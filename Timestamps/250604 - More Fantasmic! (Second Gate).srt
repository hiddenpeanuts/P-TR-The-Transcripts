00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,480
Welcome to Podcast The Ride The Second Gate, where today we discuss more iterations of

2
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,480
Fantasmic.

3
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:36,800
Will it leave you, the audience, feeling enthuseasmic, or will you find it anti-climaxmic, and will you be apathetmic?

4
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,000
We'll find out. I'm Scott Garrier.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,800
Hi, I'm Mike Carlson.

6
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,480
Orgasmic.

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,320
Or will you be orga- Oh, that one's already-

8
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,200
That's real, that's real.

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,640
Oh my god, I didn't have to change that one.

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,160
Wow.

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,360
That's what they should have called this whole show, obviously.

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,280
Well, yeah.

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,240
It would have been right there.

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,200
If they wanted to be-

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,400
Jason Sheridan, hello.

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,160
I didn't have a mic, but I sure enjoyed that opening joke.

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:57,880
Oh, thank you.

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm being sincere.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,440
I'm like, I'm worried it was going to sound sarcastic, but I really was along for the ride.

20
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,920
You were worried it was going to sound sarcasmic.

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,160
Sarcasmic, yeah.

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:15,200
There's really no end to the words that you can put the branding of our favorite mouse in.

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,520
Sarcasmic is when Minnie is like, Mickey, do you need help?

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,680
And Mickey is like, oh yeah, I don't need any help, thanks.

25
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,320
But he does need help, you're saying.

26
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,320
He does need help, yeah.

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,400
He like, the fridge fell on him when he was trying to move it or something, and she's like,

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh, I'm fine, I want to be down here.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,720
Right, right.

30
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,560
It's like a weighted blanket.

31
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,880
And Anvil fell on his foot, and he's like in such pain.

32
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,480
And Minnie's like, do you need something?

33
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,520
And he's like, no, I don't.

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,920
I just need to go to the hospital.

35
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,520
Come on.

36
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,600
I like the cartoon problem that you picked.

37
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,760
I like that cartoon characters would be moving anvils around their homes so often.

38
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,320
Did Mickey ever get hit with an anvil in Disney cartoon?

39
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,640
It doesn't feel right.

40
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,120
It feels more Warner Brothers, but certainly on the table.

41
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,760
I don't know, has Mickey been hit by an anvil?

42
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,680
He only shows up in that skydiving sequence in Roger Rabbit, right?

43
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,160
He's in it again at the end, isn't he?

44
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,520
Yeah, but I don't think he gets hurt.

45
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,920
I mean, Disney's going to allow the characters to cross-pollinate,

46
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,600
but they won't allow bugs on Mickey violence.

47
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,040
Right.

48
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,200
They were never going to stand for that.

49
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,840
Well, if anybody knows, does Mickey get hit with an anvil ever in his long career?

50
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,680
Yeah.

51
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,280
He should.

52
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,000
He doesn't take a lot of the abuse.

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,440
I mean, that's sort of Donald's role, Goofy's role in a silly way.

54
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,480
It was Goofy's role one terrible night of the Hollywood studio show, which we'll discuss.

55
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,720
But no, I think they save Mickey from...

56
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
Yeah.

57
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,000
Lonesome Ghosts, Mickey gets a little beat up, but not as bad as Goofy.

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,440
Yeah.

59
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,080
Yeah.

60
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,840
But not, yeah.

61
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,000
I don't think there's...

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,600
I can't remember.

63
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,000
Don't scuff the suit.

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,840
Oh, thank you, Goofy.

65
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,880
I don't need help.

66
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,160
I'll put the fire blanket on myself.

67
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,720
Mickey has the Vin Diesel rock claws in his contract

68
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,240
that he can't look weak in a movie.

69
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,440
It must be the same thing.

70
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,920
He's such a big star that he can't lose a fight.

71
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,640
Yeah.

72
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,480
Like Steven Seagal losing to Hanson Franz.

73
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,120
Right.

74
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:32,600
So The Rock and Jason Statham all have a no anvil clause in their contract

75
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,720
to make sure that they don't look foolish in one of the movies.

76
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,960
It's like a wrestling holdover.

77
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,160
Yes.

78
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,560
Yes.

79
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,480
Well, you mean an anvil or you mean an actual...

80
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,960
No, you can't lose.

81
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,680
It is, but our action stars also have it.

82
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,400
So it's not exclusively wrestling.

83
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,760
Well, our hero.

84
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,520
Well, yes, our hero.

85
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,280
Sylvester Stallone and John Voight and Mel Gibson are going to save Hollywood.

86
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,880
John Voight.

87
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,160
Wait, hold on.

88
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,760
John Voight.

89
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,440
I know about this.

90
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,920
Yeah, he's...

91
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,960
I know what he's talking about.

92
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,640
I'm just saying that.

93
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,800
He's in that list, yeah.

94
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,640
John Voight is in the list.

95
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,520
Oh, he's on the Trump list.

96
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,800
Trump appointed three people to fix Hollywood.

97
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:02,960
Right.

98
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,840
And one was, yes, the three stars of equal status.

99
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,400
87-year-old John Voight, who surely knows where he is at all moments of the day.

100
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,440
He knows what's hip.

101
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:12,680
Yeah.

102
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,880
And he knows his name.

103
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,160
Right.

104
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,120
This much we know.

105
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,120
Folks, today we are returning to the world of Fantasmic.

106
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,960
Realized it had been about a year since we covered this on the main feed, since we first

107
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:35,440
handled the Disneyland stalwarts live attraction, which has been running on the

108
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:42,600
Rivers of America, a show characterized by very memorable music, by a fun construct

109
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,840
to put a lot of Disney characters all in one place for Mickey to do battle with many

110
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,440
great villains in Disney history, but not get his suit scuffed up in any way.

111
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,920
No rips, no tears.

112
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,240
No need to go to a tailor.

113
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,480
You know, we had fun talking about that a year ago.

114
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,720
We said, we'll put it on pause and then we'll come back and we'll handle Disney World.

115
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,040
We will handle Tokyo Disney Sea, which is no longer running.

116
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,080
And we will handle whatever becomes of Disneyland's Fantasmic.

117
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,040
I don't know if you guys remember that this was sort of the because we put up an episode

118
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,600
right before it was about to come back because it had been gone for a year or so because

119
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,600
the dragon at the end of the show caught on fire.

120
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,200
Instead of just breathing fire, it breathed fire all over itself and burns to a crisp.

121
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,520
It's been one of the most dramatic, I think I said at the time, metal displays in Disney

122
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,520
history.

123
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:47,000
You know, you just brought up the Paris fire that Peter Noon from Herman's Hermits noticed.

124
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The World Showcase Paris.

125
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Not yet, not real Paris.

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,600
Notre Dame did not burn down again, seen only by Herman's Hermits star Peter Noon.

127
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,280
Peter Noon playing outside Notre Dame, playing all the Herman's Hermits hits and then it

128
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,280
catches fire.

129
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
No.

130
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,560
No, this was, but you know, and like this happens here and there.

131
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,480
There's little, you know, there's fires, there's accidents at theme parks, but they are not

132
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:18,600
usually caught on, clearly on camera from 5,000 angles and it was really insane when

133
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
this happened.

134
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,840
Also, yeah, the thing that like thousands of, hundreds, thousands of people are watching

135
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,640
that night, the focal point of everyone's attention catches on fire as well on its own

136
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
little stage.

137
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
Yeah.

138
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
That's more rare.

139
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,280
It wasn't the Sindbad show at Islands of Adventure and a prop that people don't even

140
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,160
know is coming caught fire backstage and then there was some smoke and people like coughed

141
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,360
a little and is that supposed to happen?

142
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
Yeah, probably.

143
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:53,340
This was at the, and didn't it cross over into the moment where the dragon, who is Maleficent,

144
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:58,760
you hear Maleficent's voice screaming in horror because like it was like five seconds off

145
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,480
from when the dragon is supposed to be defeated.

146
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:08,160
So there was certainly a minute where, okay, screaming, it is like, it's burning alive.

147
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,480
I guess Mickey won, but then Mickey won a little too hard.

148
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
Yeah.

149
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,840
He was winning for 40 horrifying seconds.

150
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,800
I don't want to just win, I want you to suffer.

151
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,720
I want you to scream, I want your relatives to be thinking about it, I want them to need

152
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
counseling.

153
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,720
I want to bankrupt your children.

154
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,400
Leave the gun, take the cannoli.

155
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
What is that?

156
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
I gotta ask for that reference.

157
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
That's the godfather.

158
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Okay.

159
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
That's the instruction to Michael.

160
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
I should know that, I guess.

161
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,400
Everybody's got cinematic blind spots, sometimes the most famous ones.

162
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Sure.

163
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:56,400
But anyways, so some of what we were heading for last year was, okay, well when this thing,

164
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:03,400
you know, we'll do a sequel episode and we will discuss whatever exciting change transpires,

165
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,120
whatever is, because we know it's coming back, but they haven't said what they're doing about

166
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,720
the finale, they haven't said what they're replacing the dragon with, and as soon as

167
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,840
we realize what that is, we will come back guns blazing with an exciting episode all

168
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,840
about it.

169
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,800
And then quickly we saw what it was.

170
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Maleficent the dragon was replaced by human Maleficent on a big pole.

171
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,800
Long, two words, baby, long Maleficent.

172
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,800
Oh, that's right, that's a much better phrasing for it.

173
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Long Maleficent.

174
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,800
You know, you're scared of her in Sleeping Beauty, but what if she was giant?

175
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,800
Oh, you mean like she got, and she has giant proportions?

176
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
No.

177
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,800
It's as if her head and torso are the same, but her legs are now 130 feet long.

178
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,800
She's like the Marvel Comics villain Stilt Man.

179
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,800
So the normal size body, just the legs are very long.

180
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
Very long.

181
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Do you know, Michael, do you in your day to day life relate to the character of Stilt Man?

182
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Yes, I think oftentimes I think of him and I feel sympathy for his plight.

183
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,800
You know, he's a bad guy, but he's just misunderstood.

184
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:17,800
Enough annoying flights and crotch crushed rides on roller coasters will turn you into a Stilt Man.

185
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
Yes, that's correct.

186
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,800
And luckily, I haven't been supervillainized yet.

187
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Maybe when I go to Epic Universe this next time during our live shows,

188
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,800
all the crushing will finally turn me into sort of a Stilt Man like supervillain.

189
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,800
You got a couple rides left. You got to see what they do to your crotch.

190
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
Right.

191
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,800
Hey, aside real quick, because I wanted to ask you, because you did do Stardust Racers.

192
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
I did, yes.

193
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:45,800
When you were there, just a chatter I saw online, was it stinky?

194
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,800
OK, I've seen the stinky question asked about the area.

195
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,800
Is it always, is that the term it's always used, stinky?

196
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,800
I've not, I don't know. I can't remember. Jason likes the word stinky.

197
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,800
I also like the word stinky. I don't know that I've seen.

198
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,800
I saw people saying there was bit of a smell and someone else pulled up a map showing a water reclamation.

199
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
It's very close to Epic Universe.

200
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,800
That used to be a weapons testing ground where Epic Universe was.

201
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Do we have any idea what weapons were tested on what is now Celestial Park and Darkmoor?

202
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
And what and what were those weapons?

203
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,800
How have those weapons been used to wreak havoc on our world?

204
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,800
Well, something they tested there brought all the monsters into one big house.

205
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,800
That's true.

206
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
And I am scared.

207
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,800
That's true. I think maybe it was more like airplane engines, but I don't know that 100 percent.

208
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,800
I don't think they were shooting nukes off like 10 minutes from Islands of Adventure.

209
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
Yeah. Yeah.

210
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
I don't think that's what was happening.

211
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,800
And it wasn't like the weapon that Bane stole.

212
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
That blew up the football.

213
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,800
Like a big fancy, like kind of modern, big orby kind of nuclear weapon. It wasn't like that.

214
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,800
That imploded that football field. No, I don't think so.

215
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,800
I think maybe at the least it was like airplane engines, I think.

216
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
Yeah.

217
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,800
But then there is a water treatment plant nearby.

218
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,800
And I heard somebody maybe on the day we were there say that it's nearby.

219
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
And I've heard people mention.

220
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,800
I heard somebody on the day say it'd be stinky in here.

221
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
Yeah, I was wondering what that was about.

222
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,800
But I don't I didn't notice stinky epic universe.

223
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Well, freshly planted plants require a lot of mulch and fertilizer.

224
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
So that could have been.

225
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
I mean, it just is what it is.

226
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,800
Maybe we were lucky and the wind was blowing the right way that day or something.

227
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
Because I've seen multiple people say, yes, it smells.

228
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,800
And then I heard people say epic universe smells worse at night.

229
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,800
Oh, my God.

230
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
So I don't know. I'm not sure.

231
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
And yes, Stardust, I think Stardust is Stardust.

232
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,800
There's a big open like pie where you can see right into a break room.

233
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,800
And there's a lot of you can see a lot that way.

234
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,800
And I think perhaps the treatment plan is that is over there.

235
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,800
Because they need to plant some trees you can't see over there.

236
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
But also maybe it would block some of the stink.

237
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,800
Yeah, so I don't know.

238
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:16,800
I didn't detect like a Gary, Indiana style smell, meaning like Gary, the town of Gary, Indiana, like stinks.

239
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,800
You drive through portions of Indiana.

240
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
It smells.

241
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,800
Do we do recall when we talked about with Ashley Crystal Hairston about the Tacoma aroma?

242
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Yes, I think I'm trying to remember what the response to that was.

243
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,800
That I feel like people said it is slander that the Tacoma aroma is gone.

244
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,800
Does that seem familiar to anyone?

245
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Vaguely.

246
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
I'm trying to remember what the sense we got of the Tacoma.

247
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
Like if it was still there.

248
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,800
Yeah, so the Gary, Indiana stinky Anna.

249
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,800
I don't know what they call it.

250
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,800
Yeah, I haven't driven through there in a while.

251
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Gary, Indiana has a scary stinky Anna.

252
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
That's a fun.

253
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Yeah, I don't know what the fun name for it is, but I guess we could maybe be the ones that coined it.

254
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,800
But yes, anyway, Jason, bring a big clothespin when you go to Epic Universe for your nose.

255
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
A big comical.

256
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
That's right.

257
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,800
Just in case we're there on a particularly smelly day.

258
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:17,800
Now, if touring plans as Len Testa could change his app and his books to let us know when the smelliest days of Epic Universe.

259
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
Yes.

260
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,800
If you could have somebody also now measuring stink level when it comes to Epic, I think that would be a good idea for him to do.

261
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
OK, yeah, from neutral to P.U.

262
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,800
Right.

263
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Like a skunk.

264
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,800
How many skunks or how many like Limburger cheeses?

265
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Like you could do a fun scale.

266
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
Or it's four skunks.

267
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:41,800
But then you get on the particular lease that it's like it is a it's a skunk with diarrhea with cheese diarrhea.

268
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Yes, you could show the skunk eating Limburger cheese and then it coming out the other way.

269
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,800
I mean, that's returned from a brief business trip to Gary, Indiana.

270
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
Right.

271
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,800
These are fun ideas for Len.

272
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
If he wants to use them, he can.

273
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,800
If not, whatever area people would need to buy that.

274
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
Right.

275
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,800
There'd be a much like you want to know wait times, but you need to know stink.

276
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
Yeah.

277
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
So we'll see when we're there in June.

278
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,800
We'll see how it is.

279
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Assess this stink.

280
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,800
Yeah.

281
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,800
And also, and please, anyone let us know any intel you have about the military history of this spot.

282
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,800
What what what ghosts remain besides the ones in Darkmoor?

283
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,800
What mutant hybrids were created there?

284
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,800
But anyways, yeah, Tom Maleficent is what we've had for for a year now.

285
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,800
I don't know if that caused the delay in us doing an episode.

286
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,800
If there was if it was like, huh, I think we can wait a beat on that.

287
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,800
I don't think anybody needs us to talk about giant legged Maleficent for a while.

288
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,800
No, I guess we I went straight to legs, but we don't know what's under there.

289
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:49,800
And she's in it's it's sort of, you know, presumably production wise, she's on some kind of hydraulic lift.

290
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:57,800
But, you know, in the storytelling, it's probably just it's like a big flowing draper gown or something.

291
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
Yeah.

292
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:05,800
So it could be that that's like all like celestial power underneath, like that she it's a bunch of like she's flying or something.

293
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Like you're saying the evil forces are getting her to fly.

294
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,800
Yeah, yeah.

295
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,800
There's like a bunch of like projection swirling star dust or something.

296
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
There's like energy.

297
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
I see what you're saying.

298
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:22,800
Maybe she's not long, but her dress got long and it's full of energy tentacles or yes, tentacles under there.

299
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
That's a good idea storyline wise.

300
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
Yeah, hard to say.

301
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Practically.

302
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:34,800
It's kind of like when your local municipality needs to trim some real tall trees that are getting too close to power lines.

303
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:41,800
So but it could be like because like in the old California Adventure show and I mean, obviously in the Aladdin movie,

304
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,800
genies have sort of a tail thing.

305
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
They don't always have legs when they're flying.

306
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
They kind of have just like that flowing.

307
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
You went to the show before you went to the movie.

308
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Well, you know, because not because I love I do love the show, but I go to the show because I bet it's a similar hydraulic lift.

309
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:03,800
When Jafar turns into the genie at the end, he shoots up in the sky and there's a whole like kind of red ribbon.

310
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Under his leg.

311
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,800
So you could also say he has tall legs as well.

312
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,800
But I bet it's a similar hydraulic lift to that Maleficent is on at the end of Fantasmic.

313
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:19,800
No, I've heard the opinion that this because this tall Maleficent has has existed as an option as the B mode.

314
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
Yeah.

315
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
In both Disneyland and Disney World.

316
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,800
So people have plenty of audiences have seen tall Maleficent and been impressed by tall Melissa.

317
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
I've seen the opinion that well, you know what?

318
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,800
If you don't know there's supposed to be a dragon there and then you get to see the tallest witch or whatever.

319
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,800
What's she?

320
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
What's Maleficent?

321
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,800
Yeah.

322
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
Good question.

323
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,800
I don't know if I can use a phrase from that was used in the prior episode.

324
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,800
An old crone is a more official job title than old crone.

325
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Is Maleficent a sorceress?

326
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
That sounds right.

327
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,800
She's like a queen or something.

328
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:03,800
No, I think if I had remembered any of the first Maleficent movie that I did see, maybe I can answer this question, but I don't remember any of it.

329
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,800
And I did watch it.

330
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
Wow.

331
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,800
The Angelina Jolie Maleficent.

332
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,800
But I think Maleficent is a sorceress.

333
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
I know that.

334
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
That's confirmed.

335
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,800
And I do know that Maleficent's father is going to save Hollywood.

336
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,800
Well, that is a very good, very good point.

337
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
She's certainly a mistress of all evil.

338
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,800
I'm seeing that as well.

339
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Does that help?

340
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
Are you looking at t-shirts now?

341
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,800
That's something.

342
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
T-shirts?

343
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
No.

344
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
Would you wear a mistress of all evil shirt?

345
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
Yeah, you would.

346
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,800
I would.

347
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Me?

348
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Yeah, maybe.

349
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
Yeah, maybe.

350
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,800
All right, maybe.

351
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
I hadn't really thought about it.

352
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
It just seemed like something they would put on.

353
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Like, new shirts are out, you know.

354
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
Yeah, his and her.

355
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,800
And the mister mistress of all evil.

356
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,800
Yeah, mister mistress of all evil.

357
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
You should get that.

358
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
You and Jane should get those.

359
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Yeah.

360
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
If they're vintage, though.

361
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,800
Well, yeah.

362
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,800
Well, the hubby and wife shirts I bought on Amazon.

363
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
Oh, those aren't vintage.

364
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,800
No, no, they're not.

365
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800
Did you get in trouble?

366
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,800
Huh?

367
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,800
Did you get in trouble?

368
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,800
Did I get in trouble?

369
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Because they're new shirts.

370
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Well, no.

371
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:12,800
No, I think I got in trouble more for their content.

372
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,800
Oh, so you didn't get in trouble.

373
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,800
What are these shirts?

374
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,800
I'm sorry, what?

375
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,800
I was buying some pre-wedding, like, fun stuff.

376
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,800
And I bought...

377
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Toys and stuff.

378
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
Yeah.

379
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
I bought...

380
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Target stuff that you taught us about.

381
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
I bought t-shirts.

382
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
The one had, like, a little Mickey.

383
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,800
And the one had a little Minnie, like, circle.

384
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,800
And it said hubby and wifey.

385
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,800
Mostly so I'd take a picture on Instagram.

386
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,800
I was really looking for bootleg ones.

387
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,800
But unfortunately, Disney kind of realized people would buy that.

388
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,800
So those were official Disney shirts.

389
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Oh, they were?

390
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,800
On Amazon.

391
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
Oh, I thought they were bootlegs, too.

392
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,800
Through the Disney storefront on Amazon.

393
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
So why did you get in trouble for the...

394
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Was it for hubby or was it for wifey?

395
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,800
She was like, I can't believe you bought these.

396
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
But what do you think...

397
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
Which word do you think was it?

398
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,800
Both of them in tandem?

399
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,800
Both of them equally, probably?

400
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,800
Yeah, I think they were both, sort of.

401
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,800
Trying.

402
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
Trying.

403
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
It sounds like the kind of thing I would be more upset about

404
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,800
because I don't like putting E at the end of an arbitrary...

405
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,800
No, it's Y. It's Y. You're okay.

406
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
No, but the sound, I think.

407
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
Yeah, yeah.

408
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,800
But it didn't say little hubby boy or anything.

409
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
No, I tried.

410
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Believe me, I searched.

411
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,800
Couldn't get my Redbubble account to work.

412
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,800
I'm a little hubby boy.

413
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,800
The handsomest little hubby boy.

414
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Could you add another word?

415
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,800
We keep adding words on to make it even worse.

416
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
Here's my conundrum is that I'm fighting to...

417
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,800
What I could do is pivot and change the topic,

418
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,800
but I'm so...

419
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,800
This is a video game battle

420
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,800
and I'm so knocked down by every time you say one of these

421
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,800
that I don't have the strength to change the topic.

422
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
I truly do.

423
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,800
I get beaten down by everyone.

424
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,800
I gotta build myself back up.

425
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,800
Jason, what was the last thing you said?

426
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,800
I said handsomest little hubby boy.

427
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,800
It could be handsomest, stinkiest little hubby boy.

428
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
Oh, stinkiest is good.

429
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Naughty is good.

430
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
Naughty, stinky little hubby boy.

431
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
That's really making it worse.

432
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Why do we want these sentiments together?

433
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,800
You want to be a boy, but you want to be a husband,

434
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,800
but you want to say the infantilized word hubby,

435
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
and you want to be stinky?

436
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,800
You want to be a stinky hubby.

437
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,800
I'm little, but I contain multitudes.

438
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Look, just the fact of the matter is

439
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,800
Jason's a naughty little stinky little hubby boy.

440
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
That's just the fact.

441
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,800
Sorry.

442
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
That's who he is.

443
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
All right.

444
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,800
Well, we can restart the boss battle.

445
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
I don't know what.

446
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,800
I think we're...

447
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
I don't go too hard on Scott.

448
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
I'm teetering.

449
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
I'm tipping.

450
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,800
One more is the knockout.

451
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Restart from checkpoint for Scott.

452
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
Oh, phew. Great.

453
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
Yes, thank you.

454
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
Load me up with a bunch of hearts.

455
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Okay.

456
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
Back to the Hollywood Hills in the theater.

457
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,800
Strength back.

458
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,800
Anyway, it's funny that this is where it landed,

459
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,800
that this is fine for them,

460
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
and that maybe we never get a dragon again.

461
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
Yeah.

462
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Dragon might be gone.

463
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
Because it feels very modern Disney company to say,

464
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
you know, you're good.

465
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
Right.

466
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
You don't need to, yeah.

467
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,800
Because we're going to pay more and get less

468
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,800
kind of world with them, and that's a lot less.

469
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
It's a lot less.

470
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,800
And also, I hate to be conspiratorial,

471
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,800
but it makes you think, doesn't it?

472
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
It makes me think,

473
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,800
did they burn down the dragon for insurance money?

474
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
I'm not saying they did.

475
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,800
I'm just saying it hasn't come back.

476
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,800
Yeah.

477
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
Is there...

478
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,800
How much was that dragon insured for?

479
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,800
I think the answer is no,

480
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:55,800
because if the replacement is a paid union performer,

481
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
then that's never Disney's...

482
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
That's a good point.

483
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
That's never what Disney would rather have.

484
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
Yeah, that's a good point.

485
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,800
But have we seen the Lloyds of London piece of paper

486
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,800
that says the Maleficent Dragon is insured for $1 billion?

487
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
That's right.

488
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,800
This famous stuff of so-and-so having their gams insured.

489
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Yeah, right.

490
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
St. Charisse.

491
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
It was St. Charisse.

492
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
St. Charisse had her...

493
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,800
That's right.

494
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,800
She was a dancer, and she had her legs...

495
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,800
Supposedly, the legs were insured for $1 million.

496
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,800
That's what Jason insured that naughty little

497
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,800
stinky hubby boy shirt of his for a million dollars too.

498
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
Yeah, it did.

499
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
In case it gets burnt or lost.

500
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
I know, and he knows it's a gold mine too,

501
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
if that gets recreated illegally.

502
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,800
Right, yeah, we want to prevent it.

503
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,800
It's the most relatable, adorable phrase.

504
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,800
What gal out there hasn't dreamed of her little...

505
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,800
Having her own little stinky hubby boy?

506
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,800
Who hasn't swooned...

507
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,800
They're all thinking it.

508
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,800
As a girl, oh, someday my little stinky hubby boy will come.

509
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,800
Will come, yeah.

510
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
That's the song.

511
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Didn't sing the right melody.

512
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
It's an off-brand melody.

513
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,800
Yeah, anyway, we'll see where it goes,

514
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,800
but I guess all this leaves Disney World

515
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,800
with the one functioning dragon.

516
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,800
Yeah.

517
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
I mean, maybe not on all nights,

518
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
because as I said, it happens there.

519
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Sometimes you do get Tom Maleficent instead.

520
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Yeah, it is a bummer.

521
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,800
I don't know.

522
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,800
It's been a year.

523
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
It feels like they could have rebuilt the dragon in a year.

524
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
I agree with what you...

525
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
When you say, like, yeah, maybe that's it.

526
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,800
Yeah.

527
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,800
Who knows?

528
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,800
Yeah, plenty of time.

529
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,800
They didn't do it,

530
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,800
and if people are still showing up, then why...

531
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,800
Maybe we said this before,

532
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,800
but in reminding myself that situation,

533
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,800
just that besides the complexity

534
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
and how big it was and the big staging area,

535
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,800
that thing had 60 microprocessors in its head,

536
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,800
like a special effects package in its brain.

537
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
Right.

538
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
Like, that thing, that was an expensive head.

539
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
Yeah.

540
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,800
I mean, when it happened,

541
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,800
people must have been partially like,

542
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,800
oh, God, this is dangerous.

543
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,800
What if it breathes that way

544
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,800
and a whole part of the audience gets singed?

545
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,800
A lot of people probably, once it happened, thought,

546
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,800
oh, okay, that's $10 million right there

547
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,800
or whatever it is.

548
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,800
Yeah, I'm sure.

549
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,800
Probably more.

550
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Yeah.

551
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
I bet it's like 50 or something crazy.

552
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
50 million just in that dream?

553
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,800
How old is it, too, at this point?

554
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
It's been around for a long time, so...

555
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
Sure.

556
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,800
Maybe it's, I guess maybe,

557
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
I was going to say it would be cheaper now

558
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
if they built it, but maybe not.

559
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
Maybe it's just such a unique piece of technology

560
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
that they made a couple of them.

561
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,800
I think the last upgrades in Anaheim

562
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
were in the late 2010s.

563
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
Yeah, so maybe that.

564
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
So recent-ish, but less recent

565
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,800
than like the Millennium Falcon processors.

566
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,800
Everything always costs more than I think it does.

567
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,800
Say you didn't know anything about theme parks

568
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,800
and you go on Rides of the Resistance,

569
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,800
does it seem like it costs half a billion dollars?

570
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Well, to people who enjoy the ride, maybe it does.

571
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
That's not if it gives you

572
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,800
a half a billion dollars of enjoyment.

573
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,800
I'm saying...

574
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
No, I'm saying if you were the kind of person

575
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,800
whose heart is open to liking this ride,

576
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
you might think this is very impressive.

577
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
I bet it costs half a billion dollars.

578
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,800
I mean, you would definitely say,

579
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
no, you would definitely say

580
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,800
because it doesn't feel like your friends are there,

581
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,800
this feels like 50K or 100K.

582
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,800
Friends are priceless.

583
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Yeah, the friends are so much more money.

584
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,800
But I feel like if you didn't know anything about this stuff

585
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,800
and you're like, oh, that's $100 million to build that,

586
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
you go, oh my God, so much money, of course,

587
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,800
versus five times that.

588
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,800
I always feel like things are more than I would think.

589
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
Maybe I'm in the minority, I don't know.

590
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,800
I think, though, this was not, I don't know.

591
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,800
There's only estimates out here,

592
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
but I think the whole show costs 30 million,

593
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,800
so I don't think that one dragon costs 30 million.

594
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
But I'm sure it was a ton.

595
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,800
That makes sense.

596
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,800
I'm just saying I'm always kind of surprised by numbers.

597
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,800
Well, it probably all goes to very boring things.

598
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Again, to bring up Lentesta,

599
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,800
they were talking about how economic troubles

600
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,800
could be tough for the parks and for expansion projects

601
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,800
because of just the cost of steel.

602
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,800
Hoarding steel, you think building a big dragon,

603
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
that's great.

604
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
Well, yeah, what it really boils down to, though,

605
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,800
is where's Disney going to get the steel?

606
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Yeah, sure.

607
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,800
It would be too bad if current things, you know.

608
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,800
But then there's also other current,

609
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,800
like Universal is going to have their brand new park open,

610
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,800
but there's a million different travel advice

611
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,800
to travel agents internationally

612
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,800
or cautioning people about going to the United States

613
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
or academic organizations going,

614
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,800
maybe don't go to a conference.

615
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,800
Don't present it.

616
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
Maybe do it over Zoom.

617
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,800
Don't go because there was already

618
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,800
some other professors detained.

619
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,800
Yeah, and that is mainly because of the Epic Universe stinkiness.

620
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,800
There is concern that it will spread rapid.

621
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,800
Sure, it's just Orlando right now,

622
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,800
but as people, that's like a pandemic.

623
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,800
People travel to Epic Universe, they bring it back with them,

624
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,800
and before you know it, the stink is in California,

625
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,800
the stink is in New York.

626
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,800
It could just be the stinky steel

627
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
that Universal's been using,

628
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,800
because they could be building the Horror Nights thing

629
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
out in Vegas with that stinky steel.

630
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,800
We don't know.

631
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
That place, yeah.

632
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,800
They could be building Taffer's Tavern with stinky steel.

633
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,800
Well, there's no doubt they are.

634
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,800
First of all, he's building that with the cheapest.

635
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,800
He's building that with whatever the weakest little pig

636
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,800
built his house out of.

637
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,800
Was it straw?

638
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,800
Straw.

639
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
Okay.

640
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
Straw that sticks the brick.

641
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,800
No, he's building ...

642
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,800
This place is made of straw, and it stinks.

643
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
Good.

644
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,800
I like it.

645
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,800
Money goes to my pocket.

646
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,800
He was in Disney World, and might still be.

647
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,800
He was in Disney World for weeks when we were there.

648
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
Wow.

649
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
He was in Orlando, I mean,

650
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,800
maybe just overseeing every little part

651
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,800
of his Taffer's Tavern construction.

652
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,800
But I swear, a couple days ago,

653
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,800
another picture of him and Nicole, his wife,

654
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,800
you know, of course, from the show,

655
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,800
in Disney World watching the fireworks.

656
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,800
They were there for so long, maybe they still are.

657
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,800
Well, they might have been searching out the costume

658
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:06,800
used in the show of his double, Governor Ratcliffe.

659
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,800
I was going to say,

660
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,800
dragon burned down for insurance money,

661
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,800
Ratcliffe, dirty Ratcliffe costume

662
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,800
dumped on the side of the road as a tax write-off.

663
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,800
Backed up and run over several times.

664
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,800
Make sure those giant lips can't ever be pursed again.

665
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,800
Well, yeah, we'll see what happens in California.

666
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,800
I guess let's move to Hollywood Studios,

667
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,800
where they got their own Fantasmic in 1998,

668
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,800
in October 1998.

669
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,800
So I think there was some discussion

670
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,800
with Fantasmic being a huge hit out of the gate

671
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,800
in Disneyland.

672
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,800
Where do we do it in Disney World?

673
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,800
Does it make sense in Magic Kingdom?

674
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,800
Just do it in Rivers of America,

675
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,800
just like we did in Disneyland.

676
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,800
I think it's a smaller Rivers of America there,

677
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,800
a little bit, or it's a lower water table

678
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,800
for various dull reasons.

679
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,800
Even what feels extremely packed in Disneyland,

680
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,800
I think you've got even less.

681
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,800
And soon there will be, of course,

682
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
no Rivers of America at all,

683
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,800
unless the price of steel shoots through the rim.

684
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,800
Maybe we'll all thank Mr. Trump

685
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,800
for saving the Rivers of America, accidentally.

686
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Well, the man in the rocking chair on his porch,

687
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,800
it's no telling how he would.

688
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
I don't know what that means.

689
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
Oh, on the Rivers of America,

690
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,800
they have the little cabin that you see

691
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,800
at the beginning of Pirates of the Caribbean.

692
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,800
In Disneyland, the riverboat goes by him

693
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,800
at some point in Florida.

694
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,800
Oh, just in Florida?

695
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
It's the same guy?

696
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
I actually didn't realize that.

697
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,800
I don't know if it's exactly the same,

698
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,800
but it looks really similar.

699
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,800
And there's not as many show seats.

700
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,800
Some beat-up merit attractions.

701
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,800
Could be like as a beat-up brother,

702
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,800
like the beat-up old man on the porch

703
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,800
in the rocking chair.

704
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,800
Pirates of Anaheim is siblings with the guy,

705
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
and we don't know.

706
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,800
That's interesting.

707
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,800
Yeah, well, as with Sunny Eclipse

708
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
and Officer Zizek's in Tokyo,

709
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,800
you consider them siblings or cousins

710
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,800
when mainly the same mold was used

711
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,800
for two characters.

712
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
Right, right.

713
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,800
Just like a lot of the pirates

714
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,800
are brothers or cousins

715
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,800
of the presidents of the United States.

716
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,800
Unfortunately, due to the hold

717
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,800
on live-action remakes,

718
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,800
the nasty rocking chair brother universe

719
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,800
is paused right now.

720
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,800
And they were going to get there,

721
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,800
I think, soon enough.

722
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
They were going to get there.

723
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,800
That's all they had left.

724
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,800
So it didn't make sense to do it.

725
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
Magic Kingdom didn't make sense to do it.

726
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
Epcot, because they've always been covered

727
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,800
with nighttime spectaculars.

728
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,800
No Animal Kingdom quite yet,

729
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
so Hollywood Studios got landed on.

730
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,800
But of course, you've got your little lake there

731
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,800
with Gertie the Dinosaur and whatever,

732
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,800
but that's not big enough to do Fantasmic.

733
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,800
So they had to figure out,

734
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,800
they had to build a massive complex

735
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,800
in order to do this,

736
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,800
the Hollywood Hills amphitheater.

737
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,800
And if you've never seen it in Hollywood Studios,

738
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,800
that is the deal.

739
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,800
In Disneyland, you have to just kind of like

740
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,800
stake out a spot around the rivers of America

741
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,800
before the very possibly standing room.

742
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,800
In Hollywood Studios, you can sit and watch Fantasmic,

743
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,800
and it is a massive amphitheater

744
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,800
built only for this.

745
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,800
I don't think, okay, I will admit,

746
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
I've never been to this in Florida.

747
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,800
I've never seen it in Florida.

748
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,800
So I don't know the venue.

749
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,800
When I saw a video of it

750
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,800
and the camera just looked left to right,

751
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,800
I was like, holy shit.

752
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,800
I knew it was big back there.

753
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,800
But I'd watched videos of the stage,

754
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,800
but I'd never seen how massive that venue is.

755
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,800
It's bigger than the Greek theater.

756
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,800
It's bigger than the Universal amphitheater was.

757
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,800
It's simply massive, entirely for Fantasmic.

758
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,800
I haven't seen it in a long time,

759
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,800
but we saw it early on when it had opened,

760
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,800
I guess in 99 or whatever.

761
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,800
And yes, my memory of it was just like,

762
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,800
whoa, this is a huge thing.

763
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
I mean, I guess I wasn't thinking.

764
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,800
I didn't know I was going to be analyzing things

765
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,800
in the future or whatever,

766
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,800
but I do remember feeling like, oh my gosh, this is huge.

767
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,800
It's a little, the scale is a little uncomfortable.

768
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,800
The numbers I saw were 69,

769
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,800
600 seats and then 3000 standing.

770
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Did you say uncomfortable?

771
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
Huh?

772
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
Did you say the numbers were uncomfortable?

773
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,800
I think he found it uncomfortable

774
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,800
because of the number 69.

775
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,800
That's what I was getting at.

776
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,800
Oh.

777
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800
Although wait a minute, who are we talking about?

778
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
Yeah, yeah.

779
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
It's just nearly 10,000 people.

780
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,800
But you say uncomfortable because of the,

781
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,800
it's almost intimidating in size.

782
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,800
It's intimidating in size.

783
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,800
It's a little nauseating to get in and out of, you know.

784
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,800
It's not even stinky there.

785
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,800
It's still nauseating.

786
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
It's not stinky there.

787
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,800
Well, depends on how hot it was in Florida that day, friend.

788
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,800
Nights can be very warm.

789
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,800
Yeah, I just, yeah, I probably saw it 98, 99.

790
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,800
And yeah, it was just, I mean,

791
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,800
it's better than just the traffic jam of standing

792
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,800
around the rivers in Disneyland,

793
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,800
where it's just like stanchions and ropes

794
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,800
and cast members with flashlights and it's kind of.

795
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
Disneyland is so much cooler

796
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,800
because the show is taking place at the Rivers of America,

797
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,800
but it is kind of a nightmare depending.

798
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,800
Yeah.

799
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,800
But a very wonderful thing

800
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,800
if you're trying to do anything else in the park.

801
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,800
That's true because it sucks all the people over there.

802
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,800
Which I don't know, I'm not at Hollywood Studios

803
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,800
enough to attest if that's true.

804
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,800
Like, does everything else clear out a little bit?

805
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,800
Yeah, I'm sure it does.

806
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,800
I would have to because they're still running this

807
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
and there's a reason they're running it

808
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
and it's because people go to it.

809
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,800
So I have to imagine there's a little bit.

810
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,800
I just love that they're adding a show

811
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,800
that they typically do two a night,

812
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,800
but maybe three, I don't know if they've already done that,

813
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,800
but that's a ton.

814
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,800
So much, yeah.

815
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,800
If you're going to get 30,000 a night all told.

816
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,800
Yeah, I mean, it is set back far enough

817
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,800
in the way that the Gibson Amphitheater was set back.

818
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,800
That used to be at Universe Hollywood.

819
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,800
You don't really know.

820
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,800
While Phantasm is going on, you just walk up to the tower.

821
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,800
Tower, no problem.

822
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,800
Who knows what the wait time is?

823
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800
You wouldn't know it's there.

824
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,800
It's not.

825
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,800
I know where it is, but you wouldn't know.

826
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,800
It's a little trail to take it to,

827
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,800
which was the case with Gibson, as I recall.

828
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,800
And there's a theater, another purpose-built theater

829
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,800
for the Beauty and the Beast show

830
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,800
that's been running for ages and ages.

831
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,800
It's for one thing, and it'd be hard to do much else there,

832
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
although I'd love to see a regular concert happen

833
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,800
in front of the...

834
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,800
It'd be like a mini Red Rocks.

835
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
Like a Copperfield dinner restaurant.

836
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,800
You could enter from the parking lot or Sunset Ball.

837
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,800
Well, there was a time where there was a sign

838
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,800
that advertised both, where coming to Hollywood Studio

839
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,800
or MGM Studios at the time,

840
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
and they had equal say on the sign.

841
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,800
One was Phantasmic coming soon.

842
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,800
The other was Copperfield's Magic Underground.

843
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,800
There was a time when this was the future of the park.

844
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,800
Wow.

845
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
Yeah, it was advertised outside of it.

846
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
What a bummer.

847
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,800
Do you think it'd still be there?

848
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,800
No.

849
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,800
Well, but Disney World is where the restaurants still...

850
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,800
T-Rex Cafe still goes.

851
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
No, that's a good point.

852
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
Some of the only remaining rainforest cafes.

853
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,800
Planet Hollywood in this bizarre form.

854
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,800
I think there is a world where only, only

855
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,800
Copperfield Magic Underground,

856
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,800
although maybe it was shut down in the last couple years

857
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,800
due to legal travails.

858
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,800
Yeah, no, you make a good point.

859
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,800
I'm still, if I had to bet...

860
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,800
It's gonna survive anywhere.

861
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,800
If I had to bet, I still would say no.

862
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,800
I think Pandemic might have done it in, but...

863
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,800
Yeah.

864
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,800
Well, that definitely put a pause on the original iteration

865
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,800
of the, like, five, six minutes

866
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,800
of the show is Pocahontas action sequences.

867
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
Yes, that is finally the hard...

868
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,800
Yeah, Pandemic caused big changes in all of the Phantasmics.

869
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,800
I think it kind of went away at Disneyland.

870
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
It went away permanently at Tokyo.

871
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,800
It caused, like, a big reset in Hollywood Studios,

872
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,800
where when it came back, it was different.

873
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,800
That is one for sure.

874
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,800
In terms of, like, how it was gonna be different

875
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,800
by putting it into this Hollywood setting,

876
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,800
they were more concerned with the theme of the park

877
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,800
at this moment in time.

878
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,800
And I think there was some discussion of,

879
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,800
is it just the same show,

880
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
and it's this fantasy show that comes from

881
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,800
a Magic Kingdom-style park,

882
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,800
or do we have to acknowledge the Hollywood theme in some way?

883
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,800
And apparently, there was a take and a pitch

884
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:44,800
of it being more about cinematic moments in Disney history,

885
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,800
which this sounds okay, because I think what was talked about

886
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,800
was a full-sized Nautilus battling a giant squid.

887
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,800
That would have been a part of this.

888
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,800
That does sound pretty good.

889
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,800
I don't have...

890
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,800
I've never seen that entire film, 20,000 Leagues,

891
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,800
but every time, there's something,

892
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,800
like, everything in Tokyo relating to that,

893
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,800
and a great walkthrough in Paris.

894
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,800
Like, this is a thing they've knocked out of the park before.

895
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,800
Nothing gets Tony Baxter more excited than a Nautilus.

896
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,800
He loves the Nautilus so much.

897
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,800
So I feel like that always gets extra care.

898
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,800
Anything Nautilus, Jules Verne-related,

899
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,800
is just, like, really great and still remains really great.

900
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,800
It must have been in the sweet spot

901
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,800
of what people grew up with,

902
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,800
and I think that must have been, like, a jaws of its era,

903
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,800
like, a really next-level or a Star Wars maybe,

904
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,800
in that, like, it's really immersive production design

905
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,800
and, you know, like, transports you more than a, you know,

906
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,800
like, a caper comedy or something up there.

907
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
Sure.

908
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,800
Kirk Douglas does some little sea shanties.

909
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,800
It was probably mainly the sea shanties.

910
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,800
It was probably mainly.

911
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,800
I don't think James Mason got involved in the sea shanties.

912
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,800
Too bad, though.

913
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,800
Yeah, it's a shame.

914
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,800
One can dream.

915
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,800
But that, yeah, that didn't come together.

916
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,800
I think that was probably too, like, giant scale even for this,

917
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,800
because this did end up extremely massive in scale.

918
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,800
If you've never seen it in Florida,

919
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,800
where, you know, they were kind of inventing from the ground up

920
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,800
in terms of America already,

921
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,800
you've got, like, a gigantic rock wall,

922
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,800
a mountain, essentially,

923
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,800
that is the backdrop and then still a big body of water

924
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,800
out in front of it.

925
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,800
But something I didn't know, and forgive me,

926
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,800
was this a TPM vids or where had the history on this?

927
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,800
You guys ever heard...

928
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,800
Yesterworld, Yesterworld is the answer.

929
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,800
You guys ever heard this history that,

930
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,800
and this is a clue, like,

931
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,800
that's how we know that this was in the works,

932
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,800
is that there was a soundtrack released for Fantasmic in Florida,

933
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,800
and it had a track that indicates something

934
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,800
that was supposed to happen in the show,

935
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,800
and it was pulled last minute,

936
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,800
and that track was called Mickey Walks on Water.

937
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,800
I guess in this time, when doing Battle with the Dragon,

938
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:19,800
Mickey would have Christ-like performed a literal miracle.

939
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,800
Mickey would have finally ascended

940
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,800
to what we all know he's capable of,

941
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,800
which is being a cartoon Christ.

942
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,800
Wow. I actually missed this.

943
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,800
Yeah, I had never heard this before.

944
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
This is a pretty amazing piece of intel,

945
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,800
and I think the only clue is not the soundtrack.

946
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,800
There's also the people had...

947
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,800
It's either construction photos of when they were building it

948
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:50,800
or it's footage from when the lake has been drained

949
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,800
in more recent years,

950
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,800
but there is, like, a big plate or something

951
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,800
that is, like, right on the surface of the water

952
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,800
that was meant for that illusion.

953
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,800
Oh, boy.

954
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,800
Yeah, Mickey was going to walk on water,

955
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,800
and then I believe that Eisner himself

956
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,800
requested that this be removed

957
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,800
because he thought, I don't want people to think

958
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,800
that we are saying that Mickey is Christ.

959
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,800
Which I say, lean into it.

960
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,800
It's amazing.

961
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,800
He should have died at the beginning of Fantasmic

962
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:31,800
and 30 minutes later, risen anew.

963
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,800
That's a rare...

964
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,800
You know I hate to say this, a rare L for Eisner.

965
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,800
Yeah, I know.

966
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,800
It hurts me to say that.

967
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,800
This is in a time where it starts to...

968
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,800
He was getting a little more hit or miss by the late 90s,

969
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,800
and that's a big miss.

970
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,800
I know.

971
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,800
Big miss, and it should have been...

972
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,800
He should have suggested, I want him to walk on water,

973
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,800
but I want it to be when the water is all on fire.

974
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,800
He should have had him walk through the water.

975
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,800
Walk on water and walk on fire.

976
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,800
Walk on fire and water at the same time, yeah.

977
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,800
Flame retardant suit.

978
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,800
Yeah, hopefully.

979
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,800
I'd also like him to turn stone to bread.

980
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,800
Do we have technology for that?

981
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,800
Can we hand...

982
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,800
How many people in the venue?

983
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,800
6,900.

984
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
Can we hand each of them a stone?

985
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,800
And when they look down, it has become bread.

986
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:18,800
How many fish do we have to get per show to feed the audience?

987
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,800
They saw those numbers too.

988
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,800
The numbers didn't crunch.

989
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,800
That didn't make sense, sadly.

990
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,800
Tarzana made a little more money.

991
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,800
Mickey walking that now...

992
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,800
But the show becomes very different.

993
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,800
It's about him being forced to march all the way up to the top of the mountain,

994
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:43,800
being whipped and spit on by Jafar and Ursula along the way.

995
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,800
At one point, Minnie wipes his face with a towel,

996
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,800
and the image of his face is left in it.

997
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,800
Kind of a full passion play.

998
00:41:53,800 --> 00:42:00,800
He's betrayed by a goofy for 30 cartoon coins.

999
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,800
You know how they could have sold it to Eisner?

1000
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,800
They would pass around a collection plate during the show.

1001
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,800
You get a lot more money that way.

1002
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,800
It would be like paying for itself, essentially, after a couple of times.

1003
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,800
People won't even think about where it's going.

1004
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,800
That's just what happens.

1005
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,800
People are used to hearing this story, and then a basket goes around.

1006
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,800
Before you know it, you got quarters, you got dollars, you got hundreds, quite frankly.

1007
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,800
Look at all this money from this basket.

1008
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,800
All right, collection plates going and everything.

1009
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,800
Splash plates on Splash Mountain.

1010
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,800
Star Tours.

1011
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,800
Rex passes a basket around.

1012
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,800
We're going to mail them to people at home.

1013
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,800
Listen, the Walt Disney Company is your new god.

1014
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:46,800
I'll be taking questions for Joe, our old layers now.

1015
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,800
There's enough land that we're building a place of higher learning

1016
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,800
and a place for sports to be played.

1017
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,800
It's been a place of worship.

1018
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,800
A place of worship of us.

1019
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,800
A town needs a place of worship.

1020
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,800
They were getting close.

1021
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:09,800
I think if the Disney decade had worked out by 2000, you have the first church of Mickey.

1022
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,800
Mickey Church, yeah.

1023
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:17,800
Well, maybe they would have started with more of a humble chapel just to get the ball rolling.

1024
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:24,800
That would be so popular that they would say, all right, now we need a new purpose-built amphitheater.

1025
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,800
Mickey's person of the theater.

1026
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,800
Starbucks and the Lobby, they eventually got that deal going.

1027
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,800
Is there a church being built in Cateno?

1028
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,800
How does that work in the Disney?

1029
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,800
In a private...

1030
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,800
Yeah.

1031
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,800
I should ask my parents, my parents who have now been to Cateno.

1032
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,800
Right.

1033
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,800
Now, I think people...

1034
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:50,800
I posted a tweet that was a screenshot of an interaction I had with my dad.

1035
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:57,800
They were taking a trip down there and he sent a picture of Cateno, mid to half-built,

1036
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:02,800
some random kind of blank spot of it, and said, we're moving to Cateno.

1037
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,800
I knew that was a joke, but I don't think all of the audience knew it was a joke.

1038
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,800
If you saw that, my family is not officially moving to Cateno yet.

1039
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,800
I wouldn't put it past them because they toured model homes.

1040
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,800
I guess I got to get my mom and dad on the show, Cateno with Ken and Kathy.

1041
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,800
Right.

1042
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,800
Because they've seen the model homes now.

1043
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,800
They've seen...

1044
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,800
There was something that my mom really liked.

1045
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,800
She said, I think it's really neat that the whole idea is story living.

1046
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,800
She did?

1047
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,800
Wow.

1048
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,800
Really?

1049
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,800
She completely took the bait on that.

1050
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,800
Really liked story living and then said, and you know what I like is that the restaurant

1051
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,800
in town is called The Plot Twist.

1052
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,800
Oh.

1053
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,800
My mom likes clever.

1054
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,800
She's a teacher.

1055
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,800
She likes clever.

1056
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,800
You were so clever growing up, and I like clever.

1057
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,800
Right.

1058
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,800
Isn't that clever?

1059
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,800
It's a plot twist.

1060
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,800
Wow.

1061
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,800
But that similar sort of sales pitch sold my parents on the vacation club.

1062
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,800
Uh-huh.

1063
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,800
Like touring the samba rooms and buildings and stuff in the mid-dime.

1064
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,800
That'll do it.

1065
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,800
I guess I got to get the full report.

1066
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:09,800
It was impossible to explain to them the level that Cateno comes up on the show because my

1067
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,800
dad said, well, you should do an episode about it.

1068
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,800
I'm like, well, it's a runner.

1069
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,800
We talk about it a lot.

1070
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,800
It's like, oh, so people are excited about it?

1071
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,800
No.

1072
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,800
No.

1073
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,800
I would say it is a runner that people aren't.

1074
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,800
And then he's like, but I went down.

1075
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,800
It's really nice.

1076
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,800
Yeah.

1077
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,800
Okay.

1078
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,800
Well, I don't know.

1079
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,800
Hmm.

1080
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,800
There's a lot of texture here.

1081
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,800
I don't know where to begin.

1082
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,800
Yeah.

1083
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,800
It's really expensive.

1084
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,800
Well, it sounds like it's not out of the realm of possibility.

1085
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,800
It seems like they liked it.

1086
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,800
I think they did.

1087
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,800
Yeah.

1088
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,800
It was pretty positive report.

1089
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,800
And again, it's like a couple buildings there right now.

1090
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,800
Right.

1091
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,800
I think it's like a dry lake.

1092
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,800
I don't know.

1093
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,800
And they like it this much already.

1094
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,800
Yeah.

1095
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,800
Maybe.

1096
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,800
I think I will have to issue a correction in a couple years.

1097
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,800
The characters are moving to Katino.

1098
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,800
And that means me and the gang too.

1099
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,800
I was going to say, yeah.

1100
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,800
For all.

1101
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,800
If you go.

1102
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,800
That's my family forcing me to join.

1103
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,800
If we all split them, it's a little much for us.

1104
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,800
Yeah.

1105
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,800
But if we split it between, you know.

1106
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,800
Yeah.

1107
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,800
It was meant for two, for retirees.

1108
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,800
But we can fit a family of seven and eight here.

1109
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,800
I'm moving to the Salton Sea.

1110
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:17,800
I'm buying the dip of that ecological disaster.

1111
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,800
It must be a little bit of meat on those old fish bones.

1112
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,800
Dry out.

1113
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,800
35 years ago.

1114
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,800
It supposedly has a very unique stink as well.

1115
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,800
Speaking of that.

1116
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,800
We're covering all the stinkiest places today.

1117
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,800
Yep.

1118
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,800
Yep.

1119
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,800
So anyways, we didn't get Nautilus.

1120
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,800
And we didn't get, we didn't get Mickey Christ.

1121
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,800
Damn.

1122
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,800
And it's too bad.

1123
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,800
Yeah.

1124
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,800
And I've been pitching that as a cartoon for years too.

1125
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,800
Like we love to, we buy the old stories.

1126
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,800
We just know why we do Cinderella.

1127
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,800
Why don't we do Jesus?

1128
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,800
And it's me.

1129
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,800
It's the part I was born to play.

1130
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,800
Look, you see these four wall movies.

1131
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,800
They sell out theaters from the church groups.

1132
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,800
You see sound of freedom.

1133
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,800
Okay.

1134
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,800
We're leaving money on the table.

1135
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:07,800
Why is nobody pitching that I bust up a pedophile trafficking ring?

1136
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,800
This is what today's action heroes do.

1137
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,800
They're saying I'm in charge of what?

1138
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,800
I bust through a door.

1139
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,800
We can make, we'll keep it fun.

1140
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,800
We'll make it ducks.

1141
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,800
I bust through a door.

1142
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,800
There's 50 ducks in there.

1143
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,800
I say, you're coming with me.

1144
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,800
And then I shoot a grenade launcher right in the face of the biggest creep.

1145
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,800
My sidekick is Percy Jackson and that points people to Disney Plus.

1146
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,800
It's, you know, it's a no brainer.

1147
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,800
Youthful sidekick.

1148
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,800
So, you know, they had to settle.

1149
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,800
We all had to settle for just plain old stuff.

1150
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,800
The stuff that we know already.

1151
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,800
It's projections.

1152
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,800
It's moments from our fair movies.

1153
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,800
It's I think I forget if I said the phrase in the last episode, but I should have said it barges of love.

1154
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:03,800
We have the barges of love section where the adult contemporary versions of Beauty and the Beast and Whole New World play beautiful slow dances.

1155
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:09,800
So, you know, the show, the Hollywood Studios, Fantasmic doesn't reinvent the wheel, but maybe you don't want it to.

1156
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,800
There's a lot of classic things that you want.

1157
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,800
It's the song that you want.

1158
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:23,800
You know, it's Mickey shooting fireworks straight out of his arms, which seems to me like Christ could do.

1159
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,800
And that shit is hardcore.

1160
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,800
There's museums in California.

1161
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,800
They have the exploded spark gloves and it's wild.

1162
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,800
That is true.

1163
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,800
That's a real fact.

1164
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,800
That like have blown up.

1165
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,800
Where that they've just been used to death.

1166
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,800
They're all singed.

1167
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,800
Is that right?

1168
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,800
Really?

1169
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,800
Wow.

1170
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,800
Yeah.

1171
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,800
I think a museum in Orange County, one of the annual Disney anniversary exhibits.

1172
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,800
Yeah.

1173
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,800
There's always stuff like that, which is cool.

1174
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,800
Will you shoot at Orlando's live shows, will you shoot sparks out of your gloves?

1175
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,800
Indoors?

1176
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,800
Yes.

1177
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,800
That low ceiling?

1178
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,800
Yeah.

1179
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,800
Straight at the audience.

1180
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,800
Yeah, of course.

1181
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:04,800
Okay.

1182
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:05,800
Or Vincent Various when he appears.

1183
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,800
I'm not saying any of us necessarily are him.

1184
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,800
Shoot him with sparks.

1185
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,800
Yeah.

1186
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,800
But yeah.

1187
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,800
Well, there'll be sparks will fly whether they are literal or figurative.

1188
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,800
Yeah.

1189
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,800
There's a long history of shooting pyro in small bars and clubs.

1190
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,800
Yeah.

1191
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,800
It's a long proud history and we'll join it.

1192
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,800
Yes, we promise.

1193
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:30,800
Do any of Taffer's Tavern drinks have a little sparkler on it when you order it?

1194
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,800
They will for the first nine days and then that will be retired forever.

1195
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,800
Because you think there was a chance we could get one of those sparklers and run out to

1196
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,800
the venue Tin Roof, which is a couple blocks away from Taffer's Tavern.

1197
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,800
I mean, yeah.

1198
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,800
I can't think of a better way to get fireworks.

1199
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,800
Yeah.

1200
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,800
In Orlando?

1201
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:46,800
In Orlando.

1202
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,800
I'm assuming the fireworks laws in Florida are, yeah, whatever man, go nice.

1203
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,800
I think that's probably right.

1204
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,800
If you blow yourself up, that's on you.

1205
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,800
Yep.

1206
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:03,800
But let's talk about things that are different in the Florida iteration of Fantasmic besides

1207
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,800
just the seating situation.

1208
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,800
Because for a while, it is remarkably similar.

1209
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,800
And you're like, okay, well, they pretty much brought everything over that we enjoyed about

1210
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,800
the previous.

1211
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:20,800
But then there is a part where screen projections, missed projections stop, everything goes dark.

1212
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,800
And there's a very dramatic just like junk and a whole scene has been presented and is

1213
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:32,800
already in play on the stage, a scene teeming with dozens of performers, some of whom are

1214
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,800
quickly performing stunts.

1215
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:40,800
And what world, what magical Disney realm have we entered with so many great fairy tales

1216
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,800
to choose from?

1217
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,800
Where have they taken us in the year 2020?

1218
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,800
Why, they have brought us to the world of Jamestown.

1219
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:56,800
And of course, all of our favorite characters from Pocahontas, full Pocahontas thing, still

1220
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,800
going, what, 25 years after the release of the film?

1221
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,800
Something like that.

1222
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,800
Well, 95 was Pocahontas, right?

1223
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,800
Yeah.

1224
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,800
So 30 years later?

1225
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,800
Yeah.

1226
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,800
Oh, 2020 is yeah.

1227
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,800
25.

1228
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,800
Yeah, yeah, that's 25 years.

1229
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,800
Yeah, the movie comes out in 95, Fantasmic opens in 98.

1230
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:18,800
So that's like a choice to go like, all right, a big chunk of this show is going to be Pocahontas.

1231
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,800
We have polled, we've asked around and we sense that there is still as much enthusiasm

1232
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,800
about this here in 1998.

1233
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,800
And we promise there will be just as much 20 years in the future.

1234
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,800
Yeah.

1235
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:35,800
Oh, and people mostly like the English colonizers pillaging the land.

1236
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,800
So let's get a lot of that in there.

1237
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,800
Well, let's be fair.

1238
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,800
It's not as if they, they aren't, this isn't some weird version where they're presented

1239
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,800
as the heroes.

1240
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,800
Well, I guess John Smith.

1241
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,800
John Smith is a hero.

1242
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,800
Only, yeah, let's be fair to the movie, Fantasmic.

1243
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,800
Only one of them is an awesome swashbuckling hero.

1244
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,800
Right.

1245
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,800
But one of them is a horrible villain.

1246
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,800
And that is, that is Radcliffe who resembles, I believe resembles John Taffer if you take

1247
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,800
his colonial stuff off.

1248
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,800
I think it's funny.

1249
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:09,800
Taffer definitely could come in and plus up the American colonies for sure.

1250
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,800
If he got right off the boat.

1251
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,800
I don't want to go into the bit.

1252
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,800
I'm just saying.

1253
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,800
Get all this out of here.

1254
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,800
All of it.

1255
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,800
I mean all of it.

1256
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,800
I need more lights.

1257
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,800
Lighting everything from underneath.

1258
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,800
That'll make this place sing.

1259
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,800
This might take a, what does he call America?

1260
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,800
John Taffer is going to rebrand, in this or any era.

1261
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,800
Yeah, yeah, in the original.

1262
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,800
Yeah.

1263
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,800
So just like, like we're calling it sports world.

1264
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,800
What's the number one?

1265
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,800
What's the most popular thing in this country?

1266
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,800
Sports.

1267
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:46,800
How are we going to tell people?

1268
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,800
We're called, America has been rebranded.

1269
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,800
All right.

1270
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,800
Everyone in America turn around.

1271
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,800
Count to three.

1272
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,800
Three, two, one.

1273
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,800
Whoa.

1274
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:56,800
That's right.

1275
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,800
It's now the touchdown.

1276
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,800
His home run coast.

1277
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,800
You can see all this water from here.

1278
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,800
Home run coast.

1279
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,800
Home run coast is almost bet too good.

1280
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,800
Yeah.

1281
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:08,800
But it's close.

1282
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,800
I really like it though.

1283
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,800
Yeah.

1284
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,800
That's one of the areas.

1285
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,800
Like we have several nooks in this country.

1286
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,800
Gun Plaza.

1287
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:24,800
Every colony now has a gun plaza.

1288
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,800
Yelling and everybody throwing tea in the harbor.

1289
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:31,800
That tea is expensive.

1290
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,800
You're wasting tea.

1291
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,800
And for what?

1292
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,800
To make a point?

1293
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,800
A political point?

1294
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,800
We don't want this place to be political.

1295
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,800
It's going to drive people away.

1296
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,800
I had Tea Tender come in and weigh all of your tea supplies.

1297
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:52,800
And it shows how much tea you've gone.

1298
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,800
We're measuring the tea in the harbor.

1299
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,800
You're a lifetime subscription to Tea Tender.

1300
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,800
It's over $2,000 worth of tea gone.

1301
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,800
What are they calling it?

1302
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,800
The Boston Tea Party?

1303
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,800
This is a party to you?

1304
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,800
You think this is fun?

1305
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,800
Wasting money is not my idea of fun.

1306
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,800
And it shouldn't be yours.

1307
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,800
Shut it down.

1308
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,800
We shut the harbor down.

1309
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,800
Why do you keep laughing?

1310
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,800
You laugh every time I say it.

1311
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,800
That was what I saw.

1312
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,800
I saw a music venue yesterday.

1313
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,800
I saw an episode.

1314
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,800
And the guy has a nervous t-

1315
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,800
Like the owner has like a pork pie hat.

1316
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,800
He goes, haha.

1317
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,800
Like after every time someone says something,

1318
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,800
I'm like, you are a terrible owner.

1319
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,800
And he's like, haha.

1320
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:37,800
I relate to this.

1321
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,800
I've been a nervous laugher my whole life.

1322
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:40,800
I relate to half of this guy.

1323
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,800
The nervous laugher, yes.

1324
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,800
The pork pie hat, no.

1325
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,800
I've never been a pork pie hat guy.

1326
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,800
You're not a little pork pie hat boy.

1327
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,800
There's still time.

1328
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:48,800
Not yet a little pork pie hat.

1329
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,800
A little stinky pork pie hat.

1330
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,800
Naughty little pork pie hat.

1331
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,800
There we go.

1332
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:54,800
We're looking for more words.

1333
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,800
That's going to do it.

1334
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,800
I'm teetering.

1335
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,800
All right.

1336
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,800
Hearts, hearts, hearts.

1337
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,800
Energy, energy.

1338
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:05,800
So I do think it's funny that Radcliffe is portrayed

1339
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,800
by a big, like he has a big plastic face.

1340
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,800
He's a mascot.

1341
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,800
Yeah, yeah.

1342
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,800
And then everyone else in the scene

1343
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,800
is just a face character.

1344
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,800
Yeah.

1345
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,800
Everybody else is a regular human.

1346
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:15,800
Except for him.

1347
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,800
I mentioned that, Jayden and I were watching this.

1348
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,800
I mentioned, she's like, well, you got to think like Jafar,

1349
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:25,800
they kind of have expressive cartoony faces.

1350
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:26,800
Sure.

1351
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,800
So having to see it from a distance,

1352
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,800
they probably didn't want to have just an actor do it.

1353
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:37,800
But it's very funny, the Jamestown miners, sailors,

1354
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,800
there was one point where I had to rewind it

1355
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,800
because it just looked like a guy in a camp shirt

1356
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,800
or Hawaiian shirt and jean shorts

1357
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,800
handed Radcliffe something.

1358
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,800
And she's like, oh, no, that's not a crew guy.

1359
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,800
Oh.

1360
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:54,800
Huh.

1361
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,800
It was just kind of clothes at some point.

1362
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,800
They were just kind of wearing warmer weather-like clothes.

1363
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,800
Yeah, gotcha.

1364
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:06,800
Except for Radcliffe, who's wearing like 80 pounds of plastic.

1365
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,800
Yes.

1366
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1367
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:09,800
Constricted vision, all of those heads

1368
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,800
have got to be tough and fantastic, wherever you are,

1369
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,800
whether you're in the boat, whatever it is.

1370
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:20,800
The one thing that you really, I'm like,

1371
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,800
watching this, I never watched the full Pocahontas sequence.

1372
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,800
But as canoes start going by,

1373
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:32,800
you have to do some math of the sheer volume in 25 years,

1374
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,800
no, wait, it was open in 98, that's for the movie,

1375
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,800
so a little over 20 years,

1376
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:41,800
the sheer volume of whites playing Native Americans

1377
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,800
every single night in this production.

1378
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,800
Oh, yeah.

1379
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,800
Putting on wigs in order to, I assume,

1380
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,800
I assume that it was kind of like, who's around?

1381
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:52,800
You get in there, put it on.

1382
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,800
Yeah, 1998 rules apply.

1383
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,800
Far away rules apply.

1384
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,800
Yeah, yeah, so in two performances a night

1385
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:04,800
for 22 years, this might be the most,

1386
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,800
the highest degree of problematic.

1387
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:08,800
More than old Hollywood in general?

1388
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,800
In any lake, I'll at least go with lakes.

1389
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,800
I think that makes this the most problematic lake honor.

1390
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,800
Oh, yeah, I never thought about lakes.

1391
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,800
It's like high schools in the Midwest

1392
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,800
doing like white Hamilton, like all white.

1393
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,800
What you have just flashed me to

1394
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,800
is my Catholic high school's

1395
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,800
very unfortunate production of Flower Drum Song.

1396
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,800
Yeah.

1397
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,800
I would like to say no more about this production.

1398
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,800
No more, goodness.

1399
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,800
I think there's been many productions,

1400
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,800
I think the regular,

1401
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:45,800
I think the feature film Flower Drum Song has its problems.

1402
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:46,800
Yeah.

1403
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:47,800
I'm gonna take a wild swing.

1404
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,800
Same thing with Miss Saigon,

1405
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,800
same thing even with like half of Weston's story.

1406
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,800
Oh, no.

1407
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,800
That's true.

1408
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,800
Oh, no.

1409
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:57,800
Our poor high schoolers,

1410
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,800
they were just following orders.

1411
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:03,800
They just wanted to shine on stage.

1412
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,800
That's the phrase you need to use.

1413
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1414
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,800
That absolves everyone of everything.

1415
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,800
But jumping ahead to the newer version,

1416
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,800
there is a little Pocahontas,

1417
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,800
and Pocahontas singing

1418
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:20,800
Just Around the Riverbank?

1419
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,800
Just Around the Riverbank.

1420
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,800
Oh, yeah, okay.

1421
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,800
Which doesn't happen in this.

1422
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,800
There's a lot of quick hits in the new one.

1423
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:25,800
This is just like the full war.

1424
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,800
This is just like, right, it's the,

1425
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,800
again, this is about Mickey's imagination

1426
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,800
and what can he imagine.

1427
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,800
No, he can imagine anything.

1428
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,800
In fact, it gets out of control from how much he imagined.

1429
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,800
What are you gonna imagine tonight, Mickey?

1430
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,800
I've just been thinking about the colonization of Jamestown.

1431
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:44,800
You know, it's just some unfortunate politics at play

1432
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,800
if you think about what this nation was built on.

1433
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,800
We all gotta reflect on that sometimes.

1434
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,800
I think we should reflect on it

1435
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,800
for at least 10 minutes of my imagination.

1436
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,800
That could be a stunt or two,

1437
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,800
but I want you to reflect.

1438
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,800
I think we should do a while on that town,

1439
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,800
Croatoa, that just disappeared in the colonies overnight.

1440
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,800
Pretty weird.

1441
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,800
Think about it.

1442
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,800
Walter Knob was really on the right track

1443
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,800
with a lot of his teachable things

1444
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,800
and his learning center.

1445
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,800
This thing we didn't do.

1446
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,800
I'm choking, sorry.

1447
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,800
I'm just eating while I'm talking here.

1448
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,800
That's a big meal.

1449
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,800
I do meals and meetings at the same time.

1450
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,800
I have to do it, sorry.

1451
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,800
Mickey, put the club sandwich down.

1452
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,800
There's a pool ball.

1453
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,800
You can't have both.

1454
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,800
I just think what you gotta do is you gotta teach your kids

1455
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,800
what they're different.

1456
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,800
You gotta teach them about the laws.

1457
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,800
You're foaming at the...

1458
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:37,800
You gotta teach them.

1459
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:38,800
You gotta teach the kids.

1460
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,800
Do I have to choke you?

1461
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,800
You have to choke me out.

1462
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,800
Not unchoke you.

1463
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:44,800
Oh, sorry.

1464
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,800
I got confused.

1465
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,800
There's a lady coming to choke me later today.

1466
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,800
That's a different thing.

1467
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:51,800
Okay, that's a different...

1468
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,800
You don't want the food for that.

1469
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,800
Well, gosh, Mickey, if you keep going like this,

1470
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,800
you're gonna burn out.

1471
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,800
Yeah, I know I am.

1472
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,800
But that's why Miss Stern comes over later

1473
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,800
to calm me down.

1474
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,800
I already hit the Jesus age of 34 now.

1475
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,800
I didn't think I'd live to see this.

1476
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:12,800
I'll tell you.

1477
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,800
Everything else is just gravy.

1478
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,800
I asked the question to the listeners,

1479
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,800
or I actually asked it to you,

1480
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,800
what it was called when you pay a woman

1481
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,800
to step on your balls with a high-heeled shoe.

1482
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,800
And many people on Patreon told us

1483
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,800
it's called cock and ball torture.

1484
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:28,800
Cock and ball torture.

1485
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,800
So I'm talking about I get a lady come over,

1486
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,800
do cock and ball torture on me later,

1487
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:36,800
calms me down, got a high-stress job, you understand.

1488
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,800
Sorry to be so vulgar, but it is what it is.

1489
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,800
I think Jesus died at 32 or 33,

1490
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:42,800
so I'm actually winning,

1491
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,800
and that's why I should walk on water.

1492
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:45,800
Yeah, I'm winning.

1493
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:46,800
I'm for sure winning.

1494
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:47,800
I say winning.

1495
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:48,800
Remember that.

1496
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,800
He was right.

1497
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,800
Jesus did not live to get to do

1498
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:55,800
a lot of cock and ball torture.

1499
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,800
It's not in the Bible, but, you know,

1500
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,800
I'm adding to it.

1501
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,800
I'm making...

1502
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:01,800
I'm sort of taking the legend

1503
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:02,800
and running with it.

1504
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:03,800
That's the whole thing.

1505
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,800
I'm choked again.

1506
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:06,800
I'm doing it.

1507
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:07,800
Sorry.

1508
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,800
Big piece of bacon, you know.

1509
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,800
Sometimes you get that stuck in your throat.

1510
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:12,800
This is bacon from the store.

1511
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,800
You didn't kill the three little pigs.

1512
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:15,800
No, I killed the three little pigs.

1513
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:16,800
You did kill the...

1514
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:17,800
Oh, God.

1515
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:18,800
Sorry, I'm losing it again.

1516
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,800
Yeah, I killed them for sport.

1517
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,800
The sandwiches from the commissar.

1518
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,800
It's the only goddamn edible thing in that trash can.

1519
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:26,800
You killed them and you didn't...

1520
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:27,800
You weren't even...

1521
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,800
Like, you didn't even use every part of the book.

1522
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,800
I used it for sport.

1523
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,800
It doesn't count as using it, sport.

1524
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,800
That's fun, essentially.

1525
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,800
Oh, it was a warning.

1526
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,800
So, you get some stunts in here.

1527
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,800
John Smith swings on a rope.

1528
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:50,800
Yeah.

1529
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,800
There were, I think, a lot...

1530
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,800
I think a common phantasmag mishap

1531
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,800
is John Smith missing on the rope.

1532
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,800
Oh, man.

1533
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:58,800
That would happen from time to time.

1534
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,800
I don't think he totally waked out or anything.

1535
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,800
Yeah, it's not so weird.

1536
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,800
This is the TPM vids.

1537
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,800
TPM vids condensed a lot of the different fails

1538
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,800
that have occurred over the years,

1539
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,800
one of which being that he used to swing very wide

1540
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,800
onto a little set of steps,

1541
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:16,800
and pretty easy to miss, and he would,

1542
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,800
but then he'd just kind of have to hang

1543
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,800
and wait for the lights to black out,

1544
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,800
and then he'd just sneak away

1545
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,800
and pretend like it didn't happen.

1546
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:29,800
There's so many people, there's canoes,

1547
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,800
there's canoes with flames,

1548
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:32,800
there's people who have, you know,

1549
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,800
there's stunt performers,

1550
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:35,800
and it all just made me go like,

1551
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,800
okay, there's another thing.

1552
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,800
In 22 years, how much money was spent

1553
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:43,800
by the Disney company on performances of,

1554
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,800
on this little Pocahontas play

1555
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,800
that would occur on just the Pocahontas segment?

1556
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,800
Like, how much, what's the line item

1557
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:58,800
right pre-pandemic for just what does Pocahontas cost?

1558
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,800
Right.

1559
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,800
How many performers in there?

1560
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:01,800
Did you figure out a number?

1561
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,800
They're all running around,

1562
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:04,800
I couldn't count them.

1563
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:05,800
What do we think?

1564
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:06,800
20?

1565
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:07,800
At least 20.

1566
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:08,800
Yeah, 20-ish or so.

1567
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,800
Then canoes get in the mix.

1568
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:11,800
At least 30.

1569
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:12,800
30.

1570
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,800
Disney is mounting an expensive Pocahontas

1571
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:18,800
each and every night until COVID-19 shuts off.

1572
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,800
Well, stuff all costs more than I think,

1573
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:26,800
so I'm gonna estimate roughly it costs per night

1574
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,800
to do the Pocahontas scene, it costs $200 million.

1575
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,800
Just $200 million every single night.

1576
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,800
A blockbuster movie every night.

1577
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:34,800
Oh my God.

1578
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,800
I bet it's at least, what do you think,

1579
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,800
$25,000 for the Pocahontas scene?

1580
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,800
It could be, yeah, I think so.

1581
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,800
Yeah.

1582
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:42,800
Yeah, nightly, yeah.

1583
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:43,800
Maybe.

1584
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:44,800
Because how many of those actors

1585
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,800
can pull double duty at the end?

1586
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:47,800
Oh, that's true.

1587
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:53,800
Changing and then running to a quote unquote boat.

1588
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,800
But can, is that enough time?

1589
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:56,800
I don't know if it's safe.

1590
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,800
Yeah, yeah, and then like,

1591
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,800
and we're talking about elaborate costumes.

1592
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,800
Can you put on a baloo right after that?

1593
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:03,800
Right, right.

1594
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,800
Can you tear off a problematic wig

1595
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,800
and then get into a bear suit?

1596
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,800
How fast can you do that?

1597
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:09,800
Right.

1598
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:10,800
I don't know.

1599
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:11,800
Good question.

1600
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:12,800
It just was, it's so funny

1601
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:13,800
that this was going for so long,

1602
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:14,800
and it kind of takes the slot

1603
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,800
where of like Peter Pan and pirates

1604
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,800
and pirates swinging on ropes in the pre,

1605
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,800
and while I'm always happy to see Peter Pan

1606
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,800
get replaced by anything, by anything,

1607
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,800
this still remains, it's very strange

1608
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,800
that this is what this real estate went to.

1609
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,800
During like the one bubble sequence,

1610
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:34,800
were you happy to see like Jiminy Cricket

1611
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,800
almost drowned in a bubble or Monstro show up?

1612
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,800
Like, are those the parts of Pinocchio

1613
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:40,800
you like the best?

1614
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:41,800
Oh, in the movies.

1615
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:42,800
In chaos.

1616
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:48,800
I am okay with, I have no issue

1617
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,800
with any of Jiminy Cricket,

1618
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,800
but I also don't root for his demise.

1619
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:53,800
Okay.

1620
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:54,800
Not quite.

1621
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,800
And even the regular Disney Pinocchio

1622
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,800
doesn't bother me as much as certainly

1623
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,800
every single frame of the live action,

1624
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,800
and then almost everything in which

1625
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,800
like an adult has played Pinocchio.

1626
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:08,800
Yeah.

1627
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,800
In little shorts.

1628
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,800
That's really where you get into trouble.

1629
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,800
Even in fairy tale theater,

1630
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,800
I think Paul Rubens did it.

1631
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,800
I'm, you know, tempted to like

1632
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,800
kind of anything Paul Rubens did,

1633
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,800
but that, not so much.

1634
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:26,800
I mean, I'm sure that's a very enjoyable piece,

1635
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,800
but if I'm going to watch a fairy tale theater,

1636
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,800
I'm going to watch Jeff Goldblum as the wolf.

1637
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,800
Yeah.

1638
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,800
If you've ever seen that one.

1639
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,800
That's a strong piece.

1640
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:35,800
Right, right.

1641
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,800
Anyways, yeah.

1642
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,800
Do you see, let me ask,

1643
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:42,800
because I watched a few versions of each one.

1644
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:45,800
Do you see Pocahontas during the Pocahontas sequence?

1645
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:46,800
I think you do.

1646
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,800
I think they both kind of climb the mountain

1647
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,800
and then kind of look longingly at each other

1648
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,800
from across the mountain.

1649
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,800
By the way, John Smith's voice also

1650
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,800
is somebody who is going to save Hollywood.

1651
01:05:58,800 --> 01:05:59,800
That's what I, yeah.

1652
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,800
And made a Jesus couple,

1653
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,800
well, it's going to be an occasion.

1654
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:04,800
Yeah.

1655
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,800
We should sign him up.

1656
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,800
He should do the animated version too,

1657
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:10,800
while he's at it.

1658
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,800
May as well.

1659
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,800
Who knows the beats?

1660
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:17,800
I saw Passion of the Christ my freshman year

1661
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:18,800
in college.

1662
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:22,800
And I didn't know what Passion plays were.

1663
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:25,800
And I went to like a comedy club rehearsal

1664
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,800
right after that.

1665
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,800
And a few of us just walked in like,

1666
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,800
oh my God.

1667
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,800
You thought it was going to be like a fun romp of a movie?

1668
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,800
No, I didn't think it was going to be a fun romp.

1669
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:38,800
I thought it was going to be a little more of a biopic.

1670
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,800
Like the soap opera Passion.

1671
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,800
So you just didn't know he gets the shit kicked out of him.

1672
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,800
I didn't know he gets the shit kicked out of him.

1673
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,800
There was like no English language.

1674
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,800
And there was like hardly any dialogue.

1675
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:50,800
I see.

1676
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:51,800
No, that's the point of it,

1677
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,800
is to get children to watch the bloodiest shit you've ever seen.

1678
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,800
Right.

1679
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,800
It actually, weirdly,

1680
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:01,800
it's funny that Mickey was going to walk on water in this venue

1681
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,800
because with The Big Rock,

1682
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,800
it kind of does look like a high end version of a set

1683
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,800
that could be used at like the Holy Land experience

1684
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,800
for a daily Passion play.

1685
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:12,800
That's true.

1686
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,800
If Disney ever, you know,

1687
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:19,800
if John Smith's voice and Maleficent's dad get their wish

1688
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:22,800
and Disney's Hollywood studio is taken over,

1689
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:26,800
is invaded, all the current smut is taken away.

1690
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,800
And maybe this could, this would be, I think,

1691
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:29,800
where the Passion play goes.

1692
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,800
Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense.

1693
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:32,800
Yeah, I think we're going to see it.

1694
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:33,800
Well, you'll be seeing it very strongly.

1695
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,800
Nope, we're getting Percy Jackson

1696
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:39,800
and the Mysterious Benedict Society.

1697
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:44,800
And so, like all your favorite Disney Plus properties.

1698
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,800
Are they talking about doing a lot of Percy?

1699
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:49,800
No.

1700
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:53,800
Percy Jackson has done, it is pretty popular, I believe.

1701
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,800
Yeah, yeah.

1702
01:07:55,800 --> 01:08:00,800
So anyways, the biggest difference for sure is this,

1703
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:01,800
and this is no longer the case.

1704
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:02,800
What has this been replaced by?

1705
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,800
Now it's more of a like, you know,

1706
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,800
lots of characters get a chance to shine

1707
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,800
instead of a mean governor.

1708
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:14,800
It's a lot of quick hits of like, there is like,

1709
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:19,800
there's a cool Mulan sequence with the song,

1710
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,800
one of the songs, and Bo Staff fighting.

1711
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,800
And then Pocahontas does a sequence.

1712
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,800
There's a cool Moana running,

1713
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,800
interacting with the water and stuff.

1714
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,800
She's like making it, well, does she make it?

1715
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:36,800
She's just sort of like, yeah.

1716
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,800
She kind of like makes one go up.

1717
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,800
I thought I had seen a version where she,

1718
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:43,800
it looks like she's walking on water,

1719
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,800
and then water is flying after her,

1720
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,800
but then I couldn't find any video of that.

1721
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:48,800
Oh, okay.

1722
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,800
Maybe that's just a dream you had.

1723
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:52,800
A dream or a-

1724
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:53,800
A premonition?

1725
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,800
Well, I was going to say,

1726
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,800
I might have watched videos where it's in B mode

1727
01:08:58,800 --> 01:08:59,800
and not doing that.

1728
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:00,800
Oh, maybe.

1729
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,800
Because there are show B modes.

1730
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:03,800
Oh, sure.

1731
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:04,800
Yes.

1732
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,800
Okay, well that makes sense.

1733
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,800
I think that is a good change that has transpired

1734
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,800
since the COVID reset.

1735
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,800
One pretty neat plus up, I think,

1736
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,800
about this whole thing is the addition of the Jafar snake.

1737
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:17,800
I know, the snake is awesome.

1738
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,800
That is cool as hell.

1739
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,800
So it's similar to Ka.

1740
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,800
There's a Ka in the Disneyland one

1741
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,800
with the big spotlight eyes.

1742
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:26,800
Right.

1743
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,800
But it's a little more, I think this is scarier,

1744
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,800
and I think it's, and just Jafar snake,

1745
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,800
great sequence in the movie, great in the video game,

1746
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:35,800
it's all great.

1747
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,800
And the spotlight eyes are following Mickey

1748
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,800
and chasing him around.

1749
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:42,800
Right.

1750
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:43,800
Is very cool.

1751
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:45,800
It reminds me of like,

1752
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,800
I'm trying to think if there's a,

1753
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,800
I don't know if it's like,

1754
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:50,800
there's like a snake game,

1755
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:54,800
either like a board game or like old snake toys

1756
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,800
that this snake reminds me of.

1757
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:57,800
I don't know if I'm also kind of thinking

1758
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:58,800
of Hungry Hungry Hippos.

1759
01:09:58,800 --> 01:09:59,800
It's like fragmented.

1760
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:00,800
As well, like the Hungry Hungry Hippo neck.

1761
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:01,800
Or the old cell phone game,

1762
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:02,800
where you have to like-

1763
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,800
Yeah, maybe that's what I'm thinking of.

1764
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:04,800
You have to slice a snake up

1765
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,800
and make him go into smaller and smaller pieces.

1766
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:07,800
Yeah.

1767
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,800
I believe we had the snakes and ladders.

1768
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,800
Maybe that's what I'm thinking of.

1769
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,800
It's just chutes and ladders,

1770
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:14,800
just a different thing you go down.

1771
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:15,800
But there's snakes involved.

1772
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,800
You like segmented snakes.

1773
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:18,800
Yeah, I do.

1774
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,800
I like that they're all little like,

1775
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,800
that it's, this feels like a school play

1776
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:24,800
in a charming way,

1777
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,800
where you see little people's legs,

1778
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:27,800
like they don't hide from it.

1779
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:28,800
It's theatrical, that's fine,

1780
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:29,800
you know what's going on.

1781
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:30,800
But it's, you know,

1782
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:31,800
it's like,

1783
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:32,800
like a Chinese dragon,

1784
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:33,800
it's cool.

1785
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:34,800
There's the jointed,

1786
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:35,800
yeah, these like,

1787
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:36,800
jointed snake toys.

1788
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,800
Oh, the wooden ones

1789
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:38,800
that you waggled around?

1790
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:39,800
I don't know if you can see that,

1791
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:40,800
yeah.

1792
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:41,800
Yeah.

1793
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:42,800
But those, yeah,

1794
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:43,800
those are kind of what they seem,

1795
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:44,800
it's like a big toy.

1796
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:45,800
Like a giant toy.

1797
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:46,800
It's cool, it's great.

1798
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:47,800
Yeah.

1799
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:48,800
You,

1800
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:49,800
and then you get

1801
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,800
just pure dragon finale in this,

1802
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:52,800
which works very well.

1803
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,800
This backdrop is really great for it.

1804
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,800
Like everybody's got better vision on it

1805
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:58,800
because of the amphora.

1806
01:10:58,800 --> 01:10:59,800
Yeah.

1807
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:00,800
And I mean,

1808
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:01,800
I watched a fireball hit

1809
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:02,800
that was just like,

1810
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,800
bonkers how good it was.

1811
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:05,800
Like,

1812
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:06,800
shot right out of the mouth

1813
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,800
onto something else

1814
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,800
that generated a bunch more flames.

1815
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:11,800
Like,

1816
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:12,800
like hit a spot

1817
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,800
that caused a bigger explosion.

1818
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:15,800
Yeah.

1819
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:16,800
Just that,

1820
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:17,800
that level of precision

1821
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:18,800
is so crazy,

1822
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:19,800
and the finale's

1823
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:20,800
as good as it ever,

1824
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:21,800
is Disneyland.

1825
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:22,800
Yeah.

1826
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:23,800
And then you get,

1827
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:24,800
I think a,

1828
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:25,800
I don't know,

1829
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:26,800
like,

1830
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:27,800
like,

1831
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:28,800
and then you get,

1832
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:29,800
I think a,

1833
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:30,800
it felt to me

1834
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,800
like a longer montage

1835
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,800
projected on a mist

1836
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,800
of every villain dying.

1837
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:36,800
Again,

1838
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:37,800
a kind of crazy thing

1839
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:38,800
that children watch every day

1840
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,800
is just the screams of agony

1841
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,800
of all the,

1842
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:42,800
you know,

1843
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,800
including recently referenced

1844
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:45,800
on the show,

1845
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:46,800
Claude Frollo.

1846
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:47,800
Of course.

1847
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:48,800
To see Frollo's anguish.

1848
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:49,800
Children today

1849
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,800
still watching Frollo's screams.

1850
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,800
Watching Cardinal Suffer.

1851
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:55,800
Yes.

1852
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:56,800
Yeah, yeah.

1853
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:57,800
But he's got,

1854
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:58,800
but what they,

1855
01:11:58,800 --> 01:11:59,800
what you don't know

1856
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:00,800
because it's a close-up

1857
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:01,800
is that he's got a boner

1858
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:02,800
while he's doing it.

1859
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:03,800
It's every,

1860
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:04,800
all anguish turned Frollo on.

1861
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:05,800
Yeah, man.

1862
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:06,800
Frollo and I are in the same

1863
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:07,800
wave of life.

1864
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:08,800
Even when you feel anguish,

1865
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:09,800
you also get a boner.

1866
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:10,800
Yeah.

1867
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:11,800
It just gets mixed up in there

1868
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:12,800
early on in your childhood,

1869
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,800
and I don't know.

1870
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:15,800
Just, you gotta,

1871
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:16,800
you gotta figure it out.

1872
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:17,800
I messed up in the head.

1873
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:18,800
What can I say?

1874
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,800
SMF and I were partying

1875
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:21,800
at Coachella,

1876
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:22,800
you know,

1877
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:23,800
with Jelly Roll

1878
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:24,800
and like fucking

1879
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:25,800
Post Malone.

1880
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:26,800
Then we got the next morning.

1881
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:27,800
He's already gone

1882
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:28,800
from the rental house.

1883
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:29,800
Apparently the Pope died.

1884
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:30,800
He's gotta go do

1885
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,800
a conclave bullshit.

1886
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:33,800
He didn't, he didn't.

1887
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:34,800
Wait, did Jelly Roll

1888
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,800
led to leave?

1889
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:36,800
No, Claude Frollo.

1890
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:37,800
Oh, Frollo.

1891
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:38,800
Sorry, sorry.

1892
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:39,800
I got confused.

1893
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:40,800
Jelly Roll's got nothing to do

1894
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:41,800
compared to Claude Frollo.

1895
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:42,800
Jelly Roll.

1896
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:43,800
Um.

1897
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:44,800
You know what?

1898
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:45,800
Frollo says,

1899
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:46,800
YOLO.

1900
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:47,800
In Winston-Ally,

1901
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:48,800
that's how he rolls.

1902
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:49,800
Oh, yeah.

1903
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:50,800
Yeah.

1904
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,800
You only live once,

1905
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:52,800
so you know,

1906
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:53,800
torture your cock and balls

1907
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:54,800
as much as you want.

1908
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:55,800
He's a Venmo me

1909
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:56,800
as usual.

1910
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:57,800
He forgot.

1911
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:58,800
Bullshit.

1912
01:12:58,800 --> 01:12:59,800
That's how he is though.

1913
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:00,800
I've come to accept that.

1914
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:01,800
I know you got Nazi gold

1915
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:02,800
in that cathedral

1916
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:03,800
you piece of shit.

1917
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:04,800
He got more than me though.

1918
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:05,800
I don't think so.

1919
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:06,800
This company was built

1920
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:07,800
on Nazi gold.

1921
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:08,800
That's right.

1922
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,800
Lenny Ravenstahl

1923
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:10,800
came to Burbank.

1924
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:11,800
She would think

1925
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:12,800
she came at the end.

1926
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:13,800
She wanted that tour

1927
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:14,800
and she was paying for it.

1928
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:15,800
Nazis built Tomorrowland.

1929
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:16,800
Come on.

1930
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:17,800
We know.

1931
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:18,800
There's gold under there.

1932
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:20,800
Finale, Phantasmic,

1933
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:21,800
you end up with,

1934
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:22,800
you know,

1935
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:23,800
they need to recreate

1936
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:24,800
the Disneyland version,

1937
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:25,800
which happens on the Mark Twain.

1938
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:26,800
There's already been a ship

1939
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:27,800
there for many, many years

1940
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:28,800
and the Finale was built

1941
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:29,800
with that in mind.

1942
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:30,800
They can't just move

1943
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:31,800
the whole ship

1944
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:32,800
from Magic Kingdom

1945
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:33,800
over to that,

1946
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,800
you know,

1947
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:35,800
you know,

1948
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:36,800
you know,

1949
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:37,800
you know,

1950
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:38,800
you know,

1951
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:39,800
you know,

1952
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:40,800
you know,

1953
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:41,800
you know,

1954
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:42,800
you know,

1955
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:43,800
you know,

1956
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:44,800
you know,

1957
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:45,800
you know,

1958
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:46,800
you know,

1959
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,800
you know,

1960
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:48,800
over to that

1961
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,800
and that's still in use.

1962
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:50,800
It's different parks.

1963
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:51,800
So they had to create

1964
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:52,800
a new ship

1965
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,800
from the ground up.

1966
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:55,800
I have to admit

1967
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:56,800
that I'd never put together

1968
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:57,800
that the ship

1969
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:58,800
is supposed to be

1970
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,800
like Steamboat Willie's ship

1971
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:01,800
and which is why

1972
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:02,800
it's like a little bit cartoony

1973
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,800
and like a little bulbous

1974
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:05,800
because in my head

1975
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:06,800
I would always,

1976
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:07,800
and by any measure

1977
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:08,800
I will say

1978
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,800
this ship is like

1979
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,800
an incredible set piece

1980
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,800
for a theatrical presentation,

1981
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:14,800
but compared to the Mark Twain,

1982
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:15,800
it is a little bit like,

1983
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:16,800
what's this dinky ship?

1984
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:17,800
What's this dinky ship?

1985
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:18,800
Is that insane?

1986
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,800
It's like a PlayStation 1 polygon.

1987
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:21,800
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1988
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,800
Somebody posted a gif of like,

1989
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:24,800
man,

1990
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:25,800
I miss the simplicity

1991
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:26,800
of the triangular,

1992
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,800
the pointed seagulls.

1993
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,800
Like it was just the seagulls

1994
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:31,800
in video games.

1995
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:32,800
Oh yeah.

1996
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:33,800
It was just kind of like

1997
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,800
a simple flapping thing

1998
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:36,800
in the distance.

1999
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,800
And that is what this boat wrote.

2000
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:39,800
It's just very gray.

2001
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:40,800
Yeah, yes.

2002
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,800
It doesn't hold a candle

2003
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:43,800
to the Mark Twain.

2004
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:44,800
Mark Twain,

2005
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,800
very beautiful,

2006
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,800
but when fantastic's winning,

2007
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,800
you can't do nighttime Mark Twain.

2008
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:51,800
Oh, so you're happy

2009
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:52,800
that by this being a different park,

2010
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,800
it doesn't step on anyone's

2011
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,800
riverboat enjoyment.

2012
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:57,800
So you sign off on that.

2013
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:58,800
That's true.

2014
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,800
Well, and the other thing

2015
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,800
I alluded to earlier in the show,

2016
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:02,800
the funny,

2017
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,800
the other funny fail in this

2018
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:05,800
is that like,

2019
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:08,800
as the riverboat rounds the bend

2020
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,800
and everyone goes inside

2021
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,800
to get away from fireworks and sparks.

2022
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:13,800
The many, the dozens

2023
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:14,800
of costume characters.

2024
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:15,800
The many costume characters

2025
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:16,800
all scurry away.

2026
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:17,800
Scurry away,

2027
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:20,800
but Ariel is sitting on a rock.

2028
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,800
So Prince Eric throws

2029
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,800
a flame retardant bag on her

2030
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,800
and she kind of looks like

2031
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,800
the hat man,

2032
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,800
the nightmare that people have

2033
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:33,800
if they took too much Benadryl

2034
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,800
or the woman in the yard.

2035
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,800
It's very woman in the yard-esque.

2036
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:38,800
I'm wondering if there's any children

2037
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,800
who like were looking around

2038
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,800
at this show and then just saw

2039
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,800
like pitch black Ariel

2040
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:45,800
and we're like, huh, huh, huh.

2041
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:46,800
Yeah, it's really,

2042
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:47,800
and if you've like forgot

2043
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,800
that that's where Ariel was,

2044
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:50,800
then it just seems like why

2045
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,800
is there suddenly a cloaked figure?

2046
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:53,800
Yeah.

2047
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:54,800
A lone cloaked figure

2048
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:55,800
haunting the end of the show.

2049
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,800
It's so sad.

2050
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,800
Slumped off the edge of this boat

2051
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:00,800
and like the,

2052
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:01,800
with kind of like

2053
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,800
Charlie Brown limp away posture.

2054
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:05,800
It is so sad.

2055
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:06,800
Poor Ariel,

2056
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,800
who we want nothing more

2057
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,800
than for Ariel's dreams to come true.

2058
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,800
And then in this situation,

2059
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,800
a black bag is thrown on her.

2060
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,800
She gets half kidnapped

2061
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:17,800
at the end of the show.

2062
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:18,800
But then like,

2063
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:19,800
but then it's like,

2064
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:20,800
oh shit, the cops run.

2065
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:21,800
And then they,

2066
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:22,800
they like just leave her,

2067
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:23,800
whatever,

2068
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:24,800
leave the girl.

2069
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:25,800
It's great.

2070
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,800
She's got plausible deniability.

2071
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,800
Yeah, it is very,

2072
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:30,800
I mean, it's safe.

2073
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:31,800
Like it,

2074
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:32,800
it works,

2075
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:33,800
but it is sort of like,

2076
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,800
we could just put her in her dress

2077
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,800
from the end of the movie.

2078
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:38,800
Yes.

2079
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:39,800
Yeah, really.

2080
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:40,800
Yeah.

2081
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:41,800
Why does she have to be in a fin?

2082
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:42,800
That doesn't,

2083
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:43,800
and what if it didn't?

2084
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,800
What if you then one night

2085
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:46,800
perfectly watched

2086
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,800
just a green little sparkle

2087
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,800
fly all the way from the sky

2088
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:52,800
onto that bag

2089
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,800
where it catches on fire

2090
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,800
and you know that Ariel is in there

2091
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,800
and you know that Ariel's hair

2092
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,800
can't be made of anything

2093
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,800
that goes well with fire.

2094
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,800
No hair does,

2095
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,800
but especially not wig hair.

2096
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,800
It's grandfathered in asbestos.

2097
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:09,800
Yeah, yeah.

2098
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,800
Yes, the costume was built in a time

2099
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:12,800
where this was approved.

2100
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,800
Yeah.

2101
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:14,800
Yeah, it would just be,

2102
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:15,800
yeah,

2103
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:16,800
praying for the safety

2104
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,800
of any Ariel out there.

2105
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,800
That is one of the funniest little,

2106
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,800
I'm sure they've been doing that for decades.

2107
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:23,800
That's where you got to think

2108
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,800
like how much Disney fan culture

2109
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:26,800
is out there

2110
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:27,800
that like nobody,

2111
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:28,800
like guess what I noticed?

2112
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,800
Guess what I can make go viral?

2113
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,800
Ariel's bag.

2114
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,800
There's the Pruder film level details

2115
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,800
from any angle on any of these shows

2116
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,800
which is what made it the craziest thing

2117
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,800
to catch on fire.

2118
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:43,800
Something else that I clocked

2119
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:44,800
in watching this video,

2120
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:45,800
so I watched the performance

2121
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:46,800
as late as you could go

2122
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:47,800
before everything shut down

2123
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,800
which was in January 2020

2124
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,800
and I'm watching all these characters

2125
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,800
run around the steamboat willy,

2126
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,800
the SS willy or whatever at the end

2127
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,800
and it's a lot of perennials obviously.

2128
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:00,800
It's Geppetto and Pinocchio

2129
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,800
and Prince Eric and the classics

2130
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,800
and the seven dwarves and whatever.

2131
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:09,800
And then in the group is Brer Bear

2132
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,800
and just knowing the fate

2133
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,800
that was coming to Brer Bear

2134
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,800
not too long after that,

2135
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,800
what I was picturing was the end of the show

2136
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,800
and all the characters are like,

2137
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,800
they're all like landing after

2138
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,800
and he's talking to him like,

2139
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:28,800
oh boy, another successful performance, eh?

2140
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,800
Oh boy, boy gang, you know,

2141
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:32,800
night after night,

2142
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:33,800
you'd think it would get old

2143
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:34,800
but it never does.

2144
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:35,800
You know, you guys,

2145
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,800
I just want to say you're my best friends

2146
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:39,800
and I think this is going to be a great year

2147
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,800
and I think that we're going to,

2148
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:42,800
I think we're going to have

2149
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,800
so many performances of Fantastic

2150
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,800
and I'm going to be right there with all of you forever.

2151
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:48,800
But then two months later,

2152
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:49,800
he got really sick

2153
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:51,800
and got put on a ventilator.

2154
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:53,800
That's what you were getting at.

2155
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:54,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2156
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:55,800
That and only that.

2157
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:56,800
Yeah.

2158
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,800
You know, come by Splash Mountain tonight.

2159
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,800
If you want, come hang out with me.

2160
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,800
You guys are welcome there anytime

2161
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,800
from now, whether it's now

2162
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,800
or 30 years from now.

2163
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:08,800
You're always,

2164
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,800
there's a spot with your name on it.

2165
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:11,800
You know, when Splash opened,

2166
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,800
we were worried this wasn't going to last

2167
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:14,800
but now I'm sure.

2168
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,800
I'm going to be here forever.

2169
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:17,800
That's what I know.

2170
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:20,800
Which is even like the honor of being with you,

2171
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,800
with you guys that like,

2172
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,800
to be here with Little Mermaid

2173
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:25,800
and with Aladdin

2174
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,800
lets me know that I'm one of the Disney greats.

2175
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:30,800
So we're always,

2176
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:31,800
just to be in this company.

2177
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,800
I'm like nerding out right now.

2178
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,800
Raise your champagne flutes.

2179
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,800
That includes you, Jamestown gang.

2180
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:40,800
We're never going to die.

2181
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:41,800
All of us.

2182
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:42,800
Yes, forever.

2183
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,800
We're going to live forever.

2184
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,800
Looking at you, Gene Schwartz.

2185
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,800
We're in what I like to call the big 30,

2186
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,800
the top 30 Disney characters.

2187
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:54,800
It's a Mount Rushmore

2188
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,800
that will never ever be questioned.

2189
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:58,800
I'm 22.

2190
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,800
Radcliffe, what is his name?

2191
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:01,800
It's not Radigan.

2192
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:02,800
I kept saying that.

2193
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,800
Radigan's from Great Mouse Detective.

2194
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:05,800
I wish Radigan was in here.

2195
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:06,800
He's 23.

2196
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:07,800
Radcliffe.

2197
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:11,800
And you've got the Siamese cats are 21 and 22.

2198
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,800
Did you ever see them in these?

2199
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:17,800
I don't wonder why.

2200
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,800
I heard the jumps to that song

2201
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,800
but I haven't heard the cats in a while.

2202
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:25,800
By the way, yes, this is how I talk.

2203
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:26,800
This is my voice.

2204
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,800
I think we can all agree on this.

2205
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,800
It just gets better and better

2206
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,800
and the more you hear it.

2207
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:38,800
Well, here's to a happy 2020 for all of us,

2208
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:42,800
especially me, and a happy eternity too.

2209
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,800
And happy birthday, Roseanne Cowell

2210
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,800
from home on the range.

2211
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,800
You're going to live on streaming

2212
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,800
for a long, long, long time.

2213
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:56,800
I've been streaming for a long time.

2214
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,800
Favorite Disney character, number 29

2215
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,800
of the top 30.

2216
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,800
Hopper, can't forget you, Hopper.

2217
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,800
Number 30.

2218
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,800
Hopper's 30.

2219
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,800
The other thing I've a lot of alluded to

2220
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:12,800
early in the thing, the biggest fail,

2221
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,800
the worst thing that ever happened

2222
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,800
to the point about this boat

2223
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,800
while being technically very impressive

2224
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,800
on most scales, but also

2225
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,800
you got to throw a bag on her

2226
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:26,800
and it kind of looks like Weird and Ricky.

2227
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,800
And then one awful night, Dopey

2228
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,800
is running around on the second level.

2229
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,800
His foot slips.

2230
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,800
I don't know, like stupid Dopey.

2231
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,800
His foot just happened to go

2232
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:39,800
in the massive chasm that any of the characters

2233
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,800
with limited eyesight could have

2234
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,800
on any night for 20 years

2235
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,800
just easily kicked their way.

2236
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,800
Just if you haven't seen the video,

2237
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,800
Dopey slips and falls and lands

2238
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,800
on top of Goofy.

2239
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,800
It is, for an incident that apparently

2240
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,800
did not terribly injure either of them,

2241
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,800
thank God, it looks so bad.

2242
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,800
It looks rough.

2243
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,800
It looks so bad for both of them.

2244
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,800
Really bad. They don't go in the water?

2245
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,800
No, nobody lands in the water.

2246
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,800
Thank God.

2247
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,800
Landing on Goofy is not a good scenario,

2248
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,800
but it does feel like Dopey is only

2249
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,800
a foot away from landing in the water

2250
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,800
and that can't be good either.

2251
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,800
Now you have to rescue a character

2252
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,800
in a head from water.

2253
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,800
It's a miracle that doesn't happen

2254
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,800
more often in these places.

2255
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,800
And that was Orlando or Anaheim that happened?

2256
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,800
That was Orlando.

2257
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,800
Because this kind of shit wouldn't fly

2258
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:31,800
in your beloved Mark Twain.

2259
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,800
They thought about this, it was built to last,

2260
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,800
it was built like proper railings

2261
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,800
so that real children who go on that thing

2262
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,800
don't go flying off,

2263
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,800
built with care.

2264
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,800
It's not a PlayStation 1 Spyro the Dragon boat.

2265
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,800
Yes, plenty of polygons

2266
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,800
on the Mark Twain from the get-go.

2267
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:49,800
I wish they built,

2268
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,800
I mean the different characters

2269
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,800
wouldn't fit on the actual way

2270
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,800
Steamboat Willie the boat looks.

2271
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,800
But I wish it looked more like

2272
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,800
Steamboat Willie somehow.

2273
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,800
I know what they were going for.

2274
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,800
I almost had not thought that,

2275
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:05,800
it's like a kind of cartoon

2276
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,800
cheapening out or something

2277
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:09,800
that doesn't really...

2278
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:11,800
The boat looks like shit

2279
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:13,800
in Steamboat Willie.

2280
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:15,800
But it doesn't, I don't know.

2281
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:17,800
It could look more like that.

2282
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,800
You would have been the highest caliber

2283
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:21,800
of snob if you said that in 1928.

2284
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,800
That's true.

2285
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,800
Can you believe it? A cartoon talked.

2286
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,800
What do you think, Michael?

2287
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,800
Boat looks like shit.

2288
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,800
Never mind, this thing is going to be a failure.

2289
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,800
More harassment for the Fleischer fool.

2290
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,800
I was a plant.

2291
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:39,800
So, lots of funny

2292
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,800
incidents, lots of funny strange

2293
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:43,800
programming, I think a lot of

2294
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,800
fun separate culture

2295
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,800
of the Florida one.

2296
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:49,800
Which I still

2297
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,800
have to be honest, I will never take the

2298
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,800
time to see this, it's not happening.

2299
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,800
Either coast.

2300
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,800
I've seen it in California.

2301
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,800
But you'll never go to Orlando and see it.

2302
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,800
I think I'm just not, I don't know.

2303
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,800
But with kids?

2304
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:05,800
That's the difference.

2305
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,800
But in this current era, where I

2306
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,800
have kids, but I keep going to Disney

2307
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:11,800
World without them.

2308
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:13,800
That's what I'm also in a situation.

2309
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,800
I bring her too, but

2310
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,800
often.

2311
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,800
Getting in and out of this

2312
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,800
amphitheater with kids.

2313
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,800
That's just chaos.

2314
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,800
Nightmare that not even

2315
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,800
Mickey could conjure.

2316
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:29,800
I like to see

2317
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,800
my parents, so I would walk behind.

2318
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,800
Other kids would run ahead.

2319
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,800
If you're a parent, neither

2320
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,800
is ideal.

2321
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,800
I guess ahead you can see them.

2322
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,800
But like, my parents

2323
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,800
really, I feel like that

2324
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:45,800
was a thing I'm remembering.

2325
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:47,800
I was like, I'll walk behind you

2326
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,800
so I can see. They're like, no, we

2327
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,800
were fine. We need to see

2328
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:53,800
you.

2329
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,800
Because just following behind

2330
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,800
your dad, or you think is your dad,

2331
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:59,800
that's how Home Alone 2 happened.

2332
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,800
That's right. Very good point.

2333
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,800
Don't just trust the regular looking

2334
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,800
guys backside.

2335
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,800
Important point. You get home

2336
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:09,800
alones, and then you have to go meet Trump in the

2337
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,800
lobby.

2338
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,800
Let's talk Tokyo for a minute here.

2339
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,800
Did you see it in Tokyo?

2340
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:17,800
I saw part of it in Tokyo.

2341
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:19,800
We planned it and watched the whole

2342
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,800
thing. The kind of leisurely thing that

2343
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,800
yes, can happen when you have enough

2344
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,800
days to do so.

2345
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:27,800
I will admit this.

2346
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,800
We didn't

2347
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:31,800
plan on it.

2348
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,800
I kind of loathe to see these things sometimes

2349
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,800
because I don't want to take the time to pick out a spot.

2350
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,800
But we were walking by and we were just like,

2351
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,800
this is a good spot. We're fine. We got one.

2352
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:41,800
This is great. Because that harbor,

2353
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,800
we've obviously raved about Tokyo

2354
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,800
Disney Sea a lot.

2355
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,800
There's so much to rave about, you almost don't take the time

2356
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,800
to say what you enter to.

2357
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,800
It's unbelievable. And then you don't get tired of it.

2358
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:53,800
Because you have to circle back that way

2359
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,800
so many times throughout the day.

2360
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,800
The Mediterranean harbor at the entrance

2361
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:59,800
is so spectacular.

2362
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,800
All of the lagoon shows they do

2363
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,800
make incredible use of it.

2364
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,800
And it looks, it's so

2365
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,800
calming and gentle there

2366
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,800
at night. There's such a feeling.

2367
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,800
Like we were just outside

2368
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:13,800
some random restaurant and I think at that time

2369
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:15,800
not yet completed

2370
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:17,800
Sorin Fantastic Flight.

2371
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:19,800
And a really magical area

2372
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,800
for it being just a restaurant and construction walls.

2373
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,800
It was a great place to see the show.

2374
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,800
I reminded myself the videos

2375
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,800
I took of it where, oh my god,

2376
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,800
it's the finale of Fantasmic.

2377
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,800
But also, I go

2378
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,800
that way and there's the volcano.

2379
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,800
And lava's coming out as we speak. And then there's that

2380
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,800
incredible Tower of Terror.

2381
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:39,800
You can see the ship in the background.

2382
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,800
Ugh, got that Tokyo.

2383
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:43,800
Got that Tokyo Jones going again

2384
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,800
as strong as always.

2385
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:47,800
The fact that the backdrop for it

2386
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:49,800
is Tokyo Disney Sea

2387
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,800
really elevates it.

2388
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,800
And it's massive.

2389
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,800
I mean Tokyo Disney Sea is that lagoon

2390
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,800
or whatever is massive. And it feels like

2391
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,800
I mean there were people that were definitely

2392
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:01,800
whenever we were there were crammed

2393
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,800
against the whatever

2394
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,800
railings to see it. But there's plenty

2395
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,800
of places you can casually stand

2396
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,800
and watch. It's not like

2397
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,800
Disneyland. Yeah, I didn't feel like

2398
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,800
constricted. I had plenty of breathing room.

2399
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:15,800
We saw the Halloween show

2400
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,800
during the daytime on the water as well.

2401
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,800
With the different little barges

2402
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:21,800
like Halloween barges which was fun.

2403
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,800
There's such barge pros in Tokyo.

2404
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:25,800
So it is

2405
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:27,800
and we didn't watch. I forget why

2406
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:29,800
we didn't watch all of it. I think maybe we

2407
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,800
happened upon it leaving something

2408
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,800
and then we watched five or ten minutes. I think I have

2409
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:35,800
some video somewhere of it. But

2410
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:37,800
just getting to sit by the

2411
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:39,800
lagoon at night with lights.

2412
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,800
That's really all you need. So anything above that

2413
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:43,800
is gravy.

2414
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,800
Content wise.

2415
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:47,800
Pretty similar to the domestic phantasmics

2416
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:49,800
would you say? It's sort of

2417
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,800
not actually. It's not radically

2418
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,800
different and it's the same structure.

2419
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:55,800
But I mean it's

2420
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,800
just so different to look at.

2421
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:59,800
While you have the backdrop of

2422
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:01,800
the volcano you can't put Mickey on there.

2423
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:03,800
So he's on this kind of

2424
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:05,800
like bedazzled

2425
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,800
mountain that rolls out into the center.

2426
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:09,800
He's on like a screen. He's on a big

2427
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,800
screen cone.

2428
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:13,800
It's a big screen cone. It's almost like a cake

2429
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,800
of some kind in some ways.

2430
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:17,800
Yes. It does kind of look delicious

2431
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,800
despite it being a bunch of LEDs.

2432
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:21,800
It's pretty jazzy.

2433
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:23,800
It's pretty snazzy. It looks very cool.

2434
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,800
They play clips off of there

2435
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,800
and then sometimes it's just abstract when

2436
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:29,800
he's fighting the dragon. The dragon

2437
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,800
rises out of a big mirror

2438
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:33,800
which

2439
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:35,800
rolls out like the darkness.

2440
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:37,800
It's incredible that they're able to do like the

2441
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:39,800
seamless transitions in the dark.

2442
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,800
Everything's right in front of you obviously.

2443
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:43,800
But they keep it still very theatrical in its

2444
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:45,800
lighting to where like whoa that's the

2445
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,800
dragon float. And none of it's

2446
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,800
out there. Right. As opposed to Phantasmac where they

2447
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:51,800
got to shut or sorry in Disneyland

2448
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,800
where they have to shut down Times

2449
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:55,800
Island way early and get everything ready for show

2450
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:57,800
mode. This seems like it just kind of

2451
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:59,800
starts. It's what? Right.

2452
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,800
It has to just be a lagoon during the day and they're probably

2453
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:03,800
running some other show. It feels like

2454
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:05,800
you're seeing Phantasmac

2455
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:07,800
on Lake Michigan or something.

2456
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,800
Yeah. Totally.

2457
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,800
It feels so hidden.

2458
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,800
I mean I'm sure if I went back because I

2459
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,800
haven't spent as much time in DisneySea as I have in Disneyland

2460
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:17,800
but you can definitely see even like all right they're getting

2461
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,800
ready for Phantasmac. Here's all the different

2462
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,800
stuff. Yeah. The stuff around the

2463
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:23,800
like railings, lagoons, stuff

2464
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:25,800
like lights and whatever. Yeah.

2465
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:27,800
But like yeah it feels a lot of it feels

2466
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,800
invisible. Yeah. Until

2467
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,800
the show starts. Which is incredible that then it starts and then you end up

2468
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,800
with like there is so much

2469
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,800
fire on that lake. So much

2470
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:37,800
fire. I think yeah there's

2471
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,800
more fire in this than any of these shows.

2472
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,800
Yeah I think it's. Fire is in all the shows.

2473
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:43,800
I think there's at least fire in Disneyland

2474
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,800
more in Orlando and then it feels like the most

2475
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:47,800
is in Tokyo. Yeah. But I mean maybe

2476
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,800
that's not true. Maybe that's my feeling.

2477
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,800
We're getting a lot of the Midwest today

2478
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:53,800
from Lake Michigan,

2479
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,800
Gary, Indiana. Oh yeah I'm just bringing

2480
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,800
it up you're saying. Not my accent. White Hamilton.

2481
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:59,800
All the greatest

2482
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,800
Midwest institutions.

2483
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:03,800
Yeah. The greatest accomplishments

2484
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:05,800
landmarks and exports. Right.

2485
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,800
The best White Hamiltons

2486
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:09,800
you ever seen.

2487
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:11,800
So I mean like

2488
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:13,800
I could talk about

2489
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,800
parts of it but it mainly it's I mean

2490
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:17,800
it's all going to as a lot of Tokyo things boil down

2491
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,800
to it's just like you guys it's

2492
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,800
so fucking cool. And then this

2493
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:23,800
thing happens and it's so cool.

2494
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:25,800
All this stuff is like like then there's like a

2495
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:27,800
big Pumba balloon a big balloon

2496
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:29,800
and it's so cool. And

2497
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:31,800
I just like it made me I was so happy

2498
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:33,800
I mean I was obviously happy all day

2499
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,800
every day there. But

2500
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:37,800
I watched a video I was like what are we doing right

2501
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:39,800
after and we were walking out just all

2502
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:41,800
it just crowds are dissipating and we seems

2503
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,800
to go straight from there to our third

2504
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,800
time of the day on Journey to the Center of the Earth.

2505
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,800
Oh yeah. And we are

2506
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,800
it's the it's the exit music

2507
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:51,800
specifically if you look at it it's what I love as it's

2508
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,800
classified on Spotify is the fantastic

2509
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:55,800
exit music which is where it gets

2510
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,800
like there's no more it's all instrumental and

2511
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:59,800
it's just synthy at that point so I love it.

2512
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,800
And we are it's

2513
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:03,800
it's a track that means so much to Aaron and I both

2514
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:05,800
from from childhood and have this

2515
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,800
thing that like we remember from being nine years old

2516
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:09,800
and now we're hearing it across the globe

2517
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,800
in this new magical setting

2518
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:13,800
that's far beyond what you thought

2519
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,800
any Disney park could do.

2520
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:17,800
We're just so we're just like giggling

2521
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:19,800
weird like we have shit eating

2522
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:21,800
grins we're so happy.

2523
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:23,800
It like yeah

2524
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:25,800
what can I say I

2525
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:27,800
you know go go check it out next time

2526
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:29,800
you're there. Oh wait you can't

2527
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,800
yeah I don't know what happened I don't know why they got rid

2528
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:33,800
of it. That's a good question I don't know either.

2529
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:35,800
It's it's I thought it was like

2530
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:37,800
triumphant I thought it was so great.

2531
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:39,800
Have they are they doing any other show?

2532
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:41,800
There has to be something planned right?

2533
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:43,800
Because all of those shows are unbelievable

2534
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:45,800
you saw Halloween one I saw the Easter one.

2535
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:47,800
I've never stopped thinking about it.

2536
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,800
Like so huge and grand.

2537
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,800
Incredible costumes

2538
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:53,800
for them. I didn't see a replacement.

2539
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,800
The costumes that you see incredibly far away.

2540
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:57,800
You know what's another we love our

2541
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,800
Eisner stuff obviously you guys ever seen that footage

2542
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,800
of like it's the opening ceremony of

2543
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:03,800
Disney Sea and that it's him and Roy

2544
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,800
and somebody else like be like be like

2545
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:07,800
trotting out like being driven

2546
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,800
out on a big barge. I don't think I have seen that.

2547
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,800
It's pretty cool with Mickey

2548
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,800
looking like Magellan or something.

2549
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,800
Mickey is like it's like from the past

2550
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:17,800
and future Mickey.

2551
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,800
Wow. This is a

2552
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:21,800
vibe yeah because it just

2553
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:23,800
looks like he's speeding on a pontoon or something.

2554
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:25,800
Just looks like yeah

2555
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:27,800
Eisner swamp style.

2556
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:29,800
Eisner going swamp

2557
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:31,800
mode.

2558
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:33,800
There's there has to be

2559
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:35,800
more Eisner in Tokyo

2560
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,800
footage like around

2561
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:39,800
this time. Probably I don't associate

2562
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:41,800
with I bet he didn't go terribly.

2563
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,800
I guess that's probably and I don't associate Disney

2564
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:45,800
Sea with him because around that time and the rest

2565
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:47,800
of the parks he was building a bunch of cheap

2566
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:49,800
shit. Right. But so it's like weird

2567
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:51,800
that he's even parted like oh you did this.

2568
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,800
Right. I guess technically you did

2569
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,800
this. Technically stitch

2570
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:57,800
is in this. You get some yeah

2571
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:59,800
you get some like like a stupid

2572
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:01,800
rock instrumental version of Hawaiian

2573
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,800
coaster ride.

2574
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:05,800
And

2575
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:07,800
I don't know.

2576
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:09,800
That's fun. It's as fun as Stitch being

2577
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:11,800
glommed on to the Tiki Room which is what happens

2578
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:13,800
there. A bunch of

2579
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:15,800
big globes and orbs.

2580
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,800
You know it's a good

2581
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,800
dragon. So many but

2582
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,800
I am not too

2583
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:23,800
specific here. I'm just

2584
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:25,800
putting I'm saying all these keywords and I'm putting

2585
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,800
exclamation points behind them just like

2586
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:29,800
the word phantasmic itself.

2587
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:31,800
Mickey has like a light up

2588
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:33,800
robe more like it's cooler.

2589
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:35,800
Yes. Yes. Yeah. He's in a Technicolor

2590
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:37,800
dream code. Yes. Very. Oh yeah.

2591
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:39,800
You're right. He loved his

2592
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:41,800
coat of many colors. That's right.

2593
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:43,800
A lot of great

2594
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:45,800
high school productions of that too. Yeah.

2595
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:47,800
There's it's if there's not

2596
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:49,800
one really good like one talented mom

2597
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:51,800
at that school that writing to her

2598
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:53,800
dream code is going to be

2599
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:55,800
going to be a real bomb. That I feel like

2600
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:57,800
that Jesus Christ superstar

2601
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:59,800
Godspell. That was

2602
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,800
in the 90s. That was the religion

2603
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:03,800
you could have schools without

2604
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:05,800
lawsuits. This was that's true.

2605
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:07,800
Now in Trump's America those are the only shows that you

2606
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:09,800
can do. Of course. Yeah. Although even

2607
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:11,800
not so like I don't I don't care for any of that hippie

2608
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:13,800
music though. Age of

2609
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:15,800
Aquarius. We're getting rid of

2610
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:17,800
it. The age of Americus.

2611
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:21,800
We're not doing hair.

2612
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:23,800
I have the best hair. That's the only

2613
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:25,800
hair you need to concern yourself.

2614
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:27,800
We don't need to learn about any other hair.

2615
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:29,800
We don't need to do hair. I also

2616
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:31,800
for some reason in this show they just

2617
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,800
say the word imagination way more.

2618
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:35,800
In any spare space in the song that

2619
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:37,800
was just instrumental before now they say

2620
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:39,800
imagination. And then in the end he doesn't say

2621
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:41,800
some imagination huh. He says

2622
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:43,800
imagination ha ha.

2623
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,800
That's how he ends it.

2624
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,800
They just I don't know it's as if they were like

2625
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:49,800
this needs to cut through all

2626
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:51,800
language. You have to you cannot

2627
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:53,800
there's a minimum you must say imagination

2628
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:55,800
a hundred and twenty times in the show.

2629
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,800
We cannot green light it.

2630
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:59,800
The smoldering volcano just

2631
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:01,800
in the background adding

2632
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:03,800
ambiance to

2633
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:05,800
incredible.

2634
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:07,800
I would like to see

2635
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:09,800
Mickey pop out of it. Yes I

2636
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,800
that is yes if they get over the dragon comes out

2637
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:13,800
of it. Yes.

2638
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,800
Something they could do there

2639
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,800
but really they don't need to.

2640
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:19,800
I mean it smolders it erupts normal

2641
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,800
times as well. They should do like a

2642
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:23,800
gag like Mickey goes in a barrel

2643
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:25,800
and a barge and pops up the volcano.

2644
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,800
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2645
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:29,800
Or just pops all over and then he's on top of the

2646
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,800
tower of terror he's everywhere.

2647
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:33,800
Volcano Bay's volcano also erupts.

2648
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:35,800
We haven't really talked about enough fake

2649
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,800
volcano eruptions I don't think on the show.

2650
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39,800
But I'm a big fan

2651
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:41,800
of the volcano and

2652
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:43,800
volcano bay. Yeah. Is this a path

2653
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,800
to yet another episode about

2654
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:47,800
Margaritaville. Well

2655
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:49,800
it could be. I mean now that you say it.

2656
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:51,800
I mean maybe you say is the

2657
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:53,800
water park H2O. Is that around?

2658
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,800
We should check in on it.

2659
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:57,800
It can't be in good shape. It is

2660
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:59,800
still around but it's not a water

2661
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:01,800
theme park like volcano.

2662
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:03,800
Yeah it's true. Well this

2663
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,800
could be because I pitched

2664
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:07,800
the notion of a final four

2665
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,800
that is fake fire meets real fire. Yes that's true.

2666
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:11,800
Lava could be part of

2667
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:13,800
the equation. Oh and I think it has to be.

2668
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:15,800
That might be a way to tribute all of the great fake

2669
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:17,800
volcanoes out there. Sure.

2670
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:19,800
So unless you disagree

2671
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:21,800
that fake lava is not fake fire.

2672
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:23,800
I agree. I think it could get along great.

2673
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:25,800
Anything else to say about Phantasmagor

2674
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:27,800
before we wind it down. I think these are all

2675
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:29,800
remarkable in their own

2676
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:31,800
ways except for the Disney World one which is

2677
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:33,800
too cowardly to have Mickey walk on water.

2678
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:35,800
Yes that's true.

2679
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:37,800
I agree with that. It's just

2680
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:39,800
I mean you know we talked about the music

2681
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:41,800
ad nauseum I think on the first one. But

2682
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:43,800
music obviously is still the biggest

2683
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:45,800
thing because

2684
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,800
everybody I think loves it.

2685
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,800
So that really will

2686
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:51,800
they could make a shittier

2687
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:53,800
show and that music would still carry it through.

2688
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:55,800
But there's a lot of different

2689
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:57,800
there's a lot of different reasons

2690
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:59,800
to like each Phantasmagor.

2691
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:01,800
I think that

2692
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,800
Disneyland

2693
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:05,800
the location still maybe is

2694
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:07,800
kind of cool that it's the most intimate.

2695
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:09,800
I don't know why we have to pick

2696
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:11,800
a favorite but. Well

2697
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,800
that's fair to do. Yeah I think

2698
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,800
I would still go towards original

2699
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:17,800
but I think Tokyo is pretty remarkable.

2700
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:19,800
Yeah I know. Disney World

2701
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:21,800
kind of comes in third I think.

2702
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:23,800
I think I go Disney little world Disneyland.

2703
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:25,800
It just shows you how good a franchise it is.

2704
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:27,800
Because I think by any measure the Disney World one

2705
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:29,800
is an incredible show. Right of course.

2706
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:31,800
But like you're getting the bigger

2707
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,800
it's an arena or whatever it's a

2708
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,800
stadium style.

2709
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:37,800
I'd like to see a stadium in the round.

2710
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:39,800
But the scope is better

2711
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:41,800
in Tokyo Disney Sea as far as something oh my gosh

2712
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:43,800
look at now it's like got so much room.

2713
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:45,800
That uses the surroundings of the actual

2714
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:47,800
park. Right. So I think Disney World is third.

2715
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:49,800
You have the intimacy of Disneyland

2716
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:51,800
of standing in the railing

2717
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:53,800
right on the water. But you have the

2718
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:55,800
extravagance of Disney World.

2719
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:57,800
But there is the downside in

2720
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,800
Disneyland that you could that intimacy

2721
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:01,800
could cause you to get burnt to death.

2722
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:03,800
Well that's true. That's the risk you take

2723
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:05,800
at any theme park. Yeah

2724
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,800
you go there knowing that if this is how you're going to

2725
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:09,800
go out it'd be the most awesome way to go.

2726
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,800
Metal very metal. Oh I have a very

2727
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:13,800
weird thing that irks

2728
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:15,800
me. But it's a bigger it's

2729
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,800
from the movie. I really

2730
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:19,800
like the movie Moana and I like

2731
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:21,800
the song from that movie

2732
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:23,800
that is in this.

2733
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:25,800
Is it How Far I'll Go? Which one? Yeah it's

2734
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:27,800
How Far I'll Go. Really like

2735
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:29,800
that song.

2736
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:31,800
The moment where she screams I am

2737
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:33,800
Moana.

2738
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:35,800
That always kind of

2739
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:37,800
bumped for me. Like that always seems like

2740
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:39,800
this doesn't

2741
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:41,800
this doesn't quite make sense

2742
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:43,800
in the song. Now maybe it's

2743
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:45,800
there's a story element or something

2744
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:47,800
I'm missing. But I

2745
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:49,800
was like you know

2746
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:51,800
I couldn't think of any other like

2747
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:53,800
Disney animated movie where it's like

2748
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:55,800
I'm just Belle you know.

2749
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:57,800
I guess the

2750
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:59,800
opening song in Beauty and the Beast they're kind

2751
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:01,800
of saying that. Well I know

2752
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:03,800
a character who would sing it in a song for sure.

2753
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:05,800
Who? Groot.

2754
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:07,800
Well you're certainly

2755
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:09,800
right there. That's a good point.

2756
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:11,800
If he's not busy rocking a roll in

2757
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:13,800
and grooving you know.

2758
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:15,800
You Jason on the podcast you should sometimes just

2759
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:17,800
yell I am Jason.

2760
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:19,800
Just to remind everyone.

2761
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,800
Because sometimes people don't know

2762
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:23,800
who or whatever I mean usually it's with

2763
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:25,800
Scott and I is the problem with the voice

2764
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:27,800
so I guess maybe Scott or I should be like I am

2765
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:29,800
Michael and then I'll start

2766
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:31,800
making my point. So if I'm missing

2767
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:33,800
a story beat from Moana

2768
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:35,800
let me know. Let him know.

2769
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:37,800
Why would it make more sense?

2770
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:39,800
Why would she yell her name?

2771
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:41,800
It is already the title.

2772
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:43,800
Sit and watch the film. Study the film.

2773
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:45,800
You get to do it in a house without a child

2774
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:47,800
who is scared of the lava monster.

2775
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:49,800
We even tried that.

2776
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:51,800
This is a wall I think that a lot of parents

2777
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:53,800
face maybe they can attest is that

2778
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:55,800
kids who like Moana until they don't.

2779
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:57,800
We were playing the video game Astro

2780
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:59,800
a Playstation.

2781
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:01,800
The Astro is like a fun platformer Mario

2782
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:03,800
style game with a little robot.

2783
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:05,800
And we did my daughter really likes

2784
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:07,800
the crazy volcano

2785
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:09,800
that has eyes that shoots

2786
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:11,800
fire at us and then you turn him like

2787
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:13,800
good at the end and then it's just all water

2788
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:15,800
flowing out of the mountain at the end.

2789
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:17,800
So I'm wondering if that will prepare her for

2790
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:19,800
a Moana. We'll see.

2791
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:21,800
A live volcano. But maybe with music and maybe that

2792
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:23,800
will be too much. Any other

2793
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:25,800
thoughts on the giant crab for

2794
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:27,800
Moana that I believe is Jermaine

2795
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:29,800
Clement.

2796
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:31,800
Doing sort of a Bowie. That's

2797
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:33,800
fun. Yeah that's fun. I feel like

2798
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:35,800
I would just be hooting and

2799
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:37,800
hollering as a kid if I was like a giant

2800
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:39,800
crab or hermit crab or something.

2801
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:41,800
I'd like to see

2802
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:43,800
I'd like to see that in a Parker

2803
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:45,800
in a show where that'd be great in a phantasmac

2804
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:47,800
type situation. Better than

2805
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:49,800
Radcliffe. But I think

2806
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,800
we have now fully covered

2807
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,800
all of the phantasmics. Made sense

2808
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:55,800
to split it. Lots to talk about.

2809
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,800
You've survived podcast the ride

2810
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:59,800
all phantasmics unless

2811
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:01,800
a new one pops up. It won't.

2812
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:03,800
Disney is too cheap to build a new one.

01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:15,800
mess around with just to combine a bunch

2819
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:17,800
of things that we've been talking

2820
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,800
about.

2821
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:21,800
Do I do it as? No I don't think I could

2822
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:23,800
sing like that. Mickey

2823
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:25,800
Mouse Superstar

2824
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:27,800
How come you don't

2825
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:29,800
walk on water?

2826
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:31,800
Mickey Christ

2827
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:33,800
Mickey Christ

2828
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:35,800
Who are you? Are you the king

2829
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:37,800
of mice?

2830
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,800
That'll get me wrong

2831
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:41,800
That'll get me wrong now

2832
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:43,800
I'm Mickey Mouse

2833
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:45,800
I am Mickey Christ

2834
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:47,800
So your Mickey

2835
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:49,800
Mouse is the great Mickey

2836
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:51,800
Look we all like you it's crazy

2837
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:53,800
Bye
