1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,800
Warning, the following podcast contains terror evaders, Minnie and Daisy playing God, and

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,320
a naughty penguin getting a spanking.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,480
Scott's back from Tokyo and he's here to tell us all about it.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,480
It's Podcast the Ride.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:43,440
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, a podcast about theme parks where one of the hosts has finally

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,760
followed the compass of his heart.

9
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,560
I am Sid, compass follower, Scott Gardner joined by Mike Carlson and Jason Sheridan.

10
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,120
Hi, my name is Mike Carlson.

11
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,400
I have also followed the compass of my heart.

12
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
Followed the compass.

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,760
Jason needs to follow the compass.

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,680
I know, I haven't yet.

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,640
I got my taxes done, but I haven't followed the compass of my heart yet.

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,040
Did that direct your compass in any particular way or your compass of spending in any particular

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,040
way?

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,920
More compass of relief because I thought it was going to be real bad.

19
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,840
Are you saying compass or compass?

20
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,920
Does it matter?

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,000
I've just never heard that pronunciation before.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Compass?

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Compass?

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hmm.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What do you think?

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Is it compass?

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Crampus.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's crampus.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Are you saying compass?

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah, like compass.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Compass, yeah.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Okay.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Compass is what I mean.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,840
I guess you're right that it actually is spelled more like.

35
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
Yeah.

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,840
Compass.

37
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,840
Yours sounds like C-U-M-P-A-S.

38
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,840
Compass.

39
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,840
Compass, yeah.

40
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,840
Compass.

41
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,280
But that's always how I've heard it spelled or heard said.

42
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,840
Jason's just very fond of CompUSA.

43
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,840
Oh, rest in peace.

44
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,840
Their good values and savings.

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,840
Yeah, I'm back.

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,840
I have been to the promised land.

47
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:00,840
I have been to what I think I can say indisputably is the greatest theme park resort on the planet.

48
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,840
Yeah, I agree.

49
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,840
Incredible.

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,840
Exceeded expectations.

51
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
I haven't seen you guys yet.

52
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,840
There hasn't even been like pre-chatter or discussion.

53
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,840
I wanted to do it all on the air.

54
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,840
Keep it real.

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,840
Keep it 100.

56
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
Yep.

57
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,840
And Mike and I have done no research to prepare for today.

58
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,840
I love this.

59
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,840
I love it.

60
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
Surprised.

61
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,840
I know.

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,840
And it makes me very nervous, honestly.

63
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,840
I'm actually nervous about having to drive the thing.

64
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,840
I feel like we're always like co-driving, but realizing that this is like essentially

65
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,840
me narrating my own vacation.

66
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,840
The pressure's on.

67
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,840
I had to get properly caffeinated.

68
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,840
I'm trying to fight the massive jet lag that I have.

69
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,840
I had too big of a lunch where it's going to make me groggy, where I'm not going to

70
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,840
be able to keep the ship on course.

71
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,840
We're just fix on fly.

72
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,840
We're raw dogging it today to come along.

73
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
Oh my god.

74
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
The compass talk.

75
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,840
It's down and dirty.

76
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,840
That's insane.

77
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,840
And we're pointing the compass.

78
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
The compass.

79
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,840
You're the one talking about a navigational instrument putting the word cum in the...

80
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,840
Put cum spice on it.

81
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,840
It's even what they say.

82
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
When you see the people singing the song, they say compass.

83
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,840
I think they do.

84
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,840
It's a little...

85
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,840
In the song, and the song that I'm referring to is in the Sindbad's Storybook Voyages ride.

86
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,840
And it is like...

87
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,840
I'd only heard...

88
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,840
I still have not listened to the part of the Tokyo Disney episode that I left.

89
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,840
I need to go back now.

90
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,840
I'm sure we'll overlap some of the territory.

91
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,840
But I do...

92
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,840
I'm aware of certain things about it.

93
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,840
And I am certainly aware that you were very moved by this song.

94
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,840
Very, yes.

95
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
And I was as well.

96
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,840
And I'm on the ride going...

97
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,840
I'm like...

98
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:52,840
You immediately well up a little bit because you're introduced to a town in which everyone is supporting each other.

99
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,840
It is the sweetest thing you ever see.

100
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,840
But still, I'm not like, yeah, but what brought them to tears?

101
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,840
What could have possibly...

102
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,840
And by the end, to totally go...

103
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,840
I think by fighting it at the beginning, it caused it to happen at the end.

104
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,840
I welled up a bunch of times on this vacation in multiple places.

105
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,840
My heart is so full.

106
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,840
This will be the most earnest episode, Scott-wise.

107
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:25,840
So please, you guys, lob your joke bombs because try to sink this very earnest ship that I'm steering.

108
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,840
And you came back to what can only be described as a United Hollywood.

109
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,840
Hand in hand.

110
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,840
Agents and directors.

111
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,840
Making projects.

112
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,840
Good luck on your renegotiations.

113
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:48,840
Yeah, I discovered the news that I was to fire my agents while inside the volcano.

114
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
Oh, wow.

115
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,840
I was hoping that this news dropping would happen in a dramatic way during the vacation.

116
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,840
And it was lining up to happen.

117
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,840
I was like, maybe I'll be at the top of the Park Hyatt, the Lost in Translation bar.

118
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,840
I'll have a dramatic view of Tokyo and then I'll get this crazy Hollywood shattering news.

119
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,840
But then it got delayed a week and I was wondering what was going on.

120
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,840
And then I'm literally about to board the TeraVader.

121
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,840
And I see an even...

122
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,840
I just check and it's the most dramatically phrased headline possible.

123
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,840
Like, there is no deal.

124
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,840
Fire your agents.

125
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:39,840
So then I'm brought into a room that is like pumping machinery and sirens and alarms and excavators and like man the hatches.

126
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,840
Mass firings on three.

127
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,840
It was unforgettable.

128
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,840
Jules Berne created an agent firing machine powered by steam.

129
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,840
Can fire 15,000 agents at once.

130
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:58,840
Well, if it makes you feel any better, the most recent dispatch from the Screen Actors Guild is we have direct deposit now.

131
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,840
So lots of exciting stuff on the Hollywood labor front.

132
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:11,840
The next time my five dollars and forty three cents of collected Moonbeam City residuals show up, ten envelopes will be saved.

133
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,840
Yeah, that's great news.

134
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,840
We're helping the environment.

135
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,840
Sure.

136
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,840
Yeah, I mean...

137
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,840
So I guess we say spoilers if you don't want to know about Tokyo Disney.

138
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,840
Tokyo Disney, I suppose.

139
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,840
I have no idea how much anybody else was playing my game of not wanting to hear things.

140
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:37,840
And I, you know, since that episode, I've thought I feel like I was like too strict on it because we've since determined that like you guys felt so much you didn't need to spoil things that I didn't know about Grandma Sarah's kitchen.

141
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,840
Yes.

142
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,840
And I'm like, did I convey like too hard of a spoiler rule?

143
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
Maybe I did.

144
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:51,840
However, I'm glad that I did because constantly around every corner there were things that I had no clue about.

145
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:59,840
And I thank you guys for for helping me in that endeavor and being fine with me leaving an episode, quitting it halfway through.

146
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
Sure.

147
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:07,840
I was wondering if there was anything that we should have said, but I don't think most of the things you probably found on your own, they're big enough stuff.

148
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,840
And yeah, so you know, you you passed along this book to me that I would really recommend to anybody going.

149
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,840
The TDR Explorer.

150
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,840
Yes.

151
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,840
Tokyo, which that's a Twitter account to write the whoever runs it, I think seem to be there at the same time.

152
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,840
I was always there.

153
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
He's the Tokyo Disney Explorer.

154
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,840
I think he has a Twitter.

155
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,840
TDR Explorer blog, I believe.

156
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,840
Yeah, incredibly helpful book.

157
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,840
And I recommend finding this book.

158
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,840
I think it's available for the for the Kindle or whatever.

159
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,840
Yeah, I think so.

160
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,840
Yes.

161
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,840
And it's that TDR Explorer.

162
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:44,840
Super helpful because I there are there are logistics you have to figure out as much as I didn't want spoilers.

163
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,840
I think about Tokyo in general, there's there's a lot that you need to solve.

164
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
The trains are complicated.

165
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,840
The Wi-Fi thing you have to figure out.

166
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,840
But within the resort, there's definitely things to to determine.

167
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,840
And you know, one of which is when you go.

168
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,840
And that is if I I don't know how it was in general, crowd wise.

169
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,840
When you were you were there in like October, it was like Halloween ish September.

170
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:16,840
OK, OK. Within the window, though, where they had because you said you had our mid September Haunted Mansion holiday.

171
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,840
Yes, they have Haunted Mansion holiday.

172
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,840
They still had started Halloween already because they started early there, too.

173
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,840
But it was like second week in September, I believe.

174
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,840
Third week.

175
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,840
How was that like crowd wiser?

176
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
Crowds were bad.

177
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
Like not crazy.

178
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,840
I will say that they did seem like they had a good flow.

179
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
The crowds had good flows.

180
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,840
It wasn't like anything was like choked.

181
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
It was just there was a lot of folks.

182
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
Sure, sure.

183
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:49,840
I think you this may have been you who said it or that you feel I mean, there were a ton of people when I was there, too.

184
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,840
But you do feel the crowd dispersal is just better.

185
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:02,840
And I can't help but wonder if it does it have something to do with them not having Max Pass and the app and everything?

186
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,840
Well, the app is coming.

187
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,840
Oh, it is.

188
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
So we'll see.

189
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,840
I guess we'll see next time we go.

190
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,840
But it's possible.

191
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:15,840
But you would think, though, because they still have paper fast passes that people be running all over the place.

192
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
Sure, sure.

193
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,840
So that would also be a thing, too.

194
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,840
The only thing in terms of that, when the gates open, because I did a rope drop of Tokyo,

195
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:30,840
Disney and there is so much excitement for the park in general and clearly for the Easter season.

196
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,840
That's like they had to people were out there holding signs that say, please don't run.

197
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,840
Oh, yeah.

198
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,840
It would certainly be your temptation.

199
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,840
And as polite as the Japanese people are, I mean, I wanted to run.

200
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
Yeah.

201
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,840
When you round that, when you first see that volcano, I've seen plenty of pictures of it.

202
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,840
But when it is first in your sights, you the mania takes you over.

203
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,840
Sure.

204
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
Get me in everywhere.

205
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,840
I will stay up all day.

206
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,840
I will never sit this entire day.

207
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,840
I wonder if it's I do wonder if everyone just like more polite about walking, maybe.

208
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,840
Maybe so.

209
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,840
People also polite, apparently, about asking for the front row.

210
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:20,840
Single writer is a seemingly not super common there, which helps you blast through Indiana Jones and lost spear raging spirits.

211
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,840
Yes.

212
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,840
Is the like wild mouse type coaster.

213
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
It's a smaller roller coaster.

214
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,840
Which is fun, but like you shouldn't wait forever for it.

215
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:35,840
Before we get into your trip, I remember the one there's probably many stories I forgot to tell real quick.

216
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,840
There's a story I left out of my trip about that coaster.

217
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,840
OK, so I'm walking into the queue.

218
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:48,840
An employee runs up to me and he's trying to communicate the question.

219
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,840
How tall are you?

220
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,840
And at first I think, oh, he's like, I'm a six, three gentleman.

221
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,840
He's oh, this is fun.

222
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Look how tall he is.

223
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,840
He's like a Herman Munster or something.

224
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:10,840
And it becomes very clear that he hands me a card and it says that I'm six, three and I'm the tallest you can possibly be to ride this roller coaster.

225
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,840
Oh, and I'm like, oh, oh, shit.

226
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Like, so we're walking through the queue, Lindsay and I walking through the queue going like like an inch taller and I'd be decapitated on this thing.

227
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,840
This is insane.

228
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
I've never heard of this before.

229
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,840
So we're like walking through like, should I go on this?

230
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,840
Should I just not do this?

231
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:37,840
Because they're like because there was a whole like he was talking amongst employees like, should we let this guy go on or whatever?

232
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,840
And then they they were like, all right, it's fine.

233
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,840
And they handed me this card that said I was approved to go on it.

234
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
So I was stressed.

235
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,840
I was stressed the whole line.

236
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
There's got to be some wiggle room.

237
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
Of course.

238
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,840
But I'm just saying still, I was like, this is weird that there was even a debate.

239
00:11:53,840 --> 00:12:00,840
So I got on the ride and I'm like crouched down on the coaster is like hard as I can.

240
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
And obviously everything was fine.

241
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,840
But I do think I put myself in such an uncomfortable position.

242
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:11,840
Like I hurt my back a little bit because I was like making sure I wasn't like going to get decapitated on the ride.

243
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,840
I think really the issue was that the restraints didn't go high enough.

244
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
Oh, OK.

245
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,840
I think that's probably what it was.

246
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,840
But still, you didn't ever there wasn't some like overhand.

247
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,840
There wasn't some temple ruin that almost hit you in the brain.

248
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,840
No, but still I was like, I've never seen this before on a roller coaster that I'm too tall to go on it.

249
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,840
Like that's never happened.

250
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:39,840
I find it weird on that ride that there was a when after the cars did the loop that the loop like shook.

251
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

252
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,840
It's a little unnerving, a little unnerving.

253
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,840
A wild mouse type coaster with a loop.

254
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
I'm very intrigued.

255
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,840
Mm hmm.

256
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
It was it's it's really good.

257
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,840
You would call it like the best thing there.

258
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:59,840
Yeah, but especially you single ride it really well themed and it like fogs up right before you you shoot through a little tunnel.

259
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:05,840
And there's a big there's like ruins like step ruins kind of enticing you in.

260
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,840
It's like a pretty plain coaster, but themed a little better than usual.

261
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:15,840
But the entrance where there's a waterfall going down the steps, but it's also on fire at the same time.

262
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,840
Incredible. So cool.

263
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,840
It's just a throwaway part of that park.

264
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,840
That's like the 19th best thing in the park.

265
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,840
We didn't go on in the night, but it looks better at night, too.

266
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,840
Oh, I bet. Yeah, I didn't do enough.

267
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,840
Like I saw this in the day and at night.

268
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
We didn't either.

269
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,840
I can get into various iterations of that.

270
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:41,840
Well, to the end of the harnesses being too small, definitely think that the rides are built for smaller people.

271
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,840
Oh, yeah, it's definitely true.

272
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,840
Yeah, for sure.

273
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,840
Finally.

274
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,840
Nice.

275
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,840
A place that doesn't diminish.

276
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,840
It's shorter restraints that don't give me a headache every time I go on a looping coaster.

277
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,840
They have to hand you a form that you sign where you say you are the perfect candidate to go on this ride.

278
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,840
Are you OK being perfect?

279
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,840
Yes.

280
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,840
A blue ribbon you wear.

281
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,840
Mayor of the ride.

282
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,840
So, oh, wait, I was starting to say the time that I was there was fantastic.

283
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:20,840
It's fantastic if anyone's listening to this for general recommendations because I was there in the second week of April.

284
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:33,840
And it's fantastic because you're avoiding right at the end of April is this thing Golden Week, which is apparently everywhere in Japan is fucked apart tourism wise because they're very like institutionalized spring break.

285
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,840
So we missed all that.

286
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,840
But it's right before that.

287
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,840
So everything's still really beautiful and cherry blossoms are in bloom.

288
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,840
And that's as cool as it's hyped up to be.

289
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:51,840
Crowds were totally fine, except that I did end up there on a Saturday and Saturday markedly worse.

290
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:59,840
So I'd say anybody who can avoid the weekend if your schedule is open, avoid weekends because the difference was night and day immediately.

291
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:05,840
But boy, I really recommend when I went and especially because I was there for Easter.

292
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,840
It was the Easter celebration.

293
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,840
And holy shit.

294
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,840
I mean, I'm sure it's always great.

295
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,840
But I and I'd heard it alluded to a little the glory of Easter.

296
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:27,840
I mean, really, every Easter also affected Sanrio Puroland, which I will try to be sparing talking about because we have to just that's its own thing for sure.

297
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,840
Easter at Disney.

298
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,840
Oh, my God.

299
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,840
And I'll lay all this out mainly.

300
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,840
Do you guys know about the mythology of the the U.S.

301
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,840
Toma and the U.S.

302
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,840
No.

303
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,840
Oh, no.

304
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:48,840
But I am interested because it's Easter like the the cultural like Easter parade Easter of fancy dresses and linen suits.

305
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,840
Right.

306
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,840
Like there's no there's no element of Jesus Christ Easter.

307
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,840
Not remotely culturally in Japan.

308
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:02,840
I don't think the traditional definition of Easter is totally skewed for just eggs and fancy clothes.

309
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:14,840
But also, it's not like big gowns necessarily like their Easter clothes are just kind of like in many cases, like sparkly space clothes.

310
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,840
There are dolls of Chip and Dale where they're just wearing these complicated asks.

311
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:27,840
They've got a spire and it's like sparkly purple and sparkly silver clashing and going back and forth on every part.

312
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,840
I met Easter Dale. That was that was really exciting.

313
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,840
Oh, you post a photo of that. I think I tweeted about it.

314
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,840
I got to have a conversation about Easter.

315
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,840
I was like, well, there's a language barrier here, but I bet he's he's in his Easter clothes.

316
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,840
He must be excited about Easter. So I made bunny ears.

317
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,840
He made bunny ears in return and we hugged.

318
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,840
It's very exciting.

319
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:56,840
Easter is just it just takes what is probably already like kind of a hyper park and just ratchets it way the right up.

320
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:02,840
Like like Lindsey got me this crazy Tokyo Disney see Mickey for my birthday, which is insane.

321
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,840
But the clothes in general are already.

322
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,840
Do you remember what this looks like?

323
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,840
Yeah. Wait, spin that around if you can, Jason, without hurting anything.

324
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,840
I know kind of what you're talking about.

325
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,840
He's in this crazy like future sailor suit.

326
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,840
Yeah, it's like he's it's crazy.

327
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,840
Like the clothes already look a little bit.

328
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,840
Yeah. Like, how do you even what is even a touch point?

329
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,840
I don't think we have in our culture what kind of clothes Mickey's wearing.

330
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:30,840
Sort of like P.T. Barnum sort of get up, but all in like different shades of baby blue.

331
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,840
So a greatest showman. Yeah.

332
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,840
A little British showman, but like a twenty thirty greatest showman.

333
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,840
But with the nineteen hundreds with a tri-corner hat.

334
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,840
Yeah. Like a colonial America tri-corner hat.

335
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:48,840
The most detailed like buttons and crevasses and the the brightest baby blue.

336
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:54,840
I mean, this is like the character they dress like these weird like samurai

337
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,840
by way of a turn of the century marching band.

338
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,840
That's like not Easter even. That's their their base.

339
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,840
Right. That's just normal.

340
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,840
Like here we have right now, Mickey and everyone are in like party city style,

341
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,840
like white suits with like splashes of color.

342
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,840
I was no fan of that before. I'm really not a fan of it now.

343
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,840
I think I prefer the Japanese kind of crazy clothing,

344
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,840
not only on the characters, but also on the people in the park.

345
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,840
Like when you see people dressed up together in Disneyland,

346
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,840
there's the Disney bounding thing or there's dapper day.

347
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,840
There's the kind of the retro thing.

348
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,840
And those those are fine. And it's just it's not my bag.

349
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,840
But it's I like a way that people can dress in the spirit of of the park in Disney.

350
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840
It just seems like cooler or in Tokyo.

351
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
It just seems cooler the way people do it.

352
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,840
They were like, here's a group of ten girls and they're all dressed as ham.

353
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,840
How did they coordinate this?

354
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,840
This is insane. Ham from Toy Story or just the concept of ham?

355
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,840
No, not although that would fit right with with Easter, wouldn't it?

356
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,840
OK, yeah, yeah.

357
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,840
They're there when they all form like a transformer, they form the full.

358
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,840
Yeah, the full traditional honey.

359
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,840
Yeah, no. Or like, you know, like a bunch of the sets of two male friends

360
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,840
who dressed exactly the same.

361
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,840
Yeah. Like a little vest and button.

362
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,840
And how do they do this? How do they coordinate?

363
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,840
And it just and it all feels more like then they could go out on the streets

364
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,840
in regular Tokyo and nobody would make fun of them.

365
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,840
Like it's just all like the cool culture is embedded with Disney culture.

366
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,840
They're just one in the same.

367
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,840
Yeah, I mean, I think that's probably true.

368
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,840
I do feel like I mean, I think with Disney now it's still it's it's getting more

369
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,840
melded every day. Yeah.

370
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,840
Like we'll be there in like 30 or 50 years where it's like not even where there's no chance

371
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,840
you get beaten up by Orange County punks if you wore your dapper days outfits into the

372
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,840
Fuddruckers nearby because the punks are wearing like hashtag Disney squad shirts anyway.

373
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,840
Yeah. And a lot of them already. A lot of the punks are already wearing that.

374
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,840
So potentially we're getting closer.

375
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,840
But yes, I know they're wearing some they're wearing something with like a like fifties

376
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,840
pomp and like a fifties swoop Clara Clara Bell.

377
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,840
Yeah. A patch of Oogie Boogie saying Wop Op a Loo Bop.

378
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,840
I think I'm just relieved that there's not a lot of fifties going on in in Japan.

379
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,840
I don't know what my problem is with the fifties, except that actually, as I say that,

380
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,840
I'm totally wrong because Sanrio Puroland, their Easter celebration was fifties rock and roll was Wop

381
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,840
Op a Loo Bop. Whoa. Yeah. Like like like Rob Bob a loop.

382
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,840
It's Easter time. Why are these things? I think there is a certain streak of like because

383
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:48,840
greaser fashion is like it's a spin on like traditional menswear, which is such American

384
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,840
menswear is a big influence in Japan and vice versa.

385
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,840
Like there are catalogs.

386
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:02,840
One thing I read about like Japanese menswear, there's a book of like Ivy style,

387
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:10,840
like of the shops around like Harvard or Princeton or that sort of stuff that is very popular in Japan.

388
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,840
And then it's very popular for menswear enthusiasts in America.

389
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,840
So it's like a circular thing. Huh?

390
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,840
And then one influences the other and it changes back on the other side.

391
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,840
Yeah. Same with rock and roll.

392
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,840
The Japanese, I think we've all been listening to Japanese city pop lately.

393
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,840
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Which you know what threw me in the record stores?

394
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,840
I don't know what you call. It was hard to find stuff.

395
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,840
I don't know what they call city pop. They don't have a big section labeled city pop,

396
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,840
but they do certainly have like, you know, here's the giant progressive rock area.

397
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,840
And there's a massive area devoted to AOR, my favorite genre of music.

398
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,840
We're like some obscure thing that I don't even have one friend to talk to about this album.

399
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,840
It's like what they're featuring this week. Whoa. Yeah.

400
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
I'll constantly that the tower records and we didn't even get there.

401
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,840
Oh, we got to go. Yeah. Next time. Holy shit.

402
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,840
Because also the there's one in Shinjuku where I stayed and I'd recommend anybody going to Tokyo,

403
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,840
Shinjuku, great central area. I dug it a lot.

404
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:16,840
But then the one in Shibuya is the like crazy multi-level.

405
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,840
It's the one where when you if you watch the documentary or you hear like, boy, the end of tower.

406
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,840
And why did we reject tower? Oh, but it is in Japan in the coolest building you've ever seen,

407
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:33,840
which would fit right into tomorrow land and Disneyland, which I obviously was super enamored with.

408
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,840
Tower records, fucking rocks, everything. I mean, the city, I can't even go into the city.

409
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,840
There's so much cool shit. I was starting to head to Easter.

410
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:51,840
So for a number of years running now, Disneyland took a Disneyland has the Usatama,

411
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,840
who are a bunch of eggs with legs who have infested the park. Whoa.

412
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,840
And they are everywhere. They've made themselves at home.

413
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:04,840
And the ones in Frontierland are, you know, kicking back on top of the saloon and, you know,

414
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:10,840
and drinking some moonshine or they've disguised themselves as, you know,

415
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:18,840
the dwarves over in the by the Snow White Fountain or they're they look like Mike Wazowski

416
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,840
over in Tomorrowland or whatever. There's so many eggs.

417
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,840
You get to do like a visual Easter egg hunt while you're there.

418
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:32,840
And they've so cleverly designed all of these eggs in a very fun pop or what's the literal?

419
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,840
What am I thinking of the park? Yeah. Or the Park stars.

420
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:43,840
Yeah, it's so much like that, where it's a really minimal representation of the characters from there.

421
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:50,840
Up on top of the country bears, eggs dressed as teddy bear and Henry and what have you.

422
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:55,840
So this just adds this level of visual excitement everywhere in the parks.

423
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,840
They do a version of it in Disneyland, but it's just like kind of painted eggs and it's Chip and Dale

424
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,840
or something. And there we saw one of them recently and they're fine. Sure, sure.

425
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,840
But this is a whole seems like a whole nother level. There's this mania where there's like they're presented

426
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,840
like critters. They're like gremlins or something who've taken over the park.

427
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:20,840
They've just made it there. I got a picture of one like the lawns in front of the castle there are very golf

428
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:26,840
course manicured. So they made one look like he's putting he's got like a golf bag and a visor.

429
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,840
My favorite clothing item. Just a regular cloth visor hanging off of this egg.

430
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,840
But so how you know, they're cute and all, but we have to keep the population under control.

431
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:44,840
How do we do that? Well, with the Usatama on the run parade in which Mickey is piloting a suction machine.

432
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,840
Oh my gosh. I didn't know anything about this. Eggs to try to. That's insane.

433
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,840
That's so fun. It's a population control measure more than it is a parade.

434
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,840
I literally didn't stop and watch this parade, but just look up photos of it was the time on the run.

435
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,840
Wow. Writing a big contraption. It's been they're all helping out.

436
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,840
They've all got Mickey and Donald have their own ways of trying to find the do they have like a big thing of eggs

437
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,840
behind him like he's caught some of them caught a bunch.

438
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,840
Yeah, they're all they're all suffocating. They're all like they're all hanging like fish from hooks.

439
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,840
Wow. He made lessons of a couple of them. No, I don't know.

440
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,840
Look, they're all friends. Ultimately, at the end of the day, he just has to know where they are because it's his park.

441
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,840
Right. Can't get to Disney feral cats. They can't get out of control. Right.

442
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:37,840
Yeah. When you said they all have their own ways of taking care of it, I was concerned that like Donald was like Eli Roth and glorious bastard.

443
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,840
It's like he's the brutal was like he's like taking them out back. As soon as you said that, I went, I bet Donald has a baseball bat.

444
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,840
Yeah, that is what I thought. Then you said Eli Roth. So we were on the same page.

445
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,840
It's a walking tall scenario. Smashing your mind, bitch.

446
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,840
That's close. I can get to Donald, apparently.

447
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:06,840
But new this year, I got to be part of the inaugural audience of the first time ever Disney see equivalent of the U.S.

448
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,840
Toma, a genetic varietal called the U.S.

449
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,840
Pio. And here's what they are.

450
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:18,840
Donald, I'm sorry, Daisy and many were decorating for Easter that year.

451
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,840
And they took an egg and they painted some bunny ears on it. Cute, right?

452
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:31,840
Yes. Went a little further than that because the eggs actually sprouted ears and chickens hatched out of them.

453
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:42,840
So Daisy and many unknowingly created a genetic abomination, which are little chicks with Easter eggs and that still have their shells on their bottom and their top.

454
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:53,840
And those are the U.S. Pia and the giant lagoon show Tip Top Easter is all about you get to witness the birth of many U.S.

455
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,840
Pio's at once. Wow.

456
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:02,840
They all come out of eggs and like, do you know about this lagoon show in general?

457
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,840
Or did you see some equivalent of that?

458
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:12,840
We saw the Halloween, the villains party with like waters like like ski do's and there were that.

459
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,840
Okay. And then.

460
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,840
Flying kites off of the back of jet skis.

461
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:21,840
There was that they all the villains had their own like vehicle in the water.

462
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,840
So each each villain had their own special big giant thing that they were out on.

463
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,840
And then shit. Yeah.

464
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,840
And there's a crazy original song and Hades does a rap in it.

465
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,840
Whoa. What? Yeah.

466
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:42,840
Apparently at last year's Easter, Andrew Grissom told us they there was a rap done by Max Goof.

467
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,840
He's on. But there was a whole new show this year.

468
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,840
They revamp them every year. Yeah.

469
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,840
You can go by CDs of just the single songs that are 15 minutes long.

470
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,840
They sell CD singles of just the Easter music or probably just the Halloween music.

471
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,840
I got the three disc like kind of best of from that year, but I should have bought more.

472
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:09,840
Like there's a 10 to 15 disc thing that's on eBay for five hundred dollars of the history of the music of the park.

473
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,840
And I was just showing a picture of it to people in the park going like, do you have this?

474
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,840
And then they would be like, they were so helpful, but no one knew what I was talking about.

475
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,840
So I would have had to have bought like all of the CDs because it's not on there.

476
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,840
And that's one of the big reasons.

477
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,840
I remember you had something up with the CD and I was looking and I didn't seem to be anything, which that be the first thing you'd want to walk away with.

478
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,840
Yes, for sure. And I I've had to rip it off of YouTube.

479
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,840
Do you have it on your iPhone?

480
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,840
It's it should be on my iPhone. It's on my computer for sure.

481
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,840
I think it's probably transferred over. I listen to that song like once a week at least.

482
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,840
I mean, we've been singing it ever since.

483
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,840
And the main I mean, I I'll say this now.

484
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,840
The this was a hard vacation to leave.

485
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,840
We love if we hadn't even done Disney to Tokyo and Kyoto are such fantastic cities.

486
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,840
We're very sad to be the saddest I've been to leave a vacation since I was at Disney World when I was seven.

487
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:15,840
And one little trick that we did to make us more excited about coming back was going through the airport, passing by the customs agents,

488
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:24,840
imagining that they were puppet dolls singing a majestic song, wishing us luck on our journey back to America.

489
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:34,840
And we did the same thing to our cats when we went to retrieve them from Chatsworth, where they were staying while we were gone.

490
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,840
We were wishing them good luck on their journey back from Chatsworth.

491
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,840
And there are cats names are Brenda and Bunny and we called them Bryn Bad and Bundu.

492
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,840
And it really helps.

493
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,840
So any difficult challenge you have in your life, imagine anyone near you.

494
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,840
Don't forget that. Imagining people are naked or in their underwear.

495
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,840
Imagine anyone is a puppet doll wishing you luck on your journey.

496
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,840
It's going to help you through any challenge.

497
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:11,840
So but just to sum up from earlier, this year's Easter show, which probably won't be back next year, involves Minnie and Daisy playing God.

498
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,840
Yes. And creating life, a new form of horrifying life.

499
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,840
It is a tale of genetic engineering gone. Adorable.

500
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,840
It works out to their advantage.

501
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:27,840
Well, while you were gone, I watched Gattaca and was under Gattaca.

502
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,840
Not at all. I also thought I had never I knew very little about that movie.

503
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:37,840
And but I saw the poster and like box art for years and I was like, this is a sci fi action movie.

504
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:47,840
No, this is a like off Broadway sci fi melodrama that involves a lot of smuggling urine and blood samples.

505
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:59,840
I haven't seen in a long time. I think it was a cooler was it just there was a lot of interesting like brutalism architecture choices and a lot of interesting coloring choices.

506
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:08,840
Yeah, but it is really like Arthur Miller play almost of like not a lot of big set pieces and stuff.

507
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:18,840
Well, you know, as we allow our most beloved franchise is to sort of take surprising forms like our Joaquin Phoenix jokers or whatever.

508
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:23,840
I would gladly watch the gritty Gattaca style film about the birth of the the Uso Pio.

509
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,840
Oh, yeah. Oh, sure. Great. Yeah. Yeah.

510
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,840
They don't sell Uso Pio merch, though. They do. And it's they do. It's tough.

511
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,840
And I, you know, we have so there's we have friends with babies and stuff.

512
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:41,840
And and I was trying to find Uso Pio puppets. It's tough. They apparent.

513
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,840
I think they go in. I was finding sites. I think they also have these in Hong Kong.

514
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,840
And it's like there are two left in the entire nation. Yeah, they go like that.

515
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,840
Like a new Duffy outfit or something. Yep. Yep. Flies off the shelf.

516
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,840
I certainly I I definitely get Duffy more now.

517
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,840
I will say that especially when I saw Duffy while waiting for the Tip Top Easter show,

518
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,840
I saw a Duffy dressed as an aristocrat.

519
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,840
This was the most adorable thing. Yeah.

520
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,840
Did you see anyone pushing two strollers around full of Duffy characters?

521
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:24,840
I definitely saw. I mean, not that, but I saw people like having meals across from their Duffy.

522
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:29,840
Yep. Yep. And I like that there were little seats that you put the Duffy on to take a photo.

523
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,840
Like in the volcano, you like lean down a little. Oh, yeah.

524
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,840
Seats and like here's the perfect spot for them to have their photo taken.

525
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:47,840
And in the in this multi barge lagoon show, there's you can there's many vantage points from which you can watch it.

526
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,840
And you could watch it over in Donald Daisy territory or Mickey Minnie territory.

527
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,840
You don't know what's coming until they land.

528
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:00,840
And ours was the Duffy gang. So while I didn't meet Duffy or watch a separate Duffy show,

529
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:06,840
I did get to see Duffy. Can I name them now? Duffy, Jelatoni.

530
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:11,840
Maybe I can't. But I'm certainly more fond of Jelatoni than I used to be.

531
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
Oh, my God. He's the best. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

532
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,840
No, it's not. Yeah. Jelatoni is one of my guys. Yeah.

533
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,840
There's a well, Shelly May, Stella Lu.

534
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:26,840
And who's the Bird Mailman? Who's the Hong Kong one that our wonderful listeners sent us?

535
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:31,840
Merchandise from Hong Kong of Cookie of Cookie. OK.

536
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,840
Well, we should tell the listeners there's a there's a lot of Duffy coming from podcast to ride.

537
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,840
Oh, yes. Things have not even aware of what you guys did while I was gone.

538
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:46,840
We recorded an interview already for part of the Big Duffy episode coming up and we'll be doing the full version soon.

539
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,840
Only a fraction of it has been completed. Yeah.

540
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:56,840
It's a big project. Sure. It's a little more like a it's a little more like a serial or like a slow burn.

541
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,840
Right. This one's going to be a little bit more of an excavation.

542
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:10,840
I will be certainly more mentally invested in the episode now, having seen the gang and having seen Duffy and his pals teach the hatched egg creatures ballet and magic.

543
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,840
Oh, wow. What ends up they hatch and then they teach them about Easter.

544
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:20,840
Some ballet dancers show them and then say, now you go and they they you know, they don't even know how to walk, let alone do ballet.

545
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,840
But they try their best. It's very adorable. Is Stella Lu a ballet dancer?

546
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,840
Was one of them? I don't recall. She has like a yeah, she has like a tutu.

547
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:33,840
She may have taken lead in that section. Here's the number one thing that happens in that show, though.

548
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:42,840
At one point, something is yelled and everybody points over to the volcano and the volcano itself yells,

549
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,840
Happy Easter. Whoa. Yeah.

550
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,840
What? Shoot something out to or does it?

551
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:55,840
There might be like, you know, I mean, nothing special, nothing besides its usual eruptions, the coolest shit ever.

552
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:01,840
Now we were discussing later. Is that supposed to be a spoiler?

553
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:07,840
The monster inside the ride wishing Happy Easter. Oh, or is it the volcano itself?

554
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:13,840
I prefer to think that the landmark, the volcano loves Easter. Right.

555
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:19,840
Like the lava short from Pixar. Oh, yeah. That guy saying, oh, maybe.

556
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:25,840
Absolutely. Short I love and I've talked in the past that people were way too mean to those volcanoes.

557
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,840
People vary. People do not like shaming those volcanoes.

558
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:39,840
Well, I think also they were saying because because they're saying like the the lava volcano is like a like a chunky guy and the woman volcano was like sexy girl.

559
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:45,840
And that's a trope like where it's, you know, people were that's sexualizing the volcanoes.

560
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:53,840
That's odd. Why? But I have been like, but for instance, like with cartoons where it's like, for instance, Heathcliff,

561
00:35:53,840 --> 00:36:02,840
when the Cadillac Cats riffraff is like short and stout and looks like a cartoon, but then his girlfriend is as the body of a sexy woman.

562
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:07,840
What's wrong with that, Michael? I'm just saying that's something that people talk about.

563
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:13,840
You know, like I think Kevin James and Bugs Bunny doesn't jack like a human man.

564
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:22,840
But Lola Bunny sure looks like a sexy lady. That's that's the that's like comedians getting with people like Kevin James on a sitcom.

565
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:29,840
Yeah. Is there some comments on Facebook or somewhere said like our girlfriends and wives are too attractive for us?

566
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:36,840
Must be a California thing. Yeah. Whoa. That's funny. All right.

567
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,840
Thanks for giving us credit.

568
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:47,840
Okay. So I've so I've said that the I think that the time of year that I went was was perfect.

569
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:53,840
Yeah. But there is an outstanding question. The outstanding question is how long how long were you there? Did I go for?

570
00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:01,840
Let me reach into my duffel bag and hang on. Will you have like just a number like a big plastic number?

571
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,840
Will you have like just a number like a big plastic number?

572
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:11,840
We'll pull out now and reveal to you gentlemen my four day magic.

573
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,840
That's what I thought we should have. We should have asked.

574
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,840
Jason always wins.

575
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:22,840
Because what people were we ran into some listeners who were asking about this.

576
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,840
Some listeners were asking about how long you were there. People asked.

577
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,840
Well, yes. We didn't know.

578
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:37,840
But then they said, which I was thinking there because the reason we think is because Tony said for Tony really pushed it over the only

579
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,840
back to our life episode.

580
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,840
Tony got me on Splash Mountain and and Tony.

581
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:49,840
No, I don't know. I well, hey, your enthusiasm from being there doesn't doesn't do nothing either.

582
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,840
You clearly you clearly had a great time and clearly.

583
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,840
And you know, so you deserve some credit, too.

584
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,840
And now here's here's the caveats. It was a four day passport.

585
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,840
Two of those were half days. Right.

586
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:11,840
I got so, you know, a first evening in Disneyland, two front to back days and then a little in the morning before before we went off to the airport.

587
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:15,840
So you kind of did what we did because we really did like three and a half days.

588
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,840
OK. Yeah. So it's ended up being three all told. Right.

589
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:29,840
Now, so is the revealing of this four day passport me eating crow in a way, in a way, a delicacy in Japan.

590
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,840
So many good crow places in the parks.

591
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,840
So I could grow. I I will say this.

592
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,840
I I will maintain.

593
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:45,840
I think that four front to back opening to closing rope drop days would be overkill.

594
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,840
I don't think you need that much time.

595
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,840
That is, I I'm still going to hold by that.

596
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,840
I don't know how you feel about that.

597
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,840
He hasn't been. Yeah, I haven't been there.

598
00:38:54,840 --> 00:39:00,840
How much time did you because you were not staying at an official Disney hotel.

599
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,840
Did you spend much time at all at the official Disney hotels?

600
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,840
I you know, I didn't. And I'm usually somebody I like exploring hotels.

601
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,840
I definitely I've said before, I carve out hotel time when I go to Disney World.

602
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:16,840
Yeah, I didn't really partially because those hotels seem really neat and one of them is right next to Disney Sea.

603
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,840
Yeah. But the parts are so great.

604
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,840
I don't want to spend time in a hotel.

605
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:28,840
There was even I ran around the mall, expiry, and I tweeted something about the upcoming expiry affair.

606
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,840
And I thought about spending more time.

607
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,840
That's sort of their downtown Disney, although it's removed.

608
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,840
It's not like right next to the parks.

609
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:40,840
But I kind of thought I'm going to want to spend a bunch of time there in the silly mall next to I didn't really.

610
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,840
The parks are so great.

611
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,840
I had no desire to be in the other places.

612
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,840
The other thing that kept me out of the hotels was they're all kind of recent.

613
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:54,840
So what I'm after where I'm going to see some like solid nineteen seventy one architecture out of the contemporary

614
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:59,840
or, you know, the there's 80s throwbacks and some of those other places.

615
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,840
I was like, if they're all built in 2003, then who cares?

616
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,840
Really? I did. I stayed at the Hilton.

617
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,840
You were at the Sheraton, correct? Yes.

618
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,840
I was at the Hilton.

619
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,840
All these hotels are an easy monorail stop.

620
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:16,840
Boy, one thing I'll say, the transit so easy.

621
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,840
In general. Yeah.

622
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,840
You're waiting no time. It's a loop.

623
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,840
There's only four stops.

624
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,840
There's all the non not the main hotels.

625
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:29,840
There's Disneyland, there's Disney Sea, there's Xperia in the main train station that gets you in and out from Tokyo.

626
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:38,840
I don't see any reason to stay in the Disney ones because you're so close to the it's not like in Paris,

627
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,840
all the hotels were so fucking expensive, the main Disney ones.

628
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:48,840
So we boarded a rickety bus to Radisson that was only 10 minutes away.

629
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,840
But the ride back and forth was so shitty.

630
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,840
It made us not want to go in for the day.

631
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:58,840
Just tear like this awful shuttle where you're standing and bumping around.

632
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,840
Here you get to board the cleanest monorail.

633
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:08,840
I in general think that this initial two day arguments now here, I will say this two days, not enough.

634
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,840
I was certainly wrong about that.

635
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:17,840
I'm man enough to say it sounds like because Jason had always said for it sounds like I was absolutely right.

636
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:22,840
Before I went with the three days, it sounds like I'll give it to you.

637
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,840
I don't give it to you on everything.

638
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,840
I'm giving it to you on this.

639
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,840
You were right.

640
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,840
You called it.

641
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,840
I appreciate that.

642
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:33,840
Also, I think I was thinking about the whole situation again.

643
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,840
I don't know that I was like mad that people were going if it was too.

644
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:42,840
I think I said we should do three with our level of I think that's all I was ever saying.

645
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,840
This is a good point.

646
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,840
For some people, for some people, one day is fine.

647
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,840
I don't know.

648
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,840
I get why people would just do see this friends of ours.

649
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,840
You're like I didn't do to get Disneyland because it's the same as the one here.

650
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,840
Now, for me, a big fan of all this stuff, it certainly isn't.

651
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:08,840
But in all these micro ways, you're like, well, Space Mountain is a ramp and not the you know, it's a ramp from the front like the way it used to be in Disneyland.

652
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,840
So you got to see that.

653
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,840
And it's kind of the Haunted Mansion from Florida.

654
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,840
But it's different in this way.

655
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,840
Yes, like we're finding all these micro differences.

656
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,840
So of course you need more time.

657
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,840
Yeah, we talked about that on my episode.

658
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,840
It was like, which one is this going to be?

659
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:28,840
Yeah, like that was a wonderful mix of a lot of Magic Kingdom, which is great because Magic Kingdom perfected a lot of Disneyland stuff.

660
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,840
And then in other cases, totally original to them.

661
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,840
And in other cases, a little bit of a tribute to the original.

662
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:40,840
It's like it's the better Pirates and Space Mountain because it's Disneyland.

663
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,840
But then it is Florida Haunted Mansion, which I don't know is better, but is interesting.

664
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,840
And then nice to do.

665
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,840
I'm not like super familiar with that one.

666
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:53,840
So getting to do, you know, the library is part of the ride or her bag is part of the ride.

667
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,840
And then I got what the coolest thing was, it was Haunted Mansion holiday.

668
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,840
So I got to see the Florida version of Haunted Mansion, which doesn't exist.

669
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,840
Disneyland overlay.

670
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,840
Yes, which is very cool.

671
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,840
All right.

672
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,840
So yes, that's for nerds.

673
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:14,840
So yeah, if you're even slightly a nerd, you definitely need a little more time because Disneyland is going to take you a little more time.

674
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,840
Yes.

675
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,840
You know, if you're listening to this podcast, you were a nerd for this stuff, presumably.

676
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:27,840
But I would tell anybody, even if you can't even stand theme parks, Disney Sea is this other beast of thing.

677
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:33,840
It's almost like it's the closest that Disney's come to like a public works beautification project.

678
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,840
It's like something the city needed.

679
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:41,840
It is so they like made they made Tokyo better with Disney Sea.

680
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,840
It's unbelievable.

681
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:48,840
A city already chock full of substance and culture and a million subcultures.

682
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:53,840
The greatest I could I could talk for two hours about talking about Disney in terms of Tokyo.

683
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,840
Tokyo fucking rules.

684
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:00,840
And they somehow it's such a testament to Disney Sea that it's right.

685
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,840
Right. It was the last thing I did, essentially.

686
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,840
And it's like all I've thought about since even though Tokyo is the best place I've ever been.

687
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,840
Right.

688
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:22,840
It's a masterpiece in design every which way, because I'm trying to think of any other theme park I've been in like that where I think I said it before, where it's like everywhere you're standing, it feels like it was perfectly designed to be the most beautiful scene you've ever seen.

689
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:28,840
As if they like as if in every single spot as if they did like a Google Street view.

690
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,840
All right. Now go five feet over here and look every way around you.

691
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,840
And if there's anything cluttering your view, it's out.

692
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,840
Yeah.

693
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,840
Every square inch made the most beautiful place.

694
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,840
Isn't it wild that open the same year as California Adventure?

695
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,840
Yes. It's you know, I've actually been I think I've been saying the wrong date.

696
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,840
I think I've been saying 2002 on the show for a while.

697
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,840
It was literally the same year, six months after California Adventure.

698
00:44:51,840 --> 00:45:09,840
And we get the soap opera Bistro and they get the this beautiful Mediterranean Harbor and they get like the you know this thing that like wildly over invents the Autopia or the motorboat cruise or totally original mythologies.

699
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:15,840
And and if you I also think I think you could have an incredible day at Disney Sea and never go on a ride.

700
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,840
Yes, that's for sure.

701
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,840
Yeah.

702
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,840
And maybe you did find this.

703
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:25,840
The one criticism I would hit with Disney Sea is maybe it's missing like one or two e-ticket rides.

704
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,840
But I can see that.

705
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,840
But but also just being there is the ride.

706
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,840
Yeah, absolutely.

707
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,840
Well, and now they're there.

708
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,840
It's absolutely mind blowing that they're adding soren.

709
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:46,840
They're adding I don't know what's going on ride wise, but they're adding frozen tangled and Peter Pan and another new Peter Pan thing that is not the main Peter Pan's flight ride.

710
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:57,840
Right. And has to be like I think Tony Baxter, I was listening to some old season pass interview with him on the season pass podcast, which you should go back and I listen to those like every six months, I think I listen to him on the flight.

711
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,840
Yeah.

712
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,840
Barnes, thanks for the interviews.

713
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:06,840
Yeah. So I think he was talking about like they were years ago going like what if we did like a crazy ticket Peter Pan.

714
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:14,840
So like a full scope Peter Pan with like the I guess probably like a Cars Land scope maybe.

715
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,840
I don't know.

716
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,840
You didn't say that specifically, but aren't they also getting the Beauty and the Beast?

717
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,840
Yes, that's coming to animatronics Disneyland.

718
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,840
That's going in.

719
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,840
Oh, yeah.

720
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:30,840
OK, as is a big hero six thing, which is not like a crazy ticket thing, but it's sort of like Luigi's Rolican Roadsters.

721
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,840
It's one of them.

722
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,840
I like those kind of attractions.

723
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,840
It looks really fun.

724
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,840
And something else.

725
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,840
I forget what.

726
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,840
But these parks are going to be unstoppable.

727
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,840
Yeah.

728
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,840
There's so much shit.

729
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:47,840
My like, yeah, the only criticism I could say was like, oh, be nice to have like two more giant rides.

730
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,840
You got to go on.

731
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,840
And then it's like, oh, well, in two years, I'll have that.

732
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,840
Yeah.

733
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,840
Like, I guess are three, two or three.

734
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,840
They're way ahead of you.

735
00:46:54,840 --> 00:47:02,840
How cool is it also to think of going backwards and Disney not saying, well, we already have a ride of this.

736
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,840
Thinking, well, yeah, we have a ride.

737
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,840
But why don't we do a crazy ride of it?

738
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,840
Yeah.

739
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,840
Which is sort of what Star Wars is in general.

740
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,840
There is a Star Wars ride.

741
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,840
We've had it since the 80s.

742
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,840
But hey, what if we did a shitload more?

743
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,840
It's a pretty exciting area to think about.

744
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:24,840
Well, there's already I mean, it wouldn't be Mr. Toad, although certainly I'd love a car's size of Mr. Toad.

745
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,840
That would be the greatest.

746
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,840
But it's a little like they did.

747
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:31,840
I mean, I guess you could argue the Snow White minecart is a little bit.

748
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,840
Absolutely.

749
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:33,840
I don't know.

750
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,840
It leaves something to be desired, but it's very cool.

751
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,840
It's a very cool ride.

752
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,840
So they've they've dabbled in that.

753
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:45,840
I mean, they have a little luxury, a little bit more autonomy and freedom with the Oriental Land Company.

754
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,840
The company running it pays.

755
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:59,840
I don't know if the term legal term is licensing, but, you know, there is another company helping run Tokyo Disney that operates a little independently from this.

756
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,840
Uses Disney Imagineering.

757
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:06,840
Yeah, kind of does their own thing and I believe is partially funded by the Japanese government as well.

758
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:12,840
You can definitely feel just the infinite pockets of that place.

759
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,840
Yeah. And like what I can only imagine being an Imagineer.

760
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:23,840
I bet like in the way that Tony Baxter speaks very fondly of the Eisner era because they're like, right when he got there.

761
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:28,840
Oh, my God, I can do I have like endless resource to build whatever I want.

762
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:32,840
I bet only second to that as an Imagineer was you're getting put on Disney.

763
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:36,840
See, and there's no restrictions are on you.

764
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,840
Yeah, are off that.

765
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:43,840
Yeah, because like just those videos of that Beauty and the Beast ride they're opening, you're like, oh, this is going to be incredible.

766
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,840
And it does. Yeah, it does.

767
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:51,840
Feels it just feels like they know when running that park that like we everything has to hit this level of good.

768
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,840
Like we can't do something shitty and nothing looks shitty.

769
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,840
That's coming. So not in the least.

770
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,840
Yeah, they aren't cheaping it out.

771
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:01,840
The only this is really we shouldn't get too sidetracked.

772
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:07,840
There was that rumor that they were going to build a third park over there called Disney Sky, which I was so excited about.

773
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,840
What does that mean?

774
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,840
And then it's and then it was a rumor and it's not true.

775
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,840
They were just going to expand.

776
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,840
But maybe that was in the pipeline at some point, which also I didn't understand.

777
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:21,840
And I maybe I said this on the show on my Tokyo, our Tokyo episode that I really didn't understand.

778
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:28,840
Tokyo Disney Sea was because Disneyland and then see, I didn't get that until we were there, I think.

779
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:33,840
Yeah. Oh, and Disney. Oh, land, land, sea, sky, sky.

780
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,840
So satisfying. It's so satisfying when I've explained it to people.

781
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,840
Oh, my God. It's land and sea. That's so clever.

782
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,840
Right. It's and I was like, oh, my very cynical people have been like, oh, I love that.

783
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:46,840
That's so cool. And these on Tokyo Bay like has a practical reason.

784
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:51,840
Yeah, man, there are views where especially the probably the prettiest zone.

785
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:58,840
Well, there's the ship is amazing to be on the New York area, but also the area with the aquatopia.

786
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:04,840
If you're on the if you're waiting for the train that takes you to the New York area, actually that whole train ride,

787
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:11,840
you have like all of the water internally in the park and they have arranged the views to where it looks like an infinity pool.

788
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:16,840
And it just goes and goes forever, even though there's a monorail and a service road back there.

789
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:21,840
There is no it does not connect to the literal ocean, but it looks like it does.

790
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,840
And that's where it feels like it is a beautification project for the city.

791
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:29,840
Long Beach could have had this. Yes. And I mean, whatever.

792
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:36,840
I mean, I like what we end up ended up with. But the chili is yes, that's the ultimate beautification.

793
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:47,840
Outlet Mall empty on Black Friday, a dome where an old insane man's plane used to be and now Carnival Cruise Line boarding and luggage is happening.

794
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:56,840
It's absolutely insane. And what was the hell was I heading for?

795
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,840
It's it's it's just jaw dropping.

796
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:09,840
And well, here's the other thing I could say about why I was incorrect about two days and what I can see now.

797
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:19,840
If you were entirely about getting the rides done, if like if like we're going to do the park, we're going to finish this park,

798
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:24,840
then you were going to war in that way. For sure, you could do it in two days.

799
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,840
You could maybe do it in less. I don't know.

800
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:38,840
What I forgot was all the other dimensions of the theme park experience that I never do that in my two rides and wine style of visiting now,

801
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:42,840
which I cherish very much, but it is a different thing over there.

802
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:47,840
And there's all of the other stuff that I never do in theme parks.

803
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,840
And let me go through these really fast.

804
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:56,840
I just a couple areas. And then I haven't said, by the way, from the name of the episode, what we're going to end up doing to keep me on track.

805
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,840
So I don't just ramble forever and ever.

806
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:05,840
I have isolated what I consider the top 10 rides in Tokyo, not just the Disney resorts, but everywhere else.

807
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,840
And I am calling it rides, but they're not all rights.

808
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,840
I think what I know to are all rights.

809
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:17,840
I would also like to hear a little about your trip itinerary in general, how you thought about planning it and that sort of thing.

810
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,840
Sure. I can go into that.

811
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:30,840
I like what I did. As I said, the time of year that I went, I think we ended up with five nights Tokyo, two nights Kyoto, three nights Disney.

812
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:35,840
I would probably, you know what? I wouldn't even take it away from Disney. I'd just add to Kyoto.

813
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:41,840
Kyoto is incredible. It would be boring for me to explain it, but oh my God, go to Kyoto, holy shit.

814
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:53,840
And especially if you can find we were on our way to a bamboo forest that we didn't end up going to, but we stumbled into a park where you can visit monkeys.

815
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:57,840
There is a hill that you can climb and the top of it is covered in monkeys.

816
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:04,840
And we thought about having a whole like half day to our trip to go to wherever it is where you can see monkeys bathing in hot springs.

817
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:08,840
But some people told me that that is a little sad.

818
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,840
Somebody went and said it was a bit of a bummer for some reason.

819
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:19,840
And that kind of turned me off. Macaques are the type of monkeys, the like red faced monkeys that are primarily in Japan, I think.

820
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:23,840
But this gave me the taste of monkeys that I wanted.

821
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:28,840
And you're climbing a hill and you're wondering what the hell is this?

822
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:34,840
And you're seeing like really confusing warning signs that's like, OK, if you see this face, the monkey is scared.

823
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,840
And if you see this face, the monkey is angry and you're like, those look like the same face.

824
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,840
I don't know what you're telling me. And then we climb.

825
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:45,840
And it's so steep. It is so much walking and people are coming down and saying, oh, good luck.

826
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,840
And what are we? Oh, no. What are we heading for?

827
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,840
We get up to the top. Huh. I wonder if we're close to the monkeys.

828
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,840
Like big old monkey fight breaks out, spills down the hill.

829
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:03,840
And we just like back up like I'm as cowardly looking as I could possibly be.

830
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,840
We think about just turning around. All right, we'll just eat shit on that monkey money.

831
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:12,840
We won't see any monkeys. But we were brave and we got to monkey summit.

832
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:17,840
And there's there were no other fights. We just happened to see the one that happened.

833
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:26,840
But it is this incredible city view that you were ignoring because there were 80 monkeys around just walking all around you and getting up on the binoculars.

834
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:30,840
And like playing with them and turning them of all varieties.

835
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:39,840
A wise old monkey, a cute baby monkey. It's one of the best things I've ever done with golden sunlight just drenching down from the top.

836
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:44,840
So go to go to Monkey Mountain. That's not the name of it, but it's certainly what I'm calling it.

837
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,840
Conquer Monkey Mountain and go to Kyoto in general.

838
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:54,840
So I would do more Kyoto now and maybe a little less Disney, but maybe not.

839
00:54:54,840 --> 00:55:00,840
The one other thing I can say took a bullet train from Tokyo to Kyoto.

840
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:07,840
The bullet train was going so fast and I'm looking at a map and I'm seeing it quickly were plowing through these cities.

841
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:15,840
And I thought, you know, at this rate, we would be at Osaka in 15 minutes. Oh, and my wheels are spinning.

842
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:22,840
And I think, well, we're cramming a lot of theme parks into this trip because there's things I haven't even mentioned yet that I did.

843
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:29,840
And I'm like, you know what? Now that I know the speed of this thing, maybe I need to go to Universal Studios Japan.

844
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:35,840
I get I tell Aaron what the bit my wheels are spinning. She rolls her eyes, but it's like, you're right.

845
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:39,840
No, you're right. Yep. Yep. Yeah. All right. Maybe you're right. Maybe you're right.

846
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:43,840
I'm thinking of everything. I asked Justin Michael the time zones hooked up.

847
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,840
I was like, would this be crazy? I don't know. I don't think it'd be crazy. It'd be pretty cool.

848
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:56,840
Jaws and and then I looked at the refurbishment schedule. T2 was down. Oh, and that was enough to break the tie for me because that's like the main thing.

849
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:03,840
I like Jaws. I like back draft. I like everything else they have. But seeing T2 and we just recorded an episode of that T2.

850
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:08,840
It was up. Yeah. Would have been really it was the first day it was closed. Yeah. I missed it by one day.

851
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:16,840
Well, there was a crazy and I'm regretting this now is that when we were there, there was a crazy Halloween thing going on like a weird haunt.

852
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:23,840
You know, like I there whatever their horror nights is. And it was like you have to know Japanese to do it, which we couldn't do it.

853
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:36,840
I was like, could we still do it, though? Well, in the summer, they have like a full on like anime like theming like re theming some rides, anime pop ups like.

854
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:44,840
And it's like for some of the months it's like Lupin and I forget.

855
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:51,840
I think it is Detective Conan in some languages and then other times it's Attack on Titan.

856
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:59,840
And so like it changes. They change it up. They do like this thing lasts a few months, but then halfway through, it changes again.

857
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:11,840
Like so it's a whole like short run sort of thing. Maybe this is that you this is still an area that either might be my being the first person to to go to Universal.

858
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:15,840
I thought like how proud would I be to surprise you guys? Yeah, that would be great.

859
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:22,840
That would take a photo under their city walk. King Kong and their Spider-Man photo op where he's like hanging it down.

860
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,840
I mean, I feel like you got to go because they have Spider-Man 2.

861
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:35,840
Yeah, if you can if you can make sure nothing's closed, they also don't have whatever the crazy I think it's called Space Fantasy, whatever replaced E.T., which I hate, obviously.

862
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:45,840
But whatever that is looks cool. But that was down to so I think next year if you see your thing after Nintendo opens.

863
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,840
Yeah, yeah, I can see why.

864
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:56,840
I mean, I want to go take your son have a nice three of you or just the two of you say three is fun.

865
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:06,840
Three is a fun. There are no one has any qualms about three. Yeah, I really am interested by Japanese baseball culture.

866
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:10,840
So I would want to take in either a game or yes, yes, Tokyo Dome.

867
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:14,840
I'll say I did go to Tokyo Dome City. We texted about that a little bit.

868
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,840
And it was during a baseball game and I thought, do I do it?

869
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:23,840
And then I turned around and I saw the line. It's one of the craziest lines I've ever seen for anything in my life.

870
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,840
So I did not see it. It's supposed to be very intense.

871
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:30,840
I think if you do it, book a baseball game six months in advance.

872
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:35,840
Oh, yeah, for sure. They even have standing room, which sounds like a nightmare.

873
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,840
And I read Yelp review. It was like it is a nightmare.

874
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:43,840
So do it with some foresight. Yeah, maybe you got to go.

875
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,840
Everybody's got to go. If you're listening, you got to go.

876
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,840
Everyone find a way to go. It's so fucking great.

877
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:57,840
So I was on my way to the non ride things that are why you need to go, which are in a couple categories for me.

878
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:01,840
Characters. I don't meet the characters I never do.

879
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:05,840
Only in the rare rare occasion am I like, oh, let's get a picture with many.

880
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:14,840
You have no choice. You got to meet characters, especially when you walk into the really before their main street world.

881
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:19,840
Bizarre starts. If you just the courtyard at the front of Tokyo Disneyland,

882
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:26,840
every once in a while there's just this explosion of characters unrelated, just 12 of them run out.

883
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:32,840
And do you do people just get up in a line? No, they cluster around the characters

884
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:37,840
who somehow manage to keep track of who was the last to walk up to them.

885
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:44,840
It is like seeing a celebrity get mobbed by autographs and they like make time for everybody.

886
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:49,840
It's crazy. I don't think I saw that happen. That's I mean, there's lineups too.

887
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:55,840
You wait 90 minutes to meet Duffy or whatever. But these little like character street parties,

888
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:01,840
I was thinking how so many advertisements for Disney parks over the years have been here's,

889
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:07,840
you know, like you're partying in the streets with Mickey and Donald and you then you get there

890
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:12,840
and it's as formal and functional as it could be. This really felt like I'm at a street party

891
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:18,840
and I don't know who I'm going to turn around and see. I had a great time with the following characters.

892
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:26,840
Easter Dale, as I said, the gray aristocat, Captain Hook and one of the three little pigs.

893
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:30,840
I have photos that I will cherish and really good times with all of those characters.

894
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:35,840
Do I care about any of them? No, I don't like the I don't know which one.

895
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,840
I do boy chip and they're pushing Chip and Dale really hard right now.

896
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,840
They're pushing rescue Rangers really hard right now. Yeah.

897
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,840
Japan and it was exciting to see and I bought a gadget and it's great.

898
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:53,840
But like these who cares characters were so much fun.

899
01:00:53,840 --> 01:01:02,840
The gray aristocat like grabbed two girls from the crowd and like kind of like like put his hands up to his head

900
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:08,840
and like spun around like he's they're driving him crazy and he grabbed the girls and walked away with them.

901
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:13,840
Like you're coming with me and then he backed up to Aaron and added her to the mix too.

902
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:21,840
So I lost Aaron to an aristocat and then and lots of little things like they're pointing at people's toys

903
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:27,840
and a girl walked up and had the gray aristocat on her bag and he was like, yeah, there we go.

904
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:32,840
And then he pointed at a different one that was not him and went no boo. Get out of here.

905
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:37,840
And then back to him and the character bits are just a blast.

906
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:47,840
Aaron got to meet Susie and Perla the Cinderella mice who we've had sensed that they have an odd amount of presence in Tokyo Disneyland.

907
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:52,840
I wonder if we'll get to meet them. We were literally the line was cut off.

908
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:58,840
We did not. We couldn't meet them, but they saw Aaron losing her shit and they came up to her on the way out.

909
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:03,840
Both hugger. She said, you're my favorite. They keep so much they like did.

910
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:07,840
I'm not worthy to her like Wayne and Garth. Wow. Magic.

911
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:11,840
All of the character performers are incredible.

912
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:16,840
A pure land, too. It's just like the it's it feels like an elevated art.

913
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:21,840
It's more like mime or something like these people are so good not to insult anybody.

914
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:27,840
There's great characters in in the US parks, but holy shit characters.

915
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:31,840
Characters bathrooms. Oh, yeah.

916
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:35,840
We just released our tangled bathroom episode. Mike, you were talking up Tokyo bathrooms.

917
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:38,840
Absolutely right. Oh, my God.

918
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:42,840
The love, the degree of cleanliness, the seat warming, the options.

919
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:51,840
If you need a little extra cleanliness help while you're in there, the parks are crawling with children.

920
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:55,840
I think the US parks have pretty good bathroom cleanliness considering.

921
01:02:55,840 --> 01:03:00,840
However, these are facilities that thousands of babies are going in and out of every day.

922
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:09,840
So they just are what they are. I didn't smell shit anywhere, probably in the entire city, but especially the parks.

923
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:19,840
How do they manage that? I mean, I think it's a combination of a very diligent janitorial staff and everyone cleans up after themselves there.

924
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:22,840
Yeah, it's a much different. There's not as much litter on the street.

925
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:30,840
There's not that many garbage cans. I don't know if you noticed that around, which does that encourage you to like, hey, hold on to this and throw away, throw it away when you can.

926
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:37,840
I think that's absolutely. I think, yeah, it's like you carry it home as opposed to so there's no psychological way.

927
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:44,840
Like, I think you just get used to either not taking a cup with you from the restaurant or you hold on to it so you get home and discard it.

928
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:48,840
Yeah, yeah. You're annoyed at first. I want to throw it away now.

929
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:52,840
But then it makes you do it in a place that can handle it. Yeah.

930
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:55,840
So it's a combo, probably. You know, it's the other thing.

931
01:03:55,840 --> 01:04:02,840
It's a sanitizer for the seats. Oh, yeah. You don't just put down the paper.

932
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:07,840
You don't say I hate the crumpley paper that you sit on in the bathrooms.

933
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:11,840
I did so. Those are awful to sit on. Yeah.

934
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:14,840
They they have essentially hand sanitizer.

935
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:19,840
You put it on some toilet paper, rub down the seat and then you sit on the seat.

936
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:23,840
Why isn't that standard practice everywhere? I would like a robot to do that, though.

937
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:31,840
I don't even want to. Sure. I mean, there's those weird ones that are like plastic that you hit it and it like it's like a conveyor belt that goes around.

938
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,840
Have you seen those? No, no. I don't know. I've seen these a couple of times.

939
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:37,840
I don't know where specifically, but it's like the seat is covered in plastic.

940
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:45,840
You hit a button and then it goes like new plastic like rotates around, but you can't tell if it's just the same plastic.

941
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,840
There's no real way to know unless it was covered in shit.

942
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:51,840
And now it's not. That would be the only way you would know.

943
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:55,840
You see in hotels a lot now. Their remotes are like, what's the term?

944
01:04:55,840 --> 01:05:04,840
Like bacteria resistant or whatever TV remotes. Oh, I don't know what that they've coded it in something like it's anti-microbial.

945
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:11,840
Is that what it is? But but you see that every now and then because you always hear about like, oh, the dirtiest parts of hotels like the TV remote.

946
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:15,840
Aaron sprays them down. That's the first thing she does when she gets anywhere. Makes sense.

947
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:20,840
Yeah, they can have cleaned all the surfaces, but the thousand people have touched that remote.

948
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:25,840
The first thing I do, maybe less nowadays because I'm on my phone all the time.

949
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:31,840
But like when I was younger, I would just as soon as I walked into a hotel room, turned the TV on like without even thinking.

950
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:38,840
And my parents would tease me about it because you get TV that's not your TV channels or an information channel.

951
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:44,840
Most importantly, the Holy Grail HBO is good, but an information channel that loops every hour.

952
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:52,840
There's that time in Vegas when you had to leave the dinner early at the bachelor party because you were feeling a little ill.

953
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:57,840
And we came back and you were asleep. But the king of Queens was on the TV.

954
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:02,840
I was probably looking for the information channel and dozed off before I got to it.

955
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:07,840
It was also the time was about 1030 p.m. Yeah, it was about 10th. I thought it was five in the morning.

956
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:14,840
But I had a layover in Vegas, like an unexpected layover where they put you up at night.

957
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:19,840
And that was what I settled on to like fall asleep to. Oh, man.

958
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:23,840
I checked my luggage, too, so I didn't have another change of clothes.

959
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:30,840
So I was just like joylessly sleeping in this this strange hotel with like the Vegas information channel on.

960
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:36,840
I have watched informational videos about the Mandalay Bay Dolphin encounter more times than you can count.

961
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,840
Sure. It never changes. There's no.

962
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,840
I don't want to do the dolphin encounter. I just want to watch this.

963
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:46,840
Some dull person. Dolphins love being in the desert.

964
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:51,840
It's really better for them. Yeah. And it's the blubber.

965
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:56,840
I don't know if they have blubber. What are my what are my categories?

966
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:02,840
Oh, oh, merchandise. I don't shop in the parks here.

967
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:08,840
And so much of the merchandise is generic, but they're it's cute stuff.

968
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:19,840
And it's like one of a kind. If there's something on a ride, you're probably this is if there's some components to a ride that you like, there's probably a toy of it.

969
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:28,840
And you can and you like I got to have I need to have some little trinkets or a member of this unique experience I had spent so much time shopping.

970
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:33,840
And and to that end, I've come back with some things for the both of you.

971
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:37,840
Oh, I feel bad because I get a duffel. I got you such a little thing.

972
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:41,840
You got a little thing from it. 82 was great. I'm still eating the candies.

973
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:50,840
I have one. I have one little this is a little thing, but I converted some yen coins into Country Bear Theater.

974
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:56,840
Oh, oh, crushed yen. What's that? Crush yen. Is that what it is?

975
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:01,840
So, yeah. And you weren't crushing American pennies. No, it was. Yeah, yeah.

976
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:13,840
Would have been would have been a little hundred. And these are and specifically for Mike Trixie and for Jason, the Sun Bonnet Trio.

977
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:18,840
Oh, I'll hand those over. I can also hand these later.

978
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:25,840
Get them now. But let's see for these are nice. Not bad.

979
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:30,840
Not bad. Right. And very specific. And like it's not just of the theater in general.

980
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:37,840
Choose your character. I hope I chose well. Oh, yeah. We forced Jason to be associated with the Sun Bonnet Trio before.

981
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:44,840
My girls. He likes it. For Jason to commemorate your taste in rides and your taste in treats.

982
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:52,840
I have for you a little a die cast, a one four or five scale Mark Twain.

983
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:56,840
There's these wonderful little there's little vehicles.

984
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:01,840
There's a massive collection and even like a catalog of them. And they're so cool.

985
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:05,840
They have them for the monorails for the buses that take you to the hotels.

986
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,840
They have for the ride, the journey into the center of the Earth vehicle.

987
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:12,840
I bought a bunch of these things. I think they're so cool. But I got one of the Mark Twain.

988
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:15,840
And then I liked this a lot.

989
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:24,840
A this is a plastic churro that is also a pencil on the inside.

990
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:27,840
Wow. Vaguely Mickey ear.

991
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:32,840
Also, if you look at it down there, I like that a lot.

992
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:38,840
Tokyo Disney Resort, where dreams come true in in churro form, the multi-use churro.

993
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:41,840
Oh, sorry. Well, we'll see.

994
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:48,840
And for Mike, I mean, here, brighten your home with this and share this with Lindsay.

995
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:56,840
But a a tiny plush of our beloved Shandu, the most adorable character here.

996
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:01,840
I shall hear you very much. Shandu, good luck on your journey to Mike's arms.

997
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:06,840
Hey, you survived. Congrats on your journey.

998
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:11,840
Thank you for Shandu that and then and as requested.

999
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,840
Oh, you specifically requested item, a T-shirt.

1000
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,840
Well, I'm for sure Venmo. Which is, oh, no, let's call it a gift.

1001
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,840
It's from the Tokyo Disney Resort.

1002
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:25,840
This is a shirt that is an exclusive thing that Mike wanted, which is a what?

1003
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:30,840
It's a pastel design of Mickey of of Mickey bars.

1004
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,840
Very detailed Mickey bar.

1005
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:36,840
Yeah. So the Mickey Mickey like not ice cream, but popsicles essentially.

1006
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,840
But it's his head and they're different colors and they're all over.

1007
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,840
And I follow it on Instagram.

1008
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:45,840
There's an account that just posts when new merchandise pops up in Tokyo Disney.

1009
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,840
That's how I knew about this.

1010
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,840
So I it popped up like you're there or you were going to be there in a day or two.

1011
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,840
And I said, I want this.

1012
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,840
And you said, like, if you happen to run into it, I figured I couldn't miss this.

1013
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,840
And I saw it the first night. So thank you very much.

1014
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,840
I won't throw this. So I'll deal with that.

1015
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:05,840
But that's just a design. They don't sell those kind of popsicles.

1016
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:09,840
They do. They do. I have a picture.

1017
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,840
One of my pictures, I think I posted on Instagram.

1018
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,840
I'm eating that same popsicle. Oh, really?

1019
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:18,840
I didn't realize that because they're very similar to I think someone posted on our Facebook group

1020
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:24,840
and all those old Mickey popsicles that was like Mickey Donald, Minnie and Goofy.

1021
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:26,840
And there were the different flavors and they were the full body.

1022
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,840
You remember those? So like I have a great affection for those.

1023
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:33,840
And this is close because it's just a head. Right.

1024
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,840
And it's pretty detailed for a popsicle. It's a pretty fun design.

1025
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:39,840
Many, many colors are presented. We'll post a photo of it.

1026
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,840
Get one if you go there.

1027
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,840
And, you know, speaking of treats, that's the thing to discuss.

1028
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:47,840
But here's what we'll do. Let's let's take a quick break.

1029
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:53,840
And when we come back, I have several mini lists, one of which is my favorite treats of the trip.

1030
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:57,840
And then Scott's Tokyo top 10, the best rides in the city of Tokyo.

1031
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,840
Welcome back. Let's continue our journey.

1032
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:06,840
Good luck, Mike and Jason, on our journey through my trip.

1033
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,840
So I'm so here we go.

1034
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:20,840
I in order to sort of guide this discussion so I don't just a ran rail forever, I've picked out.

1035
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:26,840
And it was tough to do as tough to do as as navigating the fake rock final four.

1036
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:30,840
Tough to narrow it down to what I consider the 10.

1037
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:37,840
I mean, I guess I'd call them the 10 best rides, but it's also it's a highly subjective list.

1038
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,840
It's definitely it's the 10 rides I had the most fun on during my vacation.

1039
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:46,840
But before that, I have a couple of mini lists, which I'll try to make go a little faster.

1040
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:49,840
But one of one of those lists is is treats.

1041
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:57,840
Another thing I'm I'm the least treat of boy of this treat boy laden podcast.

1042
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,840
And but, you know, in Tokyo, you couldn't help it.

1043
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,840
Everything's everything looked fantastic.

1044
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:08,840
Everything had a giant line and you knew that wasn't arbitrary.

1045
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:12,840
It's not just them being fetishy about we have to try everything.

1046
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,840
If there's a line, it's got to be good.

1047
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,840
And it was I was always right on.

1048
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,840
You know what? I'll also give this update.

1049
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:26,840
Anytime Tokyo's come up, I've been I've expressed concern for Aaron.

1050
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:28,840
My wife is a vegetarian.

1051
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:32,840
And how is she going to fare in Tokyo in general and especially in the parks?

1052
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,840
Great. Did great.

1053
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,840
There are very few vegetarian options, I will say that.

1054
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,840
But vegetarian curry, curry is really good.

1055
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,840
There's so much curry in the park.

1056
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:47,840
I love awesome that as their hamburgers or whatever.

1057
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,840
That's a that's a great trade off.

1058
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,840
That's fantastic.

1059
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:59,840
So and a really good margarita pizza at this sit down restaurants in the Mediterranean area.

1060
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,840
Vegan might be tougher.

1061
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,840
Vegan is probably very tough.

1062
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,840
But vegetarian, we did all right in the city in general.

1063
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:13,840
She had some of the best food she's ever had, quite literally, I think the best pizza we've ever had, which sounds crazy.

1064
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:17,840
I think it is true at a place that I don't remember the name of.

1065
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:24,840
It's in the Nakameguro area and it's on the show Ugly Delicious with David Chang.

1066
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,840
I think I'm getting that right.

1067
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:30,840
Look it all up if you want good pizza, Neapolitan pizza in Japan.

1068
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:32,840
It's unbelievable.

1069
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,840
But so Disney treats.

1070
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,840
I'm going to do these just as three.

1071
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,840
Number three, Little Green Dumplings.

1072
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,840
Little Green Dumplings, the name for the mochi.

1073
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:47,840
The Toy Story alien mochi, which was very good.

1074
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:51,840
Not like mind blowingly good, but a pretty neat snack.

1075
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:52,840
Are you guys aware of the familiar this?

1076
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:53,840
Did you do it?

1077
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,840
Mike? Yeah, well, I didn't do it.

1078
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,840
I had a good atomic mochi.

1079
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:59,840
Oh, I didn't do that.

1080
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:00,840
I'm jealous of that.

1081
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:02,840
Yeah. Oh, boy.

1082
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:06,840
I didn't do any good atomic food and we didn't really eat in Sanrio.

1083
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,840
The food wasn't so great, but I like that mochi.

1084
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:15,840
Thank you for you gave me that heads up and we just went to like a adjacent food court in that area.

1085
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,840
That's another thing in Japan.

1086
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:18,840
Food court food.

1087
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:19,840
All good convenience store food.

1088
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,840
Good train station food.

1089
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:27,840
You sent us a picture from 7-Eleven where we posted one and I wanted to hear it's great.

1090
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:28,840
The food is great there.

1091
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:33,840
I mean, you your picture was very funny because it was men's dress shirts next to pornography.

1092
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:45,840
Oh, yes. I was switching back and forth between how quickly you could get from a nice dress shirt to kind of raunchy pornography and then just like great rice treats one step away.

1093
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,840
Salary men work long hours.

1094
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,840
They kind of need everything in one spot for the convenience.

1095
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:56,840
Yeah. My favorite 7-Eleven treat was the Coke that was flavored to lemon and vitamins.

1096
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,840
Vitamin vitamins.

1097
01:15:58,840 --> 01:15:59,840
What's the flavor of vitamins?

1098
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,840
I don't know. It's just a lemon and vitamins.

1099
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:02,840
So I got it.

1100
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:05,840
Did you do any like hot food from 7-Eleven?

1101
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:06,840
No, I didn't.

1102
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:09,840
I didn't either, but it all seemed good.

1103
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:10,840
I didn't McDonald's admittedly.

1104
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,840
Oh, we did too much McDonald's.

1105
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,840
Really? Good stuff.

1106
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:17,840
Oh, yeah. I mean, it's not too different.

1107
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,840
Not like incredibly better.

1108
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:24,840
I did get like an interesting like tea with turmeric in it or something like an iced tea with turmeric.

1109
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:27,840
They had some cool drinks, but nothing like crazy.

1110
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:28,840
Turmeric.

1111
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:29,840
What did I call it?

1112
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:30,840
Turmeric.

1113
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:31,840
It's cummeric.

1114
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:32,840
Oh, cummeric.

1115
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:33,840
Oh, cummeric.

1116
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:34,840
Yeah.

1117
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,840
Did you do like sodas?

1118
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:43,840
I think like I'm not a soda person even in like weird unusual ones, but I'm told the sodas in the park are cool.

1119
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,840
I feel like I did a little of it, but nothing crazy.

1120
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:47,840
Nothing. I was like, oh my gosh.

1121
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:48,840
Okay. Okay.

1122
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:50,840
Well, yeah, a little green dumplings.

1123
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:51,840
Not oh my gosh.

1124
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:57,840
Anyway, you get a little like plastic dish of three mochi and you don't know what flavor it's going to be till you bite in.

1125
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,840
But it's I think we got all three.

1126
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,840
It's the Neapolitan.

1127
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,840
It's strawberry chocolate vanilla.

1128
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,840
And they're very cute and a lot of fun.

1129
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:06,840
Good treat.

1130
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:10,840
Number two, a potato churro.

1131
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:11,840
This familiar to you?

1132
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:12,840
You didn't do this?

1133
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:19,840
This was at a cart inside the volcano and a big old line.

1134
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:20,840
And we wondered what the hell's up with that.

1135
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:21,840
It's got to be good for something.

1136
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:27,840
They like come out like in and out and they like, okay, now what do you lives like a preorder situation?

1137
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,840
It's that level of intensity.

1138
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:31,840
I don't this.

1139
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:35,840
I think you would both love the potato churro.

1140
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:36,840
I wrote down notes.

1141
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:41,840
It's kind of salty on the outside and then soft and potato we on the inside.

1142
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:46,840
So it's like churro texture, but more like the innards of a French fry.

1143
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:49,840
People say it's like a giant French fry.

1144
01:17:49,840 --> 01:18:00,840
But I found it to be almost also a little bit like if you gave like if you let the best chef in the world make a Domino's bread stick, that's interesting.

1145
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:03,840
It almost sounds a little like a can ish.

1146
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:04,840
Oh, I think so.

1147
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:08,840
Yeah, I'm not super can ish familiar, but that sounds right.

1148
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:11,840
Yeah, really unique and odd.

1149
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:18,840
But all the they had like they had a Nemo colors churro like bright orange over by the Nemo ride.

1150
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:20,840
That was fantastic.

1151
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:21,840
You can't go wrong.

1152
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,840
I don't even you don't even need to listen to my top three.

1153
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,840
Just buy anything you see and it'll be great.

1154
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:31,840
But my number one curry popcorn.

1155
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,840
Did you do popcorn?

1156
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:34,840
We had chocolate popcorn.

1157
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,840
I don't think I did the curry popcorn.

1158
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:37,840
We did a few.

1159
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,840
We did honey over in the poo area.

1160
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:45,840
We did caramel and they're all great and they all make the park smell great.

1161
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,840
Anytime you're passing by a popcorn cart.

1162
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:49,840
Oh my God.

1163
01:18:49,840 --> 01:19:03,840
There's also like release whatever they consider an Easter smell before the Easter show starts and great smells throughout Sanrio Pureland to like so I could I could have ranked the smells, but I'm not prepared for that.

1164
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:07,840
But curry number one, this like savory popcorn.

1165
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,840
So you need chocolate.

1166
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:10,840
I think I'm trying to remember.

1167
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:13,840
Maybe we had one other flavor, but it was not curry.

1168
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:14,840
That sounds good.

1169
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:15,840
There's so much curry there.

1170
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:16,840
Yeah.

1171
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,840
So you don't want to go overboard with curry.

1172
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:22,840
And yet this was, you know, so you know, there seem to be like a soy sauce one.

1173
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:27,840
There were a couple of some like Chinese barbecue kind of popcorn.

1174
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:30,840
But I didn't I didn't know how big of a deal the popcorn is.

1175
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,840
How big of a deal the collector things.

1176
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:39,840
You can get your popcorn in a Mark Twain and you carry it around your neck all day.

1177
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:40,840
Sounds good.

1178
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:45,840
Would they fill it with egg custard because custards are big there, right?

1179
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,840
Too, because I they are.

1180
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,840
Yeah, I don't know if I had any custard in the part.

1181
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:52,840
I feel like I had decent custard somewhere in Japan.

1182
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:58,840
But I think you'd be able to find a way or after the day's over, go to 7-eleven.

1183
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,840
Just DIY.

1184
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:04,840
I want your custard into that Mark Twain custard and like red bean.

1185
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:08,840
I love red bean as like a filling and stuff and curry and right.

1186
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:14,840
Like if I knew how to make this stuff, like I should learn how to just make it because I would like eat some of the stuff every day.

1187
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,840
Yeah, I could.

1188
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:17,840
I know me too.

1189
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:21,840
And it also feels like even though you're like stuffing yourself, it feels healthier on some level.

1190
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,840
Yeah, the freshness of everything.

1191
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:27,840
I think just less processed food, more fresh stuff.

1192
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:33,840
I am fighting every urge I have to become that guy who's like, well, so I've just been in Japan.

1193
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:39,840
So I'm doing I'm sort of I'm eating differently because I don't want all that, you know, all that stuff.

1194
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:44,840
It's not good. I'm like and putting I like tempted to put lanterns up in my apartment.

1195
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,840
I'm like, I'm teetering.

1196
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:47,840
I'm becoming the worst.

1197
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,840
We were doing that bit for months.

1198
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,840
All fairness.

1199
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,840
It is the country that invented cup noodle as well.

1200
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,840
So like, you know, not swings both ways.

1201
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:58,840
Swings a lot of things.

1202
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:00,840
Not everything is the highest taste.

1203
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:02,840
So what you're saying is you don't want to go to the sushi restaurant.

1204
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:09,840
We discovered after this that says like happy hour half off and the happy hour runs from noon till 10 p.m.

1205
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:10,840
It's like so it's half off.

1206
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,840
So that's just your prices.

1207
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,840
That's your prices for your operating hours.

1208
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,840
It's not so much happy hour.

1209
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:17,840
I like that place.

1210
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:18,840
I like it too.

1211
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,840
I just think it's funny that they're like half off during the special time.

1212
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:22,840
Trying to trick us.

1213
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:27,840
I don't know if I'm going to like the taste because it's like you're getting fresh fish when you're in Tokyo.

1214
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:37,840
Well, we were watching we were watching and this is a very popular anime, but my hero academia, which is which is all it's hot topics main display.

1215
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:40,840
Now, if you go by in the mall, hugely popular, Lindsey was like, I don't know.

1216
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:42,840
I really got an anime and then we were watching it.

1217
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,840
She's like, you know, now that we've been there.

1218
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:45,840
Yeah.

1219
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:46,840
Oh, did it get you on that train?

1220
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:54,840
Well, it's a little bit like, you know, we're kind of like more familiar with the culture now and like, you know, so like it is that's real.

1221
01:21:54,840 --> 01:22:00,840
But also like very aware of how annoying it is, how annoying we could be of like, you know, it's a little more connected to the culture.

1222
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:04,840
So like we really like the music and the art that's produced there.

1223
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:07,840
You were skating the most delicate line.

1224
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,840
It's exactly where I'm at.

1225
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,840
I do not want to be an off putting dude.

1226
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:15,840
Maybe I just have to do it in my own quiet ways.

1227
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:16,840
Yes.

1228
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:23,840
And actually, really what I mean, I can tell you what it means for Aaron, which is she's very committed now to find out way more about the mythology of the anime.

1229
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,840
The mythology of each and every Sanrio character.

1230
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:27,840
Oh, yeah.

1231
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:31,840
Less of a lifestyle thing and more about what's that tall carope?

1232
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:32,840
What's his deal?

1233
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:33,840
Yeah.

1234
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:34,840
And she will know.

1235
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,840
And we'll talk about it soon.

1236
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:42,840
Hey, wouldn't be Scott Gardner trip report if I didn't rank the three best drinks.

1237
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:43,840
Oh, hell yeah.

1238
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,840
The trip.

1239
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:49,840
Number three, the Manhattan at the Teddy Roosevelt's.

1240
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:50,840
I didn't get it.

1241
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:51,840
On the boats.

1242
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:52,840
What do you have there?

1243
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:53,840
I can't remember the name.

1244
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:54,840
It was like a fruit.

1245
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:58,840
It was like a fruit purpley drink with sugar on the rim.

1246
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,840
Really sweet, really great.

1247
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:01,840
I'm trying to remember the other one.

1248
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:06,840
There was one other one I had and I can't remember lemon drop anywhere somewhere.

1249
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:07,840
Yeah, but not there.

1250
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:13,840
Yeah, that's like not my genre of drink, but I would like I liked it when I had it.

1251
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:16,840
You know, it was first of all, I also to thank you, Mike.

1252
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,840
I might have missed this Teddy Roosevelt's lounge.

1253
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:19,840
I might have been unaware of it.

1254
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:20,840
Had you not talked it up?

1255
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:28,840
The downside of this is that it is demonstrably a better drinking location than even my beloved

1256
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:30,840
Cartay Circle lounge.

1257
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:31,840
Yeah, I think.

1258
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,840
Did you did you sit in the main room or did you sit closer to the bar?

1259
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:36,840
We the main room.

1260
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:40,840
Because that's we were by the bar and it's a little less good over there.

1261
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:46,840
OK, we see we thought about going back and bad because you want to sit by those bear pylons.

1262
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:51,840
Yes, in the big area is that we were like, that was probably the place to get seated.

1263
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,840
Yeah, yeah, I think it was it was it was pretty good.

1264
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:55,840
It was pretty.

1265
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,840
I walked around and I took pictures of all of the Teddy.

1266
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,840
There's a little teddy bear.

1267
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:03,840
Just nice to pay tribute to T.R.

1268
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:11,840
Of course, while in Japan, the the only thing that I could take solace in in this excellent

1269
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:15,840
drinking location is that it was certainly no Cartay, Manhattan.

1270
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:18,840
It was nice and a great place to dance more.

1271
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:19,840
Why I'm putting it on there.

1272
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,840
It's not as if it was an incredible Manhattan, but a great place to get a drink.

1273
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:24,840
Just a blast.

1274
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:30,840
Erin was pointing out we were in the in line for that bar and she was pointing out just look at the carpet right here.

1275
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:35,840
Even as beautiful as Cartay Circle is, you can feel that the carpet is like a little beaten up.

1276
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,840
This place looks like opening day.

1277
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:41,840
There's not one square inch of Disney that doesn't look like opening day.

1278
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:42,840
Yeah, it's wild.

1279
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:43,840
Yeah, yeah.

1280
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:44,840
Incredible.

1281
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:46,840
It's just like a little better there.

1282
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,840
Although I will also I'll talk up another thing that we do.

1283
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,840
America does better with this.

1284
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:03,840
My number two, the Italian white wine at the Ristorante di Canaletto in the Mediterranean area of Disney.

1285
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,840
See, excellent pizza there.

1286
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:11,840
I think I think the only like nice vegetarian meal in the park, but a pretty good one.

1287
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:12,840
And you know what?

1288
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:13,840
I hate to say it.

1289
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:17,840
I think that pizza might have ruined Red Rockets pizza for me.

1290
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:24,840
No, I'm a guest as as beloved as the hamburger pizza is to me.

1291
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:27,840
No, just having like really good pizza.

1292
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:30,840
I mean, there is good pizza, I guess, in the Disney parks.

1293
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:37,840
But yeah, at a sit down restaurant in the you're just you're comparing it immediately to the worst theme park pizza you've ever had.

1294
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:47,840
And I think I've said before, the best pizza is via Napoli or Napoli, whatever it's called in in Epcot and in downtown Disney out here.

1295
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,840
It's the same outside restaurant group running the Epcot one is the same.

1296
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,840
It is the same people.

1297
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:54,840
I don't know that.

1298
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:55,840
OK, OK, I believe.

1299
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,840
Yeah.

1300
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:58,840
And that is yeah, that is excellent.

1301
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:02,840
Yeah, the Epcot one hypes up more that they tried to find the water.

1302
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:07,840
That's a chemical makeup close to the mineral count of Naples.

1303
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:21,840
That I think what I have sensed is that from this really good place I went to that I cannot remember the name of, but it's themed after both twenty thousand leagues type submarines and Beatles yellow submarine at once.

1304
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:26,840
And you take submarine a submarine spiral staircase down to like a Beatles room.

1305
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:28,840
This restaurant in Nakamegaro.

1306
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:29,840
God, unbelievable.

1307
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,840
Next time you go, you have to have to go there.

1308
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:35,840
But the this place seems to be very like it's the right water.

1309
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:39,840
It's all there is for ingredients, but it's the best.

1310
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:43,840
And I'm told the pizza has only recently gotten really good in Japan.

1311
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,840
And this place seemed like part of that.

1312
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:46,840
Probably.

1313
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,840
I thought it was great.

1314
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:53,840
And just nice to have some solid wine because wine, not so good in Japan.

1315
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,840
There is one downside.

1316
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:59,840
We are near Napa and in the Central Coast.

1317
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,840
It's just better here.

1318
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:02,840
So I'm thankful for that.

1319
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:03,840
I like our man.

1320
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:08,840
I like our wine, but it was nice to have some of that in in Disney.

1321
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:13,840
Also, like everywhere in Japan seems kind of like, do you want the red wine or the white wine?

1322
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,840
You have two choice.

1323
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:16,840
Like there's no menu.

1324
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:18,840
It's like which bottle of the two?

1325
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:25,840
There was a tiny amount of selection at this place and it made us very happy.

1326
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,840
Beer, very popular in Japan.

1327
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:30,840
Yeah, which is closer to Scotch.

1328
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:31,840
Yeah.

1329
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:37,840
Justin Michael mentioned a place that we ended up going to called Bar Ben Fittich.

1330
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:41,840
It is a very like super like Harry Pottery.

1331
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,840
And you just there's no menu.

1332
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:48,840
You just say like what base you want and they'll give you the greatest thing you ever had.

1333
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:49,840
So whiskey is yeah.

1334
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:50,840
Whiskey is killer.

1335
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,840
I didn't do a ton of sake.

1336
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:53,840
It was pretty good when I had.

1337
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,840
I think I had some decent sake.

1338
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,840
Oh, you know, it's another good restaurant in Disney.

1339
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:06,840
See, there's a sit down fish market restaurant in the New York area that looks like a New York fit, an old New York fish market.

1340
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:16,840
And it's like as I think all any fish option at Cartay Circle rocks like every bit is good, maybe better at this place.

1341
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:23,840
So if you're looking for restaurant recommendations, sorry, I don't have the names for you, but go to the fish market once.

1342
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,840
Not that hard to find.

1343
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:28,840
But anyway, number one, pretty simple.

1344
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:32,840
The Kirin Ichiban draft inside the volcano.

1345
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,840
It's in the bottom level.

1346
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:35,840
It's called the Nautilus Galley.

1347
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:40,840
There's a couple of places you can just get a good draft beer in Disney Sea.

1348
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:52,840
But man, if like when I was if you're chasing that beer in the cars area vibe shit crazy good beer real just simple like I don't know.

1349
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,840
There's only one option and they knock it out of the park.

1350
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:58,840
I think there's like a frozen kind to where it's a little bit like ice cream or something.

1351
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:01,840
Yes, I think here in like pioneered that.

1352
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:03,840
And I think it was a thing like Dole Whip.

1353
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:09,840
You could only get it like two places like you get it in Japan or you get it at the Japanese Pavilion and I've caught.

1354
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:13,840
But now I think it's branched out because I think I saw it for sale on like Fairfax.

1355
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,840
OK, interesting.

1356
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:20,840
Is the Japanese food is this the Japan Pavilion good food wise?

1357
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:22,840
I think you change it.

1358
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:23,840
There's a new restaurant going in there.

1359
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:24,840
I think that's right.

1360
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:25,840
I don't know.

1361
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:26,840
I haven't had too much at that Pavilion.

1362
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:27,840
I haven't really.

1363
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:30,840
I mean, all of the times I've gone next time.

1364
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:31,840
Curious how legitimate.

1365
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:37,840
Do you guys know this fact about Tokyo Disneyland that there's there was this weird thing.

1366
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:41,840
Meet the world that that's it's what was there before Monsters Inc.

1367
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:45,840
Ride and seek and it was their American adventure.

1368
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:48,840
It looks deathly boring.

1369
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:51,840
Yeah, robots telling the history of Japan.

1370
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,840
I've heard of it, but I don't know much about it.

1371
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:54,840
I don't really either.

1372
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:56,840
This pretty hard to watch video on YouTube.

1373
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:59,840
There seems to be an animated stork and the robots seem very good.

1374
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,840
But boy, does it seem dreadfully boring.

1375
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:08,840
And the issue with this attraction was always they tell the story of Japan and then they speed you up to modern times.

1376
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:13,840
And they briefly nod to we had some dark years, but then it got better.

1377
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:20,840
And everyone always was like, this is pretty tricky to grace past the dark years.

1378
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:23,840
So it was always an iffy attraction.

1379
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,840
I think they wanted to get it out of there.

1380
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,840
And now it's a very cute Monsters Inc.

1381
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:28,840
Ride.

1382
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:37,840
But I found this fact out via Jim Hill that they this attraction was developed for the Epcot Pavilion, the Japan Epcot Pavilion.

1383
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,840
And they built the building for it.

1384
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:40,840
And it's there.

1385
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:46,840
If you go backstage at Epcot, there's this building that they've never used for anything.

1386
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:48,840
It was supposed to be their American adventure.

1387
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:50,840
And instead they just carted it over to Tokyo.

1388
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:52,840
Wow, that's interesting.

1389
01:30:52,840 --> 01:31:01,840
And there's just in fact, because it's the Oriental Land Company, they almost called in the 70s all of the paperwork called Tokyo Disney Oriental or Oriental Disneyland.

1390
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:02,840
Wow.

1391
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:09,840
Yeah, that almost was opened as the probably icky name that would have changed.

1392
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,840
I would imagine so.

1393
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:14,840
Anyway, yeah, real good drinks.

1394
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:15,840
And I'll tell you what.

1395
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:25,840
Walking around the volcano with that great beer made me think, well, if beer factored into why I like those those rocks and Cars Land so much, do we screw up?

1396
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:26,840
Maybe we screwed up.

1397
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:28,840
You think Mount Prometheus and all of that is the best?

1398
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:30,840
Maybe I think it might be.

1399
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:32,840
I think I think I had the bias.

1400
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:34,840
I had a hometown bias.

1401
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:35,840
For sure.

1402
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:36,840
We had a hometown bias.

1403
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:40,840
We'll have to see in 2020.

1404
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:41,840
When Jason goes.

1405
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:47,840
I think you could make the argument that Mount Prometheus deserved to be in the last four to for sure.

1406
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,840
I mean, that was that was tough in there.

1407
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:50,840
Yeah.

1408
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:52,840
Remember, that was madhouse.

1409
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:53,840
Yeah.

1410
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:54,840
Matterhorn make it to the final four.

1411
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:55,840
It might have.

1412
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,840
I think it's a conference issue.

1413
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:02,840
I think if you were like ranking, if there wasn't like pairings, I think Prometheus would have made it.

1414
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:03,840
Yeah.

1415
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,840
And I think I mean, look, there were some oversights in the final.

1416
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:07,840
We didn't.

1417
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:08,840
I think we should have somebody pointed out.

1418
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:14,840
We should have put those like blue rocks from Tomorrowland in Orlando in the mix, because those are very fun.

1419
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:16,840
Maybe I've been there.

1420
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:17,840
I've seen them.

1421
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:20,840
They are good and they might belong at least in the bracketing.

1422
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:23,840
So I'm saying there were problems maybe with the bracket, but couldn't be perfect.

1423
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,840
I think maybe people are right.

1424
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:30,840
Another one we heard a lot was the Little Mermaid stuff in Florida.

1425
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:32,840
Do you consider it coral?

1426
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:35,840
Perhaps people were even doing the rationale for us.

1427
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:36,840
Well, you can't put it in because it's coral.

1428
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:39,840
But we didn't say that.

1429
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:40,840
You're making up a rule.

1430
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:41,840
Yeah.

1431
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,840
That came up with the petrified trees of Black Spire Outpost.

1432
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:44,840
Right.

1433
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:46,840
Well, that's I mean, we'll certainly see.

1434
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:53,840
I'm still very thankful those didn't win a different different ballgame in 2020 with Black Spire Outpost.

1435
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:56,840
And if we've all been to Japan by then, we may need to.

1436
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:57,840
Yeah.

1437
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:58,840
You can cast the final vote.

1438
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:01,840
I at least think it should have been in Final Four, if not final two, if not final one.

1439
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:02,840
I don't know.

1440
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:03,840
Yeah.

1441
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:04,840
I mean, it's pretty jaw dropping.

1442
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:07,840
Skeptical about this Florida Tomorrowland rocks.

1443
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:08,840
I don't know.

1444
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:09,840
I don't know if they blend in with the retrofuturism.

1445
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:12,840
I need to examine them closer in person.

1446
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:13,840
I've seen them.

1447
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:14,840
I like them.

1448
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:15,840
Better than ours.

1449
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:16,840
California rocks.

1450
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,840
Let's not talk about those.

1451
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:22,840
It's too dark.

1452
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:27,840
So with that said, I can now head into my top 10 rides.

1453
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,840
Finally, we'll be talking about rides.

1454
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:35,840
In this involve, I will include everything in Tokyo, not just not just the Disney parks.

1455
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:39,840
A couple of caveats before I head into the top 10.

1456
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:43,840
As I've said before, Pooh's Honey Hunt was sadly down when I was there.

1457
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:46,840
And I think almost undoubtedly it would be in my top 10.

1458
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:49,840
However, it cannot be as I have not been on this ride.

1459
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:50,840
A good reason to go back.

1460
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:52,840
And there's many of those.

1461
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:55,840
The other thing is we know this like.

1462
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,840
All right.

1463
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:05,840
I knew before coming home that I knew that I wanted to isolate at least one attraction and remove it from my main Tokyo episode and put it over on the second gate.

1464
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:13,840
I didn't know what it was going to be, but I figured there's going to be something that I love so much that I can't even take up the real estate of this main episode to talk about it.

1465
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:21,840
And there was an experience so unique, so narratively rich that I can't possibly fit it into this episode.

1466
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:33,840
So I'm declaring right now that we will be doing a second gate episode about the Pan Galactic pizza port, the restaurant in Tomorrowland.

1467
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:36,840
This is non-negotiable, gentlemen.

1468
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:46,840
We will be doing this and as soon as we possibly can, because it's taking everything I have right to not just spill my guts about this thing right now.

1469
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:47,840
I have to contain it.

1470
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:50,840
I have to take a deep breath and save it a little bit.

1471
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:53,840
This is one of my favorite things ever to exist.

1472
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:54,840
I love it so much.

1473
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:56,840
Can you say the name of the character that you like?

1474
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:57,840
Yes.

1475
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:58,840
Why?

1476
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:04,840
In the Pan Galactic pizza port, you follow the the high jinx and the travails of Tony Solaroni.

1477
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:06,840
You also meet his wife.

1478
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:09,840
You meet his mean boss, Mr.

1479
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:10,840
Fusano.

1480
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:15,840
You get to experience his machine in action, the PZ 5000.

1481
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:20,840
And we will be talking about all of this in depth over on the second gate.

1482
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:21,840
So get ready.

1483
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:27,840
I feel you know somebody tweeted an old Disney News magazine article about this thing right before I got there.

1484
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:31,840
They tweeted it at us and I was ready and raring.

1485
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,840
I remember seeing this as a kid and I went and found that issue.

1486
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:38,840
So now I know about the making of the Pan Galactic pizza port.

1487
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:39,840
It's so incredible.

1488
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,840
We will be doing that on the second gate.

1489
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:42,840
There's a ton there.

1490
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:48,840
I as I said on my Instagram, I think I found my favorite thing of my childhood in my 30s.

1491
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:49,840
Right.

1492
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:50,840
It took till now.

1493
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:51,840
Holy shit.

1494
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:53,840
So we'll see you at the Pan Galactic.

1495
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:59,840
And during which I will also contain my thoughts in general about Tokyo Tomorrowland.

1496
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:00,840
Oh, right.

1497
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:01,840
Holy shit.

1498
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:06,840
And I'll just briefly say here, Rex is a hitchhiking ghost droid.

1499
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:08,840
Thank you for not telling me.

1500
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:10,840
That is a delight.

1501
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:12,840
I think we said that very cool.

1502
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:13,840
That was one of the ways soon as you left.

1503
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:14,840
I think we yelled it.

1504
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:20,840
I know I'm glad I made it out in time because I think we knew we had to keep that one under the head.

1505
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:23,840
But it is we did around the corner and we were like, whoa.

1506
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:24,840
Yeah, yes.

1507
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:26,840
Me too.

1508
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:27,840
As you can imagine.

1509
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:28,840
Oh, man.

1510
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:30,840
And then there's still another Rex.

1511
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:31,840
I oh, boy.

1512
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:36,840
Yeah, there's just there's I'm going to call it number one tomorrow.

1513
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:39,840
And I think it's number one to my really interesting for me for what I'm after.

1514
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:43,840
And Tony Solaroni, that's a small part of it.

1515
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:48,840
So I love that entryway, that blue and white entryway for way the land.

1516
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:50,840
So the spires.

1517
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:51,840
Yeah. Yeah.

1518
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:52,840
Oh, my God.

1519
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:54,840
I mean, I feel like that's what they all used to look like.

1520
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:59,840
And they've like kept that classic tomorrow land as they all should have.

1521
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:02,840
What is all this nonsense of having to update it?

1522
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:04,840
As we've said many times, the future is neon.

1523
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:05,840
Just keep it there.

1524
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:06,840
What are you doing?

1525
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:07,840
Tokyo's got it right.

1526
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,840
All right.

1527
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:13,840
Let me finally begin the top 10 list and I'll see if I can do this not painfully slowly.

1528
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:14,840
Sure.

1529
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:15,840
All right.

1530
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:19,840
So as I said, this will not include just the Disney parks.

1531
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:24,840
It will not include Universal Studios, but I don't think anything was there that was

1532
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:27,840
open that would have been on the list anyway.

1533
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,840
Curious about space fantasy, the ride.

1534
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:30,840
Right.

1535
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:32,840
I don't know if it would have made it.

1536
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:35,840
But number 10, we will start with a non Disney.

1537
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:42,840
And that is and I might butcher the pronunciation of this, the Gekion live coaster at Sega Joypolis.

1538
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:45,840
I have not brought up Sega Joypolis yet.

1539
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:47,840
You didn't go to know is correct.

1540
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:53,840
Absolutely worth some of your time if you're going to Tokyo and next time you go, you got to do it.

1541
01:37:53,840 --> 01:38:01,840
Sega Joypolis is like if Disney Quest worked, they if they did it right, if money stayed in the machine,

1542
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:09,840
if they actually change things around, if it was cutting edge technology instead of 20 years ago technology,

1543
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:12,840
although there's still a little of that too, but in a charming way.

1544
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:13,840
Right.

1545
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:14,840
It's amazing.

1546
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:16,840
They've done a great job there.

1547
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:21,840
And it's no wonder that celebrities have spoken so highly of Sega Joypolis on your way out.

1548
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:26,840
You get to see autographs of prominent people who've been there, including Freddie Prinze Jr.

1549
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:31,840
Who visited in 2001 and Leo DiCaprio, who visited in 2000.

1550
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:34,840
So lots of prominent visitors.

1551
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:37,840
I think I want to say Jonathan Lipnicki as well.

1552
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:43,840
So if you want to walk in the in the feet of giants like Jonathan Lipnicki, go to Sega Joypolis.

1553
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:46,840
In general, Sega Joypolis is part of this crazy.

1554
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:50,840
They call it Tokyo Beach and it's this crazy mall zone.

1555
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:54,840
There's so there's a ton of malls and a Madame Tussauds.

1556
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:59,840
And then there was some free exhibit that we walked into where a robot did a drawing of us.

1557
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:05,840
And there was a free VR ride where you get swung around on a miniature kooka arm.

1558
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:12,840
And and there's a mall that has a big Gundam robot outside of it.

1559
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:15,840
And I'd seen photos of this thing and I thought, oh, that's funny.

1560
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:21,840
Big robot outside of a mall did not prepare me for the incredible scope of this.

1561
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:24,840
This robot has to be seen to be believed.

1562
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:29,840
Like it makes you go, why doesn't why don't any of the universal parks have a full size transformer?

1563
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,840
That's essentially what this is.

1564
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:36,840
It lets you know this is what it would be like if transformers were real and one of them was about to step on you.

1565
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:39,840
It's and it's just sitting outside of a mall for no reason.

1566
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,840
How tall is it? I don't know.

1567
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:43,840
Huh. Could I ballpark it?

1568
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:47,840
It's like two stories tall or not that I think more.

1569
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,840
Wow, really? Maybe more.

1570
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:53,840
It looked about as tall as do you know the Maryland in the center of Palm Springs?

1571
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:57,840
Wait, is that there's a big there's a giant Marilyn Monroe.

1572
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:58,840
Really? Yeah.

1573
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:03,840
I've been at Palm Springs. I haven't seen like right in the center, kind of close to the General Store Museum.

1574
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:06,840
Oh, you had to look up that skirt.

1575
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:08,840
Yeah. And it's weird.

1576
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:11,840
Driving a car under. Do you walk under it?

1577
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,840
Yeah, you walk around it.

1578
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:15,840
Yeah, it's a little it's a little strange. Yes.

1579
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,840
Yeah. Yeah, weird.

1580
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:19,840
Very tall.

1581
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,840
Yeah. Oh, that. Oh, the Maryland.

1582
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:26,840
Yes. This whole I recommend this whole area entirely, including Sega Joypolis.

1583
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:33,840
And you can you can buy the rides piecemeal or you can just do them or get a full day pass.

1584
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:35,840
It's cheaper if you go at night.

1585
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:39,840
So we did this three screen rides that are really fun.

1586
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:43,840
Wild Wing, Wild River and Wild Jungle Brothers.

1587
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,840
One seems like a ripoff.

1588
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:48,840
Indiana Jones, one seems like a ripoff.

1589
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:50,840
Soren and one seems like a ripoff.

1590
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:52,840
Jurassic Park. We went on the ripoff.

1591
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:53,840
Indiana Jones.

1592
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:56,840
And it's it's a real delight.

1593
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:59,840
There's like a Japanese solo narrating the whole time.

1594
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:01,840
It's like it's better than you think.

1595
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:05,840
Some little indoor ride has a right to be Sega place is great.

1596
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:09,840
There's games in the urinals at Sega Joypolis.

1597
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:12,840
Wow. There is a target that you aim at.

1598
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:18,840
And if you correctly pee on the target, the video screen will live correspond.

1599
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:28,840
And I watched a game where you your character is like Fonzie esque and you were firing snot liquid snot at a nerd.

1600
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:32,840
What? You're like drowning a nerd.

1601
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:35,840
And you're not which is controlled by your pee.

1602
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:41,840
And this is one of like seven options of urinal games that you can play.

1603
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:44,840
So each urinal has a different scenario, essentially.

1604
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:47,840
Yes. You have you got to drink so much water and say good job.

1605
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:49,840
Let's see the energy to play every year.

1606
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:53,840
And I mean, are there games in the female restrooms?

1607
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,840
I don't know.

1608
01:41:55,840 --> 01:42:01,840
I think you're at a handicap because I feel like right now females have a more difficult time controlling with precision.

1609
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:09,840
Is there a blogger in Japan who's like, well, the was a little concerned about the state of the urinal games,

1610
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:16,840
like nitpicking like Disney bloggers going like, well, there's a bit of disrepair has fallen upon the Mike Finke boats.

1611
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:22,840
Just, you know, the the polygons are not responding as quickly as they should be.

1612
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:24,840
Plus up of those pissing games.

1613
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:30,840
Now that you go to regular urinals, are you like, you know, just like in Tokyo, it's like, it's just like I come on board with a urinal.

1614
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:32,840
It's definitely been disappointed.

1615
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:38,840
There's also there was a Aaron went to a Sanrio Pure Land bathroom that like had a full on light show.

1616
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:39,840
Oh, yeah.

1617
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:41,840
Just like and there was like a script.

1618
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:54,840
There was like a video also that my urine activated at a Sanrio that like where you watch Hello Kitty in space and it starts because I started being it's so insane.

1619
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:58,840
Pure Land is really going to get the short end of the stick in this episode.

1620
01:42:58,840 --> 01:42:59,840
Yeah, we'll get to we have to.

1621
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,840
I think it did in yours, too.

1622
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:03,840
Yeah, there's so much to say about Pure Land.

1623
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:06,840
Send bad and this we have to know.

1624
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:08,840
We have to shut up.

1625
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:16,840
Yeah, I'm just glad that from now on I can operate from a Tokyo right juncture point in doing this podcast.

1626
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:20,840
OK, but the Gekion life coaster, it's like the heart beach of the facility.

1627
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:31,840
As soon as you walk in, ripping through the second story of this area is a spinning coaster that also does inversions, which I'm told is a rare thing.

1628
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,840
I don't think that's common.

1629
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:36,840
So this is just odd little spirited coaster.

1630
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:38,840
It's also a launch sun.

1631
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:42,840
Now that I'm launching, I think it's only my second launch technically.

1632
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:45,840
But I was brave and I don't even like going upside down either.

1633
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:46,840
But man, this thing was so cool.

1634
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:49,840
I think they've like a functional Disney quest.

1635
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:53,840
They have made this park where you can trade the rides in and out easily.

1636
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,840
And I think this used to be a shooting roller coaster.

1637
01:43:55,840 --> 01:44:02,840
So you're like in the screens, you're moving forward and the screens also moving with you.

1638
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:12,840
And sometimes, you know, when you're playing like a basketball shooting game and it's going back and forth and getting further and further away so it gets harder and harder to shoot.

1639
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:14,840
It's like that with screens like it.

1640
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:16,840
First, the screens right in front of you and then it gets hard.

1641
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:18,840
So it gets much harder to see.

1642
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:19,840
You're trying to catch up with it.

1643
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:22,840
It's kind of a challenging game that you're playing.

1644
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:24,840
It's not a shooting coaster anymore.

1645
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:34,840
It's now like a dance dance revolution where you have buttons under your harness that you have to hit in time and it somehow impacts your ride experience.

1646
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:40,840
I'm not sure how because it's all in Japanese, but like you can change your ride and soup it up more.

1647
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:46,840
The better you do on this thing faster, I think maybe really or it just affects the color scheme.

1648
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:51,840
Like if player green wins, then it's going to be a more green ride that you go on.

1649
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,840
It's really inventive.

1650
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:55,840
Are there better rides in Disney?

1651
01:44:55,840 --> 01:45:00,840
Probably. But I wanted to shout out Sega Joypolis because it's really well done and really worth experiencing.

1652
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:02,840
I did so shitty on this ride.

1653
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:04,840
I thought I was doing well the whole time.

1654
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:06,840
I got a C terribly grade you.

1655
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:08,840
Erin got a B.

1656
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:09,840
She kicked my ass.

1657
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:13,840
But bad grade, good grade, really good ride.

1658
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,840
Recommend Sega Joypolis and the Gekion Life Custer.

1659
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:16,840
Number nine.

1660
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:19,840
Let's start getting into Disney.

1661
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:23,840
I thought should this list only have things you can't do here in America?

1662
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:25,840
Should it only be Tokyo specific?

1663
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:31,840
However, there are some rides that are so much better done in Tokyo Disney than they are in the States.

1664
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:36,840
And I have to honor though they're almost more of a handicap in a way that they have to be that much better.

1665
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:40,840
And one of those is and that is number nine, the Jungle Cruise.

1666
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:42,840
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1667
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:43,840
Right. Yeah.

1668
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:47,840
It's more like the Florida Jungle Cruise, which is better than our Jungle Cruise out here.

1669
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:48,840
Oh, I didn't know that.

1670
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:49,840
OK. Yeah.

1671
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:50,840
Because you got you.

1672
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:51,840
There's stuff in there.

1673
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:54,840
Yeah. You go in a little like a tunnel under a bridge.

1674
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:55,840
And that's like, yeah.

1675
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:56,840
And the Florida one is like that.

1676
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:57,840
OK.

1677
01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:01,840
So maybe I might be missing out on Jungle Cruise evolution in general.

1678
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:04,840
Yes. I forgot totally when we went back a couple of years ago.

1679
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:07,840
We went on the Jungle Cruise and I went, hey, look at this.

1680
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:09,840
Right. Because out here it's fine.

1681
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:11,840
And I like it going on once in a while.

1682
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:13,840
But it's not in your regular rotation.

1683
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:14,840
No, never.

1684
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:16,840
And I think this one would have to be.

1685
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:19,840
There is so much excitement with the employees.

1686
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:22,840
There's like 20 people wearing khakis on the dock.

1687
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:27,840
They employ more people than most companies in Los Angeles just on the Jungle Cruise.

1688
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:30,840
Everybody's out there so excited you're there.

1689
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:37,840
They get everybody on the car to like yell like I think you like they have pendants of different animals and that you choose.

1690
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:38,840
Are you like an elephant?

1691
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:40,840
Are you a hippo or whatever?

1692
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:42,840
And whatever the sound is, everybody has to make the sound together.

1693
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:44,840
Excited crowds.

1694
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:46,840
They don't do hokey jokes.

1695
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:48,840
They just do like, are you ready?

1696
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:49,840
Here we go.

1697
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:50,840
We're going to see the elephants.

1698
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:58,840
There's music the whole time that gives it this narrative thrust circle of life plays when you see the lions.

1699
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:02,840
And then you go into this incredible projection mapping room.

1700
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:03,840
Is that in Florida?

1701
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:06,840
I don't think it's like that.

1702
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:07,840
I don't think it's to that degree.

1703
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:08,840
The one in Tokyo.

1704
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:09,840
Yes, seems like it's the best.

1705
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,840
But I'm trying to remember.

1706
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:12,840
I got my memories fuzzy on it.

1707
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:13,840
So I don't know for sure.

1708
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:14,840
Is did they do the stuff at night?

1709
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:16,840
Because I didn't do this at night, but it looked like it was.

1710
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:17,840
It's really good.

1711
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:18,840
I did it at night.

1712
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:19,840
We did it at night.

1713
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:20,840
So yeah, it was.

1714
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:22,840
Yeah, I'm trying to think.

1715
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:25,840
I can't remember the two of them are now blending together in my head, I think.

1716
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:28,840
So I can't remember if one the projection happens in Florida.

1717
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:32,840
You're talking about like when you go in like the stone, like the whatever you call.

1718
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:33,840
I don't even know what you call it.

1719
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:36,840
Like temple ish kind of kind of a temple.

1720
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:39,840
It's like it's some elephant God.

1721
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:40,840
I don't tell you what happens.

1722
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:44,840
It's just really cool projection mapping and it comes out of nowhere.

1723
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:45,840
It's so neat.

1724
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:50,840
The whole thing just has so much more spirit than the one in Disneyland.

1725
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:51,840
Yeah.

1726
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:55,840
And you know, whatever stupid thing they're going to do to it when the rock movie comes out.

1727
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:57,840
Don't guys don't overthink it.

1728
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:58,840
Look to Tokyo.

1729
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:00,840
Look what they did.

1730
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:01,840
It's just so much more fun.

1731
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:02,840
They only redid it in 2014.

1732
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:06,840
It's pretty recent and they did a great job.

1733
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:08,840
No, no rock robots.

1734
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:09,840
Please no robot.

1735
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:10,840
I know.

1736
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:11,840
We'll see.

1737
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:12,840
I don't know.

1738
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:13,840
It just make.

1739
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:14,840
Yeah.

1740
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:21,840
I P in general, pretty lacking in Tokyo and I'm not an IP snob.

1741
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:25,840
I try to not be an IP snob, but boy, nice to be in a place.

1742
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:31,840
I just I was like every every like sight line is so clear and not cluttered and there isn't

1743
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:40,840
some weird loud temporary way to jam Dr. Strange into this corner of the park or whatever it

1744
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:41,840
is.

1745
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:46,840
Like they aren't at they aren't like screaming at me about Lady and the Tramp for they're

1746
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:51,840
like so much more sparing with all that stuff.

1747
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:52,840
That's true.

1748
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:53,840
Yeah.

1749
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:54,840
I don't know.

1750
01:48:54,840 --> 01:48:55,840
No Marvel like anywhere.

1751
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:56,840
Yeah.

1752
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:57,840
Is that because of Japan though?

1753
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:00,840
Is that because of Universal?

1754
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:04,840
They might have agreements are for international because they do have the Spider-Man ride because

1755
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:07,840
they haven't announced anything for Japan for Marvel.

1756
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:09,840
So I think it might be a case of because they can do it in Paris.

1757
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:12,840
They can do it in Hong Kong and Shanghai, I think.

1758
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:17,840
But I do think there's they can't do it in Orlando yet unless it's like Guardians when

1759
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:18,840
they can't do it in Japan.

1760
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:21,840
I think that's right because they would have announced something for it unless Marvel is

1761
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:22,840
not popular there.

1762
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:26,840
I sense that Star Wars is not super popular there.

1763
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:27,840
Is that correct?

1764
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:31,840
I guess I think it's maybe not as popular as it is here, but it's still I don't know.

1765
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:33,840
They haven't announced Star Wars land for Tokyo either.

1766
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:34,840
Yeah, no, they haven't.

1767
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:37,840
In China, it's definitely not as popular.

1768
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:39,840
Yeah, they've had a real problem with that.

1769
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:40,840
Yeah.

1770
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:41,840
Yeah.

1771
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:44,840
You know, because there's like a black actor in it.

1772
01:49:44,840 --> 01:49:47,840
That's a problem.

1773
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:53,840
I believe the issue was that they had shrunk John Boyega's face on the poster because he's

1774
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:56,840
like one of the three leads and like he all of a sudden was like in the corner, tiny

1775
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:57,840
in the corner.

1776
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:58,840
Yeah.

1777
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:04,840
We're not going to promise anything, but it's possible this actor is smaller than BB-8.

1778
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:07,840
He may be a little tiny man and you might not even notice him in the movie.

1779
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:09,840
Yes, that's right.

1780
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:16,840
I was reading about a movie called Detective Chinatown 2 in Japan and it grossed five hundred

1781
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:18,840
and forty four million dollars.

1782
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:21,840
Whoa.

1783
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:24,840
So are we going to get rides of that?

1784
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:25,840
Who knows?

1785
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:29,840
Dick Tracy's Crime Stoppers, but with Detective Chinatown 2.

1786
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:30,840
Yeah, maybe.

1787
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:31,840
I'm looking forward to it.

1788
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:38,840
Maybe the general sense of calm and just like the pleasantness of Tokyo is entirely based

1789
01:50:38,840 --> 01:50:41,840
on the fact that Star Wars isn't popular there.

1790
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:44,840
Like no one is screaming at each other about this.

1791
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:46,840
They have their own issues.

1792
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:48,840
There might be a few.

1793
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:49,840
Yes.

1794
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:55,840
Anyways, to keep going with the theme of Better in Japan, Indiana Jones and the Temple of

1795
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:56,840
the Crystal Skull.

1796
01:50:56,840 --> 01:50:57,840
Yep.

1797
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:58,840
That's number eight.

1798
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:00,840
I thought about putting this lower than Jungle Cruise because Jungle Cruise is a bigger jump.

1799
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:03,840
I felt like I went from like 60 to 100.

1800
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:06,840
Indiana Jones is more like 85 to 100.

1801
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:07,840
But man, it's a good jump.

1802
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:09,840
It's a real good jump.

1803
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:10,840
Yeah.

1804
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:11,840
It's like going on.

1805
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:14,840
And when it first opened, I imagine the track feels nice.

1806
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:16,840
It feels nice and smooth.

1807
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:17,840
Yeah.

1808
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:19,840
It's like operating like at optimum performance.

1809
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,840
The car feels better.

1810
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:26,840
The very crisp projections of the bugs.

1811
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:32,840
They don't try to do the weird rat thing that has never worked that well.

1812
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:36,840
There's smoke rats dripping on your car.

1813
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:41,840
That crazy contained tornado when you enter that's lit with blue light.

1814
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:42,840
Oh, right.

1815
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:43,840
Looks amazing.

1816
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:45,840
The head is amazing.

1817
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:48,840
I think the head is probably a little better than Mara in some way.

1818
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:49,840
The head is better than Mara.

1819
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:53,840
I think the main not not in the first tunnel, but in the main ruins room.

1820
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:54,840
Yes.

1821
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:55,840
Yes.

1822
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:56,840
Yeah.

1823
01:51:56,840 --> 01:51:57,840
I think it is.

1824
01:51:57,840 --> 01:51:58,840
The only thing I think is better is Mara herself.

1825
01:51:58,840 --> 01:51:59,840
Yes.

1826
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:00,840
The big head.

1827
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:02,840
That's the only thing in the skull is cool.

1828
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:03,840
Yeah.

1829
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:04,840
But you're right.

1830
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:05,840
Yes.

1831
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:07,840
The actual big head has more attitude and personality.

1832
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:08,840
Yeah.

1833
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:09,840
But that's it.

1834
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:10,840
I like that they don't do the doors.

1835
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:15,840
I like that you're just committed to this cool room with little like pools of water.

1836
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:17,840
It's the night sky.

1837
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:19,840
It's lit up when you enter that first ramp.

1838
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:20,840
Yep.

1839
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:21,840
What else?

1840
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:24,840
The the bellowing smoke ring monster.

1841
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:25,840
Oh, my gosh.

1842
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:26,840
So cool.

1843
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:27,840
So scary.

1844
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:28,840
Such a surprise.

1845
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:31,840
The sculpted heads spitting the darts.

1846
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:37,840
You don't get day glow Halloween store like decorations.

1847
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:42,840
You get Roman art for some reason spitting darts at you.

1848
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:43,840
It's crazy.

1849
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:47,840
That it's because I think sure we said this is a repeat, but we said like that's always

1850
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:50,900
a part where you talk about the Indiana Jones ride where you go, well, that last stretch

1851
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:53,040
right before the ball is and it's fine.

1852
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:56,400
But it feels like if you're heading to the climax, it should be a little something extra

1853
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:57,400
there.

1854
01:52:57,400 --> 01:53:02,520
And this place there is there's a really cool extra angry God that shoots fire at you.

1855
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:03,520
Yeah.

1856
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:06,840
And then there's actually like feeling like a physical presence that's shooting darts

1857
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:07,840
at you.

1858
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:08,840
Yeah.

1859
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:09,840
Yeah.

1860
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:11,240
It just feels more just a better looking room.

1861
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:14,720
It's a more visceral effect because the statues are cool.

1862
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:19,880
And then at the end, Indy, the especially the second animatronic by the by the first

1863
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:21,840
the crushed boulder beat up.

1864
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:22,840
Yeah.

1865
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:23,840
He looks like shit.

1866
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:27,000
It looks like back to their actual Harrison Ford.

1867
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:31,480
He looks like what Harrison Ford looks like if he has to go out in public and speak to

1868
01:53:31,480 --> 01:53:32,480
someone.

1869
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:33,480
So upset.

1870
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:37,960
But also more clearly him, I think.

1871
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:40,440
Yeah, I guess that's more like Harrison Ford.

1872
01:53:40,440 --> 01:53:43,400
Just better, more kind of spastic animatronic.

1873
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:44,400
So great.

1874
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:47,520
I feel like I had to bump some things that I really liked off the list to put Indiana

1875
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,680
Jones on, but I went on a second time.

1876
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:50,680
It's undeniable.

1877
01:53:50,680 --> 01:53:51,680
We went on three times.

1878
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:52,680
Geez.

1879
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:53,680
Wow.

1880
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:54,680
Because single riders easy.

1881
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:55,680
Yeah.

1882
01:53:55,680 --> 01:53:56,680
Yeah.

1883
01:53:56,680 --> 01:53:57,680
Yeah.

1884
01:53:57,680 --> 01:53:58,680
Very, very well done there.

1885
01:53:58,680 --> 01:53:59,680
So nice that they don't really have that nobody's using that single rider.

1886
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:00,680
What a good little cheat.

1887
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:01,960
Oh, you know what else?

1888
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:02,960
In the line.

1889
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:05,680
When in the lines, not as good as our line because they didn't have to get you all the

1890
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:08,560
way out of the park like they like they do here.

1891
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:14,660
But that room with all the skeletons piled up is just a big old pile like spit out skeletons

1892
01:54:14,660 --> 01:54:20,120
as if like a monster took them and just like ripped the skin off like a rib and tossed

1893
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:21,120
them back into the pool.

1894
01:54:21,120 --> 01:54:24,120
Oh, like the way I eat fish.

1895
01:54:24,120 --> 01:54:25,120
You do it like Heathcliff style.

1896
01:54:25,120 --> 01:54:26,120
Like Heathcliff and riffraff.

1897
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:27,120
Yeah, like riffraff.

1898
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:32,840
And then they each bone hits like a xylophone when it heads out of your mouth.

1899
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:34,320
OK, Indiana Jones.

1900
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:35,320
Great.

1901
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:36,320
Number seven, Aquatopia.

1902
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:39,560
Love the Aquatopia.

1903
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:42,060
So strange and unique and weird.

1904
01:54:42,060 --> 01:54:43,880
This weird little putt around ride.

1905
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:44,880
It's such a delight.

1906
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:46,400
You don't know what it's going to do when you get on.

1907
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:47,840
It's different every time.

1908
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:48,840
Looks good at day.

1909
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:49,840
We did it again at night.

1910
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:50,840
Really liked it.

1911
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:54,320
I think this should be a franchise in every park.

1912
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:56,960
My I have a new Tomorrowland plan.

1913
01:54:56,960 --> 01:55:01,680
We rip out the submarines and the Autopia.

1914
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:04,000
You put in the Aquatopia and Tron.

1915
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Perfect.

1916
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,000
I agree.

1917
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,000
We don't do.

1918
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:12,880
Hey, kids, you want to experience the dream of driving an old smelly car?

1919
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:20,980
Put kids on a clean, like, you know, quiet electric vehicle the way the future needs

1920
01:55:20,980 --> 01:55:21,980
to be.

1921
01:55:22,980 --> 01:55:24,460
is to survive.

1922
01:55:24,460 --> 01:55:27,100
The Aquatopia will show us the way.

1923
01:55:27,100 --> 01:55:28,700
But the Aquatopia in the park.

1924
01:55:28,700 --> 01:55:30,420
I think that's a good idea.

1925
01:55:30,420 --> 01:55:32,980
They're like little Wi-Fi vehicles basically.

1926
01:55:32,980 --> 01:55:34,860
And then it's a self-driving car.

1927
01:55:34,860 --> 01:55:35,860
Self-driving car.

1928
01:55:35,860 --> 01:55:38,320
Thinking because it's also like it's not actually that deep.

1929
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:39,740
It's a very shallow pool.

1930
01:55:39,740 --> 01:55:40,740
Yeah.

1931
01:55:40,740 --> 01:55:41,740
But that's a good little trick.

1932
01:55:41,740 --> 01:55:43,860
You think you're on a real lagoon or something.

1933
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:44,860
Right?

1934
01:55:44,860 --> 01:55:45,860
No, I think that's great.

1935
01:55:45,860 --> 01:55:48,700
I think it's like the same technology as like the Luigi's Roadsters.

1936
01:55:48,700 --> 01:55:49,700
Yes.

1937
01:55:49,700 --> 01:55:50,700
Yeah.

1938
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:54,420
I mean, I looked it up the second trackless ride, the first being Pooh's Honey Hunt.

1939
01:55:54,420 --> 01:55:55,420
Oh, right.

1940
01:55:55,420 --> 01:55:56,420
Still upset.

1941
01:55:56,420 --> 01:55:58,500
But there's only five that have actually opened.

1942
01:55:58,500 --> 01:56:00,060
Yeah, it's still few.

1943
01:56:00,060 --> 01:56:01,060
And then, yeah, Star Wars.

1944
01:56:01,060 --> 01:56:04,540
Mystic Man, Red Tetsui, and Star Wars will be.

1945
01:56:04,540 --> 01:56:05,540
Yeah.

1946
01:56:05,540 --> 01:56:06,540
OK.

1947
01:56:06,540 --> 01:56:07,540
They're cool.

1948
01:56:07,540 --> 01:56:08,540
I'm glad they're happening.

1949
01:56:08,540 --> 01:56:09,540
But this is a very good one.

1950
01:56:09,540 --> 01:56:10,540
I love Aquatopia.

1951
01:56:10,540 --> 01:56:12,500
At night, we did it once at night.

1952
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:13,500
Very good.

1953
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:14,500
Yeah.

1954
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:15,500
Very fun.

1955
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:16,500
You've got that.

1956
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:18,700
It looks like the best of our Tomorrowland in a way.

1957
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:24,420
The most realized version of weird future past little strips of neon.

1958
01:56:24,420 --> 01:56:26,620
That little zone and with the Nemo ride.

1959
01:56:26,620 --> 01:56:28,140
Port Discovery, I think it's called.

1960
01:56:28,140 --> 01:56:29,660
It is called Port Discovery, I believe.

1961
01:56:29,660 --> 01:56:30,660
Very fond of Port Disco.

1962
01:56:30,660 --> 01:56:31,660
I don't know.

1963
01:56:31,660 --> 01:56:32,660
What's my favorite port?

1964
01:56:32,660 --> 01:56:36,620
Probably New York, but well aboard the volcano itself.

1965
01:56:36,620 --> 01:56:39,740
I guess it's got to be the volcano.

1966
01:56:39,740 --> 01:56:44,900
Port Discovery is, no, Discovery Bay is what Tony's flight thing was going to be at the

1967
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:47,300
Star Wars land is in Disneyland.

1968
01:56:47,300 --> 01:56:49,300
So they've stolen Stellatus.

1969
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:51,620
I mean, stolen in a good way from his.

1970
01:56:51,620 --> 01:56:54,300
This whole thing feels like this must be Tony's dream.

1971
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:57,820
Like a lot of it feels like what he was trying to bring to the parks.

1972
01:56:57,820 --> 01:56:58,820
Yeah.

1973
01:56:58,820 --> 01:57:01,500
Prometheus, especially with all the Jules Verne shit that he's obsessed with.

1974
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:02,500
Yeah.

1975
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:03,500
Yeah.

1976
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:05,980
I'm almost glad we didn't hear more of his thoughts on it because I didn't want to spoil.

1977
01:57:05,980 --> 01:57:07,860
But he must be very excited about this.

1978
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:09,140
I don't think he worked on it really.

1979
01:57:09,140 --> 01:57:10,620
But yeah, I don't think so.

1980
01:57:10,620 --> 01:57:11,620
Although who knows?

1981
01:57:11,620 --> 01:57:13,020
He could be like they did it all wrong.

1982
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:14,620
He was so funny.

1983
01:57:15,340 --> 01:57:16,700
Yeah, because he'll throw stuff under the bus.

1984
01:57:16,700 --> 01:57:20,540
I just heard one of those season passes where he was like, he really like let something

1985
01:57:20,540 --> 01:57:21,540
have it.

1986
01:57:21,540 --> 01:57:22,540
I forget what.

1987
01:57:22,540 --> 01:57:26,060
I mean, he was he was he was mad about the name Condor Flats.

1988
01:57:26,060 --> 01:57:30,740
Oh, that's a that's a different podcast, I think, which I've also listened to where he

1989
01:57:30,740 --> 01:57:38,060
was saying the theming at Condor Flats wasn't wasn't easy to add rides to because in Tomorrowland

1990
01:57:38,060 --> 01:57:41,040
or Adventureland, you know what type of rides, but Condor Flats.

1991
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:42,040
What does that mean?

1992
01:57:42,040 --> 01:57:43,040
Yeah.

1993
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:44,600
He was kidnapped by a bird.

1994
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:47,920
He also threw some shade at Pleasure Island on that.

1995
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:48,920
That's what I was thinking of.

1996
01:57:48,920 --> 01:57:49,920
Yes.

1997
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:55,720
He goofed on the plaques that we goofed on about Merryweather Pleasure and all the backstory.

1998
01:57:55,720 --> 01:57:56,720
He's right.

1999
01:57:56,720 --> 01:57:57,720
They're disconnected.

2000
01:57:57,720 --> 01:57:58,720
It's a fun story.

2001
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:01,520
But yeah, I've I'm of course of two minds.

2002
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:02,520
That's just too much.

2003
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:06,000
Yeah, but let's get the themed attractions podcast.

2004
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Oh, yeah.

2005
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Oh, that's what it is.

2006
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Yeah.

2007
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,360
podcast interviewing professionals.

2008
01:58:10,360 --> 01:58:11,360
Yeah.

2009
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:16,200
If you want people who know what they're talking about and know the Imagineers and won't bother

2010
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:21,480
them with dumb ride pitches like we did, listen to that podcast.

2011
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:27,400
And I believe someone who hosts is affiliated with the company that invited us to look at

2012
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:28,400
fake rocks.

2013
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:29,400
Yes, that's right.

2014
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:30,400
Oh, boy.

2015
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:32,680
So preview of a future episode.

2016
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:35,720
You might get to hear us talk about looking at fake rocks.

2017
01:58:35,720 --> 01:58:36,720
That's right.

2018
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:37,720
Still develop it.

2019
01:58:37,720 --> 01:58:38,720
Yes.

2020
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:40,720
Still in the incubation tanks.

2021
01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:42,360
All right.

2022
01:58:42,360 --> 01:58:43,360
Aquatopia.

2023
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:44,360
Great.

2024
01:58:44,360 --> 01:58:45,360
Number six.

2025
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:46,720
Very excited to talk about this.

2026
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:49,480
Roger Rabbit's cartoon spin.

2027
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:50,480
Oh, interesting.

2028
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:51,960
I didn't do it.

2029
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:56,600
I owe this ride a big apology.

2030
01:58:56,600 --> 01:59:02,800
I mean, I don't because the Disneyland version is not what it could be.

2031
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:05,200
If there's a mode, that's the best.

2032
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:06,520
And then B mode and C mode.

2033
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:08,080
I think it's in C mode.

2034
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:09,080
Tokyo.

2035
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:14,600
I was hoping I would have the time.

2036
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:16,880
And here's what happened, by the way.

2037
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:22,320
The first night there, horrible, horrible weather, the only bad weather the entire vacation.

2038
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:23,880
We were like, can we even do this?

2039
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:25,320
Maybe we got to get out of here.

2040
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:26,320
This really sucks.

2041
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:27,920
But we're in Disneyland now.

2042
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:28,920
We're paying for it.

2043
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:30,800
Maybe we should wait it out.

2044
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:33,040
Then rain lets up a little bit.

2045
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:37,000
Everybody goes to everyone in the park goes to watch the projection mapping show on the

2046
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:42,480
castle, thus giving us Fantasyland and Toontown to ourselves.

2047
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:44,440
We were the only people.

2048
01:59:44,440 --> 01:59:49,040
Thus Pinocchio, Snow White, Peter Pan, no wait.

2049
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:54,360
I mean, literally, we walked in and sat on the vehicle and it started.

2050
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:56,920
Peter Pan had no wait.

2051
01:59:56,920 --> 01:59:57,920
This was insane.

2052
01:59:57,920 --> 02:00:00,560
This, I think it helped us do this in less.

2053
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:03,920
Maybe you do need four days if it's crowded as shit.

2054
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:07,320
We had this lucky night where we just jumped on everything.

2055
02:00:07,320 --> 02:00:08,320
That is key.

2056
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:09,320
Yeah.

2057
02:00:09,320 --> 02:00:13,960
We really missed things for three and three and a half days.

2058
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:17,560
I could see why you would have because on the Saturday we were there, Fantasyland was

2059
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:18,560
a hellscape.

2060
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:19,560
It was horrible.

2061
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:27,200
There was this famous crowded area, the crosswalks, Shibuya crossing, where 19 directions all

2062
02:00:27,200 --> 02:00:29,120
cross at once.

2063
02:00:29,120 --> 02:00:32,160
There was a part of Disneyland that was much worse than that.

2064
02:00:32,160 --> 02:00:35,680
It was just because that's where the fast pass for Small World was.

2065
02:00:35,680 --> 02:00:36,680
We could not move.

2066
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:37,680
It was horrible.

2067
02:00:37,680 --> 02:00:43,080
But, we got to be there on this magical night where the weather had barely cleared up and

2068
02:00:43,080 --> 02:00:44,080
no one was in Toontown.

2069
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:46,520
So, we were in the gag factory by ourselves.

2070
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:49,040
We were in Minnie's house by ourselves.

2071
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:52,680
We just laid down for a while, sat on a nice chair.

2072
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:56,440
I pretended to do the dishes in Minnie's house.

2073
02:00:56,440 --> 02:00:57,440
It was great.

2074
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:59,320
But anyway, Roger Rapp was part of that.

2075
02:00:59,320 --> 02:01:02,480
I was like, oh, you know what we can do that I bet we wouldn't be able to do tomorrow?

2076
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:04,560
Roger Rapp, I've heard maybe it's better.

2077
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:07,000
It was so much better.

2078
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,360
No one was there by that point.

2079
02:01:08,360 --> 02:01:12,480
So, the employees were thanking us for picking their ride.

2080
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:14,320
You're here.

2081
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:15,320
Come on in.

2082
02:01:15,320 --> 02:01:17,680
Hurry, go.

2083
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:21,400
We still had to do the, even though no one was there, we had to do the entire queue.

2084
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:26,680
But that claustrophobic queue that I complained about for so long, we're in by ourselves,

2085
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:29,200
running through it, looking at everything.

2086
02:01:30,120 --> 02:01:31,120
We're in our pictures.

2087
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:32,120
Hey, great.

2088
02:01:32,120 --> 02:01:34,640
We have this to ourselves, not claustrophobic at all.

2089
02:01:34,640 --> 02:01:35,640
Plus, the lighting's better.

2090
02:01:35,640 --> 02:01:37,160
Plus, the paint's better.

2091
02:01:37,160 --> 02:01:38,880
Then we get on the ride.

2092
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:43,040
The control you have of those vehicles is incredible.

2093
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:46,880
It's like those in California, they're molasses.

2094
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:53,160
In Japan, it was such precise control that Aaron and I, it's kind of a cab and another

2095
02:01:53,160 --> 02:01:55,640
cab and we just each took one to ourselves.

2096
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:57,880
We turned them to face each other.

2097
02:01:57,920 --> 02:02:03,160
We were just in the middle of the ride, just looking in each other's eyes for the entire,

2098
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:05,760
you had to adjust a little bit and kind of stay on it.

2099
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:08,200
But we were just locked eyes on this ride.

2100
02:02:08,200 --> 02:02:09,400
It was so weird.

2101
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:12,800
The most romantic moment of the trip, obviously.

2102
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:16,640
But we got off and immediately got back on again and they're cheering us.

2103
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:19,760
Yeah, one more.

2104
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:22,880
Everyone in line is celebrating our presence there.

2105
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:25,320
And also, everything worked.

2106
02:02:25,320 --> 02:02:26,720
The dip machine worked.

2107
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:27,760
It spit dip.

2108
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:30,360
The shit they haven't done in so long.

2109
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:32,040
It's spinning out of control.

2110
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:33,360
It's bright green.

2111
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:34,640
Every effect looks great.

2112
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:36,080
Roger Rabbit rocks.

2113
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:40,480
I am so sorry that I trashed it for so long, but you do have to go to the Japan one.

2114
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:41,480
Man, that sucks.

2115
02:02:41,480 --> 02:02:42,480
It's just a little better.

2116
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:43,480
We had to do it.

2117
02:02:43,480 --> 02:02:46,120
Next time you go, yes, I'm sorry to make you jealous.

2118
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:47,120
No, that's okay.

2119
02:02:47,120 --> 02:02:49,560
I got to do poo, so we did poo twice.

2120
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:54,600
Oh boy, you got a big one on your list that I don't.

2121
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:57,680
Next time, Roger Rabbit's cartoon spin rules.

2122
02:02:57,680 --> 02:02:59,440
Number five, Monsters Inc.

2123
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:00,440
Ride and seek.

2124
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:01,440
It's great.

2125
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:02,440
It's undeniable.

2126
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:03,440
What a fun.

2127
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:04,440
It's good.

2128
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:08,440
I didn't love the flashlight stuff as much.

2129
02:03:08,440 --> 02:03:09,440
Oh, how so?

2130
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:10,440
What do you mean?

2131
02:03:10,440 --> 02:03:11,440
Too much.

2132
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:14,960
I wanted to appreciate the robots more.

2133
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:18,480
The flashlight is shooting at the robots of the monsters.

2134
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:20,120
I felt like I want to enjoy this more.

2135
02:03:20,120 --> 02:03:21,120
Too much busy work.

2136
02:03:21,120 --> 02:03:23,120
You could have just sat there.

2137
02:03:23,120 --> 02:03:24,120
That's true.

2138
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:26,640
There was no scoring mechanism either.

2139
02:03:26,640 --> 02:03:29,640
I wanted a score of some kind.

2140
02:03:29,640 --> 02:03:33,640
Well, I think your only reward is making that little ding sound.

2141
02:03:33,640 --> 02:03:38,640
If you haven't done this ride, it's sort of like a shooting ride.

2142
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:40,640
But for kids, it's tamer.

2143
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:41,640
It's not a gun.

2144
02:03:41,640 --> 02:03:43,640
You have a flashlight and you're pointing at little Monsters Inc.

2145
02:03:43,640 --> 02:03:44,640
Ms.

2146
02:03:44,640 --> 02:03:47,640
Mostly on hats, but sometimes in other places.

2147
02:03:47,640 --> 02:03:50,640
And what it does, I guess, is trigger an effect.

2148
02:03:50,640 --> 02:03:53,640
It opens a drawer and you get to see a monster that you wouldn't

2149
02:03:54,160 --> 02:03:56,160
see if nobody pointed their flashlight at it.

2150
02:03:56,160 --> 02:03:57,160
Right.

2151
02:03:57,160 --> 02:04:00,160
But I felt like I was on the spot to do it.

2152
02:04:00,160 --> 02:04:01,160
We only did it once, I guess.

2153
02:04:01,160 --> 02:04:02,160
I should have done it a second time.

2154
02:04:02,160 --> 02:04:03,160
Great robots.

2155
02:04:03,160 --> 02:04:04,160
Very good ride.

2156
02:04:04,160 --> 02:04:07,160
I just was not as excited about it.

2157
02:04:07,160 --> 02:04:08,160
Sure.

2158
02:04:08,160 --> 02:04:09,160
That's all I'll say.

2159
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:11,160
Well, then you might be OK with it.

2160
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:14,160
I actually thought you would have the biggest problem with what I'm

2161
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:15,160
about to say.

2162
02:04:15,160 --> 02:04:16,160
Heading for next.

2163
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:19,160
I actually thought you would like that ride a lot and that you wouldn't like where I'm

2164
02:04:19,160 --> 02:04:21,160
ranking the next ride ahead of it.

2165
02:04:21,160 --> 02:04:22,160
Interesting.

2166
02:04:22,680 --> 02:04:26,680
But here, I'll just go into it now, knowing it'll be received better.

2167
02:04:26,680 --> 02:04:29,680
Number four, Sanrio character boat ride.

2168
02:04:29,680 --> 02:04:30,680
Oh, yeah.

2169
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:31,680
Yeah.

2170
02:04:31,680 --> 02:04:32,680
No, I'm not mad about that.

2171
02:04:32,680 --> 02:04:33,680
Hey, great.

2172
02:04:33,680 --> 02:04:37,680
I thought you would have I was like Michael like Monsters Inc a lot and just that'll

2173
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:38,680
be like too much of a leap.

2174
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:42,680
But we both I think we Monsters Inc, I guess, was a little hyped up maybe for us too.

2175
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:45,680
So I think both of us kind of left it going like, oh, good.

2176
02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:48,680
But like I wasn't not like poo or not like any of the other ones.

2177
02:04:48,680 --> 02:04:49,680
Sure.

2178
02:04:49,680 --> 02:04:50,680
Sure.

2179
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:51,680
Yeah.

2180
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:55,200
It's really something.

2181
02:04:55,200 --> 02:05:01,200
It's yeah, it's the best of it's it's junkie in a lot of places.

2182
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:04,200
It's a junkie, weird little ride.

2183
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:05,200
The end of it is pretty good.

2184
02:05:05,200 --> 02:05:08,200
The end of it is like, OK, here we go.

2185
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:09,200
Yes.

2186
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:12,200
All of the characters in their Sunday finest.

2187
02:05:12,200 --> 02:05:15,200
If I could describe the story of the ride and you know what?

2188
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:19,200
A lot of places said this is kind of this weird small world rip off.

2189
02:05:19,200 --> 02:05:20,200
No way.

2190
02:05:20,200 --> 02:05:22,720
It is not that it has a great story.

2191
02:05:22,720 --> 02:05:24,600
Hello Kitty wants to have a party.

2192
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:29,760
She sends heart shaped invitations to you in the line and every all of her friends in

2193
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:31,280
the Sanrio universe.

2194
02:05:31,280 --> 02:05:36,080
You get to see them all at the magical moment that they got the invitation to her party.

2195
02:05:36,080 --> 02:05:41,600
Then they all take flying machines to get to the party, each cuter than the last.

2196
02:05:41,600 --> 02:05:47,520
And then you go to the party, which is she's in kind of a wedding dress, but it's not a

2197
02:05:47,560 --> 02:05:48,560
wedding.

2198
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:52,960
And her boyfriend is also dressed up, but they don't kiss or anything.

2199
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:56,360
And her parents are there, but it's just a regular party.

2200
02:05:56,360 --> 02:05:59,360
Everybody just wanted to see Hello Kitty wearing a nice dress.

2201
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:00,360
And they do.

2202
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:01,360
And everyone goes home happy.

2203
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:02,360
Yeah, it's weird.

2204
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:05,320
It belongs on the list.

2205
02:06:05,320 --> 02:06:08,440
It's very strange.

2206
02:06:08,440 --> 02:06:13,320
I like how I'm trying to remember now back to it because it's been a little while.

2207
02:06:13,320 --> 02:06:17,280
I do feel like the first part of it is like, oh, is this going to be like grow?

2208
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:20,480
There's a gross feeling maybe initially where I'm like, some of these don't feel like they've

2209
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:23,000
been kept up the animatronics.

2210
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:27,520
But I like that too, because you're like feeling like you're because a junkie not kept up boat

2211
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:28,520
ride is fun too.

2212
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:31,680
Although I don't think I felt that I felt the magic.

2213
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:34,080
I felt the I had no problem with the cleanliness.

2214
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:38,120
I felt I don't mean it wasn't clean, but it felt like a little like old.

2215
02:06:38,120 --> 02:06:40,760
It felt a little tired maybe initially.

2216
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:44,760
Although it is a revamp, it has not always been Sanrio character boat ride.

2217
02:06:44,760 --> 02:06:45,760
Yes, I've read that.

2218
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,320
The name is a lot of what I love about it.

2219
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:52,640
I love the bluntness, just the descriptive nature.

2220
02:06:52,640 --> 02:06:54,880
A fun ride for you to go on today.

2221
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:55,880
Mm hmm.

2222
02:06:55,880 --> 02:06:57,960
Uh, no, I we really liked it.

2223
02:06:57,960 --> 02:07:01,040
I got to watch the ride through again to really remember my feelings about it.

2224
02:07:01,040 --> 02:07:04,240
It was the last thing we did in the day to we're a little tired, but I was like, oh,

2225
02:07:04,240 --> 02:07:05,240
that's great.

2226
02:07:05,240 --> 02:07:06,240
We needed to do that.

2227
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:07,240
It's an overwhelming place to be.

2228
02:07:07,240 --> 02:07:08,240
Yeah.

2229
02:07:08,240 --> 02:07:12,280
What better way to end it than with a boat ride, which I also I love indoor boat rides.

2230
02:07:12,280 --> 02:07:21,240
It gave me such shades of, uh, um, the, you know, Norway and Mexico, like claustrophobic

2231
02:07:21,240 --> 02:07:24,240
fake indoor sky, even though you're outside.

2232
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:28,680
I love that there's ride scenes and then you're just in the regular lobby and watching people

2233
02:07:28,680 --> 02:07:30,720
shop and eat, but you're on a boat.

2234
02:07:30,720 --> 02:07:36,160
Yeah, because it goes, it has that feeling of like a weird, not that I've even been there,

2235
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:40,440
but like Mall of America where you're zooming in and out, but it's just, you're going through

2236
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:43,840
normal places, but you're also in like a world, a special world.

2237
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:47,040
So it's, it's inconsistent in what the reality might be.

2238
02:07:47,040 --> 02:07:50,260
But then of course there's so many great fake rocks in Piroland.

2239
02:07:50,260 --> 02:07:51,260
So you think rocks are good.

2240
02:07:51,260 --> 02:07:52,640
You've got all that great stuff.

2241
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:58,320
Fake hill, good, like magic, a little like a fiber optic kind of stars and fireworks

2242
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:00,120
that really come to life during the show.

2243
02:08:00,120 --> 02:08:02,400
We will get to Sanrio Piroland.

2244
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:05,720
Even now I feel like I can't talk about it a lot, but really fast.

2245
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:10,920
The thing that bumps this up ahead of some Disney ones is that Disney rides are never

2246
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:13,640
going to give you Japanese weirdness.

2247
02:08:13,640 --> 02:08:20,720
And this ride has Japanese weirdness, especially in the area of the character, Bad Batsmaru.

2248
02:08:20,720 --> 02:08:27,840
There is a penguin who is mean and has spiky hair and he does bad things in this ride,

2249
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:29,120
legitimately bad.

2250
02:08:29,120 --> 02:08:31,240
He's no good boy.

2251
02:08:31,240 --> 02:08:35,080
When he, you've seen all these adorable characters get their invitations.

2252
02:08:35,080 --> 02:08:38,040
The frogs get their invitations and they're leaping around.

2253
02:08:38,040 --> 02:08:39,040
Hooray.

2254
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:42,400
When he gets his invite, he's up to his bad tricks.

2255
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:49,520
He's gambling, he's smoking cigars and very, perhaps in the strangest scene in any ride

2256
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:54,000
in Japan, he is spying on a woman in a dressing room.

2257
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:59,880
She is like, she has, she's like up, she's a bigger woman, I think a cat or something.

2258
02:08:59,880 --> 02:09:05,320
And she has, she has like a workout clothes on and he's behind a mirror, like trying

2259
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:06,320
to get a peek.

2260
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:07,320
He's like a peeping Tom.

2261
02:09:07,320 --> 02:09:08,320
That's actually on the crest.

2262
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:09,800
So that's on all the money.

2263
02:09:09,800 --> 02:09:14,360
If you would look closely at the yen, that's a national pass.

2264
02:09:14,360 --> 02:09:15,680
My bills were too small.

2265
02:09:15,680 --> 02:09:23,760
If I had had the 20,000, yeah, I would have seen up skirts on the currency.

2266
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:25,760
Really weird, but also very, it feels very Japanese.

2267
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:29,120
The fact that they are a little more like out there with their perversions a little bit

2268
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:33,440
that this children's ride has weird like voyeurism.

2269
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:34,440
So crazy.

2270
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:35,440
It's the, yeah.

2271
02:09:35,440 --> 02:09:36,440
I think that's the thing.

2272
02:09:36,440 --> 02:09:39,040
Maybe the one of the other things about Tokyo Disney that I was like hoping a little bit

2273
02:09:39,040 --> 02:09:44,920
more of that vibe snuck in, which it does in places, but not overall.

2274
02:09:44,920 --> 02:09:49,220
Like this, yeah, this feels like, this feels like a totally different tone.

2275
02:09:49,220 --> 02:09:50,720
This is a different vibe.

2276
02:09:50,720 --> 02:09:54,000
And this is still a children's, supposedly a children's thing.

2277
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:57,800
I watched an anime while you were gone as well, Scott.

2278
02:09:58,480 --> 02:10:00,320
Night is short walk on girl.

2279
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:05,440
And it's so fast pace and like mostly delightful.

2280
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:11,120
But then every now and then there is a weird little bit of horniness like that.

2281
02:10:11,120 --> 02:10:14,560
So I, yes, I understand what you're talking about.

2282
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:18,800
It's kind of like younger skewing, but like, no, well, it's about like college.

2283
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:23,080
It's about like one, it's a one crazy night kind of movie.

2284
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:31,640
Yeah, it's about like a guy who has a crush on a girl and she's just trying to enjoy it.

2285
02:10:31,640 --> 02:10:35,440
They're both enjoying like this nighttime festival and he's trying to get like this

2286
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:37,880
children's book he knows she loves.

2287
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:39,360
And then it gets crazy.

2288
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:43,720
Like there's no, there's very little cohesive plot besides that.

2289
02:10:43,720 --> 02:10:45,960
And then there's a crazy gangster.

2290
02:10:45,960 --> 02:10:49,000
There's crazy pop up plays happening.

2291
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:50,600
There's spirits.

2292
02:10:50,600 --> 02:10:51,600
It's insane.

2293
02:10:51,600 --> 02:10:54,360
Like, yeah, there's a little bit of weird horniness.

2294
02:10:54,360 --> 02:10:56,360
Kind of.

2295
02:10:56,360 --> 02:10:59,600
But I do recommend it was very fun.

2296
02:10:59,600 --> 02:11:00,880
OK, neat.

2297
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:09,480
Well, the payoff actually, you know, well, what I'll say in terms of maybe the only place

2298
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:15,400
in Disney where I felt a little more of the like oddness harshness was Pinocchio's Daring

2299
02:11:15,400 --> 02:11:18,280
Journey, which is very well done there.

2300
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:22,920
That's Aaron's favorite ride in any of the parks, although probably at this point it's

2301
02:11:22,920 --> 02:11:24,720
Sanrio character boat ride.

2302
02:11:24,720 --> 02:11:28,760
But she always likes that it's a morality play that people do bad things and then they

2303
02:11:28,760 --> 02:11:29,880
get punished.

2304
02:11:29,880 --> 02:11:32,000
And that happens in the US one.

2305
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:35,040
But in the Japan one, a lot more cigar business.

2306
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:36,040
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2307
02:11:36,040 --> 02:11:42,120
I feel like there's like a very long room where you just are down going down cigar alley.

2308
02:11:42,120 --> 02:11:44,760
There's 10 different stores.

2309
02:11:44,760 --> 02:11:48,680
Indian after giant Indian storefront, smoking cigars.

2310
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:56,600
And then as a result, after that, the children who are turning into donkeys are much sadder.

2311
02:11:56,600 --> 02:11:59,200
They are crying thick tears.

2312
02:11:59,200 --> 02:12:00,760
They're like gelatinous.

2313
02:12:00,760 --> 02:12:04,360
They are so much more upset and just wailing.

2314
02:12:04,360 --> 02:12:06,840
It's a much more upsetting version.

2315
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:11,000
Yeah, I remember this too, because it's more like the movie, honestly.

2316
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:12,720
The movie is very upsetting.

2317
02:12:12,720 --> 02:12:13,720
Yeah, it's.

2318
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:16,080
And it's pretty upsetting on the Disneyland, right?

2319
02:12:16,080 --> 02:12:18,000
But I do remember there was like, yeah, more.

2320
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:21,400
This is much more upsetting than they're much more comfortable with it.

2321
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:23,440
That's how what really feels about actors, right?

2322
02:12:23,440 --> 02:12:25,920
Hi, Italy, the actors like for me like that.

2323
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:27,800
But you're near do wells.

2324
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:33,860
Yeah, just like smoke and or Jack brain jackasses.

2325
02:12:33,860 --> 02:12:35,360
It's all a metaphor for them.

2326
02:12:35,360 --> 02:12:39,960
Them going into Pleasure Island is a metaphor for them joining a union.

2327
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:41,240
Sure.

2328
02:12:41,240 --> 02:12:44,440
If you look at just the letters in union or flickering on the pleasure,

2329
02:12:44,440 --> 02:12:48,800
or even just United Artists, like you can just like, what do you mean?

2330
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:49,880
They own the play.

2331
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:52,360
What do you mean? Chaplin and Pickford owns the place.

2332
02:12:52,360 --> 02:12:54,080
They're all a bunch of fatty our buckles.

2333
02:12:56,320 --> 02:12:58,360
Drunken exploits.

2334
02:12:58,360 --> 02:13:02,680
So to that end, just like Pinocchio, horrible things happening and then punishments.

2335
02:13:02,680 --> 02:13:04,760
Bad Bats Maru spying on the woman.

2336
02:13:04,760 --> 02:13:08,160
But then in the next scene, she has him.

2337
02:13:08,160 --> 02:13:09,520
She caught him.

2338
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,760
He is over her knee and she is spanking him.

2339
02:13:13,440 --> 02:13:16,240
OK, that's a heightening punishment.

2340
02:13:17,360 --> 02:13:21,600
If I think I don't know much about Bad Bats Maru, but I think he might be

2341
02:13:21,600 --> 02:13:23,520
he might not consider that a punishment.

2342
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:25,720
We've got to look into Bad Bats more.

2343
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:28,760
His his backstory and he might have.

2344
02:13:29,120 --> 02:13:32,160
Was he in the anime he watched?

2345
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:34,040
He was in Miami, too, for some reason.

2346
02:13:34,040 --> 02:13:36,200
Yeah, just just watching fucked up shit.

2347
02:13:36,360 --> 02:13:38,600
He just appears in the corner every once in a while.

2348
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:42,840
Then he is at the party, but he's by himself bitterly drinking.

2349
02:13:43,720 --> 02:13:48,040
Wow. He looks he's a little like all the other characters are upright and waving.

2350
02:13:48,040 --> 02:13:51,560
And then he's sort of leaning against the bar and sort of looks like he's a few in

2351
02:13:51,560 --> 02:13:56,280
and teetering. So a ride in which you get to see a bitter drunk.

2352
02:13:56,480 --> 02:13:59,040
Yeah, that's great. Something else. Sure.

2353
02:13:59,600 --> 02:14:02,400
So that brings us into the top three.

2354
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:07,040
I have little thoughts about other I mean, I could say my honorable mentions

2355
02:14:07,040 --> 02:14:09,760
really for we're pretty deep in this episode, I'd imagine. Oh, yeah.

2356
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:12,160
Yeah. I'm getting hungry. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2357
02:14:12,200 --> 02:14:15,400
All right. Well, then let me. OK.

2358
02:14:16,840 --> 02:14:17,720
All right. I'll just go.

2359
02:14:17,720 --> 02:14:20,120
I'll just go straight to the top three because I'm especially excited about

2360
02:14:20,120 --> 02:14:22,560
number three, the Tower of Terror.

2361
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:25,680
I did the Tower of Terror. Wow.

2362
02:14:25,680 --> 02:14:28,000
I braved the Tower of Terror.

2363
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,640
Thank you for your applause.

2364
02:14:29,640 --> 02:14:33,160
I was so excited to tell you that was the triumphant return.

2365
02:14:33,200 --> 02:14:36,640
I was in line for Tokyo Disney Sea, wondering, will I do it?

2366
02:14:37,600 --> 02:14:40,560
Aaron said, yes, you will do it and you will like it.

2367
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:45,720
All right. Well, that's in a in a person dominating bad bats.

2368
02:14:45,720 --> 02:14:49,600
Maru, like a cat bending man, that's a rule over me.

2369
02:14:50,200 --> 02:14:52,800
Like a penguin enduring his spanking.

2370
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:54,800
No, she informed me I'd be doing it.

2371
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:57,240
She was correct. Not that bad. Really not.

2372
02:14:57,240 --> 02:15:00,920
I hadn't done it. I think like Splash Man, a lot of fear had built up,

2373
02:15:01,400 --> 02:15:03,400
although I've also heard it's tamer. Can you attest?

2374
02:15:03,400 --> 02:15:04,480
It is tamer. Yes.

2375
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:06,920
Tamer than Florida? No.

2376
02:15:07,560 --> 02:15:09,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. No, I'm wrong.

2377
02:15:09,680 --> 02:15:11,040
Yeah, tamer than Florida for sure.

2378
02:15:11,040 --> 02:15:15,000
It feels like the first I know they're doing a crazier thing now.

2379
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:18,080
I think we said it where there's like a for teens where it goes much more up

2380
02:15:18,080 --> 02:15:22,280
and down, but it feels like the first ride profile that I ever went on for it.

2381
02:15:22,280 --> 02:15:26,200
It's short. OK, feels like a minute maybe or less.

2382
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:30,480
And we were disappointed in it because we're used to like the Guardians

2383
02:15:30,480 --> 02:15:31,840
and the one in Florida.

2384
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:34,720
And yeah, we were like, oh, that's oh, we wish it was a little longer.

2385
02:15:35,080 --> 02:15:36,000
So, yeah, very tame.

2386
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:40,480
My question now is, but maybe this stepped me up, though, where I could do.

2387
02:15:40,720 --> 02:15:41,880
Guardians, guardians.

2388
02:15:41,880 --> 02:15:44,640
How big of a leap do you think it is?

2389
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:49,440
Well, I always argue that the worst part of it is the anticipation.

2390
02:15:49,680 --> 02:15:54,040
Not that I'm some genius for for arguing that, but and that's what Lindsey says,

2391
02:15:54,040 --> 02:15:57,440
too, because it's so like the fear of like, oh, my God, it's going to drop.

2392
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:59,840
And then but that's gone with the Guardians, right?

2393
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:01,160
Because it shoots you right up.

2394
02:16:01,160 --> 02:16:02,760
We get a jolt right away.

2395
02:16:02,760 --> 02:16:04,920
But that feels like that feeling might be scary.

2396
02:16:06,040 --> 02:16:08,680
I'm the wrong person to talk to about that because I love it.

2397
02:16:08,720 --> 02:16:10,040
You like launches for that reason.

2398
02:16:10,040 --> 02:16:11,160
I'm obsessed with it now.

2399
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:14,400
And it's only in the last couple of years where I've gone on it so much that I like that.

2400
02:16:15,200 --> 02:16:17,640
But I mean, yeah, I don't know.

2401
02:16:17,640 --> 02:16:18,840
It's just kind of I don't know.

2402
02:16:18,840 --> 02:16:20,240
I just find it so fun.

2403
02:16:20,240 --> 02:16:24,320
Yeah. And it's anything that I was ever scared about with it was the drop itself.

2404
02:16:24,360 --> 02:16:26,120
Sure. So I think honestly, it's like

2405
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:28,760
it is a toot.

2406
02:16:28,760 --> 02:16:30,720
I don't know, two times more intense.

2407
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:31,960
A few times. What do you think?

2408
02:16:31,960 --> 02:16:34,720
You're distracted by the hits of the 70s, especially.

2409
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:35,720
Yeah, especially. Yeah.

2410
02:16:35,720 --> 02:16:39,400
The song starts playing and rocket plugs in and it's like very fun.

2411
02:16:39,440 --> 02:16:40,640
I feel like I could do. I might.

2412
02:16:40,640 --> 02:16:42,560
I think you can do. I don't I honestly, I don't think.

2413
02:16:43,320 --> 02:16:44,480
And I and you know what?

2414
02:16:44,480 --> 02:16:46,840
I not only did it the once I did it three times.

2415
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:48,000
I couldn't get enough.

2416
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,720
Oh, yeah. So we're going to do this.

2417
02:16:50,720 --> 02:16:52,080
All right. And then we'll do the episode.

2418
02:16:52,080 --> 02:16:52,760
Yeah, yeah.

2419
02:16:52,760 --> 02:16:53,840
The Guardians episode.

2420
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:55,400
Yeah, I probably need to do it before we do.

2421
02:16:55,400 --> 02:16:59,560
We'll do it. So when we go to Star Wars land proud, I have a bravery report to give.

2422
02:16:59,560 --> 02:17:00,760
And I'm so glad I did.

2423
02:17:00,760 --> 02:17:02,560
And the tower stuff is great.

2424
02:17:02,560 --> 02:17:04,320
We'll do a whole episode about it at some point.

2425
02:17:04,320 --> 02:17:08,440
But the tale of Harrison Hightower, the disappearing idol.

2426
02:17:08,560 --> 02:17:10,720
I don't know how they did it. So cool.

2427
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:13,680
This might be one for me.

2428
02:17:13,680 --> 02:17:15,560
Yeah, this might be two, actually. I think it's two.

2429
02:17:15,560 --> 02:17:16,920
That'd be fair. That'd be absolutely fair.

2430
02:17:16,920 --> 02:17:20,080
Yeah. I'd be curious to hear your top three after when I finished mine.

2431
02:17:20,080 --> 02:17:21,200
Although I think you would guess.

2432
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:22,720
Well, maybe not. I think I guess.

2433
02:17:22,760 --> 02:17:25,760
So, yeah, effects are amazing.

2434
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:27,600
I bought a little shriki keychain.

2435
02:17:27,600 --> 02:17:29,200
I love him.

2436
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:34,000
And I only am docking at a couple of points because I don't like when you go into a store

2437
02:17:34,160 --> 02:17:38,320
and the character based on Imagineer Joe Rody is presented as a god

2438
02:17:38,480 --> 02:17:41,520
being massaged and fed fruit by beautiful women.

2439
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:44,360
I I couldn't disagree more.

2440
02:17:45,160 --> 02:17:47,880
I can't imagine anything I would spend on faster.

2441
02:17:48,440 --> 02:17:50,640
That's not for sale. You're saying that's decoration.

2442
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:52,080
That's embedded in the wall.

2443
02:17:52,080 --> 02:17:55,640
That's what the thing we were upset with with the gift shop is that we wanted some

2444
02:17:55,640 --> 02:17:58,960
Harrison puppet or merch or figure.

2445
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:04,560
Same thing with Sinbad. Sinbad doesn't have a plush or a dog or Shandu is everywhere,

2446
02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:06,960
but you can't get a good Sinbad toy.

2447
02:18:06,960 --> 02:18:10,600
Yeah. And the same thing with Harrison Hightower, where the idol is in there.

2448
02:18:10,880 --> 02:18:13,760
But we were like we loved Harrison Hightower so much.

2449
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:17,280
But and is, of course, his manservant, Smelding.

2450
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:19,720
I what's I missed Smelding.

2451
02:18:19,720 --> 02:18:22,840
So in the queue, did you do Fastpass all the time or did you?

2452
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:23,960
I did Fastpass.

2453
02:18:23,960 --> 02:18:26,560
Oh, yeah, you may have been you may have missed out.

2454
02:18:26,560 --> 02:18:29,960
Because when you're we did it twice, we did one Fastpass, one regular.

2455
02:18:29,960 --> 02:18:33,280
And there's so much wonderful art in the main

2456
02:18:33,680 --> 02:18:38,200
lobby of him pillaging famous things from like

2457
02:18:38,760 --> 02:18:43,120
like a piece of Stonehenge or something or him and Smelding Smelding,

2458
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:46,520
like hanging from the basket like this meek looking dude

2459
02:18:46,720 --> 02:18:51,000
who is like helping him steal from like Aborigine or aboriginal people.

2460
02:18:51,360 --> 02:18:56,840
Like it's such a crazy bit of like amazing paintings

2461
02:18:56,840 --> 02:19:03,080
of him just destroying old artifacts and old whatever you I don't know.

2462
02:19:03,080 --> 02:19:06,720
OK, so by the end, when you see him, you're happy.

2463
02:19:06,720 --> 02:19:08,520
How did in this awful way?

2464
02:19:08,520 --> 02:19:11,320
It's like, you know, you know, he's like a villainous.

2465
02:19:11,320 --> 02:19:13,440
Yes. And I also think it's crazy.

2466
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:17,040
When we were outside in the queue, there's all these female,

2467
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:20,000
like very busty female statues.

2468
02:19:20,240 --> 02:19:24,320
Oh, so like not only is he's like really like Trumpian,

2469
02:19:24,320 --> 02:19:26,920
Trumpian building up a heel character.

2470
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:31,280
You're like, oh, this is guy who like thinks he's God's gift to women.

2471
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:34,320
And then you go inside and there's these immaculate paintings of him

2472
02:19:34,320 --> 02:19:37,720
doing the worst things to like historical landmarks.

2473
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:40,400
And like he has this like meek

2474
02:19:40,440 --> 02:19:44,080
manservant that I believe we want to play.

2475
02:19:44,440 --> 02:19:46,840
A listener did some art with me as smelding.

2476
02:19:46,840 --> 02:19:50,200
Yeah, I think we said Jason for smelding on the show.

2477
02:19:51,320 --> 02:19:52,400
OK, I miss this.

2478
02:19:52,400 --> 02:19:56,560
And there's a whole guestbook signed by a bunch of different rich people of the era.

2479
02:19:57,280 --> 02:20:01,480
So like going in that main queue, we were just so we were like

2480
02:20:01,480 --> 02:20:04,800
wanted more time with the main queue of looking at the art.

2481
02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:09,160
Yeah. So by the time he dies, it's totally justified.

2482
02:20:10,080 --> 02:20:11,120
He's a total asshole.

2483
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:14,080
So that, yeah, at the end, there's that newspaper clipping of him

2484
02:20:14,080 --> 02:20:17,880
with like women and like he's in the old time Scrooge McDuck bathing suits.

2485
02:20:18,480 --> 02:20:22,840
And it's like it's such a good it's crazy how much stuff they produced

2486
02:20:22,840 --> 02:20:25,720
to build up this guy as an evil shithead.

2487
02:20:26,680 --> 02:20:28,880
I am I am a little sorry I missed that.

2488
02:20:28,880 --> 02:20:34,040
Huh? Huh? Well, at the same time, it is nice to get a fast pass and not wait.

2489
02:20:34,080 --> 02:20:35,080
Yeah, sure.

2490
02:20:35,720 --> 02:20:38,560
Especially when you wind up wanting to do it three times.

2491
02:20:38,760 --> 02:20:39,840
This is what you're told.

2492
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:41,960
Like you're going to hate it, but then you're going to love it so much

2493
02:20:41,960 --> 02:20:43,200
and why can't get enough of it.

2494
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:44,560
And that's what happened to me with this ride.

2495
02:20:44,560 --> 02:20:47,480
Well, we'll do that on Guardians, because when we went with Anthony

2496
02:20:47,480 --> 02:20:49,600
Geo a couple of months ago, we did three in a row.

2497
02:20:49,600 --> 02:20:51,360
Guardians right at the start of the day.

2498
02:20:51,360 --> 02:20:53,400
Wow. I'm curious.

2499
02:20:53,400 --> 02:20:54,400
I think it'll be a little more.

2500
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:56,160
I think it'll be a little more for me to brave.

2501
02:20:56,160 --> 02:20:57,680
But you'll love you love pop music.

2502
02:20:57,680 --> 02:21:00,560
So you'll be good at the adventure of what song you'll get.

2503
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:02,800
Yes, true. Yeah.

2504
02:21:02,800 --> 02:21:06,760
OK, number two, Sinbad's storybook voyage.

2505
02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:10,960
I'm putting it to we've talked about it a lot.

2506
02:21:10,960 --> 02:21:13,960
It influenced the trip and made it easier for me to come home.

2507
02:21:13,960 --> 02:21:16,600
It was heartwarming. I teared up, went on it twice.

2508
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:20,160
I bought a chandu. I got you a chandu.

2509
02:21:20,160 --> 02:21:24,360
I want to remember him forever when he pounces on the drum.

2510
02:21:24,360 --> 02:21:25,480
Oh, yeah.

2511
02:21:25,480 --> 02:21:28,400
We'll do a whole episode about this.

2512
02:21:28,400 --> 02:21:31,600
I will say my thoughts more later.

2513
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:35,240
But oh, my God, the scope of it and seeing this town

2514
02:21:35,360 --> 02:21:39,000
supporting each other on both really at the end.

2515
02:21:39,280 --> 02:21:43,440
It's also so, so funny how heartwarming it is.

2516
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:45,280
Like we wish you well.

2517
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:48,520
And then he returns and we're so glad you did well.

2518
02:21:48,720 --> 02:21:52,640
It is just one note of love for eight minutes.

2519
02:21:52,840 --> 02:21:55,560
It's so insanely positive.

2520
02:21:55,560 --> 02:21:59,200
Every scene a triumph for Sinbad, every scene.

2521
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:00,640
He faces no adversity.

2522
02:22:00,640 --> 02:22:03,560
You've come in at the moment that he has triumphed.

2523
02:22:03,600 --> 02:22:05,920
He has. He's probably a little bit of adversity,

2524
02:22:05,920 --> 02:22:07,080
but we don't even have to see that.

2525
02:22:07,080 --> 02:22:09,960
We just know he's succeeded yet again and he's turned everyone around.

2526
02:22:09,960 --> 02:22:13,200
And everyone's now he's playing musical instruments at every scene.

2527
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:15,120
He's singing this glorious song.

2528
02:22:15,120 --> 02:22:17,400
And then he gets home and you're like, wow, what a success.

2529
02:22:17,440 --> 02:22:18,760
Wow. A bunch of monkeys.

2530
02:22:18,760 --> 02:22:21,960
I wonder if he had any trouble, you know, getting in with them.

2531
02:22:21,960 --> 02:22:24,440
Or is one of them is one of them trying to like pull him apart?

2532
02:22:24,560 --> 02:22:27,560
No, he has joined their monkey drumming band

2533
02:22:27,720 --> 02:22:30,400
and is probably better at drumming than they are instantly.

2534
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:33,000
Yes. I like the musician focus with which he's

2535
02:22:33,400 --> 02:22:34,760
Yeah. Yeah.

2536
02:22:34,760 --> 02:22:39,280
He's he faces no adversity is great from second one till second last.

2537
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:40,600
And it's a great ride.

2538
02:22:40,600 --> 02:22:44,960
And did I upgrade this song to best Menken

2539
02:22:45,240 --> 02:22:48,320
over part of their world, part of your world?

2540
02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:50,720
Maybe I may have in the last few weeks.

2541
02:22:50,720 --> 02:22:52,520
I think I said maybe this is number one.

2542
02:22:52,520 --> 02:22:55,760
Well, all of my Disney tearing up was Menken related

2543
02:22:55,760 --> 02:23:00,200
because I also went to the mermaid lagoon theater show.

2544
02:23:00,200 --> 02:23:02,920
Oh, you with your flying aerial. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2545
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:07,640
And it's it's like if you heard that they have this amazing

2546
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:12,560
King Triton's concert show with The Little Mermaid, where

2547
02:23:13,080 --> 02:23:17,200
she's on wires and flipping around and the precision of it

2548
02:23:17,200 --> 02:23:21,160
and how close she can get to the audience and then screens with the sisters

2549
02:23:21,160 --> 02:23:23,480
and great puppets of flounder and Sebastian.

2550
02:23:23,640 --> 02:23:27,920
If there was a Little Mermaid musical in your town and it was that

2551
02:23:27,920 --> 02:23:31,520
you'd be telling everybody, holy shit, you got to see this Little Mermaid show.

2552
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:35,120
Yeah, it's Broadway. It's above Broadway caliber. It's so great.

2553
02:23:35,160 --> 02:23:38,000
It's a good version of Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark. Yes.

2554
02:23:38,040 --> 02:23:40,400
Because she doesn't fall.

2555
02:23:40,400 --> 02:23:45,000
Would would love an Ursula saying that a theater is surprisingly easy to break into.

2556
02:23:45,120 --> 02:23:47,480
Yeah, it's all only docket points for that.

2557
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:50,320
But yeah, yeah, I think you figured out by the end,

2558
02:23:50,320 --> 02:23:52,440
there's only two things that could have been the top two.

2559
02:23:52,960 --> 02:23:55,560
And it was it was a little bit of a tough choice,

2560
02:23:55,560 --> 02:23:58,920
but ultimately you got to go with number one ride in the country of Japan.

2561
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:01,200
Journey to the center of the earth.

2562
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:03,960
Holy fucking shit. What a ride.

2563
02:24:05,280 --> 02:24:07,080
I it's really great.

2564
02:24:07,080 --> 02:24:10,040
Mm hmm. I heard you had some qualms.

2565
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:11,840
It needed another room.

2566
02:24:11,840 --> 02:24:13,280
That's my feeling about it.

2567
02:24:13,280 --> 02:24:14,360
That's what I said.

2568
02:24:14,360 --> 02:24:16,400
Now we were going on the ride.

2569
02:24:16,400 --> 02:24:18,800
We were like, this is awesome. This is awesome.

2570
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:21,360
And it shoots out. You see this crazy lava monster.

2571
02:24:21,360 --> 02:24:23,360
You're like, oh, the amazing.

2572
02:24:23,360 --> 02:24:24,720
And then that's kind of it.

2573
02:24:24,720 --> 02:24:25,960
That's kind of the end of the ride.

2574
02:24:25,960 --> 02:24:28,000
Because you could do two more minutes like that.

2575
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:31,640
Yeah. So I think that's the only thing that I would mean.

2576
02:24:31,640 --> 02:24:33,960
It's my expectations, of course.

2577
02:24:33,960 --> 02:24:37,560
But yeah, you would docket points because it felt like, oh, holy shit.

2578
02:24:37,560 --> 02:24:39,080
Now what are we going to see?

2579
02:24:39,080 --> 02:24:41,280
And then you're kind of done. Yeah, sure.

2580
02:24:41,280 --> 02:24:43,400
You just kind of quietly get off and you go.

2581
02:24:43,400 --> 02:24:46,440
Yeah, you go down like a cool zipping fast tracky thing

2582
02:24:46,440 --> 02:24:48,120
through some cool fake rocks.

2583
02:24:48,120 --> 02:24:50,920
But that's it. Sure, sure.

2584
02:24:50,920 --> 02:24:52,680
Yeah, I'm with you on that.

2585
02:24:52,680 --> 02:24:55,400
I do just think that the I think

2586
02:24:56,200 --> 02:24:58,480
the the world building is so cool.

2587
02:24:58,480 --> 02:25:00,680
The line is incredible.

2588
02:25:00,680 --> 02:25:05,600
The terrors, which I realized go up.

2589
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:10,000
You're sent into these these these elevators that and there's all of

2590
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:14,680
there's like creepy smoky smells and it shakes around like mad.

2591
02:25:14,680 --> 02:25:16,640
And it seems like it's going haywire.

2592
02:25:16,640 --> 02:25:20,200
And you feel like you're falling all the way down, down into the center of the earth.

2593
02:25:20,440 --> 02:25:23,560
But then you realize, wait a minute, you unload from the top.

2594
02:25:23,720 --> 02:25:27,160
So it's an illusion that makes you think you're going way, way down

2595
02:25:27,160 --> 02:25:29,200
when, in fact, you're going up, which is pretty cool.

2596
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:31,240
Yes, that's really great.

2597
02:25:31,240 --> 02:25:33,120
A track ride system, right?

2598
02:25:33,120 --> 02:25:36,480
Test, track, great air, test track, slash, slash cars.

2599
02:25:36,480 --> 02:25:38,840
It's in that it's in that neck of the woods.

2600
02:25:38,840 --> 02:25:40,040
Breaks down a lot.

2601
02:25:40,040 --> 02:25:41,360
Does it really? Yeah.

2602
02:25:41,360 --> 02:25:43,760
That was the last fast pass we had for the whole trip.

2603
02:25:44,080 --> 02:25:46,960
And it broke down. Oh, bummer. Oh, no.

2604
02:25:46,960 --> 02:25:48,840
We did what we did it once the first day.

2605
02:25:48,840 --> 02:25:50,320
And then we were like, oh, great, this will be great.

2606
02:25:50,320 --> 02:25:52,440
We'll do that. The last thing we go on

2607
02:25:52,680 --> 02:25:54,160
before we have to go to the airport.

2608
02:25:54,160 --> 02:25:57,360
And it broke down and we like sat outside it for like a half hour

2609
02:25:57,360 --> 02:25:59,800
to see if it would come back up. And it did not.

2610
02:26:00,360 --> 02:26:03,080
That was over. Very sad.

2611
02:26:03,080 --> 02:26:05,120
But we got to do it once. I apologize for that.

2612
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:08,040
We got lucky with it and we did it four times. Oh, wow.

2613
02:26:08,160 --> 02:26:09,640
In choosing. Yeah. Yeah.

2614
02:26:09,640 --> 02:26:12,080
Somehow like fast passes earlier in the day.

2615
02:26:12,120 --> 02:26:16,160
I think you do if you're going to Tokyo, get in there, get fast passes right away.

2616
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:18,640
It's kind of a war when you get into the park and then you can relax.

2617
02:26:18,680 --> 02:26:20,680
But grab something as soon as you can. Yeah.

2618
02:26:20,680 --> 02:26:22,280
And then your day will be fine.

2619
02:26:22,440 --> 02:26:26,760
Yeah. These feel like very packed days, which I know you don't often like to do a lot.

2620
02:26:26,760 --> 02:26:28,040
Yeah, you're telling me.

2621
02:26:28,040 --> 02:26:30,320
Because of all this other stuff, because you got to meet characters,

2622
02:26:30,320 --> 02:26:32,720
you got to have treats. Yeah, we were way more front to back.

2623
02:26:32,720 --> 02:26:34,720
We had boundless energy.

2624
02:26:34,720 --> 02:26:37,480
We ended up with a very packed long episode, as I imagine we would.

2625
02:26:38,200 --> 02:26:40,360
But that ride was just like irresistible to me.

2626
02:26:40,360 --> 02:26:41,880
You're totally right about that.

2627
02:26:41,880 --> 02:26:45,280
However, those creatures you meet, it's, you know, yeah,

2628
02:26:45,280 --> 02:26:48,040
you meet friendly creatures, Daigle creatures, very E.T.

2629
02:26:48,160 --> 02:26:49,800
on the way down into the center of the earth.

2630
02:26:49,800 --> 02:26:52,120
And then it gets scary and there's explosions.

2631
02:26:52,120 --> 02:26:54,760
And there's lightning that you forget about every time.

2632
02:26:54,760 --> 02:26:56,000
Oh, God, that lightning.

2633
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
I thought I was prepped for it, but I'm not.

2634
02:26:58,000 --> 02:26:59,720
Then fire shooting out at you.

2635
02:26:59,720 --> 02:27:03,240
And when you round the corner and you see the lava monster.

2636
02:27:03,320 --> 02:27:05,680
Oh, my God. The scope of that thing.

2637
02:27:05,800 --> 02:27:09,200
So scary. Makes a big difference to sit in the front row,

2638
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:11,920
and especially in the seat closest to the monster.

2639
02:27:12,120 --> 02:27:16,320
Doug Jones, friend of the show, said, got to do front row on that thing.

2640
02:27:16,400 --> 02:27:19,080
And he gave me the translation, Ichiban Sekki.

2641
02:27:19,200 --> 02:27:20,920
And they were so excited.

2642
02:27:20,960 --> 02:27:24,200
I was like, was this am I going to seem like an American asshole bugging them?

2643
02:27:24,320 --> 02:27:27,120
They loved that I attempted to say those two words.

2644
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:29,880
They were like, oh, yes.

2645
02:27:29,880 --> 02:27:33,720
And like took me to the side and then ushered me. Here it is.

2646
02:27:33,960 --> 02:27:37,720
They were so delighted that like employees incredible this whole part.

2647
02:27:37,880 --> 02:27:39,640
And and that was the best moment.

2648
02:27:39,640 --> 02:27:42,640
I think the last ride we went on was me with the best seat in.

2649
02:27:43,560 --> 02:27:45,480
That's great. In Journey to the Center of the Earth.

2650
02:27:45,480 --> 02:27:47,400
That that drop is fantastic.

2651
02:27:47,400 --> 02:27:49,920
Again, sorry, I was a militant about spoilers,

2652
02:27:49,920 --> 02:27:53,320
but getting to go on that ride and having no idea what's going to happen.

2653
02:27:53,320 --> 02:27:54,400
Yeah, incredible.

2654
02:27:54,400 --> 02:27:56,200
Sorry if I ruined it for you, the listener.

2655
02:27:56,200 --> 02:27:59,600
Now I'm being selfish, but you just shouldn't listen to the episode in general.

2656
02:28:00,280 --> 02:28:04,760
But so in a way disappointing, it's not in other parks,

2657
02:28:04,840 --> 02:28:09,600
but also how special that you have to do the pilgrimage to go on this incredible ride.

2658
02:28:09,800 --> 02:28:12,440
It as a kid, I was always disappointed

2659
02:28:12,680 --> 02:28:15,800
that after Indiana Jones, Disneyland went off a cliff.

2660
02:28:15,800 --> 02:28:19,000
It was all rocket rods and superstar limo and all this garbage.

2661
02:28:19,160 --> 02:28:21,320
And like, why didn't they build on that?

2662
02:28:21,320 --> 02:28:23,440
Why didn't it get better after Indiana Jones?

2663
02:28:23,440 --> 02:28:25,480
It did only in Tokyo.

2664
02:28:25,480 --> 02:28:30,920
It's the evolutionary step between Indiana Jones and Radiator Springs racers.

2665
02:28:30,920 --> 02:28:31,840
It's it's fantastic.

2666
02:28:31,840 --> 02:28:34,600
Radiator Springs only better because there's more characters,

2667
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,240
characters at the end, a better last room.

2668
02:28:37,360 --> 02:28:40,600
But I don't think you get cars with that journey to the center of the earth.

2669
02:28:41,240 --> 02:28:43,840
Amazing ride vehicle. I got a little die cast to that.

2670
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:46,240
Oh, yeah. I love, love, love this ride.

2671
02:28:46,400 --> 02:28:49,240
Choosing between thrills and heart with this and Sinbad.

2672
02:28:49,240 --> 02:28:51,360
But I got to choose. Yeah, hell of a thrill.

2673
02:28:52,120 --> 02:28:56,120
Love it. People have to go to this park and go on this ride and all of these rides.

2674
02:28:56,280 --> 02:28:58,160
Yeah, it's crazy.

2675
02:28:58,160 --> 02:29:00,520
I was going to say, like we did

2676
02:29:00,520 --> 02:29:04,560
major 20,000 leagues under the sea, which is great.

2677
02:29:05,680 --> 02:29:09,480
And the employee was asking us there, which what was our favorite ride?

2678
02:29:09,480 --> 02:29:12,040
And that's when we were like really trying to figure it out.

2679
02:29:12,080 --> 02:29:14,880
And that's where she was like, and now she's like,

2680
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:18,600
I think we said Sinbad and she goes, that's my favorite, too.

2681
02:29:18,840 --> 02:29:20,400
And she spoke English as well.

2682
02:29:20,400 --> 02:29:22,480
So I go, yeah, I guess we have to go Sinbad.

2683
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:26,080
And then I think Tower of Terror for the theming, but not the ride itself.

2684
02:29:26,560 --> 02:29:30,920
So I feel like over especially in Disney, see, like the theming is almost more

2685
02:29:31,480 --> 02:29:33,160
even important than like length of ride.

2686
02:29:33,160 --> 02:29:38,000
I think now we're a little spoiled with thrills and what have you and length of ride.

2687
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:41,000
But they don't care as much about that over there.

2688
02:29:41,040 --> 02:29:42,160
Oh, maybe not. Yeah.

2689
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:43,840
So it's not as big of a thing.

2690
02:29:43,840 --> 02:29:47,080
So would you go is top three Sinbad Tower

2691
02:29:47,600 --> 02:29:51,600
journey, something else? Yeah, maybe Poo before.

2692
02:29:51,640 --> 02:29:54,840
Oh, man, who's that? Maybe Poo before.

2693
02:29:54,880 --> 02:29:56,560
I don't know. I don't know.

2694
02:29:56,560 --> 02:29:58,600
I might say it Poo is like four.

2695
02:29:58,600 --> 02:29:59,840
Journey is really good.

2696
02:29:59,840 --> 02:30:02,480
I think the problem with journey was that it was so hyped up

2697
02:30:02,480 --> 02:30:04,280
and it was the one I knew the least about.

2698
02:30:04,280 --> 02:30:06,120
Well, actually somebody at least about as well.

2699
02:30:06,120 --> 02:30:09,120
But I think when you're seeing the volcano, when you're seeing that,

2700
02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:12,720
how the scope of this whole place, I think in my head, I had built it up

2701
02:30:12,720 --> 02:30:16,280
was like, there's going to be 10 more rooms after this lava monster.

2702
02:30:16,280 --> 02:30:18,600
Sure, sure. And like we're going to be like teetering on a thing.

2703
02:30:18,600 --> 02:30:20,400
And there's going to be lava under us.

2704
02:30:20,400 --> 02:30:23,600
And it felt like, oh, it's a lot actually smaller than I thought it was.

2705
02:30:23,600 --> 02:30:25,280
But that's partly my expectation.

2706
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:27,920
That rush up the hill is so fun, though.

2707
02:30:27,960 --> 02:30:30,000
Oh, yeah. The spiraling and spiraling.

2708
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:33,280
I know it's short, but then like and then a light at the end of the tunnel.

2709
02:30:33,280 --> 02:30:35,480
And what is is that something good out there?

2710
02:30:35,560 --> 02:30:37,120
No, it's a drop.

2711
02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:39,400
Yeah, I think I think also that

2712
02:30:40,920 --> 02:30:42,560
when we were going around outside,

2713
02:30:42,560 --> 02:30:45,800
I think I go, oh, we're going to drop back into scenes or something

2714
02:30:45,800 --> 02:30:47,120
that we shot out.

2715
02:30:47,120 --> 02:30:49,480
And then I think probably if I had gone out on the second time,

2716
02:30:49,480 --> 02:30:51,680
then my expectations were in check.

2717
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:52,520
I know what it was.

2718
02:30:52,520 --> 02:30:54,320
Given a better assessment.

2719
02:30:54,320 --> 02:30:57,040
Sure. So that being said, since we went in, it's in bed,

2720
02:30:57,040 --> 02:31:00,360
I think maybe four, three or four times. Wow. Wow.

2721
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:05,160
Well, only barely because, yeah, only barely a number two for me.

2722
02:31:05,400 --> 02:31:07,200
It's all good. It's all really good.

2723
02:31:07,200 --> 02:31:07,840
Yeah, it's all.

2724
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:10,640
Harrison Hightower, too, just all of the detail on that.

2725
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:12,160
We were just obsessed with.

2726
02:31:12,160 --> 02:31:13,880
Yeah. Yeah. World building characters.

2727
02:31:13,880 --> 02:31:16,320
I feel like I feel like we got to cut it off or we'll just do it forever.

2728
02:31:16,320 --> 02:31:19,600
And yeah, the top 10 did not help me make it shorter.

2729
02:31:19,720 --> 02:31:21,080
There's so much to say.

2730
02:31:21,080 --> 02:31:21,840
Go to this place.

2731
02:31:21,840 --> 02:31:25,440
I break off all these rides and we'll we'll we'll talk about other stuff.

2732
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:27,720
Well, you know, we'll hit it in other episodes.

2733
02:31:27,720 --> 02:31:29,320
Twenty thousand leagues. I really liked.

2734
02:31:29,320 --> 02:31:31,840
But the top 10 is so packed. I get it.

2735
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:33,360
No, I don't. I.

2736
02:31:33,360 --> 02:31:35,600
Twenty thousand leagues, a little bit lacking as well.

2737
02:31:35,840 --> 02:31:38,800
A little bit of something, maybe a finale needs.

2738
02:31:38,800 --> 02:31:41,040
I'm sorry. A little hard to see in there.

2739
02:31:41,360 --> 02:31:43,640
But all of it, how they do it is really great.

2740
02:31:43,640 --> 02:31:45,680
And still so cares.

2741
02:31:45,680 --> 02:31:48,240
Neemone, French Sea Rider, I didn't put on there, but it's great.

2742
02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:49,200
You got to do it.

2743
02:31:49,200 --> 02:31:50,880
That's fun. Yeah.

2744
02:31:50,880 --> 02:31:54,560
And also, it's I don't know how much you consider this a ride,

2745
02:31:54,560 --> 02:31:59,760
but at Tokyo Dome City, we went on a Ferris wheel where we saw that karaoke

2746
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:03,600
in every sixth car or something is a karaoke car.

2747
02:32:04,120 --> 02:32:07,680
And so we got to sing karaoke at the top of Tokyo.

2748
02:32:07,920 --> 02:32:10,480
Life highlights so crazy, terrifying.

2749
02:32:10,480 --> 02:32:14,000
Aaron hates Ferris wheels and heights and everything, but was brave for this.

2750
02:32:14,200 --> 02:32:18,400
And luckily, though most of the songs are Japanese, it did have our three.

2751
02:32:18,440 --> 02:32:21,080
It happened to have our three favorite songs.

2752
02:32:21,440 --> 02:32:24,200
Wham's Last Christmas.

2753
02:32:24,200 --> 02:32:27,200
That's what makes you beautiful by One Direction and Aerosmith's

2754
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:30,160
I Don't Want to Miss a Thing and singing I Don't Want to Miss a Thing

2755
02:32:30,160 --> 02:32:32,520
at the top of Tokyo, a life highlight.

2756
02:32:32,680 --> 02:32:34,320
I didn't want to miss a thing.

2757
02:32:34,320 --> 02:32:36,880
I don't want to miss a thing in this episode, but I'm sure I did.

2758
02:32:36,880 --> 02:32:39,280
But hey, we don't have to retire Tokyo here.

2759
02:32:39,440 --> 02:32:40,760
The spirit can live in our hearts.

2760
02:32:40,760 --> 02:32:42,960
A canon of songs if I've ever heard one.

2761
02:32:44,120 --> 02:32:46,480
The Great American Songbook.

2762
02:32:46,480 --> 02:32:50,280
Yeah, 100 years when the tale of American music is told.

2763
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:52,960
Those will be those will be the three.

2764
02:32:52,960 --> 02:32:57,000
Wow. Wham isn't American, but I have so many questions,

2765
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:58,160
but we need to end the episode.

2766
02:32:58,160 --> 02:33:00,000
We should just do another one of these.

2767
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:01,080
I don't know. Oh, my God.

2768
02:33:01,080 --> 02:33:03,840
Well, there's also I mean, another good place for it is

2769
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:05,840
a Panglecti Pete's board episode.

2770
02:33:05,840 --> 02:33:07,360
We'll definitely be doing that.

2771
02:33:07,360 --> 02:33:10,600
Hey, if you have questions about my trip to Tokyo,

2772
02:33:10,720 --> 02:33:13,400
if you have questions about going to Tokyo, but the city itself emails

2773
02:33:13,400 --> 02:33:15,120
podcast, right, Gmail.

2774
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:20,200
Thanks to all the people who followed our trip at my Instagram at Skiz Gerdner.

2775
02:33:20,400 --> 02:33:21,600
Let me tell you another thing.

2776
02:33:22,720 --> 02:33:27,000
You know, our trip to Paris was disappointing because that property is so weird.

2777
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:28,840
It was tough getting around Disney Studios.

2778
02:33:28,840 --> 02:33:30,840
Paris is as bad a park as Disney.

2779
02:33:30,840 --> 02:33:32,840
See is good.

2780
02:33:32,840 --> 02:33:36,560
But you know, when you compare these to my two international Disney trips,

2781
02:33:36,720 --> 02:33:39,520
you know what I didn't have in France was a bunch of people

2782
02:33:39,520 --> 02:33:43,280
I've never met writing me and saying, I'm so happy.

2783
02:33:43,360 --> 02:33:49,160
I'm living vicariously through you cheering me on, just like Sinbad's town.

2784
02:33:49,280 --> 02:33:52,960
That's what I felt like I had with the audience of this show.

2785
02:33:54,760 --> 02:33:56,600
Good luck on your journey, Scott.

2786
02:33:56,600 --> 02:33:59,960
So thank you to everybody who cheered Aaron and I on.

2787
02:33:59,960 --> 02:34:01,480
It was so heartwarming.

2788
02:34:01,480 --> 02:34:04,960
This is the least snarky episode humanly possible of this show.

2789
02:34:05,160 --> 02:34:07,280
We'll do jokes again in a future one.

2790
02:34:07,280 --> 02:34:08,560
We'll try to. Maybe.

2791
02:34:08,560 --> 02:34:10,560
Maybe. Or maybe that's our thing.

2792
02:34:10,560 --> 02:34:11,880
We're the not funny.

2793
02:34:11,880 --> 02:34:13,680
There's plenty of places being funny.

2794
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:15,680
Maybe that's heartwarming.

2795
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:17,480
You survived podcasts, right?

2796
02:34:17,480 --> 02:34:20,760
And thanks, gentlemen, for thank you, Mike, for all your tips

2797
02:34:20,760 --> 02:34:23,080
and everything that helped me get around.

2798
02:34:23,080 --> 02:34:25,680
I'm like Columbus. I paved the way.

2799
02:34:26,560 --> 02:34:27,920
So, yeah, no.

2800
02:34:27,920 --> 02:34:30,680
But Jason will be the bravest explorer.

2801
02:34:30,680 --> 02:34:32,000
The grand finale.

2802
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,320
Jason goes international.

2803
02:34:34,320 --> 02:34:35,440
Have you ever?

2804
02:34:36,440 --> 02:34:39,320
Only Bermuda, which I believe technically might be a U.S.

2805
02:34:39,320 --> 02:34:40,920
protectorate. Mm hmm.

2806
02:34:40,920 --> 02:34:43,720
And Scott's only been to Bermuda via a Beach Boys song.

2807
02:34:44,840 --> 02:34:46,720
You did a group, but you lumped it.

2808
02:34:46,720 --> 02:34:48,280
You went Bermuda, Bahama.

2809
02:34:48,280 --> 02:34:54,640
Yeah. And I and I vicariously had to imagine a hypothetical pretty mama.

2810
02:34:54,840 --> 02:34:57,040
Yeah, because you weren't married at the time.

2811
02:34:57,040 --> 02:34:59,120
I thought I wrote one of the first time I heard that song,

2812
02:34:59,120 --> 02:35:01,760
I wrote Mike Love a fan letter and I said, thank you.

2813
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:04,160
I'm living vicariously through you.

2814
02:35:04,160 --> 02:35:09,200
Enjoy your journey to Kokomo, a fake place because that's a city in Indiana.

2815
02:35:09,200 --> 02:35:10,880
Finding a new hat.

2816
02:35:13,600 --> 02:35:15,520
Yeah. Hey, everybody, thank you so much for listening.

2817
02:35:15,520 --> 02:35:16,840
Thanks for all your comments and everything.

2818
02:35:16,840 --> 02:35:19,040
And there'll be more Tokyo talk to come.

2819
02:35:19,040 --> 02:35:24,200
And hey, follow us at pockets right on Twitter and on Instagram

2820
02:35:24,280 --> 02:35:27,560
and follow the compass of your heart to our live show.

2821
02:35:27,720 --> 02:35:33,680
Oh, yeah. Dynasty typewriter at the Hayworth Theater Friday, June 7th, 2019.

2822
02:35:33,680 --> 02:35:37,800
I haven't recorded an episode since this became reality that we're doing this.

2823
02:35:37,800 --> 02:35:39,200
Yeah. So excited.

2824
02:35:39,200 --> 02:35:42,400
Really want to say what the topic is and what we're doing.

2825
02:35:42,400 --> 02:35:44,160
But we can we got to leave some surprises.

2826
02:35:44,160 --> 02:35:46,080
Maybe we'll link it before we do the show.

2827
02:35:46,080 --> 02:35:47,440
Maybe we will. But you're going to like it.

2828
02:35:47,440 --> 02:35:49,680
You're going to like it. But I'll say this.

2829
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:52,320
And not to this is not hucksterism.

2830
02:35:52,320 --> 02:35:55,360
I mean, it's a little salesmanship, but tickets are going fast.

2831
02:35:55,920 --> 02:35:59,880
So if you're on the fence, I think there's a chance there's no tickets by the time.

2832
02:35:59,880 --> 02:36:02,000
There is that is a possibility.

2833
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:03,760
We might have to cut this down.

2834
02:36:03,760 --> 02:36:06,080
There's a chance that this will be cut. You'll never hear it.

2835
02:36:06,080 --> 02:36:09,760
Good luck on your journey to the dynasty typewriter website.

2836
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:14,600
May your compass guide your mouse to directions are on there.

2837
02:36:15,320 --> 02:36:17,520
Allow time for it. That is true.

2838
02:36:17,520 --> 02:36:19,120
It's a crowded part. Yeah.

2839
02:36:19,120 --> 02:36:20,600
For high density area.

2840
02:36:20,600 --> 02:36:22,440
There are lots and valet options.

2841
02:36:22,480 --> 02:36:25,520
It is not as beautiful of an area as Tokyo Disney

2842
02:36:25,520 --> 02:36:29,880
Sea, but we will be your guides and your heart will swell.

2843
02:36:29,880 --> 02:36:33,160
And no one will lock a parking lot right afterwards.

2844
02:36:34,960 --> 02:36:36,360
Thanks for listening, folks.

2845
02:36:36,360 --> 02:36:39,280
Glad to be back. Talk to you soon. Bye bye.
