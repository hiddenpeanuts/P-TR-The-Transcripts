1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,360
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Pipe.

3
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,120
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Mike Carlson.

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,920
I was gonna, boop, boop, boop, boop.

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,760
Was that the sound?

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,600
I think that was Yogi Bear.

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,360
I fumbled, I'm sorry, I'm tired.

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,480
Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,320
As if mine.

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,880
Acroid, like Yogi Bear.

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,360
Mine was fumble adjacent.

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,600
Jason Sheridan, hi.

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,680
Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,440
These are great pipe impressions.

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,120
They're great pipe impressions.

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,960
Scott, I couldn't tell if you.

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,760
Oh, oh, oh, oh, shh, quiet.

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,640
Doot, doot, doot, doot.

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,640
That's close. Okay.

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,480
It's more of a sucking.

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,320
Thank you.

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,160
It's like doot, doot, doot.

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,000
Thank you for that.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,040
There's like a pitch down.

25
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,880
Yeah, you're right, you're right.

26
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,440
There is some, anyway, sorry, Jason.

27
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,520
Scott, I wasn't sure if you were delighted by that

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,760
or skeptical of it or unsure.

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,960
Oh, a mix, yeah, yeah, yeah.

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,800
Somewhere.

31
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,640
It's just so thin.

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,920
Sometimes it all hits at once.

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,120
But the rules are lighter here on the Second Pipe.

34
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,280
We don't have the standard intros.

35
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,720
But we do have to keep our pipe sounds in order

36
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,800
because we're kind of,

37
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,800
we're doing this loose celebration of Mario,

38
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,160
which we stepped away from for a couple of weeks.

39
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,040
But when we talked about the Ice Capade show

40
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,840
where Mr. Belvedere played Koopa,

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,520
we thought is there something else we can do to talk about?

42
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,040
I mean, really what it is is like,

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,040
as Universal Studios now has this brand new high tech,

44
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,120
very on brand Nintendo and Mario world,

45
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,280
to flash back to our childhoods

46
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,760
where nobody was minding the store

47
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,280
and there was just a bunch of,

48
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,080
any like charlatan who wanted to do something

49
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,840
with a brand like Mario could do so conceivably.

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,960
And, you know, kind of under the,

51
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,600
I feel like under the prism of,

52
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,320
yeah, this bullshit's not gonna be around in a year.

53
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,400
Do whatever the hell you want.

54
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,320
Yes, and I think, again, according to legend,

55
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,320
the Mario movie itself was the last straw for Nintendo

56
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,840
as far as just the free for all

57
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,040
that was the Mario rights being given out.

58
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,480
We are cracking down.

59
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,640
There is, what we have learned is that children like this

60
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,400
and know a lot about it and it's probably not good

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,520
if we pay for a property or every name on a property

62
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,920
where it doesn't make any sense

63
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,440
or have anything to do with what the thing is.

64
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,280
Yeah, you know what, maybe we shouldn't have it

65
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,480
where everything that's not a Mario video game sucks.

66
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,360
Maybe we should make sure that's the case.

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,340
You're telling me you guys don't have fond memories

68
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,320
of Captain N, the Game Master?

69
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,880
Well, I do, actually do.

70
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,560
Who's Captain N, the Game Master?

71
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,920
Captain N, the Game Master is a kid who,

72
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,480
did he get sucked into video games

73
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,520
or did video games come out?

74
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,840
This was another Nintendo affiliated cartoon.

75
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,280
As you can see, it's a young teen

76
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,420
in a letterman jacket holding a handgun.

77
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,480
Different connotations nowadays.

78
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,800
That's the Nintendo blaster.

79
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,640
You know.

80
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,460
Oh, that's the gun.

81
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,720
That's like the duck hunt gun.

82
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,560
Yeah, yeah.

83
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,380
Uh-huh.

84
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,220
Wow.

85
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,260
This was, I thought, a part of Super Show,

86
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,540
Super Mario Super Show,

87
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,360
which is not what we're talking about today.

88
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,580
You might expect us to talk about Super Mario Super Show.

89
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,580
Kind of.

90
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,420
Yeah.

91
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,980
It comes up tangentially.

92
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,700
It is related, and it's sort of,

93
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,060
it seems like it was certainly born out of this

94
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,540
and then was like programmed with as well.

95
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,300
I think we have maybe paired with it.

96
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,140
Yeah.

97
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,420
In Los Angeles.

98
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,260
Right.

99
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,460
What we're primarily talking about here

100
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,800
is something called King Koopa's Cool Cartoons.

101
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,100
All Ks, Ks every which way,

102
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,300
which is a local Los Angeles show

103
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,580
where Koopa showed you cartoons.

104
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,780
Thank God, by the way, it's four Ks.

105
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,620
Yeah.

106
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,740
And they were prescient enough to not,

107
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,580
yeah, we should probably,

108
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,340
maybe they had it as Koopa's Cool Cartoons

109
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,220
and went, ah crap, is he a king or something?

110
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,620
He is, I looked it up.

111
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,180
He's like, I called my dumb nephew.

112
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,580
He said he's a king.

113
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,140
We don't have to have three Ks anymore.

114
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,020
Cause we know we want the K in cool.

115
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,100
We have to.

116
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,260
Have to.

117
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,500
So this is this local Los Angeles show

118
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,700
and we're gonna get into this,

119
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,780
but if you don't mind,

120
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,780
I have a little bit of a prelude,

121
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,780
which is something else that came up in the last episode

122
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,780
in terms of weird, sloppy, off-brand Nintendo programming,

123
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,620
in this case, musical programming.

124
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,540
And by that, I mean an album that came out in 1991

125
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,220
called Nintendo White Knuckle Scoring.

126
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,380
It's a very inane phrase that means nothing.

127
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,020
Oh, the white knuckle feeling

128
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,140
of what all video gamers desire, which is to score.

129
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,980
Yeah.

130
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,100
I guess it's, I mean, I guess when I'm describing

131
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,100
the turtles level where I'm underwater

132
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,380
and I'm desperate to get through the seaweed,

133
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,620
I guess I am white knuckling the controller.

134
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,620
But it's, but the pursuit of scoring,

135
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,180
only if you're in a competition,

136
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,140
is it white knuckle scoring.

137
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:18,980
Right.

138
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,980
And even then, no one has ever said this phrase.

139
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,820
Right.

140
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,660
This phrase comes from nowhere.

141
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,700
Yes, very true, very true.

142
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,260
It's really silly and I'm excited to just

143
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,420
do my little book report about white knuckle scoring.

144
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,580
The title is inane and the cover is also kind of inane.

145
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,620
It's a little small here.

146
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,540
You guys probably can't see it too well,

147
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,620
but there's a bunch of like teen rockers, punks,

148
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,460
and you know, like a dreadlock guy,

149
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,860
and they are all like jamming out

150
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,420
and CDs are exploding all over the room

151
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,300
as Mario punches his way through a television

152
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,940
and into these rockers' homes.

153
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,900
And that, it kind of sums up the vibe of the album,

154
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,380
which basically is, this is a compilation album

155
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,380
that features all the favorite bands

156
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,540
of any Nintendo loving kid in 1991.

157
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,420
Crosby, Stills, and Nash.

158
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,260
Nice.

159
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:20,260
Sheena Easton, Trickster, Roy Orbison,

160
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,900
Canadian rock super group Alias,

161
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,620
which had all the members of Heart except for the sisters.

162
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,460
Right, right.

163
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,740
Finally got rid of those sisters

164
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,300
and all the real Heart can jam.

165
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,020
So here is why this album exists.

166
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,900
In the early 90s, there was an executive

167
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,420
at MCA Records who realized that there was cash

168
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,820
in potential with Nintendo.

169
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,500
And then also his friend died in a helicopter.

170
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,740
Just separately, there was a music agent,

171
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,460
incidentally Roy Orbison's agent,

172
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,980
who died in the very tragic helicopter crash

173
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,940
that killed Stevie Ray Vaughn.

174
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,780
Really?

175
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,620
Wow.

176
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,020
Yes, didn't see that turn coming up.

177
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,620
Nintendo plus helicopter deaths.

178
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,580
And this guy was very beloved in the music community.

179
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,060
He was very well known, if you knew him,

180
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,580
for supporting the cause of literacy.

181
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,940
He really wanted children to be able to read,

182
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,580
big proponent of literacy.

183
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,580
So thus, this MCA Records executive said,

184
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,420
all right, I'm gonna kill two birds

185
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,100
who are flying in completely opposite directions

186
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,780
with one stone, and I'm going to make an album

187
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,300
that's about Mario and literacy all at once.

188
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,580
If you're wondering how do you get

189
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,260
Crosby, Stills, and Nash, and Trickster, and Alias,

190
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,900
all two, that's a very specific assignment,

191
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,380
that it's Mario and literacy.

192
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,260
How do you get all of these disparate artists

193
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,900
to cover both of those topics?

194
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,780
And the answer is, you do not.

195
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,540
What you do is you get a bunch of shit

196
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,860
that's lying around MCA Records,

197
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,140
things that haven't come out yet,

198
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,020
things that weren't good enough to release,

199
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,140
songs that have nothing to do with each other,

200
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,620
songs that have nothing to do with Mario,

201
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,980
and you throw them together and you put Mario on the cover

202
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,820
and you hope that kids don't notice.

203
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,700
Another move that you make is to have just one song,

204
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,620
one song only, that is about the topic of the album.

205
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,500
And this is the reason why I know about any of this,

206
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,180
is because the first song is done by

207
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,220
one of my favorite bands of all time,

208
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,820
a early 90s power pop band called Jellyfish.

209
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,020
Everybody heard of Jellyfish?

210
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,340
I feel like there are possibly three listeners

211
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,020
in the audience, maybe.

212
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,060
That might be overestimating.

213
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,740
But this band called Jellyfish that I love,

214
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,380
Roger Manning, keyboard player, he's played with Beck forever,

215
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,060
like unbelievable band that's like Queen and Cheap Trick

216
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,660
and Super Tramp and the Partridge family all in one.

217
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,500
They made this really lovely melodic pop in the early 90s

218
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,940
and they only made two albums

219
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,620
and then they broke up never to return again

220
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,340
with no hope of coming back.

221
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,260
And part of the arc of liking this band

222
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,300
is that you start going like, is there any more of this?

223
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,820
I'm dying for more songs by this band.

224
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,660
And you find out, oh yeah, there is one

225
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,980
and it's on White Knuckle Scorin.

226
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,060
And it is a song that is from the point of view of Bowser.

227
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,580
They're the only band that did the assignment.

228
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,420
Wow.

229
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,140
They took these, like Mario Literacy got it

230
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:32,140
and they made this mini rock opera called Ignorance is Bliss

231
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:37,260
that is about, that is being sung to Princess Toadstool

232
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,740
and from the point of view of Bowser,

233
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,540
who does not like reading

234
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,420
and he conveys how much he hates books and reading.

235
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,700
In this song, wonderful little,

236
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,780
like clever little musical piece.

237
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,140
They did the assignment and then they contribute this

238
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,100
and they assume the other bands are going to,

239
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,940
but instead it's just a bunch of fucking bullshit,

240
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,700
including there's a song from the Dire Straits

241
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,580
on this album and this song is called Iron Hand

242
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,580
and it is a sad dirge about police killing coal miners

243
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,540
in a real British strike.

244
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,980
Oh, okay.

245
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,340
And you're like, so why in the world is this on a Mario?

246
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,900
How does this possibly, and how does it even conveyed

247
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,340
that this album is about literacy

248
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,940
if only one band bothered to actually do it?

249
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,340
And the answer is there is a comic that came with the CD.

250
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,260
Oh.

251
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,020
A 14 page comic with an original Mario adventure

252
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,100
that you can only experience this way.

253
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,820
And this, in the plot of this comic,

254
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,780
stemming from the Jellyfish song,

255
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:51,140
Bowser captures Princess Toadstool and he puts her in jail

256
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,980
and he sends his children, the Koopalings, to go bother her,

257
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,980
but instead she teaches them how to read

258
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,860
and he is very upset about this.

259
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,700
He doesn't like books.

260
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,420
He can't read, doesn't wanna know how to read,

261
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,500
even though several pages later he sends Mario and Luigi

262
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,180
a letter that he hand wrote in cursive.

263
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,260
So I don't understand how that works.

264
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,100
But anyway, the idea is that you're supposed to like,

265
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,580
follow along with the story in the book

266
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,180
and then play the songs that line up accordingly.

267
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,620
And characters on the pages even say cue song

268
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,820
and that is your, you have to connect

269
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,620
whatever the title is to whatever the track is.

270
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,980
And this is an example, and this is how they set up

271
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,780
a song called I Drove All Night,

272
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,180
which is Roy Orbison's last song.

273
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,140
He'd been dead for two years by the time this came out.

274
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,940
And this was the official way that this song was released.

275
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,020
There's even a music video made for it

276
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,340
starring Jason Priestley that has Mario nods all over it.

277
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,340
Like there's a Mario Brothers plumbing truck

278
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,140
in the background of the music video.

279
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,260
So this is how it would work.

280
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,020
If you're a kid, it's a big if,

281
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,340
if you're a kid who's reading along

282
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,420
with the White Knuckle Scorn book,

283
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:12,300
here is an image of a very off-brand Mario

284
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,260
driving a 57 Chevy and wearing cool shades.

285
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:22,460
And then he finds the princess and he says,

286
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,420
to get to you, babe, I drove all night.

287
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,060
And she says cue song, and then you'd hear this.

288
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:34,060
And then, I don't know, then you listen to Roy Orbison

289
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,260
and you're just, and then, you know,

290
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,660
you do it several pages later for the,

291
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,180
for the sad Dire Straits song, Iron Hand.

292
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,340
Which also didn't appear on any other album.

293
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,820
It ended up being on a Dire Straits album later.

294
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,060
But the first way I think that you could hear

295
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,820
this miserable song was on Nintendo White Knuckle Scorn.

296
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,140
So- Scorn, that's so funny.

297
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,940
Cause that's like, someone knows like,

298
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,700
oh, you score, you score in video games, you know?

299
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,980
Like you score points.

300
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,060
They were given a brief.

301
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,460
They were given like the coverage that you get, you know,

302
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,980
like an executive doesn't want to read a whole script.

303
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,540
So you just give them the bullet points.

304
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,940
Yeah, they got a dossier.

305
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,380
They got a pitch deck.

306
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,980
It was just called score, I don't know, Songs for Scoring.

307
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,780
And then they're like, no, not enough,

308
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:24,220
not extreme enough for the fans of Britney Fox,

309
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,220
whatever that is.

310
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,060
Yeah.

311
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,880
They're gonna buy this thing.

312
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,080
Like Roy Orbit said, Mario was never quite the same

313
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,480
after all his friends died in that plane crash.

314
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,600
After Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr., you know,

315
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,800
they all got on that plane and-

316
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,680
The original Toad.

317
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,520
Yeah, they were-

318
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,360
I forget they had to replace Toad.

319
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,200
Yeah, Toad.

320
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,040
It's the second Toad they hired.

321
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,880
It's kind of like a Santa's Little Helper.

322
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,720
Sort of sitting there.

323
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,560
Birdo.

324
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,080
They just found an original, yeah, yeah.

325
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,520
Found an identical guy, an identical Birdo.

326
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,080
So anyway, that's sort of it,

327
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,760
except for one final detail about this comic,

328
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,000
and that is that the comic is horny.

329
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,320
Well, you said Bae, called her Bae.

330
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,320
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

331
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,680
You're looking it up, yes.

332
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,680
Okay, so Mario and Luigi are kinda having their own adventure,

333
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,520
often wearing sunglasses, which is cool.

334
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,520
And then Yoshi shows up and just talks,

335
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,840
just talks in English, something that does not,

336
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,480
I don't think happen in any video games.

337
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,120
But they say they're looking for the princess,

338
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,120
and Yoshi says, the smart looking Bae with the dynamite bod.

339
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,960
Pfft.

340
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,800
Pfft.

341
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,640
Pfft.

342
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,480
Which at least-

343
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,320
Yoshi says that.

344
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,880
That's straight out of Yoshi's mouth.

345
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,720
Yoshi?

346
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,560
Yoshi talks?

347
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,200
He's not very talkative.

348
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,120
And he's attracted to human women?

349
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,800
Yeah, I guess.

350
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,560
I guess he only opens his mouth

351
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,400
to say something important, I guess.

352
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,800
To be performatively horny, I guess.

353
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,280
Yeah, you don't need to try that hard to replace Yoshi.

354
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,560
By the way, I corrected myself, it's Snowball the Cat

355
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,520
that they're constantly replacing on the Simpsons.

356
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,160
There's only one Santa's Little Helper.

357
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

358
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,840
I got confused.

359
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,360
You know what's interesting is that this is not the,

360
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,200
this will not be the only time that the original,

361
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,320
the first episode of The Simpsons is referenced

362
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,120
in this episode. Oh, okay.

363
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,920
You might know where I'm going, maybe somebody does.

364
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,120
Anyway, there's yet one more use of,

365
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,400
I think somebody, yeah, somebody calls it,

366
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,440
the narrator describes her dynamite bod again.

367
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,920
And then there's a sequence, which, yes.

368
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,640
I mean, she's a short cartoon.

369
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,560
I don't even want to look, I'm just saying like,

370
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,440
that's kind of a leap, like, look,

371
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,960
April O'Neil is drawn as a full-sized human woman, okay?

372
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,640
Oh, it's perfectly okay.

373
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,880
I'm not saying it's okay.

374
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,840
Encourage to be into April O'Neil.

375
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,440
But I'm saying the princess is like

376
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,960
a little pixel character.

377
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,200
I know she's on the cartoon, but what are we doing here?

378
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,280
If, well, I mean, it's just, it's strange to hear

379
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,400
the dinosaur sexualize her. I agree with that.

380
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,920
I mean, like, if you had to make a leap, you could,

381
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,400
like under, you've only seen her in a big gown,

382
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,600
so you don't really know.

383
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,840
Well, you're right, I don't know,

384
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,480
I don't know about her bod, I don't.

385
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,840
I'm just saying it's like, why,

386
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
these are like little tiny cartoon,

387
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,200
cute cartoon characters.

388
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,920
It just seems like whoever did this,

389
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,960
like really laid it on.

390
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,640
Kind of, inserting them, in the way that,

391
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,080
in that Belvedere thing that Bruce Philanche

392
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,920
put himself into it, in his affection for Mae West,

393
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,400
I think we're reading the work of somebody

394
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,520
who had never heard of any of this before.

395
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,360
Yes, that's what I'm gonna say.

396
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,920
And his takeaway is, ooh, dynamite bod.

397
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,120
And it gets worse because there's a sequence

398
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,480
in which it seems like she's being lowered

399
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,200
into just a pit of lava.

400
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,800
And, you're right, spoiler, she does not die.

401
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,600
This is some kind of trickery.

402
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,640
I don't remember how she escapes.

403
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,920
If you can imagine, this is a hard thing to read a little bit.

404
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,880
But in this moment, narratively,

405
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,360
we're meant to think that she died

406
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,160
and that Mario, Luigi, and Yoshi all watched it happen.

407
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,560
So that happens in this.

408
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,560
So it's like Rise of Skywalker with that chewy death.

409
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,480
Yeah, that's right.

410
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,680
Where they all watch Chewie blow up

411
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,400
and then next scene Chewie's alive.

412
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,960
And Chewie's just around and.

413
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
And you're like, wait a minute, what?

414
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,280
And they never explain it?

415
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,920
It's really confusing.

416
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,400
They should have had a droid roll on and say,

417
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,640
he tested badly and then roll out.

418
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,680
Well, and this, but worse,

419
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,000
because they watch her like melt or something.

420
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,520
I don't know, again, how this happens.

421
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,360
Think of grizzly death.

422
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,560
But the point, just listen to,

423
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,200
this is an incredible piece of narrative writing.

424
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,760
The bros were helpless to save the princess

425
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,200
as her dynamite bod vanished into the fumes and smoke.

426
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,520
No, that doesn't say that.

427
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,920
It does, this is published.

428
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,280
Oh my God.

429
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,600
Now the narrator's horny too?

430
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,440
Now this.

431
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,480
The last one I read was also the narrator.

432
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,880
But now the narrator is still giving her a dynamite,

433
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,120
focusing on the dynamite bod

434
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,040
as the bod is literally destroyed,

435
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,160
as the bod melts and turns into vapor.

436
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,160
So he's being creepy and then he's also being insensitive.

437
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,400
Sex and death, you know, a little death,

438
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,240
they're combined, you know?

439
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,080
They're one and the same.

440
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,320
Just terrible watching a dynamite bod

441
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,120
get burnt to a crisp like that.

442
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,600
That's two offenses in one.

443
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,440
Yeah.

444
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,080
This is really the day the music died, for sure.

445
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,240
As she vanished into the fumes and smoke

446
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,520
and her screams faded, they felt just awful.

447
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,200
It goes down the line, Luigi,

448
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,440
as royalty goes, she was hot stuff.

449
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,680
Mario, yes, she was,

450
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,320
which is the cue for a song.

451
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,200
I don't remember which.

452
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,720
Wait, so now Luigi jokes about her dying?

453
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,760
Yeah, yeah, he is watching,

454
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,280
well, like, they're friends with her.

455
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,800
It is my hope to never, like,

456
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
see a lot of people die in front of me,

457
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,400
but I really hope that it's not melting in a vat,

458
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,840
that I watch someone I know and love turn to liquid.

459
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,080
That sounds awful.

460
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,200
I agree. That has just happened.

461
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,200
And Luigi is making jokes and jokes about how she's hot.

462
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,600
And then Yoshi, she's hotter than ever now.

463
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,360
Yoshi?

464
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,040
But anyway, song cue.

465
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,720
Oh my God.

466
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,240
The Mario brothers and Yoshi

467
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,480
have turned into raging misogynists.

468
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,080
Not only misogynists, psychopathic misogynists.

469
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,240
They are so cold to watching a slow, painful death

470
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,080
happen in front of them.

471
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,360
Is this because they see death all the time,

472
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,920
in enemies they vanquish,

473
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,200
and they themselves die all the time?

474
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,040
Oh, interesting.

475
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,840
So they are not, yeah, they're extremely callous.

476
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,680
Right, right.

477
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,120
Death means nothing to them.

478
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,360
In the video game world, death means nothing,

479
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,960
because you can always restart.

480
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,160
Then you end up like this, just making Deadpool quips

481
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,760
about hideous, horrifying deaths.

482
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,880
Deadpool wouldn't say something uncouth

483
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,160
about a lady like that, though.

484
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,520
Deadpool has his limits.

485
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,840
Deadpool has his limits.

486
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,720
So that's this debacle of an album.

487
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,960
Wait, this is an officially licensed Nintendo.

488
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,880
The logo is on the, it feels more related

489
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,080
even than the ice capa-

490
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,280
A deal had to be struck in order for them

491
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,160
to stamp a bunch of Crosby, Stills, and Nash songs out.

492
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,720
Which one is the Crosby, Stills, and Nash song?

493
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,560
It's a way-

494
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,760
It's not Teach the Children, is it?

495
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,080
No, it's like a new one.

496
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,920
It's a new one.

497
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,720
No, of course, they gave, they didn't give a big one out.

498
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,840
I'm just saying, like, you're teaching kids

499
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,560
what other Crosby, Stills, and Nash.

500
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,560
Yeah, that's true.

501
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,400
I just wondered.

502
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,240
Well, the answer is, I mean, that would have been

503
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,080
too related.

504
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,360
A live cut of it or something, or like a solo demo of-

505
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,200
But then what would have been the fun in that?

506
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,280
That would have forced the writers of the comic books

507
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,480
to just tell a straight narrative through line,

508
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,680
instead of having to suddenly put Mario and Luigi

509
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,840
in Knight's armor just to justify

510
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,040
the sad Dire Straits song, Iron Hand.

511
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,160
I'll get you with my iron hand.

512
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,200
That is not something you'd say about your armor.

513
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,120
You don't call that an iron hand.

514
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,960
No.

515
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,480
It probably is an iron, entirely,

516
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,280
if you want flexibility with that thing.

517
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,840
Yeah. Yeah, no.

518
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,480
So this is a disjointed, horny debacle,

519
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,240
and I felt like it was my duty to punish you two

520
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,960
and the audience by making you all know about it.

521
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,800
Sure.

522
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,560
So with that, I've said my piece.

523
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,440
I hope no one sleeps after hearing about this.

524
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,600
Well, I don't trust the Yoshi anymore,

525
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,200
as far as morals and ethics.

526
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,680
We're maybe not going back to Nintendo

527
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,200
for a little bit at Universal.

528
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,280
I don't know what your plans are,

529
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,520
but you're not gonna want to.

530
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,680
No, I don't want to see that guy.

531
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,040
The guy only talks to say something pervy.

532
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,560
You almost watch your friend Optimus Prime die

533
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,720
again and again.

534
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,120
Yeah, but we know he, yeah.

535
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,960
But he knows what he's okay.

536
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,560
There's no sexuality to that.

537
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,480
No, that's good.

538
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,640
That's no sexuality.

539
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,480
Oh, there's no, oh, absolutely not.

540
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,440
No, and then you get to see him out in front of the ride.

541
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,520
Maybe he's making quips.

542
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,720
Maybe he's making references

543
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,360
to generate a viral video or something.

544
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,400
What he's saying is nice things to people.

545
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,240
That's what he's doing.

546
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,080
He does say nice things.

547
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,480
He's G-rated things.

548
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,760
Your bravery saved the planet.

549
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,360
And your dynamite bod didn't hurt either.

550
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,200
No, what?

551
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,880
That would shatter my impression of Optimus Prime,

552
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,280
and I would never go back on the ride.

553
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,000
And then I would say we could demolish it

554
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,400
to put Donkey Kong there,

555
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,240
if that was the case, which it's not.

556
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,480
I can't imagine it is,

557
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,120
but I just wanted to see a squirm.

558
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,720
Peter Cullen better have never starred

559
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,240
in some sort of beach party direct to DVD movie

560
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,960
where he's like pulling the glasses down and going,

561
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,920
look at that bod or something.

562
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,280
And then someone to mash up.

563
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,080
Yeah, mash it up with Optimus Prime,

564
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,200
and then ruin my day.

565
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,920
Well, I think if anybody pitches their voice down

566
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,920
and runs it through a flanger, flanger,

567
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,240
is it a soft G?

568
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,080
Think of flanger.

569
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,200
Maybe I'm wrong, actually.

570
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,400
I think almost anybody could make Optimus Prime

571
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,800
say some dirty things.

572
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,640
Don't do it.

573
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,800
Be creative out there.

574
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,160
That's not a call to action.

575
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,000
Don't do it.

576
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,360
It is for me.

577
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,760
Your bravery has made me horny.

578
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,640
So, yeah, listeners, get those hand parts

579
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,520
of your dynamite bods working

580
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,800
and doing some editing.

581
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,120
Oh, you can do it.

582
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,960
I keep seeing videos where people generate

583
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,320
AI, Biden, and Trump going back and forth playing

584
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,080
on Twitch, playing Overwatch

585
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,040
and yelling at each other.

586
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,200
Sounds like a blast.

587
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,160
Yeah.

588
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,440
It's fun for everybody.

589
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,360
Did you have one more horny thing to say, Mike?

590
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,200
Yeah.

591
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,040
Let's hear it.

592
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,880
Get out with it.

593
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,720
Get out with it, yeah.

594
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,920
I started questioning, though, what it was gonna be.

595
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
Nope, nope.

596
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,280
Spotlights on you.

597
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,120
Zing.

598
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,840
Save the AllSpark, which is a vibrator

599
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,880
that I use often on my prostate.

600
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,320
I would have done it before with more energy

601
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,280
when I hadn't assessed what I was about to say.

602
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,200
I did it real defeat.

603
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,440
I did the version where Optimus Prime

604
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,920
is ashamed of himself for using the AllSpark in that way.

605
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,360
What do you think, before he transforms,

606
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,600
what is Optimus Prime's prostate?

607
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,960
What part of the car is it?

608
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,480
Yeah, tailpipe or gas load?

609
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,920
Well, no, it's inside.

610
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,760
It's inside, that's a good point.

611
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,440
Yeah, I know, but how do you get there?

612
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,800
Is it a seat?

613
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,640
Is it a bucket seat?

614
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,600
Well, does he, do all the Transformers have a tailpipe

615
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,920
coming out of the rectum?

616
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,040
Hmm.

617
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,400
Well, there's that one that's like a cassette player.

618
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,000
In the first one, they pee,

619
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,320
John Titoro gets peed on by one of the Transformers

620
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,240
and it is coming from the area where a penis would be.

621
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,480
That happens in this?

622
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,600
In the first Transformers movie,

623
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,520
John Titoro gets pissed on by a Transformer.

624
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,440
I forget which one it is.

625
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,280
Is it Bumblebee?

626
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,440
I mean, yeah, it's a long journey from that

627
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,880
to Stanley Tucci drinking a bag of milk, you know?

628
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,880
Right, that's the-

629
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,720
Later one.

630
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,560
Right, right, right.

631
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,360
So yeah, I think there's a tailpipe of some kind.

632
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,440
It might be shorter than a car's tailpipe,

633
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,040
but since they are cars,

634
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,920
all those parts have to go somewhere.

635
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,720
Yeah, they all have to get rearranged

636
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,800
and become equivalents of human bodies.

637
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,280
So the tailpipe is absolutely the Transformers rectum.

638
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,120
It's just a matter of how far they stick out.

639
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,840
Is it big enough though?

640
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,680
What do you mean?

641
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,640
On this proportionally on a Transformer,

642
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,560
I think a tailpipe is too thin.

643
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,440
Too thin in the sense that-

644
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,520
Maybe it opens up.

645
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,280
Are you saying thin as far as the material of the pipe

646
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,240
itself on the outside or longwise?

647
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,960
The width of a tailpipe is not enough to be a rectum

648
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,080
of a big creature like a Transformer.

649
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,160
Right, but they're not taking traditional shit.

650
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,600
I think it's a P-hole.

651
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,800
It's a P-hole.

652
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,760
You think that tail?

653
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,600
Yeah.

654
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,400
And you think the rectum is just a hole?

655
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,120
Yeah, I think they just form a new hole

656
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,520
when they transform it.

657
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,440
Okay.

658
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,000
As part of the transforming is they form a new hole.

659
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,960
All right, the tailpipe is the P-hole

660
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,400
and then they just have a hole.

661
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,240
We cracked it.

662
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,080
It does make sense.

663
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,320
I think logically it makes sense.

664
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,760
Right, and that's where you put the Al's bark

665
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,640
to get to the prostate, which is what part of the car.

666
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,680
Here's the problem with this.

667
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,000
The fuel, where you put the fuel in.

668
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,440
The problem is that we don't know anything about cars.

669
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,280
Yeah, no, absolutely not.

670
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,600
So we can't effectively make a good joke here.

671
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,440
No.

672
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,560
Or bodies, because also before we recorded

673
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,160
we didn't know what a hamstring was.

674
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,960
Jason was explaining to us where the hamstring was

675
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,000
and I was kind of off.

676
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,400
We don't know about these things.

677
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,240
We know about.

678
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
I know it was in the lower part of the body.

679
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,040
We know about old crap and in this case,

680
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,760
old crap that is affiliated with Mario.

681
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,600
Old crap.

682
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,840
That is, that's White Knuckle Scorin.

683
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,680
Yeah.

684
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
Shall we move on to King Koopa's cool cartoon?

685
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,440
Yes, and there is a Transformers connection.

686
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,720
I don't know if you came across that.

687
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
I think I know what this is.

688
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,560
Yeah, yeah.

689
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,400
Yeah.

690
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,200
But would you like to do any further contextualizing

691
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,800
of King Koopa's cool cartoon?

692
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,520
This is something that came across my desk

693
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,800
just mere weeks ago.

694
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,480
Friend of mine, I'll mention him

695
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,600
because he's gonna come back into this.

696
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,960
Justin Donaldson told me about this

697
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,680
and he likes all this same Kitsch garbage

698
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,080
and theme park stuff and he goes,

699
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,480
you know, I just realized the other day

700
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,520
that King Koopa's cool cartoon,

701
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,840
so it's only a regional show.

702
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,960
And I said, wait, what are you talking,

703
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,760
what do those words mean?

704
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,920
And he said, well, there was a show

705
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,280
and I looked it up immediately.

706
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,320
There was a show that was kind of like the Bozo show

707
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,080
in the sense that there was a live studio audience of kids

708
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,800
and a performer there, you know, hosting this

709
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,880
in a kind of, you know, an old school TV studio, you know,

710
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,720
where you could imagine.

711
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,540
Where you're seeing all ends of it.

712
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,080
The audience is always very present as part of it.

713
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,080
And like, you can imagine the TV news is like

714
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,840
in the studio over or in that studio

715
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,520
and they just move the desk in.

716
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,800
Like it's that feeling of.

717
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,240
They can't record both at the same time.

718
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,400
The kids are too loud.

719
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,920
Right, no, no way.

720
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,320
But yes, there's the newscasters could be in hair and makeup

721
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,400
waiting to go on because it's just like

722
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,800
they're just plugging the ears.

723
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,280
Like this high up something.

724
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,360
How many episodes of this crap are they doing?

725
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,200
Right, yes.

726
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,440
And so he was telling me about this and I was like,

727
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,800
oh my God, I've never heard of this.

728
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,560
And again, it's shocking that we,

729
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,920
some of this stuff is still like being unearthed.

730
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,360
Yeah.

731
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,720
Or being told like, how did I not hear about this?

732
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,320
So yeah, looking online, you're like,

733
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,680
oh, there's not a ton about this.

734
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,280
There's not a ton of clips, but the intro was online.

735
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,040
There's a few pieces of it.

736
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:26,040
There are some information and it's fascinating to see this

737
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,280
because I've never heard another person talk about it.

738
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,400
No.

739
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,440
You would have been alive, Scott, for this,

740
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,040
but I don't think you ever came across this.

741
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,320
It only lasted for a year.

742
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,280
Yeah, and what is it?

743
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,680
Is it 91?

744
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,000
Is it, or you know it's before.

745
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,840
89.

746
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,200
89, you're obviously very young.

747
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,840
I think the timeline goes.

748
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,880
So this was a spin-off kind of the same time

749
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,080
Super Mario Super Show.

750
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,600
That's the show that everybody is aware of.

751
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,280
And probably if they were the right age,

752
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,800
it's the show starring Captain Lou Albano,

753
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,880
the pro wrestler.

754
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,760
The very hairy.

755
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,280
So the hairiest.

756
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,520
The hairiest men ever on television.

757
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,920
Like him and, I think he's hairier than Robin Williams.

758
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,400
And that's like, he's so hairy.

759
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,240
Mm-hmm.

760
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,000
And yes, I very remember.

761
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,240
Mario cartoons, it also had Legend of Zelda cartoons

762
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,760
where Link sounded like Scott's impression

763
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,000
of Summoner Redstone.

764
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,040
Okay, went then.

765
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,560
Pretty sad.

766
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,080
It was pretty rough.

767
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,280
The thing I was Captain N and the Game Master,

768
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,800
I think might be the third piece of this trilogy.

769
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,520
Captain N, by the way, a teenager

770
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,120
from Northridge, California in canon.

771
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,960
Whoa.

772
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,000
His name is Kevin Keen.

773
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,280
He gets sucked into the TV to a place called Videoland

774
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,240
where he teams up with, among others,

775
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,120
Mega Man, Kid Icarus, and Simon Belmont from Castlevania.

776
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,480
Wow, what a team up.

777
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,320
Oh my God.

778
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,160
That's a great team up.

779
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,800
That's a pretty good use of a bunch of disparate IP also

780
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,880
from all together in this power force.

781
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,760
There needs to be more done, by the way, with Mega Man also.

782
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,600
You know what's happening?

783
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,440
I love Mega Man.

784
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,280
Yeah, no, it's-

785
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,400
Would you play Mega Man when you were a kid?

786
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,240
I did, yeah, yeah.

787
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,080
I think only one of them.

788
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,280
I don't remember which, but I loved the one.

789
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,440
I found it very challenging, but rewarding.

790
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,160
It is, especially this challenge.

791
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,800
Mega Man 2, my God.

792
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,200
I don't know which one I had.

793
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,040
I do not know.

794
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,880
Could have been three.

795
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,280
Three and four, when you have more power ups,

796
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,760
it gets more pleasant.

797
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,680
Right, I still loved it, but yeah, anyway,

798
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,480
I like Mega Man a lot.

799
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,320
I haven't played in a while.

800
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,320
So yeah, so that's the one everybody remembers.

801
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,160
And it is sort of, it's not like this in the sense

802
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,840
that it's like, this one had a budget, the original.

803
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,640
It's not maybe the most beautiful looking show in the world,

804
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,040
but there was a big set.

805
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,680
It very much feels like a Pee-Wee's Playhouse thing,

806
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,720
which all feels born out of sort of local live television

807
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,560
to me.

808
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,520
But picture, but much cheaper than that.

809
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,120
Yes, of course, much cheaper than that.

810
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,360
But I'm just saying, I don't know,

811
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,880
I guess that's probably not the most relevant example

812
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,080
in this day and age.

813
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,280
Well, there is just, there is not this.

814
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,920
There's nothing where a bunch of kids

815
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,240
are all in grandstands, disorganized,

816
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,680
and they can all yell and chatter

817
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,960
and shout insults whenever they want.

818
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,360
There's no shows like this that are just a big kid pen.

819
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,040
Did you watch stuff like this when you were a kid out here?

820
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,200
I don't think there was any,

821
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,280
I think this genre was extinct.

822
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,520
Maybe it was killed by King Koopa's cool cartoons.

823
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,640
The thing I was watching was the Bozo show.

824
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,560
You were watching just the genuine Bozo show.

825
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,200
And I apologize for not knowing

826
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,160
when the regional Bozo stopped,

827
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,680
because you had an original like Los Angeles Bozo

828
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,800
that was different than my Bozo.

829
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,840
And then at a certain point, WGN sort of just took over

830
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,360
and then the Bozo that I watched was everyone's Bozo.

831
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,720
But it was Bozo in most cities?

832
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,360
There were regional Bozos that was a licensed character.

833
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,560
So they would, instead of just syndicating

834
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,920
or sending the same tape around,

835
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,080
they would just hire a local person

836
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,880
to play Bozo in specific markets.

837
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,720
So you would go across the country

838
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,640
and there would be the Bozo show,

839
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,920
but it would look different.

840
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,400
Bozo, each guy had a different take on the material.

841
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,880
Some of which it seems like were just like

842
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,440
raspy voice.

843
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,280
So that's the original.

844
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,000
60 year old.

845
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,840
Bob Bell.

846
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,360
Bob Bell is the Krusty the Clown bassist.

847
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,200
Okay.

848
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,720
He's the original Bozo the Clown.

849
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,000
My uncle was friends with his son.

850
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,840
Whoa.

851
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,680
Bob Bell was a crazy alcoholic

852
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,760
and would come home hammered a lot.

853
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,880
Hammered. Hammered.

854
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,080
And Bob Bell, if you watch the show,

855
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,920
it is very much like Krusty.

856
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,000
Old, this older drunk guys fucking around on a set.

857
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,280
They have their sketches like Bob Bell's dressed is like,

858
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,200
same thing like a little stinker or something

859
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,800
or he's dressed like grandma

860
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,320
and there's wolves at the door.

861
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,640
It's very watchable.

862
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,640
There's very little available, which really bums me out.

863
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,160
But if what you can find does look like

864
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,440
Krusty the Clown show.

865
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,400
It conveys it.

866
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,120
And the like, yeah, the way that is,

867
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,640
that is really like low rent what the,

868
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,680
what Bert's favorite show is.

869
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,960
And in the same way that Krusty was barely committed

870
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,640
to the bit, Bob Bell not committed to the bit at all,

871
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,040
completely above it.

872
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,440
Him and like Cookie, who would later join the show,

873
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,440
who would be still on when I was watching,

874
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,440
they were all just like fucking around.

875
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,200
And it was so funny to see, this is for children.

876
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,120
This is very much of a piece with something that you and I

877
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,240
I think got into like 10 years ago from a long time ago,

878
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,160
the Dean Martin variety.

879
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,000
Well, right.

880
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,600
Cause I'm sure these guys in their minds were like,

881
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,480
we should be on primetime TV entertaining adults.

882
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,760
We're drunk performers.

883
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,440
We should be on primetime.

884
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,760
Phoning in sketches.

885
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,600
Why can't we be on like the Dean Martin variety show?

886
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,760
Right, yes, exactly.

887
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,960
So it's a very similar vibe to like,

888
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,920
we don't give a shit about this,

889
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,960
but even more so cause like, there's no, I don't know.

890
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,000
There's no, I'm sure the joke writers,

891
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,720
they wrote the sketch 10 minutes before the show started.

892
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,560
Yeah.

893
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,400
And it was-

894
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,240
That's right.

895
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,200
Kids are coming.

896
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,840
But Bob Bell has the crusty voice.

897
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,680
It's really like what Dan Kesslin took it from.

898
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,560
Wow, wow.

899
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,280
But by the time I was watching Bozo,

900
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,360
it was a guy named Joey D'Aria or Delaria.

901
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,680
I forget how you pronounce his last name,

902
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,960
but he was very much a polished Jay Leno Bozo.

903
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,960
He very much had of like, he was kind of, he was funny.

904
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,280
And he was like a little smart alecky,

905
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,400
but he definitely was-

906
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,400
Crowd pleaser.

907
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,240
Yes, they absolutely got a Leno type Bozo.

908
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,080
None of the old magic.

909
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,320
And I liked Joey a lot.

910
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,800
I thought he did a good job and he was my Bozo growing up.

911
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,280
And I didn't know, I didn't know anything else.

912
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,880
I didn't know the Bob Bell Bozo,

913
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,840
which many purists in Chicago were unhappy

914
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,480
because this new Bozo wasn't drunk.

915
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,400
This new Bozo was not, he's too polished.

916
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,880
And this was a way that you as a child

917
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,480
were deprived of being unhappy.

918
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,320
Right.

919
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,480
You didn't have all the information you needed

920
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,640
to be unhappy about this.

921
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,480
Exactly.

922
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,240
And now I'm retroactively unhappy.

923
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,800
Let me ask, was, do you remember,

924
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,040
was there anyone who would like steer the ship?

925
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,440
Like there's a Dean Martin sketch that is one of the funniest-

926
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,600
In the Bob Bell stuff or the Joey years?

927
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,640
I think any of them.

928
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,080
Cause like there's a Dean Martin sketch

929
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,400
where like Bob Newhart is, he's got the script in,

930
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,640
he knows what the scene is.

931
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,480
Oh, I've seen that, yeah.

932
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,240
Do you think there's anyone as talented as Bob Newhart

933
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,840
on the set of the Bozo show?

934
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,680
I don't know.

935
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,800
I don't think there's anyone as talented,

936
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,400
but there's someone like who's sober and knows the stuff.

937
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,240
Well, I'll say this.

938
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,600
I don't know if there isn't.

939
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,720
Even kid children's performers, I like,

940
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,040
these were good performers.

941
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,680
Cookie, I was a big fan of.

942
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,760
So Cookie was old at this point.

943
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,880
So I think I've said this before,

944
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,120
where Cookie was sort of the sidekick

945
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,960
that would get shit on all the time.

946
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,160
So a common sketch I would watch on the Bozo show

947
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,560
is Bozo like has some pies or some like treats

948
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,240
and he makes a trail of treats into a big cannon

949
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,440
and Cookie's such a fucking moron.

950
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,200
He follows the trail, goes into the cannon

951
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,840
and Bozo again, like Krusty,

952
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,440
would pull the thing on the cannon

953
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,360
and they would pretend that they shot Cookie

954
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,520
across the whole set.

955
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,920
And then Cookie would come out with his clothes in tatter

956
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,760
and he has the smoke all around him

957
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,320
and we're like, woo, woozy or whatever.

958
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,840
That's a common, that would be what

959
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,400
a normal bit would be like.

960
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,480
This is Cookie?

961
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,320
Yes.

962
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,160
Okay, yeah.

963
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,480
Cookie's a clown too, but he looks like more of a dipshit.

964
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,080
Cookie was older, so Cookie was older

965
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,560
because he was from the early years

966
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,320
and Cookie would always want to lead the grand march

967
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,160
at the end of the show.

968
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,520
And much like Trix Rabbit or something,

969
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,440
Bozo would always fuck with this guy

970
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,120
and not let him lead the grand march.

971
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,360
And it drove me nuts.

972
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,840
I was like, I like Cookie, let him lead the grand march.

973
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,360
And here comes the sad, dark thing,

974
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,920
which I think I've said on the show before.

975
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,960
The only time Cookie got to lead the grand march

976
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,800
is when he had been gone for a few months

977
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,680
because he had cancer.

978
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,280
Cookie came back and led the grand march.

979
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,800
And I was like, well, this isn't the way.

980
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,000
It's like, it's fucking Cookie.

981
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,240
Shouldn't be a sympathy move.

982
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,440
I like Cookie.

983
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,920
He earned this right.

984
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,760
But I-

985
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,160
Don't do it because you think he's gonna die.

986
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,480
But I was obsessed with this

987
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,080
and this was the hottest ticket in town.

988
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,040
My mom would call every once a year

989
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,360
when they would put tickets on,

990
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,000
not sale because we're free, put tickets available.

991
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,760
She would be on the phone, I remember, for hours

992
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,880
trying to dial through like a single line

993
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,600
to get through to get us tickets.

994
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,440
Never happened.

995
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,640
Why once a year?

996
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,480
What the hell's going on?

997
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,680
Whatever dumb system that they had in place here

998
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,360
was not working, especially for me.

999
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,840
Now my mother was an at-home player

1000
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,920
on the first Bozo show.

1001
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,960
She won a prize from Bozo, but she wasn't on the show.

1002
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,360
Her name got pulled out of like a sack or something.

1003
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,880
What did you say, an at-home player?

1004
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,440
We haven't talked about King Koo, but I certainly-

1005
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,280
But-

1006
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,640
I'd like to say this.

1007
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,560
There have been multiple outings.

1008
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,920
We're going out for drinks with Mike

1009
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,520
where the conversation becomes,

1010
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,160
let me tell you everything about Bozo.

1011
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,000
Let me tell you about Bozo.

1012
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,840
This is absolute.

1013
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,960
I think this is the thing, the most, this is like the-

1014
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,040
You're finally getting the full-

1015
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,040
When you rupture what comes forth as Bozo.

1016
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,520
And he lights up.

1017
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:07,520
Then, just as he is like cranked up to 11 now.

1018
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,160
Desi, he goes to the bathroom,

1019
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,640
takes a hit of cocaine and comes back out.

1020
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,200
So an at-home player is that they would have a Bozo buckets

1021
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,400
and there would be a kid in studio

1022
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,440
with the little ping pong balls

1023
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,760
trying to get the Bozo buckets to get in each of the balls,

1024
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,280
or excuse me, each of the buckets.

1025
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,680
And you would get a better prize

1026
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,360
the farther you got along the buckets.

1027
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,080
So they would also right before pull an at-home player.

1028
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,840
So that kid would get matching prizes

1029
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,440
for the kid who was playing in studio.

1030
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,360
So my mom was pulled.

1031
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,840
So the kid who was doing the bucket game

1032
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,920
got to maybe bucket three and she got like a bicycle.

1033
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,120
And if you got to like five,

1034
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,840
you might get a trip or something.

1035
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,200
Bicycles is hell of a-

1036
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,040
It's a great prize.

1037
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,860
It's pretty great.

1038
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,800
Wow.

1039
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,880
So I never got to do Bozo's show.

1040
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,200
I never got to go in that,

1041
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,880
on the risers with a bunch of other kids and scream.

1042
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,920
I never got a bike.

1043
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,800
You never got to watch this cancer riddled man

1044
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,080
lead the grand march.

1045
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,640
I forgot to see a weary Cookie

1046
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,080
have to put the makeup back on in his seventies or whatever.

1047
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,760
He's still doing it himself.

1048
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,720
Yeah.

1049
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,080
Sorry Cookie, we can't, yeah, we got nobody to help you.

1050
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:13,920
Yeah.

1051
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,320
Dip your face up, I'd be done with it.

1052
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,040
I loved, I mean, they had all the kids.

1053
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,960
There was Professor Andy, there was a Whizzo, the Magician.

1054
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,800
Uh-huh.

1055
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,560
Okay, Marshall Brodean, all these guys I loved.

1056
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,640
So when I learned there was a King Kuba version of this,

1057
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,880
I was very excited.

1058
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,700
Yeah.

1059
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,040
It was not quite as exciting looking

1060
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,680
as perhaps a Bozo show was when I found some of the footage.

1061
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,600
But-

1062
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,720
I might take humiliation with you

1063
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,640
calling Bozo exciting looking.

1064
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,480
Okay, all right.

1065
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,720
Let's Google Bozo, an old drunk dressed as a clown.

1066
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,320
All right, exciting.

1067
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,960
Uh-huh, well to me, you know, to me.

1068
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,800
I need to look at it,

1069
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,480
cause I would watch Bozo when I was very young as well.

1070
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,320
I have memories of it.

1071
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,560
I don't know if it was your Bozo or Philadelphia Bozo.

1072
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,480
Cause I believe Philadelphia had it.

1073
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,600
Yeah, that was a market for sure,

1074
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,880
where there was a regional Bozo.

1075
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,320
But yeah, so, and of course I've mentioned many times

1076
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,960
the five timers, I think Billy Corgan

1077
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,500
played the final Bozo show.

1078
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,640
He played forever young on the final Bozo show.

1079
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,660
Take it.

1080
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,120
19-

1081
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,880
So he did not play 1979 on the Bozo show.

1082
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,880
Let's play the intro to King Koopa's cool cartoon.

1083
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,920
The intro is really good.

1084
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,760
Yeah.

1085
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,100
So here, let me.

1086
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,580
["Koopa Koopa Theme Song"]

1087
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,680
So to describe this,

1088
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:53,680
there's a man in a very cheap looking King Koopa costume

1089
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,520
that's modeled after that cartoon version

1090
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,560
that you would see on the Mario Brothers Super Show.

1091
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,640
He doesn't look kind of like the Bowser in game.

1092
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,000
He looks like King Koopa specifically from that cartoon.

1093
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,140
So he's got kind of like a,

1094
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,840
like he's got green face paint on,

1095
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,700
but he also has like this cheap snout,

1096
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,040
this kind of Koopa snout.

1097
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,520
He has a crown and he has like,

1098
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,180
like a shabby blue jacket.

1099
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:21,900
And he's going up and down Hollywood Boulevard

1100
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,220
in this intro with a bunch of kids in tow.

1101
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,060
An army of children.

1102
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,380
An army of children in tow.

1103
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,200
So many.

1104
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,860
It's very Pied Piper-y.

1105
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,700
And also,

1106
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,380
Grauman's Chinese theater is very prominent.

1107
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,260
It's very, yes.

1108
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,580
I think he's at,

1109
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,260
because he's next to all these big like columns.

1110
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:44,500
I think he's out front of what is now the Kimmel Studio.

1111
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,340
I want to say.

1112
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,160
Oh, okay.

1113
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,740
I think, because if he's across from the Chinese theater.

1114
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,340
Yeah.

1115
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,300
I think we're at the,

1116
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,380
you know, it's too bad he didn't graduate up to that theater.

1117
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,620
It should have been his.

1118
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,460
Yeah, it should have been.

1119
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,300
It could have been.

1120
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,060
Kind of outlasted Kimmel easily.

1121
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:01,900
Yes.

1122
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,980
But some problems arose.

1123
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,260
And Jay, if, you know, Jay Leno could have pushed,

1124
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,140
tried to push him out at a certain point here.

1125
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,700
Jay would have hosted this show.

1126
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,420
But yeah.

1127
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,140
So there's kids and this is a,

1128
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,060
you know, you can tell by listening to it already.

1129
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:20,820
It's rap adjacent,

1130
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,500
rap what somebody who think,

1131
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,580
oh, this is a modern kids like.

1132
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,420
Oh my God.

1133
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,660
Here we go.

1134
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,660
I'm Koopa.

1135
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:33,060
The lyric is about who calls you a nincompoop.

1136
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,340
Yes, I have the lyrics.

1137
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,900
Creeper who calls you a nincompoop Koopa.

1138
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,620
I'm the pain who plays the game and knocks you for a loop.

1139
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:45,980
Love it.

1140
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,260
I'm a Koopa Koopa.

1141
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,500
He's Koopa Koopa, the kids say.

1142
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,260
So he.

1143
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,780
Takes no convincing of these kids.

1144
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,220
There's so many kids.

1145
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,060
They are.

1146
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:58,060
On for, I don't know what he did to get them.

1147
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,580
Brainwashed from the start.

1148
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,420
Yeah.

1149
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,260
They're ready to follow him.

1150
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,100
Yeah, yeah.

1151
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,940
Yeah.

1152
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,420
I think there seems to be an error to this show

1153
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,060
from what I could tell of like,

1154
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,260
it's cool to be bad.

1155
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,100
Yes. Right?

1156
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,820
Like there, cause they're all, there's attitude to it.

1157
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,660
And he kind of like,

1158
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:16,300
he's a little like threatening to them and me.

1159
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,580
And I mean, to get, to have a villain host the show,

1160
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,420
which is different than a Bozo.

1161
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,260
We know he's a, he's a bad dude.

1162
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,100
Yes.

1163
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,380
It's, there's a report, like,

1164
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,580
there's a very little information that's concrete.

1165
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,140
I feel like there's a lot of rumors about the show,

1166
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,700
but like one of the videos I was watching,

1167
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,700
it's like Bowser would regularly,

1168
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,300
or King Koopa would regularly tell kids

1169
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,580
that like sent him a mean letter,

1170
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,220
like, I know where you live,

1171
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,860
which didn't go over well.

1172
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,260
I said that he would, he would say like,

1173
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,540
all right, that's, you could say whatever you want,

1174
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,420
but now I know where you live.

1175
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,780
And some, yeah, so I saw that like,

1176
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,580
somebody like said, was this, well,

1177
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,140
that must be why the show got canceled.

1178
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,740
And someone else said, no, he said that every episode.

1179
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:03,700
Yes, yes, exactly.

1180
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,740
Cause I saw that too.

1181
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,980
It was like, oh, that's why it was.

1182
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,740
Can I ask just as a tease, I don't want to say it now,

1183
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:12,220
but did you see why one of the writers said it was canceled?

1184
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,420
Yes, I don't believe this for a second.

1185
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,260
How could it be in there?

1186
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,700
Did one of us write it?

1187
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,540
Yeah, yeah.

1188
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,500
How could it lead to this point that everything

1189
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,780
when I wrote this sentence, when I read this sentence,

1190
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:25,660
I don't, I honestly, I, we, I think we need a better source.

1191
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:28,060
I don't disagree, but how is it in there?

1192
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,340
We'll go, we'll keep talking.

1193
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,820
I just saw it very vague, like in you.

1194
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,260
You didn't see it.

1195
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,460
You would know what we meant.

1196
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,300
Oh, no.

1197
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,460
There's a person involved.

1198
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:40,100
Yeah, no, I know what the, I know what person is involved,

1199
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:43,140
but I just saw it as like, well, there were some incidents.

1200
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:43,980
Okay.

1201
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,660
There were some altercations.

1202
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,140
I'm still not sure that you know what we're talking about.

1203
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:47,980
I don't think I know what you're talking about.

1204
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,660
I don't think you know what we're talking about.

1205
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:50,500
Yeah.

1206
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,340
So we'll get there.

1207
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,160
We'll get there.

1208
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,820
And this is making it wild because of who the person is

1209
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,820
in their filmography.

1210
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,300
Oh, that's a different, it's a different,

1211
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,420
you might have a thing I don't know.

1212
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,500
I think I, okay.

1213
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,740
All right, enough of the vagueness.

1214
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,220
We'll keep talking about this.

1215
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:06,140
So the, the, a King Koopa leads a march

1216
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,620
down Hollywood Boulevard and then,

1217
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:10,500
and then walks marches everybody into a TV studio

1218
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,740
where they don't seem to have permission to be.

1219
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,580
Right.

1220
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,020
There's a security guard with a mustache who's all harumphy.

1221
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,540
And then Koopa takes his mustache off.

1222
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,000
He rips it off.

1223
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,460
It is a fake mustache.

1224
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,660
He's not, there's no blood or anything.

1225
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:24,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1226
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,740
No, no blood is shed.

1227
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,760
Yeah.

1228
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,300
And then they march into the studio of a in-progress

1229
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,820
different kid show, a clown show of some kind.

1230
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,940
And they just kind of kick the performers out.

1231
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,500
And then the last line of the opening is,

1232
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,660
it's my show now.

1233
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,420
Love that.

1234
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,940
Yeah, it is good.

1235
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,540
Yes.

1236
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:49,220
And then we've missed one aspect of this opening,

1237
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,980
which is that, and again, there,

1238
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:53,660
this is only available in miserable quality.

1239
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,980
So it is really hard to tell what the hell's going on.

1240
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,820
Yeah.

1241
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,980
Like all the shapes are fuzzy, fuzzy enough that to me,

1242
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:01,540
the Koopa makeup doesn't seem that bad.

1243
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:04,580
I was like, you know, maybe if this was an HD,

1244
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:05,740
I think it would suffer.

1245
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,700
But I'm like, this guy looks cool.

1246
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,020
If you look up, I'm sure it'll be in our art.

1247
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,940
But if you look up a picture of it, I'm kind of like,

1248
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,620
I like, I think it's good.

1249
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,580
I think it's good.

1250
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,820
I thought it referred to as like very similar

1251
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:20,860
to the icecapades costume, but with a better face.

1252
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:24,180
Yeah, he's got like kind of like plasticky top half of head.

1253
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:27,460
And then the rest just turns into like the triple chins

1254
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,780
of this guy.

1255
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:31,160
But it's, he's just painted green.

1256
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,480
I like looking at him.

1257
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,440
I mean, that's what made me want to talk about him

1258
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,720
for a while and the shit like, Ooh,

1259
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,760
I just want to stare at this picture for a while.

1260
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,760
He's got cool.

1261
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,840
He's got like, he's got them like, yeah,

1262
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,760
his neck and his face are painted green.

1263
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,840
And then it goes into like a green shirt.

1264
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,720
That's a different color.

1265
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,640
That's supposed to be the same color,

1266
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,480
but clearly not.

1267
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,320
And clearly not.

1268
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,920
And then he has a pink bow tie.

1269
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,440
And then he has like a yellow belly,

1270
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,360
like a kind of scaly dinosaur belly.

1271
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,040
And then he has.

1272
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:03,160
Yeah, that's what the brothers taught us Koopa would have.

1273
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,000
Yeah, right.

1274
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,720
I'm not saying I don't like him.

1275
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,000
I'm just saying like, it's not a high budget costume.

1276
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,800
Yeah. And look, we, I mean, especially the land

1277
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,400
and also the movie, we are for sure seeing the finally

1278
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,120
in 2023, they are doing like the clean,

1279
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,760
what it always should have been.

1280
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,040
And that makes sense.

1281
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,520
And kids are going to actually like it as opposed

1282
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,680
to whatever we're doing.

1283
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,720
But do you think kids were less scared by this

1284
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,520
or by Dennis Hopper?

1285
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,760
Dennis Hopper is terrifying.

1286
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,640
Dennis Hopper is one of the scariest men I've ever lived.

1287
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,280
Crazy. Yeah, yeah.

1288
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,120
He's so scary.

1289
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,040
You have to, you do have to give the movie credit.

1290
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,280
The stars are Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo

1291
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,920
and Dennis Hopper, like three good actors.

1292
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,760
Unbelievable.

1293
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,600
Yeah, yeah.

1294
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,360
Yeah, it's, no, it's very strong,

1295
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,120
but there's only so much you can do

1296
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,440
when probably they're writing the movie on the day.

1297
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,120
It was the same writing quality

1298
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,440
as Ken Koopa's cool cartoons.

1299
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,480
It's like no script, what the hell is this?

1300
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,320
Yeah.

1301
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,320
So what I was getting at though,

1302
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,600
is that like first time watching this opening,

1303
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,120
I'm like, what the hell is that on the ground?

1304
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,800
What is this thing running around?

1305
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,120
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1306
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:15,960
Yes, you're right.

1307
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,800
This is horrifying.

1308
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,760
And it's so, the footage is so bad and blurry and dark.

1309
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,520
I'm honestly like, I don't know what this is.

1310
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,400
This is some kind of hell hound.

1311
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:29,280
And it's clearly moving in an erratic animal-like fashion.

1312
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,880
So like, is this a dog with a mask?

1313
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,120
But then later you see the same character

1314
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,120
in a studio setting.

1315
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,600
And the answer is it is both things.

1316
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:43,600
But in general, what this is, is Koopa's pet rat, Ratso.

1317
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:44,920
Ratso, yeah.

1318
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,480
At a certain point he calls it his prize rat.

1319
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,320
Oh.

1320
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,160
So I think, yeah.

1321
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,160
He won a prize.

1322
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,760
So an award winner.

1323
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,880
So yeah, he's both a dog with just a costume on.

1324
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,760
And he's also a puppet.

1325
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,240
He's also a puppet that comes like,

1326
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,120
just like in a traditional puppet theater

1327
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:03,960
in the way that-

1328
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,160
It's very like Chuck E. Cheese.

1329
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,880
Like when there's like a supporting,

1330
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,760
there's a guy in a suit,

1331
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,480
but then there's a supporting smaller puppet.

1332
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,280
Bozo would talk to the puppet dog, Cuddly Dudley.

1333
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,040
Just for information.

1334
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,440
You are pulling all the,

1335
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,120
you are not looking at any device with the Bozo stuff.

1336
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,200
It's all off the dough.

1337
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,520
No, I didn't have to refresh on any of that.

1338
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,360
All of the Bozo specifics.

1339
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,200
Yeah.

1340
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,720
Yeah, Cuddly Dudley, I know.

1341
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,240
This, I hope that masks don't hurt a dog.

1342
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,000
I hope that dogs are not made uncomfortable by a mask,

1343
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,840
whatever.

1344
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:35,660
Let me say that.

1345
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:39,640
But when a dog is wearing a mask, it is very entertaining.

1346
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:44,040
A dog in a rat mask, it looks so crazy in that opening.

1347
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,320
And it all reminds me of one of my favorite

1348
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,960
mystery science theater movies, Killer Shrews,

1349
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,920
where there's all these like terrifying,

1350
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,600
bloodthirsty creatures.

1351
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,320
And they all have fangs just strapped on

1352
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,080
to regular dog's faces.

1353
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:57,920
Oh yeah.

1354
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,960
I have a feeling that in the 1950s,

1355
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,480
the Killer Shrews were not treated so well.

1356
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,320
Uh-huh.

1357
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,160
I don't know.

1358
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,040
There's probably a reason you don't see animals

1359
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,240
in masks more often.

1360
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,000
Yeah, I was gonna say, you know how you were like,

1361
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,120
oh, what's that really erratic behavior

1362
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,560
from that small creature?

1363
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,400
It's because the dog is having a panic attack.

1364
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,680
It's because it's in a mask.

1365
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,040
It can't see anything.

1366
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:16,880
What is this?

1367
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,040
What is on me?

1368
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,040
This is the end.

1369
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,960
So the dog's giving a hell of a performance.

1370
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,680
So a lot of dogs feel when they have a hat on.

1371
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,520
Yeah.

1372
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,360
Much less a mask.

1373
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,080
Our dog, when he's got a sweater on,

1374
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,920
fucking hates it.

1375
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,760
He's rolling around.

1376
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,600
Stop, stop, stop.

1377
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,960
Kill me, stop.

1378
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,760
Garwood loves wearing little sweaters.

1379
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,240
He does not like putting them on.

1380
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,400
He does not like getting them put on him.

1381
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,240
Sure.

1382
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,920
But he likes having them on.

1383
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,760
Because he looks good.

1384
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,600
He likes it.

1385
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,440
He likes the attention.

1386
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,640
He looks very sharp, yeah.

1387
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,480
So rats are there.

1388
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,800
I love ratso.

1389
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,640
Yeah, ratso.

1390
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,320
I mean, I like ratso, obviously.

1391
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:55,440
And then you got the kids who are all in very like,

1392
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,920
it's a Mickey Mouse Club situation.

1393
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,560
They all need their uniform.

1394
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:03,560
So they are wearing Koopa's Troopa's shirts

1395
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,640
that they got to keep.

1396
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:12,080
And then helmets that are like turtle head helmets

1397
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,560
that they had to turn back into the studio

1398
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,160
when the taping was done.

1399
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,560
So that they could be.

1400
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,680
I mean, you know, I'm in theme park mode.

1401
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,640
I'm thinking so that they can sanitize the helmets.

1402
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,040
The helmets were not sanitized.

1403
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,280
There was a new group of kids coming in,

1404
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,480
probably in two hours.

1405
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,240
There were so many families of head lice

1406
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,640
living in the Koopa Troopa helmets.

1407
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,360
Even after a year.

1408
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:42,960
The major, yeah, probably any Los Angeles lice

1409
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,800
in the late 80s.

1410
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,640
Yeah.

1411
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,120
The agent zero of it was like any kid

1412
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,520
who'd been at the taping of Koopa's cool cartoons.

1413
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,560
Right, because they were allowed to keep the t-shirts.

1414
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,920
They all were matching t-shirts,

1415
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,760
but they took the helmets back.

1416
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,600
I just said this, but yes.

1417
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,440
Okay, sorry.

1418
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,000
I was just trying to reiterate.

1419
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I know you said it.

1420
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,840
I was just trying to reiterate.

1421
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,240
Yeah, good cover, good cover.

1422
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,680
It was just like, it was an important point.

1423
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,560
So I'm gonna say it again.

1424
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,640
Yeah.

1425
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,560
Yeah, so I was talking to, I mentioned Justin again,

1426
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,960
and he said, yeah, I really wanted one of those helmets.

1427
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,720
And I thought I would be able to get it

1428
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,320
if I got on the show, but then he realized,

1429
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,680
he didn't ever get to do the show, but then.

1430
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,480
Okay, I thought that was gonna be the reveal maybe.

1431
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,320
He just did.

1432
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,160
No, no, it's a different,

1433
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,760
you're not gonna expect where the reveal goes.

1434
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,680
But he said, he never got to go on the show,

1435
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,560
but he just remembers, he didn't ever know it was regional,

1436
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:32,720
but he remembers him taking live calls on the air.

1437
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,320
It's a call in?

1438
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,640
That's too chaotic for a kid show.

1439
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,200
You don't know what's gonna happen on that.

1440
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,240
Right, so, and there's no footage of that,

1441
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,440
but that's what he remembers, live calls,

1442
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,640
and he remembers he would write letters

1443
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,200
and try to get in there too.

1444
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,040
Oh, okay.

1445
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:47,880
Try to participate.

1446
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:48,700
But never got read.

1447
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:52,240
It's so hard, again, it seems like this is sort of,

1448
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,880
like a major area of lost media.

1449
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,480
Like somehow there is very little of this,

1450
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,880
and the footage that does exist is so poorly recorded.

1451
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,200
Somebody this very week on YouTube posted,

1452
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,320
like, I tried to restore it, which actually did help.

1453
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:14,840
I was able to hear the audio of a segment with Ratso.

1454
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,760
I wrote down no notes about it,

1455
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,080
so clearly it left no impression,

1456
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,540
but I was able to hear that.

1457
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:25,540
I was able to hear every bit of dialogue of vegetable theater,

1458
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:29,380
a segment where pieces of vegetables are held up

1459
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:33,240
and puppeted, and then Koopa cuts off parts of them.

1460
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,480
Is it possible, none of the, I think,

1461
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:41,400
is it 56 episodes were recorded, maybe?

1462
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,120
Six is in the 60s. 65.

1463
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,200
Okay, I reversed it.

1464
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,040
Maybe nothing is worth saving of any of this?

1465
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,480
Very possibly, yes.

1466
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,800
One of the videos I was watching, this guy,

1467
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,760
and let me find, I'm sure we all watch the same video,

1468
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,200
because there's not many videos.

1469
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,240
Is it Thomas Game Docs?

1470
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,520
Does that sound familiar?

1471
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,360
Maybe not.

1472
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,180
I think it was a different one.

1473
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:05,020
Oh, okay.

1474
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:07,320
Did this, the information is that, you know,

1475
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,680
there's been a couple people on Reddit

1476
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,520
have talked about it.

1477
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,560
One specific Redditor says that they have two copies,

1478
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,320
two episodes on tape,

1479
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,940
but these have yet to be uploaded or put online.

1480
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:21,320
Also, somebody thinks that UCLA has an episode

1481
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:25,660
in the archives, but they will not release it to the public.

1482
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,520
Why?

1483
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,340
I don't know.

1484
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,180
What are you writing?

1485
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:30,280
It's time to storm it.

1486
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,120
I'm not sure.

1487
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,960
Let's storm it, guys.

1488
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,440
This is the PTR, January 6th.

1489
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,280
All right.

1490
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,560
Cliffords are gonna go and politely ask

1491
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,240
that they hand us a tape that we will return.

1492
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,080
Right.

1493
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,760
Just to see what a full episode

1494
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,720
of King Koopa's Cool Cartoons was like.

1495
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:51,240
So yeah, UCLA might have it in their film and TV archive.

1496
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,740
One episode, not the whole run of the show.

1497
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:56,040
Look, I wanna see the show,

1498
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,440
but I also, if you work at the UCLA film archive,

1499
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,540
can I just ask, don't you need the space?

1500
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,380
Don't you need a prison?

1501
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:05,600
There's something better you could store there.

1502
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,680
Complete digital copy.

1503
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,040
Don't you need the file space?

1504
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:09,880
Yeah.

1505
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,280
Yeah, this isn't even worth.

1506
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,480
The YouTubers who've posted clips of this,

1507
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,600
they're like, let's leave this episode up

1508
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,440
for a couple days and then, that's it.

1509
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,280
And we'll delete it, yeah, we need the space.

1510
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,440
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna need the space.

1511
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,400
Or maybe if we could just borrow it for like an hour

1512
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,500
and use your viewing, you must have viewing for students.

1513
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,520
You must have a TV, VCR, DVD player.

1514
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,800
I may be.

1515
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,360
I'm worried this isn't gonna work.

1516
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,240
The only solution is to sign up for full tuition.

1517
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,300
Years of education at UCLA.

1518
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,280
We have to do this on the open up,

1519
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,880
where it's never gonna work.

1520
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,080
It's funny this popped up too,

1521
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,880
because I have been looking through like places

1522
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,120
in the valley and around here

1523
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,440
that have student TV programs.

1524
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,920
And I was like, could I use a TV studio?

1525
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,160
Would I have to sign up for one class?

1526
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,420
UCLA is not the place to do it,

1527
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,760
but maybe it is now that we wanna get that.

1528
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,860
You're looking for student TV stations to shoot at?

1529
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,440
Yeah, I don't know what for yet.

1530
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,360
I'm just saying like this is all kind of,

1531
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,280
this is all converging at the same time.

1532
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,160
Where I was like, it'd be interesting to get in,

1533
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,680
shoot a TV show at a college TV station.

1534
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:19,240
With interns working the cameras.

1535
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,880
That's by the way where I started with the idea.

1536
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,280
So it's not like I even have thought it out.

1537
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,520
Are you trying to do it?

1538
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,360
I mean, I've thought it out.

1539
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:29,260
Are you trying to be the host of a cool teen dance show

1540
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,080
for affirmation that you are cool with teens?

1541
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:32,920
Maybe.

1542
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,000
I could do a lot.

1543
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,120
Maybe they just give me like a Saturday block of programming.

1544
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:41,880
Hey, you're back again with Mondo Mike's big time hits.

1545
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:42,720
I'll do it.

1546
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,880
We're spinning all the songs that kids love.

1547
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:50,880
Green Day, Aerosmith, here's one from the Gin Blossoms.

1548
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:54,000
The Burbank Library has a bunch of media center.

1549
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,400
Like they have a sound booth that you can rent out,

1550
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,160
but it's max two people.

1551
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,000
I looked up that one.

1552
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,960
Okay, do they have a whole television studio?

1553
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,040
Or is this a children's show?

1554
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,600
No, they might have a green screen

1555
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,000
and like editing computers.

1556
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,720
Do they have risers for children?

1557
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:08,560
To watch me perform?

1558
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,520
Oh, a few unful risers for children?

1559
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,360
I don't know.

1560
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:14,960
You'd have to talk to the head librarian for that.

1561
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,480
Head of technology might be able to help you there.

1562
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:20,120
Do you guys have a little room that I could fit like,

1563
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,280
I don't know, 30 or 40 children in

1564
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:25,560
and then shut the door and it should be soundproof too.

1565
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,840
Just so that I can like, you know,

1566
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,360
screw around and do whatever I want in there with them.

1567
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:32,520
Oh man, librarians still get enough grief these days.

1568
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,280
Like, hey, we're trying to shoot a twisted

1569
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,520
proof of concept TV show.

1570
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,800
Could you help us?

1571
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,720
I'll talk to the mayor.

1572
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,440
Maybe he'll help in Burbank.

1573
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,080
So where do we leave it?

1574
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,040
Oh, the kids and the shit.

1575
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,040
We haven't talked about the catchphrase of the show.

1576
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:50,880
Oh yeah, sure.

1577
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,320
Be a good Koopa or I'll Koopa-youpa.

1578
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,720
What does that mean?

1579
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,560
No idea.

1580
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,400
Yeah, I was trying to read that earlier.

1581
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,240
And I was like, I don't know.

1582
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,080
Just being Koopa, you can use it as a verb

1583
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,080
is like, I'll kill you.

1584
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,920
Why, you have to be a Koopa or I'll Koopa,

1585
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,480
but-

1586
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,640
Well, how about this?

1587
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,840
Be a killer or I'll kill you.

1588
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:14,960
Kind of works.

1589
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,080
I guess you translated it from Koopa-ese.

1590
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,360
Yeah, he's telling them you have to kill or I'll kill you.

1591
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,560
I'm now picturing, I'm now looking at this character

1592
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,960
and imagining him saying that, which I can picture.

1593
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,640
Except I think he's doing it with a smile.

1594
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,520
Hey, be a killer or I'll kill you.

1595
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,960
I think he just said that on the show.

1596
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,920
I think this guy slipped and said it on the show.

1597
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,000
Well, he said some other bad stuff too, apparently.

1598
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
He said, there's one I implore all of us to not say.

1599
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,400
No, I don't wanna say it, but like he-

1600
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,240
I'm not gonna say that one.

1601
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,280
There were two performers that played King Koopa

1602
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:47,880
because one of them was racially insensitive on the air.

1603
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,680
Oh yeah, that is not what I saw, yeah.

1604
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:51,520
Well yeah, and by the way,

1605
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,360
don't know that's a different thing we're talking about.

1606
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,320
Oh no.

1607
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,160
Yeah, no, we're talking about

1608
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,360
something totally different, Jason.

1609
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,200
Should we talk about this guy?

1610
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1611
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,960
Chris Collins, though I saw a different name too.

1612
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,120
Another Chris.

1613
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,680
All of this could be fake, by the way.

1614
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,920
All of this information feels like it's really lightly

1615
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,320
sourced to the point where it could be all rumor.

1616
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,920
Well, the guy exists.

1617
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:13,760
I mean, yes he does.

1618
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,920
He's on IMDB and he's credited as the character.

1619
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,240
He's a performer, yes, yes.

1620
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:21,760
Dan, he looks like a Bill Frawley type.

1621
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:22,600
Yeah, yeah.

1622
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:26,440
So it adds up that, so we start with Christopher Collins

1623
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,160
and again, I don't have his other name

1624
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,360
that he went by in front of me,

1625
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:33,840
but a veteran voice actor was in a lot of,

1626
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,040
was in a lot of like big kids cartoons.

1627
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,360
He played Starscream.

1628
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,200
He was Starscream.

1629
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,320
In Transformers.

1630
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,320
In Transformers.

1631
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,520
And Cobra Commander.

1632
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,360
Wow.

1633
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,200
In G.I. Joe.

1634
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,040
These are huge.

1635
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:45,880
Yeah.

1636
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,760
Characters that live on and the other people probably do

1637
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,040
something in the vein of what this guy did.

1638
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:54,560
Yes, and who knew he couldn't be trusted

1639
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,120
on live television to say something crazy.

1640
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:59,880
I think he also already hit on a woman in the audience

1641
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,560
or would commonly do this, maybe.

1642
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,520
Like Yoshi would do.

1643
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,360
Yeah.

1644
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1645
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,120
I saw the name Chris Lada.

1646
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:08,960
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1647
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:09,800
Okay, that's the other one.

1648
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:10,880
Yeah.

1649
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,160
So yeah, he, you know, he said this

1650
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,040
where he said, I know where you live.

1651
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,960
There's general stories about this guy.

1652
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:24,200
He, okay.

1653
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,480
Here's one about, this is in a book

1654
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:30,440
by a Transformers and G.I. Joe producer,

1655
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:34,280
the Flint Dill, who says he had to regularly bail

1656
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:38,640
this guy out of jail while working on the cartoons.

1657
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,840
This is in the grand tradition of Bob Bell, I feel like.

1658
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:44,600
Like kind of an unstable seeming performer.

1659
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,400
Although this guy seems a little more unhinged.

1660
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,160
What was it about why local entertainment,

1661
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,760
why did local entertainment lend itself,

1662
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,640
kids entertainment lend itself to drunkenness?

1663
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,200
Well, I think everyone, especially in the,

1664
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,600
everyone was drunk in the 60s, 1560s.

1665
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,800
So I think that's just blank

1666
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,920
and any older man was drunk all the time.

1667
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,040
Sure.

1668
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,360
And at their job.

1669
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,280
So it's not so strange.

1670
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,880
Right.

1671
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,840
But then this, if this guy is just on,

1672
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:11,920
was this show live?

1673
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,280
We, yeah, it is Collins.

1674
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,120
Yeah, yeah.

1675
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:14,960
Yeah.

1676
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,200
So, but there's a difference between,

1677
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,200
we'll let this old drunk be in a cartoon version.

1678
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,680
Versus he will be live on television

1679
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,440
with children in front of him.

1680
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,880
It's crazy.

1681
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,560
Well, even, I think the original Bozo show was live too.

1682
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,000
You were, you're like, cause everything,

1683
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,960
so many more things were live back in the old days.

1684
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,480
But there was still, I guess in the 80s,

1685
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,920
holdover from that.

1686
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,200
Cause yeah, the news would be live.

1687
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,880
And I'm sure other like local programs would be live.

1688
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:42,720
Oh, sure.

1689
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,680
Well, even live to tape, you, it happens.

1690
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:46,640
Then you're like, oh God,

1691
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,320
we gotta put it in the machine and cut that out.

1692
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:50,160
Sure, yeah.

1693
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,920
Which is a pain in the ass.

1694
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,800
They showed us how to use a reel to reel.

1695
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,400
Oh, I worked a reel to reel in college.

1696
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,000
Sure, you ever worked a reel to reel?

1697
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,440
I did, no, that was done.

1698
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,840
Yeah, I mean, I don't know why I had to do it.

1699
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,800
It was on the way out, we had an habit.

1700
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,040
But I had to like, cause you deserve to be punished too.

1701
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,320
I had to cut like a news package.

1702
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,120
You should do what I did.

1703
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:12,640
Reel to reel from a big time, like there's a,

1704
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,440
furthermore, I'm not gonna work in the news department.

1705
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,400
Second of all, there are fucking computers over there.

1706
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,000
A lot of my peers would just say like,

1707
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,240
all right, I'll reserve time for the reel to reel

1708
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,800
and just go to the final cut lab and just like,

1709
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:24,640
do it there.

1710
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,120
It looks so much better.

1711
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:28,280
Yeah, the more precise, the better.

1712
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:31,640
Better if nobody wants to cut the way they used to.

1713
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:36,640
One of the YouTube videos about this show

1714
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,040
and the talk about the host led me in the direction

1715
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:43,560
of an episode of WTF with Mark Maron,

1716
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:47,080
where they quoted it,

1717
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,560
but then I wanted to hear it in context.

1718
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:52,920
It's in an episode with Lorraine Newman from SNL

1719
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:57,360
and she's talking about the joys of doing voiceover.

1720
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:02,360
And he, Samarin says, see, when I think about voiceover,

1721
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,680
I think of this guy, this, there was this guy,

1722
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:10,680
this monster who was just drugs and booze and weird,

1723
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,640
just fucking creepy.

1724
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,280
You'd see this guy doing standup,

1725
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,880
like he was doing standup in Boston

1726
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:16,840
when I was starting to do it.

1727
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:19,600
And just this guy, the darkest guy.

1728
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:23,240
And Lorraine Newman jokes and says,

1729
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:26,600
and his name is expecting to get nothing in return.

1730
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,920
And Marin just says, Chris Collins, he's dead.

1731
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,680
He just says this guy's name

1732
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:35,600
and talks about the negative energy around this guy

1733
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:39,280
and how knowing that he did kids' cartoons,

1734
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,520
that he said that he would think to himself like,

1735
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:46,560
oh, if only these parents knew who was,

1736
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,800
it was putting their voice in that animal.

1737
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,640
So Marin, Marin like really, he gets dark, just recalling.

1738
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:58,640
And I have no further stories about this guy

1739
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,320
and his drunkenness, but like, you know,

1740
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:03,040
Marin saw some dark stuff doing,

1741
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,840
the way he started doing standup.

1742
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:07,480
Marin was around with, Sam Kinnison was around,

1743
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:08,800
too, was out of control.

1744
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,080
But that's a joyous, wonderful kind of message.

1745
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,360
Well, yeah, some of it.

1746
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:18,080
But I mean, yeah, Sam Kinnison made it look like it was a.

1747
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,320
He's having a party.

1748
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,480
It will be a huge mess.

1749
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,560
No, I'm just like, wow.

1750
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:26,320
So one of the only like opinions out there

1751
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:29,600
about this Koopa host is Marin getting very morose.

1752
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,520
Can I ask, how did you get there?

1753
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,880
Did you just Google his name and you found a mention of it?

1754
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:37,200
It was, part of that quote was said in one of these videos

1755
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:41,240
and then I Googled the name Chris Collins and WTF

1756
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,680
with Marc Marin.

1757
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,200
Check out the show if you haven't heard it.

1758
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,040
Good interviews.

1759
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:46,880
Lock the gate.

1760
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,280
Obama's on it.

1761
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,880
Politicians, he's got all the Oscar nominees,

1762
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,760
it seems like, recently.

1763
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:55,600
It's really impressive.

1764
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,840
Cool, so check it out.

1765
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:01,080
But anyway, like, and then on top of that,

1766
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:04,200
I mean, did you see the other thing that this guy,

1767
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:08,800
like, basically he, like, I don't know whether,

1768
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,040
I don't know what order to say this in.

1769
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,400
He was fired from this show.

1770
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,920
He was let go from King Koopa and they're thinking,

1771
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:20,560
well, we could just put another guy in this face paint

1772
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:23,200
and get away with it pretty easily.

1773
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:27,680
He was replaced with Patrick Penny,

1774
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:31,080
who is the voice of the pirate in SpongeBob.

1775
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:34,440
He's that, he's the beginning of every single episode

1776
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:35,880
with SpongeBob SquarePants.

1777
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:39,160
So this is a children's show legend.

1778
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:40,720
This is like one of the most iconic.

1779
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:41,760
Well, they both are.

1780
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,160
Yes, the other guy is too.

1781
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,960
SpongeBob is public.

1782
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,480
But some legends are complicated and cursed.

1783
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,160
I wanna know why he had two names.

1784
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:51,000
Like, why is he credit, was one a stage name

1785
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,240
and one a birth name?

1786
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,120
Was he hiding?

1787
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,720
Had he left?

1788
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,040
Did he pull all the same stuff

1789
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:00,880
while being a regional other kids show character?

1790
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,000
And then he like, he ran out of Boston, like,

1791
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,680
okay, no problem, gonna change my name.

1792
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,440
Gotta get my act together and should be good.

1793
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:11,280
Oh, this show, yes, I'd love to wear a mask

1794
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,120
and obscure my identity.

1795
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,320
So it's like the perfect job for me.

1796
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:18,040
Cobra. Of course I won't scream at the children.

1797
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,000
Cobra faked his death and gave him a new identity.

1798
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,280
That powerful.

1799
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,680
This guy died in like, what is it, 94 or something?

1800
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,200
Like he was 44 years old, very young.

1801
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,240
And it doesn't say, does it say why?

1802
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,080
I don't know.

1803
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:31,920
A brain thing.

1804
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:32,740
Okay.

1805
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:34,000
Maybe a whistle and freak thing.

1806
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,800
But he also, I think after this, shortly after this,

1807
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:42,680
he was fired from another prominent series

1808
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,160
involving animation.

1809
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,600
That series is called The Simpsons.

1810
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:50,960
This guy was the first voice of two of the more obscure

1811
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,840
characters, Mr. Burns and Moe.

1812
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,920
Ah, was this guy.

1813
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:00,100
I feel like maybe I kind of knew there was a Moe,

1814
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,680
but I did not know there was another Mr. Burns.

1815
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:05,280
Yeah, I feel like I've heard Aang talk about that.

1816
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,120
Tengu Zerea talk about, yeah, like first Moe

1817
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,880
or coming in later and like figuring it out.

1818
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:14,200
Well, what he says is they were perfectly happy

1819
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,400
with the performance of this guy,

1820
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,040
but the producers and Sam Simon in particular

1821
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,600
just hated working with this guy.

1822
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,360
He was just a huge pain in the ass.

1823
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,320
They didn't want to deal with him anymore.

1824
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,480
So they got rid of him and brought in Aang Zerea.

1825
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,040
And he says, so that should be a lesson

1826
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,280
to you kids out there.

1827
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:35,800
Be nice on your jobs and maybe things will end up okay.

1828
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:39,360
So fired from both King Koopa's Cool Cartoons

1829
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:42,520
and The Simpsons for being not nice.

1830
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,160
One seems to be a bigger loss than the other

1831
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,400
and I won't say which.

1832
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,640
I don't know what they were making

1833
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:49,960
on original King Koopa's Cool Cartoons.

1834
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:52,280
I would have to see some salary line items,

1835
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:55,520
but I would guess that they were paid in sandwiches.

1836
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:59,800
Maybe like the thing that would have set up his whole life

1837
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:01,960
that it was straight in front of him.

1838
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:02,800
Yeah, really.

1839
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:03,680
It's real.

1840
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:04,700
I mean, look, it's sad.

1841
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:07,780
Whatever is the situation, I'm sure always is sad.

1842
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:08,620
Yeah, yeah.

1843
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:10,540
But it's been a long time ago.

1844
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:14,540
So guys on a paywall podcast, they're going, Jesus Christ.

1845
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:17,180
His friends are like, don't worry about it.

1846
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:18,620
What do you think that show's gonna go for?

1847
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:19,460
Yeah.

1848
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:20,300
That was an episode.

1849
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:21,940
You told them to shove it good.

1850
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:22,780
It's not Gunsmoke.

1851
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:24,540
Things go over by the end of the month.

1852
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:26,060
There's no way that beats Gunsmoke.

1853
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,380
The King, Gunsmoke.

1854
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:28,220
Gunsmoke.

1855
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:29,180
Gunsmoke.

1856
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:32,260
Let's go watch some Gunsmoke and get liquor.

1857
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:33,380
Which season you want?

1858
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:34,700
There's 20 of them.

1859
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:36,940
Let's go to the UCLA.

1860
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:39,740
We don't have a DVD of it right now.

1861
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:41,460
But we gotta go to the archives.

1862
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:44,940
I had a weird Simpsons connection the other day,

1863
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:47,860
which we watched Elvis.

1864
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:51,180
And I think I knew this, but I didn't remember it.

1865
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:53,540
But there's like later in the movie,

1866
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:57,500
later in his career, there's numerous scenes with Tom Hanks

1867
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,820
as the scene chewing Colonel Tom Parker going,

1868
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:01,980
Dr. Nick, I'll get in there.

1869
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:03,740
You know, like help the man.

1870
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,620
Dr. Nick, someone get Dr. Nick.

1871
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:09,420
And I was like, oh my God, I forgot Dr. Nick.

1872
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:13,220
The name Dr. Nick is based on Elvis' quack doctor

1873
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:15,940
who was just pumping me full of anything and everything.

1874
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:17,500
That's what Dr. Nick is from?

1875
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,220
That's what I, I was like, wait,

1876
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:20,900
that can't be a coincidence.

1877
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:22,660
Oh, wait, so wait a minute.

1878
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:23,500
But do you know this?

1879
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:24,940
Are you just taking a leap?

1880
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:26,660
I'm pretty sure I heard this years ago.

1881
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:27,500
I'm pretty sure.

1882
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,300
Maybe I convinced myself I was wrong.

1883
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:31,660
So there's comments, sluts, get moving.

1884
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:35,100
There was a lot of, there was a lot of.

1885
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,500
This is a recipe for.

1886
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:39,740
The tabloidy kind of books about Colonel Tom Parker.

1887
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:42,980
And I'm sure Dr. Nick was a character.

1888
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:43,820
Oh, we're gonna have to find this out.

1889
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:45,060
You know, a recurring character.

1890
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:46,060
Well, it looks okay.

1891
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:48,780
This is on todayifoundout.com.

1892
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:51,900
So if we trust todayifoundout.com.

1893
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:55,380
Well, it's one of the most trusted websites I know of.

1894
01:09:55,380 --> 01:09:59,100
But there's other, do we maybe head to this

1895
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:02,060
fact that I, again, I don't believe it.

1896
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:04,820
Because why, how did the show end?

1897
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:07,620
It didn't end with, oh yeah, wait, you got something else?

1898
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,180
Well, I was just gonna say a couple of other,

1899
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:10,660
because again, there's not much footage of this.

1900
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:14,780
Like, sketch, a common, like, just to give you a sense

1901
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:15,780
of a little more of what the show is.

1902
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:17,100
I know it's not really that important,

1903
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:19,580
but like, he would be like, ah, this is,

1904
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:22,380
I'm setting the table for a party or whatever.

1905
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:24,460
Who's it gonna be here, boys and girls?

1906
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:28,420
And then like rats and like mice or lizards

1907
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:29,700
and bad guys.

1908
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:31,100
And he would all of a sudden, like,

1909
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:33,860
then he'd like get in a fight with Ratso.

1910
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:35,220
And then he'd like just go under the table

1911
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:37,340
and they'd throw confetti or like streamers up

1912
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:38,860
to make it look like he was fighting with them

1913
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:40,500
or he was getting like beaten up or what.

1914
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:43,500
Like, not the height of comedy.

1915
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,340
Uh-huh. Yeah.

1916
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:47,540
And not even, fine, I guess, for kids to see like,

1917
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:49,060
oh, they're fighting, I get it.

1918
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:50,300
And correct me if I'm wrong,

1919
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:52,660
but the representation of Mario and Luigi,

1920
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:54,980
by the way, on the show, where they were kind of painted

1921
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:56,940
on a wall in the background.

1922
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:58,060
Yeah, I don't think that.

1923
01:10:58,060 --> 01:10:59,220
Yeah, framed photos.

1924
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:01,100
Just so you can remember who he wants to kill.

1925
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:01,940
Right. Yeah.

1926
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:03,900
So yeah, it would be a lot of him like fighting

1927
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:06,820
with himself in some sort of scenario.

1928
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:08,380
And when I say a lot of it, I just mean there's two clips

1929
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:09,500
and that's the same kind of bit.

1930
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,180
And it's been both of them really.

1931
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:13,580
He's getting in like a struggle with like a weird,

1932
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:14,620
what was it, like a head?

1933
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:16,540
You've seen, there's two clips.

1934
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:18,660
It's hard to see exactly what's going on.

1935
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:21,100
Yeah, I found it hard to pay attention during the two clips.

1936
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:21,940
That's fair.

1937
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:23,180
I'm just trying to get like,

1938
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:25,540
I want our audience to get a sense

1939
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:27,060
of the comedy on the show.

1940
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:28,460
Oh yeah, yeah.

1941
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:30,940
Like, you know, like, ah, whoop, oh, I'm getting,

1942
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:33,100
oh, I'm getting beaten up under the table here.

1943
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:35,300
There's some confetti in the air, whatever.

1944
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:39,380
And then he would show like a royalty-free Popeye cartoon.

1945
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:42,900
Like, oh, play the cartoon.

1946
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:43,980
And then it would be like, you'd be like,

1947
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:45,580
this is an old cartoon.

1948
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:48,460
Like, because Bozo would do the same thing.

1949
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:51,300
They would show these old cartoons and you'd be like,

1950
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:53,660
I like Bozo, but what is this?

1951
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:55,860
Like, I can barely, like, audio is like fuzzy.

1952
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:59,380
The tape they're playing it from is like.

1953
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:01,180
It's just a bunch of people doing opium.

1954
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:02,020
What is this?

1955
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:02,860
Yeah.

1956
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:05,980
This is the saddest cartoon I've ever seen.

1957
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:08,940
You'd be lucky to get a Popeye cartoon often.

1958
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:11,340
You would just get like some knockoff Disney cartoon

1959
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:13,460
that you could barely hear the audio on.

1960
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:15,180
Oh, maybe in Oswald?

1961
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:16,020
Not even there?

1962
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:16,860
No, no, no, no.

1963
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:17,700
You don't think?

1964
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:18,980
That wasn't kind of in the ether?

1965
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:19,820
Like kind of in-

1966
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:21,100
I bet not, but I could be wrong.

1967
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:22,740
Why is it just people huffing ether?

1968
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:23,900
Yeah.

1969
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:25,260
No, no, like in the air.

1970
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:26,100
No, I know.

1971
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:26,940
Oh, okay.

1972
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:29,900
There was old depressing cartoons of ether.

1973
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:34,900
Like, Betty Boop and a grotesque character of Humvee Bogart.

1974
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:37,020
It would be like that for the first,

1975
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,980
in The Simpsons, like the first itchy cartoon

1976
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,820
where he's just walking and whistling or something.

1977
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:41,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think so.

1978
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:42,820
Yeah, yeah.

1979
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:43,940
Just like whatever they didn't have to pay

1980
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:45,700
and they could pad this thing out with

1981
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:46,540
is what would happen.

1982
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:49,020
So yeah, he would fight with himself under a table,

1983
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:50,860
throw it to a cartoon, come back.

1984
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:52,540
A cartoon that children have no desire to see.

1985
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:54,860
Take a call, ask for letters,

1986
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:57,500
which you would send it to Koopa's Keeper.

1987
01:12:58,460 --> 01:12:59,300
What?

1988
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:00,140
Koopa's Keeper.

1989
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:01,140
Is that the name of the mailbox?

1990
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:02,060
I guess.

1991
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:03,300
And it would be like P.O. Box

1992
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,220
and then the zip code is 90028,

1993
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:07,580
which is one off from my old zip code.

1994
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:11,420
So it's close to Los Feliz, or is Los Feliz,

1995
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:12,900
wherever that P.O. Box was.

1996
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,780
It's the lake.

1997
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:16,980
We're just, we're taking all your letters

1998
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:17,980
or dumping them in the lake.

1999
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:19,540
He's walking over a bridge.

2000
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:20,980
Do you think that's the,

2001
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,700
for a second I thought maybe it was the Atwater Bridge,

2002
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:24,780
but I believe this was shot on the Fox Lot,

2003
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:27,980
which is over in Century City, close to UCLA.

2004
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:29,540
Unless it was just a local,

2005
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:33,140
like it's the Fox 11 studios, you know?

2006
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:34,500
That could have been really.

2007
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:35,340
That's true.

2008
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:36,580
Not that I know where that is.

2009
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:37,580
Yeah, I don't know where that is either.

2010
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:39,780
So maybe, cause in my mind when I was watching,

2011
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:42,100
I thought it was like Prospect Studios,

2012
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:44,100
which is over in Los Feliz,

2013
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:46,380
which is close to Atwater with the bridge.

2014
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:47,220
Could have been.

2015
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:48,060
But I don't know.

2016
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:48,900
Again, we don't,

2017
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:51,100
we could add that rumor to the Zweg's Bookopedias

2018
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:52,500
and it'll just be fact for now.

2019
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,460
We're immediately one of the most factual sources

2020
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:55,300
about this show.

2021
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:56,140
Right.

2022
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:56,980
By talking about it at all.

2023
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:59,860
Prospect, whom of Grey's Anatomy, right?

2024
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:01,940
And some Marvel productions?

2025
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:05,060
All I know is General Hospital still is shot there.

2026
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:05,900
Okay.

2027
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:06,740
I don't know where Grey's Anatomy is.

2028
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:08,860
It's just kind of built into a neighborhood.

2029
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:09,700
It's kind of hidden.

2030
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:10,520
Yes, it's interesting.

2031
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:11,620
I never knew it was there for like years.

2032
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:12,540
I didn't realize it was there.

2033
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:14,020
And I know there were production offices

2034
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:15,020
for some Marvel stuff,

2035
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:17,620
but they don't like shoot things there.

2036
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,460
And I think that's gone.

2037
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:19,580
I think that's done now,

2038
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,300
but I could be wrong.

2039
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:23,900
So yeah, that's a sense of the show

2040
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:25,460
for as far as we know.

2041
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:26,300
Yeah.

2042
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:28,020
But yeah, he would say,

2043
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:30,500
the first Koopa would say offensive things got fired

2044
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:31,700
and then the second one.

2045
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:33,740
And lived on for a body year.

2046
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:37,780
The clips we don't see are probably him saying like,

2047
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:40,180
hey kids, let's do the, wait a minute, not him.

2048
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:42,140
The one in the front row, he's ugly, trade him out.

2049
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:42,980
Yeah.

2050
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:44,940
He could stay, but turn him around.

2051
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:47,020
He could just spin him.

2052
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:47,860
It's fine.

2053
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:48,700
I would.

2054
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:49,860
He doesn't get the look.

2055
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:51,700
He's too ugly to look.

2056
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:53,340
I would believe that some of the crowd work

2057
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:55,220
might be worth a watch.

2058
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:57,820
Yeah, that's why YouTube archivist,

2059
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:58,740
let's get this going.

2060
01:14:58,740 --> 01:14:59,580
Right.

2061
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:01,780
Let's see what this guy was up to every day.

2062
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:05,500
Especially this fucking maniac guy, the first one.

2063
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:09,220
Koopa's got a little bit of slime

2064
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:11,060
that's gonna come out of his throat.

2065
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:13,140
It's gonna have to go into my crown.

2066
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:13,980
Blah, blah.

2067
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:17,860
Were you kids warned about splash?

2068
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:20,100
You and the furrow, hang on.

2069
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:22,060
It's coming again, blah.

2070
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:24,380
Is Koopa dipping this episode?

2071
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:28,780
The stagehand is like, oh, does he die?

2072
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:30,500
Did he die his throat green?

2073
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:31,820
And they're like, no, he didn't.

2074
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:32,660
I don't know.

2075
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:34,900
I don't know what that is.

2076
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:36,380
He left his dip cup.

2077
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:39,260
Maybe he just had a slutter.

2078
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:41,860
That's my special mushroom sauce.

2079
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:45,340
Is that something that would be in this shit?

2080
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,500
Can't say shit in the show.

2081
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:48,580
Yeah, sure, I care.

2082
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:49,420
It's local.

2083
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:50,260
I'm a king.

2084
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:51,580
I say whatever the fuck I want.

2085
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:52,900
No, stop it, don't.

2086
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:53,740
I'll say.

2087
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:58,700
Young Mark Maron is just like watching haunted.

2088
01:15:58,700 --> 01:15:59,540
Haunted.

2089
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:03,260
18, thinks about quitting.

2090
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:05,100
Business forever.

2091
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:09,100
Yeah, so okay, yeah.

2092
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:13,060
I think as far as any useless facts,

2093
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:14,940
I think we have to get to this.

2094
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:18,420
Yeah, so it doesn't end with this weird drunk hosting

2095
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:19,820
piece of information.

2096
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:21,460
It keeps going with the second host,

2097
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:23,260
but they make it up to 65 episodes.

2098
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:26,900
It even is nominated for a Wins of Children's Emmy.

2099
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:29,980
The ratings were good in theory somehow.

2100
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:33,060
I mean, probably Mario Fever is gonna puff this up.

2101
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:34,460
Yeah, I probably would've watched it.

2102
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:35,980
I would've really enjoyed this show.

2103
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:37,460
Because I love Mario, yeah.

2104
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,340
And it would've haunted my brain as a like,

2105
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:40,940
did I see that kind of,

2106
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:42,700
I could see why it's in Justin's brain.

2107
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:45,140
But then it goes away.

2108
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:49,060
And according to sources,

2109
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:51,420
why it goes, do you have this more officially written down

2110
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:52,260
than I do?

2111
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:54,900
I have the actual, it's on, oh shit, of course,

2112
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,620
it's, the thing is gone here.

2113
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:57,460
But I had.

2114
01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:58,300
You had the warrant.

2115
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:00,140
I would've, we can just say it, we can just say it.

2116
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:02,300
I guess it's, I'm sure we can get it close

2117
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:04,820
to what the sentence that we both read is.

2118
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:05,660
Mm-hmm.

2119
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:09,820
It went away because someone wrote a letter

2120
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:12,020
to the president of Fox.

2121
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:13,940
To Barry Diller.

2122
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:17,300
The man who wrote the letter, his name, Jason,

2123
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,380
can you guess who it is?

2124
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:19,660
Oh, this I do know.

2125
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:20,500
Oh, you do know?

2126
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:21,340
I do know, yeah.

2127
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:22,420
Michael Eisner. Michael Eisner.

2128
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:24,180
The head of the Walt Disney Company, yeah.

2129
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:28,380
Michael Eisner ends up in our really unrelated episodes.

2130
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:31,260
Yes, something that finally doesn't have anything

2131
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:33,540
to do with Michael Eisner and he, look who shows up.

2132
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:35,660
He shows up and I was just like, oh.

2133
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:36,500
Hello.

2134
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:40,260
It feels really, you feel crazy, you feel like now,

2135
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:42,300
I do feel like maybe we live in a simulation.

2136
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:43,140
Mm-hmm.

2137
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:45,420
That officially now, I believe that, I think,

2138
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:48,100
is that human existence is like a simulation

2139
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:51,180
and that this was just put here to be a nice little bow

2140
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:52,820
at the end of this episode.

2141
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:54,100
Buzz a buzz, scuttle, scuttle.

2142
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:55,420
That's exactly right.

2143
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:56,980
The, I don't, yeah, why?

2144
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:57,820
How in the world?

2145
01:17:57,820 --> 01:18:00,340
This is not, if you were, if you've been paying attention

2146
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:02,860
in this episode, this is not a Disney product.

2147
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:05,860
No, it wasn't and like the company which is,

2148
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:07,740
is it DIC or Deke?

2149
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:09,740
Deke is what I always thought it was as a kid,

2150
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:10,580
which is a production company.

2151
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:11,420
What did they say at the end?

2152
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:12,240
Deke.

2153
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:13,080
Deke, okay, there you go.

2154
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:13,920
Mm-hmm.

2155
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:14,740
Okay, it's out of business now.

2156
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:15,580
Deke's going?

2157
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:17,940
Deke most prominently, they would work with Disney later,

2158
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:19,620
but not during this.

2159
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:22,060
I always knew they were at the end of Inspector Gadget.

2160
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:22,900
Yeah.

2161
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:23,740
It would say that.

2162
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:24,820
You go, oh, what is that?

2163
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:25,660
Uh-huh.

2164
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:29,020
And so I should find.

2165
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:30,820
What is, Eisner has nothing to do with,

2166
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:32,940
why is he poking his nose in this?

2167
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:35,700
Right, that's why it seems made up,

2168
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:37,620
because why would he care?

2169
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:39,820
I think Deke had some Disney connections.

2170
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:40,740
Yes, it did, that's what I just.

2171
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:41,580
Yeah.

2172
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:43,980
Yeah, but mostly more later, I think.

2173
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:45,940
Yeah, later for sure.

2174
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:48,900
But yeah, so according to this,

2175
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:52,700
and one of the writers says that Michael Eisner

2176
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:55,660
wrote a letter because, and let me,

2177
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:57,100
yeah, now I will get it completely right.

2178
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:59,300
It said the letter stated that the show

2179
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:04,260
undermine the morals of its live youthful audiences.

2180
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:05,100
Okay.

2181
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:05,940
What?

2182
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:09,100
It's just him giving a friendly tip to Barry Diller.

2183
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:11,740
This show, you're airing a show that's gross.

2184
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:14,380
So yeah, okay, so let's analyze the options here.

2185
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:17,340
This is a complete lie, which seems weird.

2186
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:19,300
Why would that be, like, it doesn't.

2187
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:22,180
Yeah, it's attributed to somebody who wrote on the show,

2188
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:23,180
Christopher Brau.

2189
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:24,020
Yes.

2190
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:25,860
So there is a name, but I, every,

2191
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:28,100
when I saw it in a Wikipedia, when I saw it in a video,

2192
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:30,260
I'm still like, you know, where did he say it?

2193
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:33,860
I need like a, I need an interview, I need a big blurb

2194
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:35,740
with a quote from this guy to believe this.

2195
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:39,260
Yeah, there were letters to the like LA Times going like,

2196
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:42,580
this is scary for a show, this man is creepy.

2197
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:45,420
Yes, and that pointed out that there was,

2198
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:48,940
it's like, yes, this man is upsetting and he is rude.

2199
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:53,860
And I frankly am disgusted by the segment, dirty underwear.

2200
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:55,580
Right, yes, I saw that, yeah.

2201
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:58,060
What could that have been?

2202
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:01,900
Well, that also opens up more questions of like,

2203
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:04,540
what were the, what is the other stuff on this show?

2204
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:07,340
Dirty underwear is a segment, this is a runner-up.

2205
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:08,180
Yeah.

2206
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:09,020
This is in almost every episode.

2207
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:12,660
I think it's like, all right, kids, you want today's prize,

2208
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:16,060
all right, your prize is that you get to clean Christopher,

2209
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:20,460
I mean, King Koopa's special underwear.

2210
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:25,380
Right, what did Michael Eisner see, if this is true?

2211
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:28,780
Is Michael Eisner watching this every day?

2212
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:30,940
I can't imagine.

2213
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:32,340
So he's a busy man.

2214
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:34,780
He's a very busy man at the band at this point.

2215
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:37,220
If I'm to believe his intros to all his TV shows,

2216
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:39,460
he's the chairman and CEO of the Walt Disney Company.

2217
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:43,140
Right, so it's like, he walks in on Breck one day

2218
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:45,740
watching King Koopa and he catches this guy

2219
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:49,220
saying something vile on live television.

2220
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:50,060
Yeah.

2221
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:51,620
And he goes, oh shit, who produces, who makes,

2222
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:53,380
oh, they're doing this on local Fox TV,

2223
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:55,780
okay, I gotta take care of this.

2224
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:58,340
All right, we gotta stay, kids, we're camping today,

2225
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:00,820
we gotta start a campfire, hey, what's this thing,

2226
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:02,060
a crucifix?

2227
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:05,700
Snap, it's Kindlewood to me now.

2228
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:10,020
Look at this guy burn in his fantastic bod.

2229
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:11,820
This is my friend, he made this piece of art

2230
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:15,060
called Piss Christ and we're showing it here today.

2231
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:18,660
Oh, wait, look at this, this is a whole pile of ratso shit.

2232
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:22,620
Oh, look at this manger set, oh no,

2233
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:25,540
what's gonna happen when these two things mesh up?

2234
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:27,580
Everyone make a, make,

2235
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:30,780
car-scope your parents out of shit and then step on them.

2236
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:33,580
Hey, kids at home, don't shit in the toilet,

2237
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:36,180
shit on the kitchen floor.

2238
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:38,460
You wanna power up like Mario?

2239
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:42,420
Go outside and get one of the needles you see on the street.

2240
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:45,700
Just plug it into yourself like a Nintendo controller

2241
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,620
and you'll get powers.

2242
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:51,340
So Michael Eisner comes home, Breck has got needles,

2243
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:54,580
he's shit on the kitchen floor, he's got the manger scene

2244
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:56,620
also, what are you doing here, what is this,

2245
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:59,380
what is this, King Koopa told me.

2246
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:01,060
Who did it, who told you what?

2247
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:03,860
The man, King Koopa on the television on Fox.

2248
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:05,740
Fox, I know Barry Diller, I'm gonna take care of this

2249
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:08,300
right now and he gets out his stationery

2250
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:11,100
and his quill pen, I'm assuming, or typewriter

2251
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:11,940
and he's typing a letter.

2252
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:13,180
It was a Mickey Mouse pen.

2253
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:14,140
Mickey Mouse pen, right.

2254
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:16,660
Yeah, which it's weird, I feel like back then

2255
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:20,340
you still heard of the affiliates and the corporate

2256
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:22,580
company, but separately.

2257
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:23,700
Everything about the affiliates.

2258
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:26,700
Jay Leno knows, of course, I'm sure Barry Diller knows too.

2259
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:29,740
I mean, I guess it's the flagship that they're based in LA,

2260
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:31,260
that's kind of the flagship.

2261
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:33,340
This doesn't make sense, how is this going all the way

2262
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:36,580
to the top, Eisner and Diller, they're both busy.

2263
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:39,820
He's in charge, this is what's not right about this,

2264
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:44,460
he's in charge of Fox, Fox, he's worried about

2265
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:47,460
how fly the Fly Girls are on a different color.

2266
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:50,820
Yes, that's nationwide, that's a nationwide concern.

2267
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:53,540
The girls aren't fly enough, people aren't gonna watch.

2268
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:58,540
He's worried about balancing the comedy and the drama

2269
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:00,340
on 21 Jump Street.

2270
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:07,340
Yes, but then there's also, this is so unbelievable,

2271
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:09,820
I feel like there has to be some truth to it.

2272
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:11,660
Why would he make this up?

2273
01:23:11,660 --> 01:23:13,780
Yeah, where does it come from, if not.

2274
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:17,060
Right, there has to be, at least somebody's told him this.

2275
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:21,740
But man, Michael Eisner, he probably didn't write about this

2276
01:23:21,740 --> 01:23:24,380
in his book, I assume, but.

2277
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:26,940
Oh, he's written a few books at this point.

2278
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:29,580
I haven't gotten any of his personal ones.

2279
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:32,580
Or any of them called My Grapples with Koopa.

2280
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:36,940
Fire bombing my empire.

2281
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:39,740
When I figuratively stepped on the drawbridge

2282
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:42,340
in front of King Koopa, like in the level of Mario,

2283
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:44,620
the first Super Mario Brothers, and I jumped over his head

2284
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:48,420
and jumped on that key thing in the drawbridge,

2285
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:49,780
retracted under him.

2286
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:53,140
I felt like a Super Mario that day.

2287
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:57,020
Very weird moment reading about the Deek Company.

2288
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:59,580
The picture of their headquarters is a place

2289
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:00,980
I drive by all the time.

2290
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:02,660
It's like by Bob's Big Boy.

2291
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:03,500
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

2292
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:04,340
The big boy.

2293
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:05,180
I remember that.

2294
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:06,900
I feel like it was there when we moved,

2295
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:08,940
when we all were first in LA.

2296
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:09,780
You think so?

2297
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:10,620
Yeah, it was Deek recently.

2298
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:11,460
It was Deek recently.

2299
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:12,300
Not that long ago.

2300
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:13,140
Yeah.

2301
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:15,940
I remember seeing it and going, oh shit.

2302
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:16,780
Wow.

2303
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:17,620
There it is.

2304
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:18,940
We're in the land of Deek?

2305
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:21,540
That was the dream factory.

2306
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:24,940
Warner Brothers lot is like mere steps away.

2307
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:26,700
And I was like, yeah, but Inspector Gadget

2308
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:28,140
had this logo at the end of it.

2309
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:30,740
Wow, there might be an old fax related

2310
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:32,660
to Inspector Gadget in that building

2311
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:34,820
if they haven't cleaned lately.

2312
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:37,300
Any number of checks they did not mail

2313
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:38,980
to the people who worked on it.

2314
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:39,820
Any number of checks.

2315
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:41,460
Residuals owed to Don Adams.

2316
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:42,300
Don Adams.

2317
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:43,300
Wow.

2318
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:46,380
You know what we didn't say is who made,

2319
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:48,060
who wrote the theme song?

2320
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:49,020
What?

2321
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:50,140
Haim Saban.

2322
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:50,980
What?

2323
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:51,820
Yeah.

2324
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:52,660
Wow.

2325
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:53,500
Yeah.

2326
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:54,340
Geez.

2327
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:56,260
Yeah, Mr. Children's Television.

2328
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:57,820
Wasn't I just saying in an episode,

2329
01:24:57,820 --> 01:25:00,020
I feel like I found the fact in real time

2330
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:02,900
that he claims that he wrote 500 songs or something.

2331
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:03,740
Yes, you did.

2332
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:04,580
We just brought this up,

2333
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:05,780
which is why I almost was thinking,

2334
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:06,980
did we just say this?

2335
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:07,820
But I-

2336
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:08,660
Not about this.

2337
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:09,500
Haim Saban wrote this.

2338
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:11,340
And this is, yeah, before I guess he figured out

2339
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:14,500
the scam of repurposing old footage

2340
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:17,260
and then underpaying actors and making a huge empire.

2341
01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:20,100
Yeah, speaking of repurposing stuff,

2342
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:22,620
so as I was looking at stuff

2343
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:25,100
and thinking of other cartoons from when I was a kid,

2344
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:27,820
I feel like there's a lot of these lost cartoons.

2345
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:31,500
Mike, you said you had seen Captain M, the Game Master,

2346
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,980
and then here's James Bond Jr.

2347
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:35,700
Very similar. Of course, yeah.

2348
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:39,540
Tall brunette guy with a jacket, with a jacket.

2349
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:42,020
And then here's a character named Ziv Zoolander

2350
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:43,260
from The Bots Master.

2351
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:44,500
Really similar.

2352
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:45,340
The Bots Master.

2353
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:46,860
Yeah, The Bots Master.

2354
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:49,380
Probably the lost cartoon that I'm like,

2355
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:51,540
I wonder how many people remember The Bots Master.

2356
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:54,700
And did I only ever find Bots Master toys

2357
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:56,660
at the KB outlets?

2358
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:57,500
No.

2359
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:58,340
KB Toys outlets.

2360
01:25:58,340 --> 01:25:59,420
I've been to a KB outlet.

2361
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:00,260
Yeah.

2362
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:01,900
I found discounted Bucky O'Hare comics

2363
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:02,740
at a KB outlet once.

2364
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:03,580
Oh yeah.

2365
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:04,420
Yeah.

2366
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:07,700
That's like a blast.

2367
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:08,700
Yeah.

2368
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:09,540
Yeah.

2369
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:11,140
Honestly, very exciting.

2370
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:14,500
These are some of the fondest memories of my childhood.

2371
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:18,740
So now, I mean, obviously the many Ninja Turtle,

2372
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:21,460
you know, Street Sharks, Cowboys of the Moon Mesa,

2373
01:26:21,460 --> 01:26:25,260
all the like attempts to generate Ninja Turtles again.

2374
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:26,860
I never watched James Bond Jr.,

2375
01:26:26,860 --> 01:26:29,060
but I very much remember the commercial for it.

2376
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:32,460
And he'd be like, I'm James Bond, James Bond Jr.

2377
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:34,900
Like that for whatever reason,

2378
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:36,940
maybe that line reading isn't completely correct,

2379
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:38,820
but I always remember being like, this is weird.

2380
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:41,220
I remember just feeling like this was a weird thing.

2381
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:44,180
I don't know if I don't need to put this on your reading

2382
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:46,860
and maybe it'd be different if I saw the real show,

2383
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:50,700
but what it sounds like is really crappy.

2384
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:52,500
Well, James Bond fights Spectre,

2385
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:55,060
James Bond Jr. fights Scum.

2386
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:58,780
I remember it, because the theme song ends with the phrase,

2387
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:01,980
James Bond Jr. chases Scum around the world.

2388
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:04,940
There was an NES game where I could,

2389
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:06,380
the first level was really fun

2390
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:09,620
and then you had to beat a puzzle to move on to the next level

2391
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:11,020
and I never beat the puzzle.

2392
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:13,580
So I only ran at the game once,

2393
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:15,300
so I would just turn the system off

2394
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:19,180
and just replay the first level over and over.

2395
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:22,020
Why did James Bond Jr. never appear in the movies?

2396
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:23,420
That's a great question.

2397
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:25,340
You got something big in the universe.

2398
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:26,860
Yeah, and they never explored it.

2399
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:29,140
Why did his uncle, James Bond, by the way,

2400
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:31,340
James Bond Jr., but I believe it was his uncle,

2401
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:33,020
not his father.

2402
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:33,860
Is that right?

2403
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:35,660
I think that was the gimmick, but I'd love to see-

2404
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:38,540
Young Indiana Jones, his uncle?

2405
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:39,380
Or was it Indiana Jones?

2406
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:42,140
No, Young Indiana Jones is Young Indiana Jones.

2407
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:42,980
Yeah.

2408
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:44,820
Stop rewind.

2409
01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:45,660
Oh, yeah.

2410
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:46,500
Okay.

2411
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:47,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2412
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:50,780
It's the continuity as the circus train chase

2413
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:51,940
in Last Crusade, yeah.

2414
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:53,260
Okay, that's a good point.

2415
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:57,140
He's his friend IQ, the grandson of Q.

2416
01:27:57,140 --> 01:27:58,780
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

2417
01:27:58,780 --> 01:28:01,140
It was just James Bond babies, really.

2418
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:02,540
It is, yeah.

2419
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:04,060
It was on perform up at babies.

2420
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:05,220
I think I'd switch channels.

2421
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:06,900
I'd sliver them up at babies.

2422
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:09,860
Did James Bond Jr. get laid as much as James Bond?

2423
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:11,540
I don't know.

2424
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:14,700
I mean, James Bond sometimes wears a windbreaker,

2425
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:17,020
when he's casual.

2426
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:17,940
And which one?

2427
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:21,460
Craig, Daniel Craig, kind of has a tan jacket on sometimes.

2428
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:22,900
But is that a windbreaker?

2429
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:23,740
Would you call that a windbreaker?

2430
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:24,580
It's sort of like a windbreaker,

2431
01:28:24,580 --> 01:28:27,100
like a members only sort of jacket.

2432
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:28,260
Oh, I'm trying to remember that.

2433
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:30,020
Well, we'll look into that for later.

2434
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:35,020
Hey, how would you like to do some over the clothes stuff?

2435
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:36,300
Is that what James Bond Jr. says?

2436
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:37,140
Yeah, yeah.

2437
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:37,980
Okay.

2438
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:41,020
I have to drive my nephew to the winter formal.

2439
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:43,180
I swear he has a funny voice though.

2440
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:44,740
Like, hello, I'm James Bond.

2441
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:46,700
His voice is Cory Burton,

2442
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:50,020
the voice of the Disneyland parking tram.

2443
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:50,860
Yeah.

2444
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:53,940
And the fake ghost host in the Christmas version.

2445
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:57,540
In my memory, James Bond Jr.'s voice is Paddington.

2446
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:59,780
I'm James Bond, James Bond Jr.

2447
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:04,540
If everyone is nice and polite, the world would be right.

2448
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:05,700
I'm James Bond Jr.

2449
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:08,340
So you're quite a babe.

2450
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:11,620
Would you like to go behind closed doors

2451
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:16,020
and would you describe what your bra looks like to be?

2452
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:18,420
You've got a hot bod, I'd like to say.

2453
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:20,700
Your bod is quite hot.

2454
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:22,780
You've got a dynamite bod.

2455
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:23,620
A dynamite bod.

2456
01:29:23,620 --> 01:29:26,820
I'm gonna send you guys the theme song to Bots Master

2457
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:27,940
and you're gonna hate it.

2458
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:28,780
I actually don't know about Bots Master.

2459
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:29,620
But you will notice

2460
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:33,500
the very first credit executive producer, Avi Arad.

2461
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:34,340
Oh yeah.

2462
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:39,020
The man who forever will get the executive producer credit

2463
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:40,580
on any Spider-Man movie.

2464
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:41,700
Oh, okay.

2465
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:45,540
Avi and Ike Perlmutter rescued Marvel from bankruptcy.

2466
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:46,380
Toy Biz.

2467
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:48,020
Because they own Toy Biz, the toy company.

2468
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:49,620
So they got linked to,

2469
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:51,660
they're stuck in the Marvel machine

2470
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:52,860
for the rest of their lives.

2471
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:55,220
But Perlmutter did fail in his attempts

2472
01:29:55,220 --> 01:29:57,660
to put that weird guy on the board.

2473
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:59,660
Yes, because Perlmutter hates Iger

2474
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:01,380
because Iger pushed Perlmutter out

2475
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:03,460
because Perlmutter wanted Feige fired

2476
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:06,620
because Feige pushed Ike out of the decision-making process

2477
01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:07,940
of the movies.

2478
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:10,420
None of this ugliness when Eisner was around.

2479
01:30:10,420 --> 01:30:12,220
I know, that man could get things done.

2480
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:13,740
He just writes a goddamn letter.

2481
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:16,180
And suddenly a show that he doesn't even have anything

2482
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:17,780
to do with is off the air.

2483
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:19,340
He could cancel any show he wanted.

2484
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:21,060
That's how much power he had.

2485
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:23,860
With but the type of-

2486
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:25,140
Sir, you don't own that.

2487
01:30:25,140 --> 01:30:26,100
Doesn't matter, do it.

2488
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:27,900
With the touch of my quill,

2489
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:29,500
with the typing of a typewriter,

2490
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,740
I can cancel any show on the air.

2491
01:30:31,780 --> 01:30:33,540
He could make a phone call.

2492
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:36,220
There could have been a live State of the Union

2493
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:37,700
from President Bush.

2494
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:40,020
And then suddenly he gets a tap on the shoulder

2495
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:41,100
and a phone call and like,

2496
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:43,180
Oh, mm-hmm, oh, Eisner, yes, okay.

2497
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:44,580
All right, bye.

2498
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:45,940
Speech over, done.

2499
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:50,540
Whatever hockey game he wants is on now instead.

2500
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:54,860
You're not in charge anymore, I'm in charge.

2501
01:30:56,140 --> 01:30:58,860
He could cancel a hockey game mid-game.

2502
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:01,220
If the letter could get fast enough to the game.

2503
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:03,420
Fight team wins, this is over.

2504
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:04,260
They just shut the lights off.

2505
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:05,500
Let's freeze the score in place.

2506
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:06,820
Shut the lights off.

2507
01:31:06,820 --> 01:31:08,140
Game's over, send out Iceman.

2508
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:09,140
Ducks win.

2509
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:10,420
Ducks win, what?

2510
01:31:12,020 --> 01:31:14,100
Shut it down, it's done.

2511
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:15,100
Well, what a time.

2512
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:16,060
Now, wait a minute, you had,

2513
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:17,020
you've been teasing something.

2514
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:18,780
Yeah, I've got a little coda here.

2515
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:19,860
Yeah.

2516
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:20,860
I've got a little coda, I don't know.

2517
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:23,380
Maybe it won't be so spectacular, but.

2518
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:26,380
So just cause we were talking about local Fox

2519
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:28,980
and local LA TV, I was like,

2520
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:32,020
King Koopa is a local kids show host,

2521
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:34,580
a local specific kids show host.

2522
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:38,620
And there's a grand tradition of people

2523
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:39,460
who would host shows.

2524
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:40,860
Forget that I'm looking through this.

2525
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:42,540
And these are just some of the greatest names.

2526
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:44,020
And I don't know much about them,

2527
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:48,140
but just going through lists of like local LA people,

2528
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:50,860
there is Beachcomber Bill.

2529
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:53,260
That was one of, like, these were all very similar shows,

2530
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:54,780
I think, to what King Koopa would do

2531
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:56,340
and what Bozo would do.

2532
01:31:56,380 --> 01:32:00,220
Engineer Bill was like a kindly, kind of like old man

2533
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:02,060
who would host a show.

2534
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:03,740
There was Sheriff John.

2535
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:06,500
There was Mr. Wishbone who had a puppet.

2536
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:10,060
There was the Pancake Man, which is a pancake man,

2537
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:12,940
which is described as a rotund short order chef

2538
01:32:12,940 --> 01:32:16,900
who plugged IHOP because IHOP sponsored the show.

2539
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:21,860
And then this, the guy who played the pancake man

2540
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:24,740
would play Otis the town drunk on Andy Griffith,

2541
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:26,140
go on to play this character.

2542
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:27,820
So the pancake man is ancient.

2543
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:28,660
This is on TV.

2544
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:29,500
Yeah, these are old.

2545
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,060
All of this stuff is ancient,

2546
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:34,980
which makes it so much better for me.

2547
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:37,620
There was a show called Mr. Do Good's Castle.

2548
01:32:39,740 --> 01:32:41,660
He's just a mister, but he has a castle?

2549
01:32:41,660 --> 01:32:42,500
Yeah, I guess so.

2550
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:44,020
That's not royalty.

2551
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:47,260
Commander Riptide and the Great Zolar.

2552
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:49,940
Beachcomber Bill, here's one of my favorite ones,

2553
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:52,100
the Rainbow Patch and the Kid-A-Littles.

2554
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:56,660
And these were all very LA specific shows.

2555
01:32:56,660 --> 01:32:57,500
And you can't find-

2556
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:58,660
This is all Los Angeles.

2557
01:32:58,660 --> 01:33:00,740
Yeah, and unless I'm, who knows,

2558
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:02,820
a couple of other ones could have slipped in here,

2559
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:05,740
but I think Chuck Jones, the Magic Man,

2560
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:09,820
these were all like, and they're not very well documented.

2561
01:33:10,940 --> 01:33:14,940
But of course, a guy we've talked about on the show

2562
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:18,540
also falls into the category of LA kids show hosts.

2563
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:19,380
Oh, I know where you're going.

2564
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:20,220
Oh, yes.

2565
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:21,860
And of course I'm talking about Chuck-O-The-Clown.

2566
01:33:22,820 --> 01:33:24,900
Yeah, that's what he is.

2567
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:25,740
That's what he's from.

2568
01:33:25,740 --> 01:33:28,460
He's an LA specific, he was a regional host,

2569
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:30,780
and I have to apologize to the audience

2570
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:32,940
because I think last time we talked about Chuck-O,

2571
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:35,580
I said Chuck-O was Randy Runyon.

2572
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:37,500
That was the real name of Chuck-O.

2573
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:39,340
And I'm only half right.

2574
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:42,840
Because Chuck-O was played by two people,

2575
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:45,380
Charles Runyon, the original Chuck-O,

2576
01:33:45,380 --> 01:33:46,220
and then his son-

2577
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:47,700
And Ken Gardner, my father?

2578
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:49,820
Oh, God.

2579
01:33:49,820 --> 01:33:50,900
And then his son.

2580
01:33:52,540 --> 01:33:57,140
His son, Randy Runyon, who originally was Jeepers the Clown.

2581
01:33:57,140 --> 01:33:59,060
And then when his father passed away,

2582
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:01,140
he took the mantle of Chuck-O.

2583
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:04,620
Randy, I think it was a very, did not have an easy life.

2584
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:06,040
And if you read his obituary,

2585
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:08,900
he was homeless periodically and alcoholic,

2586
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:12,020
but he was Chuck-O officially.

2587
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:12,860
You can't take that away from him.

2588
01:34:12,860 --> 01:34:15,180
So you cannot take that away from him.

2589
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:16,540
But with the funny thing, and again,

2590
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:20,320
I don't know how, hopefully this photo exists.

2591
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:22,960
So I'm talking to Justin just before this.

2592
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:25,560
And I'm talking about the Koopa thing.

2593
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:26,760
And he's just giving me kind of like,

2594
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:28,680
he says I don't remember too much about it.

2595
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:29,680
And I go, you know,

2596
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:31,240
I'm looking through all these old hosts.

2597
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:33,880
I go, cause his parents were,

2598
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:36,640
his parents lived here in the old days,

2599
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:37,920
and especially his mom did.

2600
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,520
And I go, do you have like,

2601
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,600
your parents remember anything about

2602
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:45,040
Randy or Charles Runyon from Chuck-O the Clown?

2603
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:46,560
And he goes, you know, my mom, Mike,

2604
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:47,760
cause his mom, like, he's like,

2605
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:51,200
my mom used to go up and watch the Batman show

2606
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:54,440
be taped up like when they would be by the Batcave.

2607
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:55,920
Cause she was just out here.

2608
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,800
I think she worked at Capitol Records.

2609
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:00,240
So he goes, so I pull up here in front of the house

2610
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:02,080
and he goes, yeah, yeah, so I'll ask her.

2611
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:02,920
He goes, oh, he goes,

2612
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:04,000
oh, my mom is calling right now.

2613
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,160
He goes, hold on one second.

2614
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:07,520
He puts me on three with his mother,

2615
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,760
who I've never met.

2616
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:09,600
Whoa.

2617
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:11,880
He goes, hey, mom, here, I'm on with Mike.

2618
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:13,920
He goes, he wants to know,

2619
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:16,800
do you know anything about Chuck-O the Clown?

2620
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:17,960
And she goes, what?

2621
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:19,520
She's like a little confused cause

2622
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:21,560
she's getting hit with whatever.

2623
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:23,440
Who knows what she's calling about.

2624
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:24,400
And she goes, Chuck-O the Clown.

2625
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:27,560
She goes, I was on the show, Chuck-O the Clown.

2626
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:28,400
What?

2627
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:31,880
She goes, I won a prize from Chuck-O the Clown.

2628
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:32,840
Whoa, what?

2629
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:33,680
She goes, yeah.

2630
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:36,400
She goes, the reason I know is cause I have a photo of it.

2631
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:37,480
Ah.

2632
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:38,920
She goes, yeah, Chuck-O was out.

2633
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:40,480
Yeah, we all watch Chuck-O.

2634
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:42,600
And I was like, oh my God.

2635
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:43,840
And she's okay?

2636
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:47,280
She's, you know, ongoing,

2637
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:50,600
Spectres in the Mirror when she.

2638
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:52,880
I'm like, whoa, really?

2639
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:55,440
So I got so excited right before I came in here

2640
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:58,040
cause she was like, oh yeah, Chuck-O, I remember Chuck-O.

2641
01:35:58,040 --> 01:35:59,880
Yeah, he was around.

2642
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:03,480
And she goes, no, the other characters like Hobo Kelly.

2643
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:06,400
And I go, yeah, Hobo Kelly, I read about her.

2644
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,680
She was like, yeah, she was big.

2645
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:10,040
And I go, yeah, Hobo Kelly.

2646
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:11,280
She was big.

2647
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:13,640
So I just want.

2648
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:14,880
Hobo Kelly was huge.

2649
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:18,800
So I just want to think of King Koopa being in this,

2650
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:23,320
this lineup of LA specific people that I am fascinated with.

2651
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:27,320
And yes, our beloved Chuck-O, both versions fall into this.

2652
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:28,960
Yes, our beloved Chuck-O.

2653
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:30,240
Our beloved Chuck-O,

2654
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:33,040
one of the favorite podcast ride references.

2655
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:37,320
Now, Mike, I don't know if you've given this any thought,

2656
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:40,360
but have you thought about, you know, maybe a story,

2657
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:42,120
maybe you probably can't get the rights

2658
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:43,840
to all these beloved characters.

2659
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,800
Maybe a story where a bunch of LA children's hosts team up

2660
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,280
to solve the murder of one of their own.

2661
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:52,480
Well, you know what's funny is there are a lot of photos

2662
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:56,120
of all the old hosts, including Chuck-O together.

2663
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:58,640
Like an LA kids host Avengers.

2664
01:36:58,640 --> 01:36:59,760
It's a scene.

2665
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,920
Yeah, so I did have the thought

2666
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:03,840
of the LA kids host Avengers.

2667
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:06,040
Drinking from a trough of whiskey.

2668
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:09,880
Well, whiskey, they went to a literal.

2669
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:13,200
It's quantity, not quality.

2670
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:15,200
Yes, I also, yes.

2671
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:18,360
So I did actually have a thought like that.

2672
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:21,920
I also found some guy calling himself Chuck-O,

2673
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,760
who in 2018 got into some sort of clown award,

2674
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:27,000
like some sort of clown hall of fame,

2675
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,920
but he's not related to the Runyans.

2676
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:30,720
I was quite upset with it.

2677
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:31,880
But.

2678
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:34,240
He wants, he's trying to be Chuck-O?

2679
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:36,160
He's calling, yeah, he's calling himself Chuck-O.

2680
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:38,200
I resist as much as I can.

2681
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:41,200
And I feel like maybe whoever owns the Chuck-O copyright

2682
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:43,600
isn't being so litigious right now.

2683
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:47,600
So maybe if we want to call ourselves Chuck-O.

2684
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,120
I'm getting worried that they'll,

2685
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:50,960
they're gonna get tipped off to it

2686
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:53,760
and that the litigiousness will start again.

2687
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,200
And I think just to play it safe,

2688
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,600
we shouldn't talk about Chuck-O ever again on the show.

2689
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:00,120
You're concerned you're gonna be washing dishes one day

2690
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:02,560
and just gonna hear quietly and slowly

2691
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:06,560
all around the mulberry bush, the monkey chase.

2692
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:08,560
Or that America song that I found,

2693
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:10,640
which you played like two years ago.

2694
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:11,480
Remember that?

2695
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:12,320
Yeah, right, yes.

2696
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:14,160
Chuck-O's like Chuck-O's USA song.

2697
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:18,640
Hello, Scott.

2698
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:21,920
I use Justin Donaldson's mom as a host.

2699
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:25,760
All I needed was somebody who knew somebody who knows you.

2700
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:29,240
Yeah, no, he pops up when we least suspect it.

2701
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:30,360
And.

2702
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:32,220
And he's looking for a host.

2703
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:34,280
A different kind of host.

2704
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:35,240
You know what I also read,

2705
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:37,120
and I know we've been recording for three hours

2706
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:40,560
at this point, but Randy Runyon also was very upset

2707
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:44,800
with the movie It because he said that It set back

2708
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:47,600
children's birthday clowns many years.

2709
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:50,840
It ruined the children's birthday clown industry.

2710
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:52,680
And he was upset when the first It came out.

2711
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:55,000
So this is like sideways in Merlot.

2712
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:58,600
The film has a huge impact on an industry.

2713
01:38:58,600 --> 01:38:59,800
Yes.

2714
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:00,640
So.

2715
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:05,480
It was a booming business before It,

2716
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:08,800
and then kids no longer wanted a birthday clown.

2717
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:09,640
Geez.

2718
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:10,600
I went the other way.

2719
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:13,280
I was, ever since Chuck-O came up on the show,

2720
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,440
I've been guzzling Merlot.

2721
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:16,440
Try to forget.

2722
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:20,120
Yeah, I get it, but he's not here, don't worry.

2723
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:22,800
It's just a funny little anecdote.

2724
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:25,720
Okay, well, I'm on lookout anyway,

2725
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:28,040
but I guess I should say while it's true,

2726
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:30,040
you survived podcasts, the ride.

2727
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:32,400
I survived, I guess the ride, the second gate,

2728
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:34,200
which we thank you for subscribing to.

2729
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:37,400
If you wanna dig even deeper, join us on Club Three,

2730
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:39,280

2732
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:44,400
And just full disclosure, those episodes,

2733
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:48,160
just like these, are not live in front of an audience

2734
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:50,560
of disorganized children.

2735
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:55,560
Typically, we are not many shots deep as we record,

2736
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:59,640
not anxious to get into fist fights

2737
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:03,160
and spend with painted green fists.

2738
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:05,200
But if any of that doesn't deter you,

2739
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:07,040
then I would still say subscribe to Club Three.

2740
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,440
I would agree with that, yeah.

2741
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:09,280
So.

2742
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:11,360
Get outta here.

2743
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:12,520
I know where you live.

2744
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:17,640
I know your email address if you sign up for this.

2745
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,680
Patreon truth.
