1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,200
Warning, the following podcast contains the names of many old timey people.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,160
Retcons galore, a new ceramic based persona for Jason Sheridan, and an amazingly dense,

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,840
hard to follow interconnected narrative that is sure to confuse dads across the world.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,480
We're talking Sea, the society of explorers and adventurers on today's podcast, The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:51,360
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a podcast whose hosts belong to a secret society called Sun,

8
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,440
the society of obedience and niceness.

9
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,080
My name is Mike Carlson.

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,560
Joining me as always, another member of Sun, Jason Sheridan.

11
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,480
Exploration continuum, Michael.

12
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,520
But we don't need to explore, we're already obedient and nice.

13
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,280
We take that wherever we explore to.

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,280
That's true.

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,320
Also, Sun member Scott Gairdner is here.

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,100
Yeah, I'm a forced member, a member from birth.

17
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,100
You don't like this?

18
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,960
Whether I like it or not.

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:29,640
As an obedient, nice person, I can't call into question whether I like it or not.

20
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,640
I have to.

21
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Yeah, that's a good point.

22
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,720
When we were all born, we got into this last week.

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,680
I think when we were born, this was our, yeah, as you're saying, our birthright was to become

24
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,880
members of this group.

25
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:47,600
Our mothers made it so that we had to be members of Sun, the society of obedience and niceness.

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,720
It's a society with all male members, but you're only initiated by your mother.

27
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,100
But I'm sure there's some listeners out there who are members of Sun, or if not, they like

28
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,080
to make fun of members of Sun.

29
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,560
I think a lot of members of Sun are out there.

30
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,200
I think we're a big group.

31
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,200
It's a big secret.

32
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,000
Maybe, you know what, maybe it's not so secret.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,240
Yeah, it's like the Freemasons at this point.

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,400
Everyone knows about it.

35
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
Right.

36
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Freemason.

37
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,200
Wow, they're actually maybe connected?

38
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,440
Because we're going to find so many connections today.

39
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,040
We're already doing it, which is very exciting.

40
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,600
It really is all about connections, isn't it?

41
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,320
This entire thing is about how do we connect as many disparate things as possible, and

42
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,920
maybe it'll add up into something like a television series.

43
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,400
Finally, maybe have the lightning rod that pulls it all together.

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,400
I have a table.

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
I have a chart.

46
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,000
I made a chart to try and keep track of all this.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,520
By no means definitive, but the notes were just getting out of hand.

48
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,440
I was like, maybe if I use columns and rows, this will be a little cleaner.

49
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,040
I have two notes on my computer, pages full of stuff.

50
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,520
I was going to organize it, and then I went, I can't even.

51
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,880
I just started throwing stuff up.

52
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,840
I'm like, if I get to this, I get to this.

53
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,280
If I get to the connection to the Bengal barbecue, we get to it.

54
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,800
If we don't, don't worry about it.

55
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:27,760
I have much less than usual because I was sure that you two would have charts and overflowing

56
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,760
documents.

57
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,040
This worked out great.

58
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,120
Before I say any more, just in case everybody didn't read the description or doesn't know

59
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,360
what this is, we're talking about something called C today, the Society of Explorers.

60
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:45,200
And adventurers, which is something that started in 2001, which is a narrative and characters

61
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,000
that tie the Disney parks together, whether it be through restaurants, whether it be through

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,320
water parks, rides.

63
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,920
It's mainly restaurants.

64
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,920
That's what I've found.

65
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,920
The restaurants are the keystone.

66
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,240
When you have to explain what is this thing and who are these characters, or they kind

67
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,680
of tie together a lot of rides.

68
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,640
Actually, wait, if you do the stockpile, though, it's mainly like, here's a picture frame at

69
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
a restaurant.

70
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
There's a lot.

71
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:13,680
Yeah, it's like, yes, it's basically like if you were watching like a Marvel movie and

72
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,720
you just a lot of the secrets in it where, well, there was a picture on the wall.

73
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,400
If you look at when Tony Stark was eating at like Burger King, that's the secret connection.

74
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,800
So it's yes, as you're saying, it's primarily maybe not primarily, but there's a lot of

75
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:36,800
connections to see at places you eat a quick service or medium service meal.

76
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:43,440
We're tying together the Disney quick service restaurants with old stodgy people from the

77
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,960
late 1800s.

78
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
That I guess is what.

79
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,640
And when you put it like that, it's funnier.

80
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,640
And I maybe even like it more.

81
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:57,120
Because what's so much what's what's more fun than just tying a bunch of just cafeterias

82
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,480
together with a narrative like that's fantastic.

83
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,800
Yeah, restaurants that you say like, yeah, it's pretty good.

84
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,800
I don't know that any of these places have I heard like, oh, you have to eat there because

85
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,480
of the quality of the food.

86
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,240
It's like, oh, it's pretty good.

87
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,280
It's good in a pinch.

88
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Sure. Well, now that you're saying that, I'm thinking like, wouldn't that be great if any

89
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,120
of these restaurant groups that own multiple restaurants, wouldn't it be fantastic if they

90
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,080
would tie like anyone who Landry's owns?

91
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,920
Wouldn't that be fantastic if there was a Landry's universe that could tie with characters

92
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,880
from the 1800s or anything like KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut?

93
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,080
Who do you have with Landry's Bubba Gump's in there, right, which is similar to in C,

94
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,880
it's a bunch of characters and mainly their original.

95
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,120
But there's also one from the Indiana Jones universe.

96
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,600
Similarly, that means that in the Landry verse you have Bubba.

97
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,200
I don't remember Bubba's last name and Forrest Gump.

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,360
So they're part of it.

99
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,280
And then you have to go into like what else is Landry?

100
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,160
Morton's, Mane House, Chris.

101
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,840
Morton's Morton Morton.

102
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,720
Mr. Morton is a character.

103
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,920
Mr. Morton, the frog from Rain Carp Forest Cafe.

104
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,040
P.H. Charts, the founder of Chart House.

105
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,680
P.H. Charts. And that and that bull, that frog from the Rainforest Cafe.

106
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,600
He's the owner, I assume.

107
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,760
Yeah, the golden nugget itself, the hunk of gold.

108
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,240
Maybe they're all hunting for the golden nugget.

109
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,920
It's like a rat race kind of thing.

110
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,960
Look how this makes it now.

111
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,840
Dining is way more fun at a Landry's restaurant.

112
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,520
Now that we flesh this out, just a tad.

113
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,040
Looking for clues.

114
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,080
And the more the more you spend, the more clues you find.

115
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,200
That's right. And you can do it.

116
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,880
Any of the restaurant groups, you could do it.

117
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,240
Do it on Twitter.

118
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,280
Let us know what restaurant groups you want to have their own cinematic

119
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,000
universe or universe that's connected via just pictures on the wall.

120
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,080
Do you think TGI Friday and

121
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,280
Fuddrucker are friends in part of a shared universe or are they bitter enemies?

122
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,960
While they both like to collect a bunch of crap

123
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,960
to put on their walls, crazy crap on the walls is Uncle Mo.

124
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,360
Similar to the members of C who have all collected trinkets

125
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,560
from their travels across the world, except in the case of TGI Friday

126
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,840
and Fuddrucker, it's all garbage.

127
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,880
Everything costs five dollars or less.

128
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,440
Yes. And I'm going to quickly side note, I'm remembering now

129
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,720
that a friend of mine had an idea for Jason that I don't even know

130
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,440
if we ever told him about, like a TV show where Jason owned a TGI Fridays.

131
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,560
And he was like a guy who would go on a mission to try to get a new piece

132
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,360
of crap to put on his wall.

133
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,200
And he was like a Harrison Hightower type character.

134
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,160
And that was before I even knew who Harrison Hightower was.

135
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,880
This is great. That's actually, by the way, a great idea that I should

136
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,240
we should pursue.

137
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,600
Yeah, we should.

138
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,920
It would be like you would be like on an Indiana Jones adventure

139
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,640
and you would like find an artifact to put in your restaurant.

140
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,600
Yeah. Or a new fabricator, a new a new printer to make a pennant

141
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,040
that says like hometown USA.

142
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah. Because some of the places, if you look at like an apple piece,

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,480
this is like, wait, that has the impression of the town it's in.

144
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,040
But it's not quite right. Right. Not specific.

145
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,680
But I like to think TGI Friday and Fuddrucker hate each other's fucking guts.

146
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,400
That's better. Yeah. Yeah.

147
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,360
Dramatic there.

148
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,880
So if maybe Jason is a third, Jason is.

149
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,520
Yeah. Yeah. Another in this lineup of Jason is a third,

150
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,160
meaning like he gets together with them after hours or.

151
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,680
Oh, could be that too. Yes.

152
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,720
Yeah, that's a whole other ballpark.

153
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,960
I mean, it could be it's like strong, strong personality.

154
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,520
Like, like I feel like Harrison Hightower, the third and Barnabas

155
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,920
T Bullion are kind of at each other's throats.

156
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,480
I would imagine maybe maybe also feuding with disgraced member

157
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,920
Professor Garrett Reed, who knows?

158
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,440
OK, you know, we all have our own head cannons.

159
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,240
So you're going to OK, if you if you're listening to this and you vaguely know

160
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,440
what we're talking about as far as C is concerned,

161
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,360
we're going to be throwing a lot of names at you.

162
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,400
A lot of names, a lot of restaurants.

163
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,400
I would say maybe here's the thing.

164
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,600
Either really try to keep up, get a piece of paper handy

165
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,680
or just let it go and enjoy the ride and enjoy the jokes

166
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,040
because there's going to be I have so much information written down.

167
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,560
I apologize for this because it's going to be hard to keep track of all of it.

168
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,440
Yeah, because once characters from classic films start showing up

169
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,560
and actual real life explorers out of honorariums, you know.

170
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,000
Yes. Yeah.

171
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,880
It's where I thought it would be helpful in a way.

172
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,800
I'm justifying my relative laziness, which is like,

173
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,360
I'm like, OK, if we if I genuinely don't know things,

174
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,120
maybe I can serve as the listeners stand in.

175
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:58,360
Right. And when you say Jason Chandler, I can say who the hell is Jason Chandler?

176
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,000
Now, I do not see clearly, you know, Jason Chandler is,

177
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,800
although there's there's multiple versions of him, you know.

178
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,440
Oh, my God.

179
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,600
But I but then there's like all these because I still almost am like,

180
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,400
how do you have we even explained what this is?

181
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,240
It's all of these.

182
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,560
It's all of these characters who who who love to travel and explore the world

183
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,280
and they bring their goods back to these Disney parks locations.

184
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,520
I don't think it's literally I think I think there's all a suspension of disbelief.

185
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,320
It's not like they all work at Disneyland.

186
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,200
Like you're supposed to assume you're going to another world

187
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,160
when you're in the Jungle Cruise or the Tower of Terror.

188
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,640
But they like in some cases, it's the owner of the ride or the owner of the restaurant

189
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,040
or or this character is just somebody who frequents the establishment.

190
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,760
Some of these characters appear in the rides and some of them

191
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,520
have never appeared in anything.

192
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,600
There's not even a picture to go along with it.

193
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,160
So it's all extremely confusing.

194
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,480
Yeah, it's the shared universe.

195
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,120
It's the shared canon of like the adventuring kind of flavor

196
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,400
of parks, attractions and parks

197
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,800
or adventure like comics and and the Dr.

198
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,520
Livingston style explorers, but with the rough edges of like

199
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,480
accidentally giving smallpox to remote tribes or colonizing it for the British Empire.

200
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,360
All of that, like, you know, sand it off, all those rough edges, you know.

201
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,320
Right. Yes. Just the fun of taking things from people.

202
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,520
Helmets and camaraderie.

203
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,680
And yes, and that's an interesting thing, too.

204
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,440
And that's what we will talk about is like some people are bad

205
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,520
when they take stuff from like native cultures and that some people are nice, I guess.

206
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,320
Some people, they like it when they take stuff away from.

207
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,040
So I'm not sure about that.

208
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,000
We'll get into that.

209
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,320
But it's got saying, I feel like I have to keep like adding more explanation

210
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,680
in case you still don't know we're talking about like it's like, yes, characters,

211
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,240
as he was saying, like that have been created,

212
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,920
that you can find now links between things.

213
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,440
So you can see like, yes, as you're saying, a picture of the owner

214
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,440
of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, who we've mentioned before, Barnabas T. Bullion.

215
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,360
And then you can, you know, you can read about him in a comic

216
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,080
that's published about Big Thunder Mountain Railroad.

217
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,280
And Mario Chenier is a character who is represented in Typhoon Lagoon.

218
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,000
But you also can see references to her on the Disney Cruise lines.

219
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:34,600
So these are like these are things for people like us to notice.

220
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,960
This is not for dad.

221
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,480
You know, this is for you, the listener, to tell your more, say,

222
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,080
civilian family and friends and them to go like, oh, neat.

223
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,120
OK. Yeah.

224
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,480
But this is to me what I've and I'm not trying to be a wet blanket in this episode,

225
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,320
but here's what I have to admit.

226
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,360
And maybe to me, I'm viewing this as sort of a make me like it endeavor,

227
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,280
because I think all this is interesting.

228
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,720
I even like we I mean, we've talked about doing an episode about it for a long time,

229
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,040
but I suggest we do it now because there is this news of a television series

230
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,160
maybe coming about all this from the creator of Battlestar Galactica.

231
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,760
Or not not the original, but the guy who knew it.

232
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,480
Yeah. Among other things.

233
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,200
But so that sort of mobilized, oh, here we should do an episode about it now,

234
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,240
because we might all be delving deep into the world of sea soon enough.

235
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,680
But I so I think it's all neat.

236
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,880
And I thought it was worth talking about.

237
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,800
But I always hit a wall.

238
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,160
I'm always like, which I will probably hit for 20 minutes in the episode.

239
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,440
We've been talking about all of these mostly unseen characters for far too long.

240
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,800
But also, and maybe you guys can agree, and it's kind of what Jason was just

241
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,000
alluding to, I have definitely started talking about this or somebody's asked.

242
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,240
So what's up with that sea thing?

243
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,280
And I will start explaining and I will watch the glaze over.

244
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,800
I will watch the person lose interest as I am talking.

245
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,240
And then it kind of comes to a quiet sputter.

246
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,160
Is this foreign to do you guys?

247
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,680
Have you guys found yourselves?

248
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,680
Oh, so C is this group of characters invented that tie together.

249
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,560
And then people just kind of like, uh, what's that now?

250
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,240
That's a good question.

251
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,600
I don't know that anyone's ever asked me to explain C to them.

252
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,200
I think C is something you have to find yourself.

253
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,880
If you're asking me about C and you, and you didn't put the time into Google C,

254
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,160
chances are you are going to do what you say and glaze over.

255
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,680
If you catch a glimpse of C, even with a slight understanding

256
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,680
that has something to do with Disney parks, I think if you're the type of person

257
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,240
who wants to Google and go down the rabbit hole, then you're going to be into it.

258
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,760
But as you're saying, if you mentioned C in a sentence and somebody goes,

259
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,400
Oh, what's that?

260
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,680
Just say, Oh, I misspoke.

261
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,040
I didn't say, did I say C?

262
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,600
Oh, I meant, uh, I was talking about C, like the wall, the ocean, like,

263
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,200
and then they'll go and then they'll get confused and then just change the subject.

264
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,720
But if you want to double down, what you can say is, well, actually,

265
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:08,360
if you look up a video interview with the Imagineer, Joe Lance, Lance Acero,

266
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,560
uh, you'll hear him say it S E A.

267
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,920
And that's interesting.

268
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,440
That might, I'm not sure if that's how he refers to it or if it's so as to not

269
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,840
confuse the listeners, the reviewers of that video with Disney.

270
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,360
Um, you know what I will hear?

271
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:27,920
You know what I will say though, is that having them do a show about C and maybe

272
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,080
incorporate, who knows, they could just change it into a bunch of sexy teenagers.

273
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,520
I'm not sure exactly what Ron DeMora's plan is.

274
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,320
Jungle Cruise movie with the rock.

275
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,040
Yes.

276
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,360
And where does that fit in?

277
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,480
That's confusing.

278
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,560
I think there's elements.

279
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,040
I've heard a rumor there's elements in there, but I would say being on TV.

280
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,240
Would really help see out in a lot of ways, because as we're seeing now with

281
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:54,040
Marvel, how popular it is, there's according to like, no one ever, like

282
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,360
people trash Marvel, but it's the most popular thing still 10 years running.

283
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:03,840
Jason and I as little kids are vindicated because the Marvel canon 80 years of it

284
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,480
is what you're saying is eyes glaze over.

285
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,400
What is the, how many times has vision done?

286
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,920
He's gone bad and good and like what version, how many X-Men teams are there?

287
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,760
10?

288
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,240
What?

289
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,720
At once?

290
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,200
Yes.

291
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,760
Well, there's X factor and X caliber.

292
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,120
All of this stuff that Jason and I told other kids on a playground and they glazed

293
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,720
right over and wanted to push us and maybe did push us down.

294
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:34,320
Like, I think thou making it into movies and TV has made it easier to digest.

295
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,040
It's more digestible to see it versus just to hear it from a giant loser.

296
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,480
It's a billion dollar industry, baby.

297
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,680
That's the traditional trappings of the society of the road.

298
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:51,680
It's so much where everyone's taking comfort in the obscure shared universes of pop

299
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,240
culture, detritus of the 20th century.

300
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:54,880
Exactly.

301
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,760
So cut to cut to five to 10 years, you're going to be talking about Harrison

302
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,440
Hightower with everyone, you know, like, did you, can you believe what happened

303
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,480
at what Harrison Hightower did at the end of season three and like everybody's

304
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,560
going to be a flutter and then they're going to realize it was in the parks

305
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,880
already and their minds going to be blown.

306
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,080
And I'm cool because I was in on the ground floor right far before the debut of

307
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,680
the of three seasons of Merryweather on on Disney Plus.

308
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,320
Exactly.

309
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:30,360
So when they need to address Albert the monkey shoplifting troubles, like

310
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,120
on Breaking Bad, you know.

311
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:42,000
So I so well, yeah, I yes, TV will will help because as we I mean, yes, there

312
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,520
being a television show about all this is better than it's a bunch of like

313
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:54,720
etchings in parks that in cruise ships and parks that are mostly not in America.

314
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,400
Like, I think that's some of why this has remained sort of quiet, this quiet

315
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,040
gurgle. There was very little sign of see it felt like in the American parks

316
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,840
until the last five years.

317
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,160
I was pretty I think I think the first I heard about it might have been on this

318
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,480
podcast from you at some point in time.

319
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,680
I mean, it's not something I've known about for too long.

320
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,280
I certainly was not aware of it when Disney see open or anything.

321
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,960
It took me maybe about in the last five, seven years is when I first noticed it.

322
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,120
Obviously, they put a lot more stuff in Disneyland and little references at this

323
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,880
point. So, yeah, I think that, yeah, at this point, the awareness.

324
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,680
It's skyrocketing.

325
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,760
Yes, yes.

326
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,280
Genuinely, I mean, when you look around when this was announced that there's

327
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:47,600
going to be a show set in this world, I was impressed like, oh, there is a lot of

328
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,560
coverage of this and there's kind of a lot of confident articles saying, you

329
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,480
know, it's the society from the Disney parks as if people know what it is, which

330
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,800
maybe more people do than I think or they will soon.

331
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,920
Yeah, I think I think at this point, maybe people have heard the name and know a

332
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,760
little bit about it at the very least.

333
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,120
If you're a nerd at this point about this stuff.

334
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,120
Can I start by dispelling a misconception about C?

335
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,240
Please.

336
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,600
OK, the Adventurers Club is not the original iteration.

337
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,680
The Adventurers Club was retconned into C.

338
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:30,240
The first attraction to mention C is a Tokyo Disney Sea exploration, like

339
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,920
a play area, essentially, for sex exploration.

340
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,400
Explorations. Yes.

341
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,520
Yeah. The Adventurers Club gets grandfathered in because what happens in

342
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:47,320
the real world is the Adventurers Club closes down in 2009, 2009,

343
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,440
yeah, 2009, 2008, thereabouts.

344
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,720
And the the props and such gets scattered to the winds.

345
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,720
And then the Adventurers Club kind of gets retconned in.

346
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
Scott, do you know about retconning?

347
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,600
I know that is the something is not part of a canon and then is sort of pulled into

348
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,120
a canon after the fact.

349
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,120
Right. Yes.

350
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:15,400
Yeah. A lot of the Fast and the Furious movies, a lot of retconning going on as

351
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,320
they have just gotten bigger and bigger and bigger.

352
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,120
They've gone like, by the way, these take place in the first place.

353
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,160
And then the Adventurers Club is kind of like a little bit more of a

354
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,880
by the way, these take place after number three.

355
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,600
You have to watch that, watch them in this order.

356
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,280
OK, I know suddenly these characters have iPhones and they have flip phones.

357
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,280
Don't worry about that.

358
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,800
Don't think too hard on that.

359
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,520
That's the defining of the rules.

360
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,680
And in that franchise, like, why are some of the why do some of the movies

361
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,160
have none of the characters from the rest of them?

362
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,520
Yes, correct. Yes.

363
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,080
You know, that's character finding themselves off on their own adventures.

364
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,120
Right. So what you're saying is like,

365
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,600
that when the Adventurers Club opened, it was not this whole concept

366
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,400
was not conceived of yet.

367
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,600
But the DNA of Adventurers Club, I think, is you can definitely see where it leads

368
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,840
to the Imagineers then in 2001, starting this idea

369
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,560
that they could link everything together and then, of course, retconning

370
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,280
Adventurers Club and then ultimately and Jungle Cruise and Jungle Cruise.

371
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,680
Rides that existed long before there was any of this.

372
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,840
And now we're going backwards and saying these characters are part of it.

373
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,760
And now we've even though we just thought of Barnabas T.

374
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,600
Bullion, the owner of the mining company this decade,

375
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,360
we're going to act like this was always part of the plan in the 70s when it

376
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,680
when it opened. Yes, exactly.

377
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,280
Should we just start with listing?

378
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,040
And I say, I think we've said this five times.

379
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,360
Well, we should start with and then we've said something.

380
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,040
And then I keep going, yeah, we should start with.

381
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,120
But should we list the characters maybe?

382
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,400
Maybe that's the best way to start.

383
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,760
Just say here are the characters.

384
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,560
The list take do you does the list?

385
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,680
Do we have to say that because some of the.

386
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,880
Well, yeah, I guess you're right.

387
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,280
I've only got to read. What does that mean?

388
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,960
I've only got about 30 members. It's OK.

389
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,600
All right. You know, you drive the.

390
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,120
OK, let's let's try it.

391
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,600
Look, feel free to cut me off.

392
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,280
Feel free to push me down as a child on a playground would be when I explain

393
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,240
to him who the third summer's brother might be in the X-Men comics.

394
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,520
In the same way, feel free to push Jason or I down.

395
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,760
OK, but verbally.

396
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,200
So, OK, Harrison Hightower is a member of C.

397
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,480
He is a character that you can find in Tokyo Disney.

398
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,600
See, he is the eccentric bad man.

399
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,240
I call he's the he's the baddest member of C.

400
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,360
I think he's the most evil, the worst.

401
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,080
He owns the Tower of Terror there.

402
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,880
And he was killed because he put a cigar out on like a tiki idol

403
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,520
and the idol killed him.

404
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,200
And you're caught.

405
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,880
It's not the Twilight Zone in Japan.

406
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,880
It is this other story about this character and this tiki idol

407
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,800
putting a curse on him and therefore you. Yes.

408
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,560
And there's a you know, we've obviously went on ad nauseam

409
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,880
about how great Tokyo Disney see.

410
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,720
And this is like one of the best rides on top of all of that greatness.

411
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,080
And it features a lot of very funny art

412
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,040
of him stealing things from around the world with his manservant Smelding.

413
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,800
Now is Smelding a part of C?

414
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,880
Is he a member of C?

415
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,880
I don't believe Harrison Hightower's

416
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,840
assistant Smelding is part of C.

417
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,920
A lot of there's a lot of great assistants on this list,

418
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,920
but I don't believe he's an official member.

419
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:43,320
I think he might be a adjacent or old superhero trading cards

420
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,640
would refer to someone as an ally of this team. Right. Exactly.

421
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,880
There's a lot of adjacent members, people around C. Right.

422
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,360
OK, a lot of people performatively on Twitter saying that they're allies of C.

423
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,240
It's a bit much, don't you think?

424
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,840
Well, yeah, you know, you want to show, not tell.

425
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,480
I feel like when you're an ally, you know, you want to be an ally of C.

426
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,840
But yeah. So all right.

427
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,080
Lord Henry Mystic is a member of C.

428
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,800
He is the man who owns Mystic Manor, which is in Hong Kong, Disneyland.

429
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,720
In the tree, it's barely discussed on this podcast.

430
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,280
Sort of a stand in for the haunted mansion.

431
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,760
It isn't exactly the haunted mansion, but they don't have the haunted mansion

432
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,640
in Hong Kong, and they do have Mystic Manor. Right.

433
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,720
They have Mystic Manor there.

434
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,640
He has a sidekick who I don't believe is a member.

435
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,960
It's a he's a monkey named Albert.

436
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,280
And he's the one Albert is the one who kind of takes you on the journey.

437
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,760
I cave during quarantine.

438
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,000
I had never watched it before thinking like, I'll get to Hong Kong one day.

439
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,840
I caved. I watched it.

440
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,120
I watched a little. Yeah, it's great.

441
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,360
I get it. I'll forget before I go.

442
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,880
It looks so fantastic.

443
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,360
I mean, this feels like one of those could be top 10 attractions anywhere.

444
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,880
But you have to go to know.

445
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,880
Yeah, I'm counting Albert the monkey as a member.

446
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,160
OK, but that's new.

447
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,600
Or you found information that I thought I think he's in.

448
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,680
Just from his number of appearances.

449
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,120
This feels like you can and though.

450
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:17,760
Well, it depends if you if you use Bengal barbecue as a keystone

451
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,040
and Bengal barbecue and tropical hideaway.

452
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,760
It depends. Harrison Eye Tower.

453
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,160
Do you should we mention every appearance of these characters when you name them?

454
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,240
That seems like too much, doesn't it?

455
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,600
Let's let's clip notes and we'll go back and we'll go back to talking about it.

456
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,360
I just want everyone to have like a baseline for like who we're talking about as we go.

457
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,520
And friend, just if you're wondering, just try to visualize

458
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,320
if you're like lost with all these names, just visualize an old white guy

459
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,560
with a beard or mustache, probably probably.

460
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,840
For the most part, unless we say it's a lady.

461
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,880
Yes, yes, which there are a few.

462
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,160
And then picture like Mary Steenburgen and Back to the Future three.

463
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,440
That's like they all do look kind of close. Yeah.

464
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,680
OK, so yeah, Henry Mist.

465
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,360
Now, Henry Mystic, I believe, is supposedly like a good guy,

466
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,000
even though he does the exact same stuff that Harrison High Tower does.

467
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
This is what I was saying before.

468
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,520
He collects artifacts and brings them back to Mystic Manor.

469
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,360
But for whatever reason, he smiles more and he looks friendlier.

470
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,400
So I guess he's OK. I guess he's a nicer man.

471
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,280
Maybe he gives money to people around the world for their artifacts or for their goods.

472
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,760
I'm not sure exactly.

473
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,640
Ask permission in the way it's more like Joe Roady would do.

474
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,160
Joe Roady, who travels to places like Nepal, the Imagineer,

475
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,080
and collects items and puts them in the cues of Disney attractions.

476
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,440
Presumably with permission.

477
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,640
Presumably this is a good thing to do, even though Harrison

478
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,040
High Tower, the bad character, looks like Joe Roady.

479
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:53,640
Several of these characters look very much like the the actual Imagineers.

480
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,960
Yeah, which is alternatively.

481
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,400
Part of me thinks it's cool.

482
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,520
And part of me thinks it's a little lame.

483
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,960
I can't quite decide.

484
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,520
I think with Barnabas, T Bullion and Harrison High Tower, it's teasing a little

485
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,840
because it's like, you know, they're there.

486
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,920
You know, High Tower is the opposite of how Joe Roady behaves, you know,

487
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,080
who Joe Roady tries to be respectful when he goes to other cultures.

488
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,400
Well, on the yeah.

489
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,400
Well, I will say this next character first and Barnabas T Bullion,

490
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,960
as we just mentioned, who looks like Imagineer Tony Baxter,

491
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,440
who owns Big Thunder Mountain Railroad.

492
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,320
He was another character who, when I look around at information, I go,

493
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,040
oh, he's he was a tyrant, too.

494
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,640
He was bad as well.

495
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,680
And then I and then I'm sure you guys read this or maybe not on the Wikipedia

496
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,120
that in Disney Kingdoms, which that's other the stories,

497
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,400
the comics, I believe, right?

498
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,080
Yeah, I don't know what Disney Kingdoms is.

499
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,080
Disney Kingdoms is the Disney Comics land that Marvel has quickly abandoned.

500
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,640
Right. That's gone. That's done.

501
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,000
That was to their two figment comic series,

502
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
a Big Thunder series and a Museum of the Weird series.

503
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:04,240
So this ties together quick service restaurants and abandoned comic lines.

504
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,840
Yes. Oh, my God.

505
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,720
No one's listening anymore.

506
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,720
Everyone turned it off. This is one of those.

507
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,680
Oh, Monday, stay away from this one.

508
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,240
Oh, my gosh. Just bail right now. This is. Oh.

509
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,840
So Barnabas T Bullion, I read here, apparently

510
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,040
the sympathetic interpretation of Barnabas in Disney Kingdoms

511
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,520
was the result of talks the author had with Tony Baxter,

512
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,480
who wanted the character inspired by him to be more of a redeemable figure.

513
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,200
Makes sense. A character looks like you.

514
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,560
You don't want him to be a mean, awful, like a Daniel Plainview type

515
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,480
of like murderous, negligent.

516
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,640
Yeah, sure. Munger.

517
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,360
I but Goldmine owner was not synonymous with good person,

518
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,120
much like we recently discussed the phrase Casino Magnet is not

519
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,960
usually short and for you.

520
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,640
Yeah, that's true.

521
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,280
So Barnabas is there.

522
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,680
And if you've read the Disney Kingdoms, he's nicer than you might think.

523
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,280
You know, that's what they're saying.

524
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:08,160
If you've read the Disney, if you read, have you guys read the Disney Kingdoms?

525
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,480
I have not read the kingdoms.

526
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,280
Big Thunder, I think one day we will revisit and I promise to read them before that.

527
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,000
Also, I do not make this promise.

528
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,560
I want to give an update. The Mr. Tato autobiography is on its way.

529
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,280
All right. Wow. It's on its way here.

530
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,640
OK. Captain Tato, not a member of C.

531
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,720
Not yet. He is a he is a potato character from a park in Ireland.

532
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,040
That has nothing to do with Disney.

533
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,440
Just to clarify, he hates the Pringles guy.

534
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,600
Their enemies are not.

535
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,360
It's sense to me. Well, the Pringles guy wants him dead.

536
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,200
That's right. He wants him and his kind fried up.

537
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,720
That's right. Although, wait, Mr.

538
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,040
Tato also sells fried potatoes, but he has permission.

539
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,560
He kills his friends and says, can I make you delicious

540
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,000
for people all over Ireland to enjoy? Right.

541
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,040
And they said they appreciate they they like a self sacrifice.

542
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,560
Feels good to them.

543
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,280
Do it for the cause. Yes.

544
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,280
OK. Captain Mary Oceaneer.

545
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,960
She is represented, as I said, in Typhoon Lagoon now.

546
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,200
She has a slide.

547
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,200
The slide is Misadventure Falls. Yes.

548
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,120
And she has a sidekick as well.

549
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,480
It's a parrot named Salty.

550
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,040
I like Salty a lot and Salty.

551
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,480
This is, I believe, from the YouTube video I was watching.

552
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,200
Salty is the first or or only animatronic

553
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,280
that you could see on a water slide.

554
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,760
Really? Disney parks, at least, if not around the world.

555
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,840
Salty, a member of C.

556
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,200
I don't know. Let's ask Jason. Jason has opinions on this.

557
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,240
Well, you know, it's when you start getting into the animal.

558
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,320
I mean, we'll have to I bet we'll have a ruling by the end

559
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,960
whether the animal sidekicks or or not.

560
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,240
Mary Oceaneer, also the namesake of Oceaneer Labs

561
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,400
on the Disney Cruise Line, Disney Magic Ship, a children's play area,

562
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:10,240
which names check name checks multiple members of C.

563
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,240
Misadventure Falls, the diving bell outside

564
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:19,960
has Atlantean text on it, which connects it to Atlantis, the Lost Empire,

565
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,560
the film. So presumably Atlantis, the Lost Empire is is

566
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,920
that is part of the canon.

567
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,160
Yes. So the character voiced by Michael J.

568
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,680
Fox, and I don't know his name, is he a member of of C?

569
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,560
Is Mr. Atlantis a member of C?

570
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,440
I'm going with Jason on to be the C judge here.

571
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:44,040
As far as I think, yeah, I think he would be a Jason.

572
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,640
Because there will eventually hit.

573
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:52,880
There's a character down the line that I would describe as an aspiring member of C.

574
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:59,560
You know, well, we all, you know, I should be so lucky.

575
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,560
All right. Dr. Albert Falls.

576
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,960
OK. Jungle Cruise Skipper Canteen.

577
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,200
Does he own he owns the Skipper Canteen?

578
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,760
Sorry, I Jason probably has even more complete information.

579
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,240
I think there's something like that.

580
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,440
Skipper Canteen, Bengal Barbecue, Tropical Hideaway.

581
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,280
It ties together a lot of these people.

582
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:26,880
Dr. Albert Falls that comes from the joke on the Jungle Cruise about like, you know,

583
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,560
Dr. Albert, this these waterfalls are named after Dr. Albert Schweitzer.

584
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,200
And it's why he named them.

585
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,120
Wait, what is that? How does the joke?

586
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,720
It's something like that.

587
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,760
It's something like that. That had no ending or beginning.

588
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,760
Some of the words you said were part of that joke.

589
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,280
Yeah. Yeah.

590
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,400
What's the joke? The joke is that it's named.

591
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,160
Wait, Schweitzer Falls and it's named after Dr. Schweitzer named it.

592
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,720
Oh, it's named after the one who discovered Dr. Albert Falls.

593
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,840
OK. I think. Oh, it's it's Schweitzer.

594
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,640
No, Schweitzer Falls.

595
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,000
Yeah, the joke is that you think it's named after somebody named Schweitzer,

596
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,640
but in fact, it's named after somebody named Falls. Right. Yes.

597
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,960
Got it. Joke really clungily.

598
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,520
And it's named after a person named Cannon.

599
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,160
Mm hmm.

600
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,080
Yeah. And kind of this is like a very old school Jungle Cruise joke.

601
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,840
And it's a very throw away this name.

602
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,920
Like, I don't think anybody thought there's an expanded universe.

603
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,040
Dr. Albert Falls.

604
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,600
That's like a like a like a sex pun name from a joke

605
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,240
your grandpa would tell you suddenly being there's all universe around

606
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,120
an IP freely or some such.

607
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,480
Really in C.

608
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,840
I do not think IP freely is it say or at least toilet magnet IP freely

609
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,520
expelled by Vitaly Rubusdeli.

610
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,520
All right. I mean, I wanted to wait for a while, but Ronald DeMore, please

611
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,200
create a character named IP freely for Jason to play.

612
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,200
If you're not going to cast him as Harrison High Towers

613
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,200
assistant smelding, please

614
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,280
connect all the characters from sex jokes, dirty limericks,

615
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,760
get them all in one place.

616
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,600
Please is the man from Nantucket in C.

617
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,800
Put the man from Nantucket in C.

618
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,960
That's where the group meets.

619
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:22,080
The way current television is written, an episode will end on a hard line

620
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,400
of someone going like we have to return to Nantucket like don't.

621
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,840
That's great. As long as once was a man from there.

622
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,000
The password to get into the C building,

623
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,840
the pass, the code phrase will be the backside of water.

624
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,440
So shortly a character will say his dying breath.

625
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,120
You'll think he's dead.

626
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,480
Characters don't die that much in Disney stuff.

627
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,520
You know, there's a handful do or they come back.

628
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,520
You know, these characters, well, they're all I mean, they're all dead

629
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,000
because this all happened.

630
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,280
These are entirely characters from the 1800.

631
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,920
Nobody is modern and in C. Correct.

632
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,240
18, 1900, Harrison Hightower

633
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,480
disappears on New Year's Eve, 1899.

634
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,320
That event occurs. Right.

635
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,920
But there are no current members of C.

636
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,040
Yeah, that's a good point.

637
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,040
That's a good question.

638
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,160
Even upon that, that's an interesting question.

639
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,040
I mean, that's definitely room for another 50 to 100 names.

640
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,360
To talk about, obviously, when a future podcast, but yeah, that would be

641
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,640
that would be worth exploring, I think,

642
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,000
maybe in season 12 or whatever of C.

643
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,200
You kind of cut to the present day of these.

644
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,360
Maybe it's maybe that's what links tomorrowland together with C.

645
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,040
To more Brad Bird's Tomorrowland, I didn't say Brad Bird's Tomorrowland.

646
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,080
I just said Tomorrowland.

647
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,760
Well, there is kind of the one this episode will take

648
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,960
so much work on my part, because I am the one who has the like

649
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,240
50 page document that explains it.

650
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,600
There was a

651
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:06,320
I forget what the term is, but it's like a game that takes place in real life.

652
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,760
There was a lead up to the release of Tomorrowland called The Optimist

653
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,640
that connected actual like Walt and Imagineer history

654
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:20,600
with like L.A. landmarks, Griffith Park, Chilly John's and Burbank.

655
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,120
And part of the mythology, Chilly John.

656
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,840
This is what we're dreaming of.

657
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,120
Yeah. Landry verse.

658
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,600
So there is kind of like it.

659
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:34,320
There was something that was kind of an imagineer movie

660
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,920
version of like the World's Fair kind of futurism.

661
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:45,080
So I guess that's experienced by 45 people in 2010.

662
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,360
Yeah. And those people's lives were changed forever.

663
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,400
You know, that's the thing.

664
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,640
It's but each one of them, you know,

665
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,000
there wasn't the most popular themed experience,

666
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
but each one of them started their own themed experience after they did it.

667
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,880
That's what's great.

668
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,360
None of which are the most popular themed.

669
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,520
No, but it can continue to sort of continue to one of those people's eventual

670
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,600
and it's not an ideal time to be the owner of an escape room.

671
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,080
You know, that's true. So.

672
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,120
OK, how many more to go?

673
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,200
OK, we don't know.

674
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,760
There might not be a bottom.

675
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,040
If we just say the major one.

676
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,400
Camel, Camelia Falco, Camelia Falco,

677
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,240
the star of Soaring Fantastic Flight at Tokyo,

678
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:35,520
Disney is the daughter of Salino Falco

679
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,160
and the first woman inducted into sea.

680
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,400
So she beats in canon.

681
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,680
She beats a Marriott chanier,

682
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,480
even though Marriott chanier was created before her.

683
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:55,640
Yes. And you can see a photo or a painting of the tail of the taily

684
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,240
vital. I don't know how to say it.

685
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,480
This episode is unreleased.

686
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,880
The the then president of sea inducting her.

687
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,040
And you can see sea members in the background of this painting.

688
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,240
You can see Lord Henry.

689
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,560
Got it. All right.

690
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,440
Let's get let's cruise a little bit faster here.

691
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,360
Jack Lindsay from Indiana Jones is a member of sea.

692
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,040
This is canon. This is canon.

693
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,320
It is noted in his bar in.

694
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,280
I always get confused who Jack Lindsay is in the movies.

695
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,400
What is Jack Lindsay in the movies?

696
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,320
He is not one of the most famous characters.

697
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:35,320
He is the pilot that flies in the away from the people

698
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,040
chasing him at the start of Raiders of the Lost Ark.

699
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,960
And Indy freaks out because there's a snake in the passenger seat

700
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,160
and jocks like, ah, it's fine.

701
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,440
And that's it. That's what he is.

702
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,120
Who owns the bar, Scott?

703
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,400
And he's got a bar.

704
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,520
His sea membership is confirmed in the bar.

705
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,120
Yes. So he's a member of sea.

706
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,880
And that bar is at Disney Springs in Florida.

707
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,800
In Florida. Yes.

708
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,840
Jason Chandler is a member of sea.

709
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,800
He built Big Thunder Mountain Railroad.

710
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,240
Well, he he invented the drilling tool.

711
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,360
That is used in Big Thunder Mountain Railroad.

712
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,520
Now, he also shows up, as we say, to Tropical Hideaway Skipper

713
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,160
Canteen. He's in the Disney Kingdom's comic.

714
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,680
He's he's I think in the background, in the painting, in Soaring Fantastic

715
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,280
Flight. But the thing I thought was interesting about Jason Chandler

716
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:40,000
originally made for Discovery Bay, the unbuilt section, right?

717
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,880
Unbuilt, you know, kind of Jules Verne inspired expansion

718
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,920
that was going to go into Disneyland that was dependent on the success

719
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:57,720
kind of of the Island at the Top of the World film, which was not successful.

720
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,800
That brings us to Captain Brio,

721
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,520
the star of the Island at the Top of the World.

722
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,880
He is in sea and was going to play a part in Discovery Bay.

723
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,600
Right. But that movie was not a hit.

724
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,720
So, oh, well, but they did not take his membership away

725
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,040
despite the movie underperforming at the box office.

726
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,400
They did not. And in fact, you can see his airship

727
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,840
in the Hyperion restaurant at Disneyland Paris Tomorrowland.

728
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,640
The airship that's bursting out of the worst restaurant

729
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,160
maybe I've ever been to.

730
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,880
The worst burger, the true if no question, the worst burger I've had in my life.

731
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,880
Wow. Was it the worst one?

732
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,720
Yeah, so, so bad.

733
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:51,520
I know we got the gripe that I am too hard on Disneyland Paris several times.

734
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,200
And I do blame food for that.

735
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,080
Food is so bad, or at least was on that day.

736
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,520
Maybe it's gotten better.

737
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,120
Maybe I was just hit a bad time.

738
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,000
I don't know. But we did.

739
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,320
And it kind of broke my heart because I have always loved that that building,

740
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,600
this cafe with this cool airship, you know, like a zeppelin flying out of it,

741
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,280
which is sort of what Tony Baxter wanted this Discoveryland area to look like.

742
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,960
Yeah, it sucks. There's just a bad restaurant in there.

743
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,000
But it's very cool from the outside. Yeah.

744
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,080
So those are the major ones.

745
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,600
We can we can say other ones as if they come up here.

746
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,760
But those are the major. I want to just there's going to be plenty of lists

747
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,920
that throwing you with this and the rest of this podcast.

748
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,880
But well, I have a couple couple.

749
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,360
I would say big ones.

750
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,760
OK, I apologize. That's OK.

751
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,560
They only mostly show up in paintings because of who they are.

752
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,480
Professor R. Blow and him or Blower Himmel.

753
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,000
And let's see our Blower.

754
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,640
Himmer is not a major member of C, but I think he's only in a painting.

755
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,760
He's in a painting.

756
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,960
But it's based on imagineer.

757
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,040
I believe it's pronounced Rops Coltrane.

758
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,120
And then these pronunciations.

759
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,960
I don't know how to say this guy's name. I looked for videos.

760
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,240
I found how to say Joe Lance Cicero,

761
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,880
and he is the inspiration for Dr.

762
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,320
J.L. Baturista, who shows up in the Mystic Manor Portrait

763
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,280
and Tropical Hideaway as well as Charlton J.

764
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,480
Tabaret. He is in the Mystic Manor Portrait of C.

765
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,680
He is based on the artist Chris Turner, who designed a lot of this stuff.

766
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,400
Can you explain?

767
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,360
Because I know I am so lost.

768
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,200
The Mystic Manor portrait.

769
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,160
What is the significance of this?

770
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,480
This is one of the early,

771
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,880
you know, documentations of C.

772
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,320
I'll share the screen here.

773
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,240
You'll see this come up a lot.

774
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,200
OK, yes. In my my find, yes, I've seen this painting.

775
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,840
And this kind of is like maybe the the the most major

776
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,600
work that shows all the members, maybe not all,

777
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,720
but a bunch of the members all in one place.

778
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,360
Yeah. A lot of the main members, a few of the imagineer based

779
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,400
members, a couple that are listed as unidentified, but they're speculation.

780
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,840
It's like, oh, that's supposed to be Jason Chandler. But it's unclear.

781
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,800
So all right.

782
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,000
Let's say if this image will tweet it or it'll be like the main image

783
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,080
of the show, of the episode, let's this.

784
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,360
So I think will be helpful if you the listeners looking at a photo

785
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,840
of a bunch of people in brown clothes and it is a banner up top.

786
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,200
It says Society of Explorers and Adventures 1899.

787
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,160
Let's go left to right. Who is who?

788
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,920
That's not that's Harrison Hightower, the third with his with a fez and the idol.

789
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,720
Yeah. The fezzes are a big thing.

790
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,560
It's the fezzes are the membership

791
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,880
like thingies there.

792
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,840
There's a lot of fezzes throughout the world.

793
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,040
Even though most of the people in this photo are not wearing the fezzes.

794
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,440
Yes, that's correct. You don't have to.

795
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,440
This next one, I believe, is Professor R.

796
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,520
Blower Himmel. Seated is Lord Henry Mystic.

797
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,800
I forget which one this is.

798
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,640
See, might be unidentified.

799
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,760
Here's Bartabas T. Bullion.

800
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,120
This one, I believe, is listed as unknown than Mary O'Shaver.

801
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,400
I know there's unknowns in that.

802
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,840
That's Dr. Dr. P.L.

803
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,480
Trevors. Yeah.

804
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:28,320
Name the great grandfather of the film critic for Rolling Stone magazine.

805
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,840
No, no. Of the Mary Poppins author.

806
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,160
OK, yes.

807
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,520
That's Peter Trev.

808
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,560
Is P.L. Trevor's related to Peter Travers from Rolling Stone?

809
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:43,880
I don't know. Well, not in reality, but in the retcon Trevor verse.

810
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,680
Yes, the Travors.

811
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,960
Mary O'Shaver and then Charlton J.

812
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,840
Tabaret on the end.

813
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:55,320
When you just said who Tabaret is, but where else can we see Tabaret again?

814
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,360
He can be found on a napkin in the restaurant

815
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:04,720
in Disneyland that's located next to the Bank of Barbecue.

816
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,360
I think mostly here.

817
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,280
Let's see. What other members are there?

818
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,320
Oh, I've got something.

819
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,640
There's is there's a big one. Go ahead, Jason.

820
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,760
Oh, do you have Maestro de Elfman?

821
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,880
That's exactly where I was going.

822
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,600
This is so stupid to me.

823
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:29,120
So one thing you might not know about the ride Mystic Manor

824
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,840
is that it has an original score by Danny Elfman,

825
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,360
one of the great film composers of all time.

826
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,560
You all know Danny Elfman.

827
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,880
And so thus they're in this in the queue is where a lot of the paintings

828
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,640
exist of these characters.

829
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,200
And I guess they consider a member of C to be.

830
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,320
What is his name in this again?

831
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,760
Maestro de Elfman. Yeah, it's just Danny Elfman.

832
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,080
It's just a caricature of Danny Elfman.

833
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,960
Maestro de Elfman.

834
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:00,200
And then it's an 1800s style photo of clearly the current musician,

835
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,160
Danny Elfman.

836
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,520
This one just feels lazy to me. Maestro de Elfman.

837
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,440
Would you say you were looking for more of a character for him?

838
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,240
Or you just think it's lazy putting Danny Elfman's face in there?

839
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,440
Hmm. Yeah. What would what would satisfy me here?

840
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,960
I mean, look, it's not, you know,

841
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,240
it's not mastered to Baxter.

842
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,120
They didn't just make it to one off of Tony Baxter.

843
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,000
It looks like but they made up a character.

844
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,520
I think I do want more.

845
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,720
How about like, yeah, like JP Notesman?

846
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,080
Works for me. That's what I do.

847
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,280
And I fixed it. Yeah.

848
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,440
Yeah. Just change the beginning.

849
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,200
I'm doing great. Yeah.

850
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,400
OK, that's good.

851
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,640
I think Danny Maestro de Elfman is definitely the most famous

852
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,440
of the sea members visually because he's the most famous man.

853
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,040
No offense to Tony or Joe Rody, but Joe Rody.

854
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,480
They were not annoying. Oh boy. Oh, let's be honest.

855
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,560
Yeah, there's no music videos, I don't believe, with Joe Rody

856
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,280
and a band that he was in. Right.

857
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,400
There are in terms of retcon, Mary Weather, Adam Pleasure.

858
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,600
Yes, that's right. Yes, he is a big guy.

859
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,480
I apologize for leaving him out.

860
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,680
Retconned. He is the creator of Pleasure Island.

861
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:23,200
Adventurers Club is was retconned to be like his outpost of sea.

862
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:28,760
And by extension, there is a letter at Alani, the Hawaii Resort,

863
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,920
from Pamela Perkins, who was a character.

864
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,320
She was the president of the Adventurers Club.

865
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:39,040
So she, I guess by default in that letter, she mentions Harrison Hightower.

866
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:44,280
And it's funny because Joe Rody, there's multiple tweets from Joe Rody

867
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,240
going like, huh? Yeah, no, I did not create sea.

868
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,560
The Adventurers Club was just the thing we did.

869
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,240
He's like, wasn't that fan made like wasn't a fan connections?

870
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,000
But eventually it seems like he started to play along a little more.

871
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,760
I mean, I don't know if he put that thing in Alani or another imagineer

872
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,680
did that. But a lot of Rody stuff,

873
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:09,360
including Rody himself, kind of have been grandfathered in to see.

874
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:13,440
I I'm interested to know, and this is probably not something

875
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,200
it'll ever be public. I am interested to know how

876
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,880
a Tony Baxter or other imagineers might feel about all of a sudden

877
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,080
a backstory coming onto a ride they may have created.

878
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,920
I bet they might be a bit conflicted because now if the actual like

879
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,600
retconning they've done of Big Thunder is there's like a ghost in Big Thunder

880
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:38,080
that's disrupting gold mining and runaway trains are happening

881
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,960
versus I think the original concept of Big Thunder is like

882
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,080
this train has been maintained very poorly.

883
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,320
So be careful getting on it.

884
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,320
And that was basically the premise.

885
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,360
There was no other character like a tyrant who ran the

886
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,000
ran the mining company or anything.

887
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,640
There's there you wouldn't it'd be weird if suddenly.

888
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:01,400
Oh, well, actually, there was a maniacal madman

889
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:06,160
who started shrinking people and putting them into his teacups.

890
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:10,200
And he invented a turntable machine to make them spin wildly

891
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,920
to the to the point of dizziness, to to to

892
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,880
throw people off and mess with their minds.

893
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,200
You're not just getting in a spinning.

894
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,280
The cups are big and you spin around.

895
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,040
But I don't know. I like Scott's because it connects the teacups

896
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,720
and adventures through inner space.

897
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,960
And this is how you do it.

898
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,040
This is how you world build, you know.

899
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:35,080
It is elsewhere in the magic kingdom, because that's what they're saying about

900
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:41,040
the sea show is that it's part of building the magic kingdom universe.

901
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,320
What did they what was this show release?

902
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,480
Because there's going to be more of this nonsense.

903
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,080
This doesn't stop at sea.

904
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:52,960
No, I was working on a movie like a magic kingdom movie a while ago.

905
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,400
And it seems like that got show just like that.

906
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,080
That's a movie. Who cares about movies anymore?

907
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,640
What we need now is universes.

908
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,560
We need this battalions of 200 films

909
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,160
and shows and tick tock accounts.

910
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,600
I don't think they'll build an empire.

911
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,880
I don't. I'm here's a guess.

912
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,360
My guess if we're talking like what they're going to do with TV,

913
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:17,880
I'm guessing that the show is not going to be about like 15 white colonizers.

914
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,960
Don't think so.

915
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,000
I don't think that seems like a good idea for a show right now.

916
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,480
Or maybe ever, probably ever.

917
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,800
So I assume what they're going to do is maybe take elements of like a secret club

918
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,880
and then try to tie it into famous ride things.

919
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,520
You know, that that would be a guess.

920
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,920
I don't know that to be sure.

921
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,320
They obviously have not spoken to Mr. Moore, but it seems like I'm.

922
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,640
Yeah, it seems like you would want to take elements from all of the different

923
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,760
parts of the parks and then tie them into an idea of a secret club.

924
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:52,120
Well, this is the speculation in this Hollywood Reporter article

925
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:55,720
that I just pulled up announcing this Magic Kingdom TV universe

926
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,600
in the works at Disney Plus and Ron Moore is creating all this.

927
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,080
So, yeah, the Magic Kingdom TV universe, there's so much more to go.

928
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:08,000
Connecting all these parks things and their this is pure speculation

929
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,080
from unnamed sources that then they back.

930
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,400
Let me let me just read this because this is going to confuse the entire thing,

931
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,440
but also lend greetings to what Mike is saying.

932
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,520
It's not just going to be this secret club of people who steal.

933
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:26,160
Yes. The idea per sources is to explore characters

934
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,640
like sea boat captain from the Jungle Cruise.

935
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,800
No punctuation or prospector from Big Thunder Mountain

936
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:37,360
or the climbers of the Matterhorn, for example,

937
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,240
as part of the Society of Explorers and Adventures to parenthetical.

938
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,240
To be clear, none of these characters or storylines are currently on the table

939
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,560
at this stage.

940
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,160
So one of the sources and they just Hollywood Reporter

941
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,920
just pulling this out of their ass is because the the climbers of the Matterhorn,

942
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,600
anybody can that's a real place and anybody can climb it.

943
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,520
That's why this free solo retconned into the sea.

944
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,240
Yeah, I mean, I think maybe at the end of the first episode

945
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,440
or the end of the first season, you maybe want to have

946
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:10,400
like a kid sweeping up and you learn that anybody can be a member of sea.

947
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,040
Yeah, we did get the gripe leave Broome Boy alone.

948
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,280
I know we did, but I like talking about Broome Boy, so I'm sorry.

949
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,680
But we can't invent new Broome Boys that are our invention.

950
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:24,480
We could do whatever we want with them, because anyone can invent a Broome Boy.

951
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,960
That's correct. That's correct.

952
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,200
Yeah, it always goes well when you flood in right now.

953
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,560
It always goes well when you put a kid in a Star Wars movie.

954
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,880
Actually, I I joke

955
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,440
or two, but as a kid, I really did like the the end or

956
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,200
the kind of made for TV and or movies.

957
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,800
Oh, yeah, I never saw them. Yeah.

958
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,320
Are they are they? Oh, they're traumatic.

959
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,840
Yeah. Oh, no. Yeah.

960
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,800
It's yeah, characters definitely die in those.

961
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,160
And that was upsetting.

962
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,120
But they certainly were on a lot on cable.

963
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,280
Yeah.

964
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:04,360
So I think, yeah, I think we're going to get a lot of like you'll

965
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,240
whatever property they're not thinking they're going to do for a big movie.

966
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,560
Like they've been they've been, you know, they floored it with the idea

967
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:15,200
of doing Big Thunder or there was a pilot or something, or at least a script, for sure.

968
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,920
I think stuff like that, they'll say, OK, now we're doing a big thunder show.

969
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:24,400
And it has an element of one character is in a group in the sea group or whatever.

970
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,040
I don't know if it probably won't be just about Barnabas T.

971
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,880
Bullion. Yeah.

972
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,320
One thing is for sure, all these characters, if it's like Prestige TV

973
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,760
now, they all these characters got depression and they're going to say

974
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,800
something epic and very modern, like in Enola Holmes.

975
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,960
That's where we all get our life lessons from.

976
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,920
There'll be a clap back of some kind.

977
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,040
Oh, there's going to be a lot of clapback.

978
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,040
Oh, Barnabas T.

979
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,800
Barnabas T. Bullion clapback.

980
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,720
Oh, yeah, he will.

981
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,160
He will clap back.

982
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,560
He will be like that CEO who made his

983
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:02,840
his salary seventy thousand dollars a year and made his employees like he took a massive pay cut.

984
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:07,480
My pitch would be for Big Thunder would be, OK, you know, Daniel Plainview

985
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,360
from There Will Be Blood, what if he clapped back?

986
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,160
And I think that's going to sell it.

987
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:19,120
Well, doesn't I mean, killing somebody with a bowling ball is kind of a clapback.

988
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,840
You know, I guess, you know, you're right.

989
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,760
It was before we were calling it that.

990
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:26,440
Some might call it the ultimate clapback is bashing someone's skull in.

991
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,920
You might call it that.

992
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:35,320
Speaking of TV shows, I found out while researching this

993
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:40,480
that apparently there was a Discovery Bay pilot made that did not go

994
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:46,400
and go anywhere starring Pete Rennaday, who has come up on the show a lot before.

995
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:51,040
Probably, I think most famously in the parks as the imitator

996
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:58,920
of the James Mason Captain Nemo in the twenty thousand leagues ride in Florida.

997
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,120
Right. So, yeah, that did.

998
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,000
So they've tried. Yeah.

999
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,640
So so that's probably that could be back on the table as far as the sea verse.

1000
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:11,000
So I'm I'm interested to see where Ronald Moore goes with this.

1001
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:15,120
And look, Ronald, look, if you're listening, which you are, come on, hook us up here.

1002
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:18,000
It doesn't I'll be a P.A. on it. I don't care.

1003
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,240
Actually, don't make a P.A. on it.

1004
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,440
That's right. Not good. Yeah.

1005
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,440
Yeah. No, no, no, no.

1006
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,800
I mean, there's a lot of old artifacts.

1007
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,120
I was a P.A. and it's hard work.

1008
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,760
Yeah. I'm not knocking P.A.s.

1009
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,400
It's just it's a pain in the ass.

1010
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,000
But now P.A.s are all in charge of covid safety now.

1011
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,560
So you really don't want to do it.

1012
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,760
It's a good point. God.

1013
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,680
It's poor guys.

1014
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,800
OK, here's here's a little thing that happened.

1015
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:49,640
OK, so we're talking about there was a reference made to Meriwether Pleasure,

1016
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,000
and he is apparently a part of sea.

1017
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:57,320
Well, Pleasure Island and the establishment, the adventures club in it

1018
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,360
are not that predates all of this.

1019
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:05,520
It clearly was the source of long rambling backstories

1020
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:09,280
for what is ultimately a restaurant or a nightclub.

1021
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,400
Because that's where if you like, if you don't know all this,

1022
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:16,840
if you a while back we did, we covered Pleasure Island with Paul Scheer.

1023
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:22,680
Yeah, Disney wanted to start a nightclub place to put

1024
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,080
a downtown Orlando place called Church Street Station out of business.

1025
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,560
They wanted there. All right, let's just do nightclubs.

1026
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,840
And they did it.

1027
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:36,280
And instead of just it's nightclubs, they it's this whole tale of this

1028
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,960
all of Meriwether Pleasure.

1029
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:42,000
And he crashed his ship and he thought this will be the place where I

1030
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:46,320
I don't even I don't remember what the backstory is exactly.

1031
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:50,040
But like it's it's it's it predates seeing that it's a backstory

1032
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:54,200
that almost manifests itself in the experience nowhere.

1033
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:58,040
Like then you're just in a 70s club called eight tracks

1034
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:02,960
and there's no reference made to this old this old man who would hold court.

1035
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:08,160
And so that's the sea philosophy starting, I feel like.

1036
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,080
Well, we kind of led me into.

1037
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,360
I would say we talked about on the episode, like there's plaques outside.

1038
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,040
Yeah, you got to follow the plaques.

1039
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:19,520
And there were these plaques with just pair thick paragraphs

1040
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,640
of the explanation.

1041
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,800
And this is all roadie.

1042
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,880
Well, he didn't invent see he did do all this.

1043
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:29,920
Right. Like insane backstory to a nightclub where you put on

1044
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:34,400
like a funny afro wig and bell bottoms and listen to Casey and Sunshine Band.

1045
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,640
But so now here's all that brings me to this.

1046
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,680
I I was like, well, maybe I should do some research for this.

1047
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,640
Maybe I should learn more about sea.

1048
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,920
And that brought me to the Wikipedia that is all about sea.

1049
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,680
There is a 100 percent sea wiki.

1050
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:55,680
And I clicked around like, well, what are the most popular pages on this?

1051
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,080
Maybe that can find me some odd info.

1052
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,520
And when I clicked on that, I found one of the most popular pages

1053
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,600
is about the funmeister.

1054
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:08,360
Now, the funmeister, you guys probably know, but as a refresher,

1055
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:12,200
the funmeister and I have a little Parkstar toy of it.

1056
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,000
The funmeister is the Pleasure Island moon guy.

1057
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,680
He is a bright yellow

1058
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,720
party dude who has a moon for a head.

1059
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,600
He is not Mack tonight from McDonald's.

1060
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:30,360
He is a different moon guy, but he loves fun and music just as much.

1061
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:34,480
So my childhood awareness of the funmeister is like, oh, yes.

1062
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,520
So parents go to these nightclubs and there's this moon guy up on the sign.

1063
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:41,400
And that's sort of where it begins and ends for most people.

1064
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:46,160
Not according to the sea wiki, which let me know

1065
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:50,080
that the funmeister is an ancient

1066
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:55,280
icon with all of this like backstory and meaning.

1067
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:59,800
I'll read as much of this as I can manage without getting bored.

1068
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:04,200
The funmeister, as roughly translated ancient Germanic names called him,

1069
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,920
was an ancient being that drove Meriwether Adam Pleasure to establish Pleasure Island.

1070
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,960
This half faced moon icon whose roots go back to the barbarians

1071
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:16,720
after the fall of Rome symbolized individuality, the celebration of life

1072
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,560
and the sharing of laughter while traveling in Mexico.

1073
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,520
Pleasure experienced a mystical vision of the funmeister

1074
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,080
that told him to travel to central Florida in 1911.

1075
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:30,000
After bringing his family down the barge canal system aboard a steamboat,

1076
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,800
Pleasure saw an ancient totem of the funmeister on the shore.

1077
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:39,240
There he met a ghostly Seminole tribe, informally known as the I-4 Indians,

1078
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,840
that allowed Pleasure to set up.

1079
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,600
What what is this nonsense? What do you mean?

1080
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,440
He is like he's a fun moon man.

1081
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,040
He is not an ancient totem.

1082
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:54,240
And then on this wiki, they show a photo of like a wood carved version

1083
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:59,800
of the funmeister as if this was like this was carved by a Seminole tribe.

1084
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,440
And then but how does all this square with like

1085
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:07,960
then I saw artwork of the funmeister and he's just like in a zoot suit

1086
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:11,800
leaning up against a wall and like dipping his sunglasses like

1087
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,800
picture mythology.

1088
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:19,000
Is he an ancient Indian thing or is he a is he like a like a Chester

1089
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,760
cheetah or Chester cheetah?

1090
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,720
Yes, that's exactly how he's pictured otherwise.

1091
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,880
Mythology gets reinterpreted.

1092
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:29,120
It's like when you do a version of the Odyssey and it's about an American

1093
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:33,480
soldier in the Iraq war trying to get home, you know, to the city of Ithaca

1094
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,200
as opposed to the island of Ithaca.

1095
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,160
Right. You know, what was that? What did that?

1096
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,640
I I believe I don't know if that was ever made.

1097
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,920
I I think was that a TV miniseries?

1098
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:49,400
There has been versions where it's just like it's the story of the Odyssey

1099
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:53,400
and the trials and tribulations of Odysseus are like it's World War

1100
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,800
Two or it's the Gulf War, you know. Right.

1101
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,080
Hmm.

1102
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,440
Scott, are you saying, though,

1103
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:03,880
somebody came to you and said, I want you to write a detailed 50 year

1104
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:08,520
history for Macktonite and make a trilogy of films about Macktonite

1105
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,680
and his rise to becoming Macktonite.

1106
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,240
You were I think you're up for it.

1107
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,600
You're up. I don't know if he's a god of some kind.

1108
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,920
I mean, you feel free to pitch on it now or not.

1109
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:17,920
I don't care.

1110
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,520
Uh, yeah.

1111
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,280
I mean, absolutely.

1112
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,640
I would love to learn the entire mythology of Macktonite.

1113
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,760
The the cool piano playing moon from McDonald's.

1114
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,160
Certainly he's got there's like a lineage of musicians.

1115
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,720
Like, I think I think the piano playing is in his blood.

1116
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,760
Maybe there's sort of a purple rain thing going on.

1117
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,960
There's a complicated relationship with his father, who was also a musician,

1118
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:46,720
but didn't, you know, like excel as much as the system.

1119
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:52,480
There's like a jealousy of Mack, who is now a popular restaurant icon.

1120
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,960
So imagine like an old like an old, bitter,

1121
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:00,440
wrinkled moon man, sadly drunkenly playing the piano

1122
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,560
and then throwing a bottle at Mack.

1123
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:06,080
Right. And then saying, you can't treat me like this, daddy.

1124
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,640
And then there's like Ronald show up at the end of the first movie, maybe.

1125
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:15,040
Oh, that's good. I'm putting together a night menu.

1126
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,440
Yeah, that's great.

1127
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:25,360
I mean, by Grimace, Grimace is wearing like a like a leisure suit.

1128
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,280
Yeah, he's the agent Colson.

1129
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,240
Ronald is Nick Fury.

1130
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,320
OK. And Grimace is is agent Colson.

1131
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,920
OK. Yeah, great.

1132
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,200
Who's who? Yeah, who's who?

1133
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:39,760
I guess. Well, Bertie has to be Black Widow, I suppose.

1134
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,840
I guess we're going original Avengers.

1135
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,920
So I'm just saying you're right that

1136
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:51,080
the fun Meisters origin may be a little bit convoluted, a little bit.

1137
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:55,080
I think, yeah, the problem is it's not rooted in what we know about the fun Meister,

1138
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,560
which is that what do we know about him?

1139
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:59,360
He's he wears a bow tie and he likes to dance.

1140
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,960
I don't believe that he is an ancient totem.

1141
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,400
But hey, this is what they got to do.

1142
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,560
This is what you got to do.

1143
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,720
It's there if you want it.

1144
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,920
You don't need to know it to enjoy it.

1145
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,840
But that's what they got to do to make theme parks.

1146
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:15,960
It's like I had to make this chart with like another 15 people we haven't addressed yet.

1147
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,480
Can we see the chart?

1148
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:19,560
Yeah, I was on a screen share.

1149
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:20,760
Yeah. Yeah.

1150
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,520
So here's the chart.

1151
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:26,680
They made it an apple.

1152
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,760
You can put a table in Apple Notes.

1153
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,240
You made a table.

1154
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,720
Wow. Table.

1155
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,280
Because here is adjacent.

1156
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,400
I think we should.

1157
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,000
Magell. Oh, they're all.

1158
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,720
Yeah. So the honorary members that show up in Fortress

1159
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,760
explorations are real explorers.

1160
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,680
Sir Francis Drake, Leonardo da Vinci, Tycho Brahe,

1161
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:49,360
Vasco da Gama, Cristobal, Cologne, Ferdinand Magellan.

1162
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,440
And then there's also places where a sea handbook shows up,

1163
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:57,240
like the UK Pavilion or a sea fez and Abra Kedabar.

1164
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,040
OK, let me talk about this real quick.

1165
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,400
Abra Kedabar is is related to sea.

1166
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:04,680
And I had no idea until today when I was looking at all this up.

1167
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:08,080
And there's a did you read the backstory about it, Jason?

1168
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,880
I read the backstory of Abra Kedabar.

1169
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,600
The sea fez doesn't have a lot of backstory, does it?

1170
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,880
No, but there's a there's a thing and I have to get out of this view.

1171
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,720
Oh, yeah. You unshare.

1172
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:19,640
Now we've seen the table.

1173
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:24,440
Abra Kedabar, the magic themed bar at the Boardwalk Hotel.

1174
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,600
Yeah. Is part of the sea verse.

1175
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,120
Yes. Did you know that, Scott?

1176
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:31,800
I did not. Along with Captain Cafe Hyperion, we already mentioned

1177
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:35,440
both Trader Sam's, of course, have a lot of sea connections.

1178
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,280
OK, so this is the canon explanation of what happened at Abra Kedabar.

1179
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:42,480
This bar once acted as a lounge for some of the world's most famous

1180
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,040
magicians and illusionists.

1181
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:48,120
However, this all changed on Friday, the 13th, September 1940,

1182
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:51,480
when every magician inside disappeared without a trace

1183
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,640
and have never been seen again.

1184
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:57,520
Among the magicians props around this lounge is a sea fez, as we were saying,

1185
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:02,080
indicating that one that one of the magicians may have been a member of the society.

1186
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:05,360
It's one of them.

1187
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:10,840
So don't worry about the fact that all the magicians disappeared forever.

1188
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:15,320
One of them may have been a member.

1189
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:20,040
We don't know that part of a weird club may have been a member of sea.

1190
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,040
Or they I mean, they could have stolen the fez.

1191
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:27,160
As far as like canon, it's not clear, like if you steal a fez and wear it,

1192
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,280
does that make you a member?

1193
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:30,960
If you kill a member of sea, do you become a member of sea?

1194
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,880
I'm not exactly sure about any of this stuff, but Abrikadair

1195
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,840
bar just has a little hint there.

1196
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,200
I am I would be interested more in the actual like disappearance

1197
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,320
of all those magicians. That seems interesting to me.

1198
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:46,200
And maybe a little more interesting than just somebody finding a dirty fez.

1199
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,960
An old, dirty fez.

1200
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,040
Jason, what do you think about fez as a look? Is that

1201
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:56,840
I don't know. It feels very, very much like an affectation.

1202
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,960
Right. But it'd be perfectly natural.

1203
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,360
I don't know.

1204
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:05,280
I bet. Do they sell fezzes at Hong Kong, Disney and Mystic Point?

1205
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,400
Probably right.

1206
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,960
I mean, I think the Shriners are still around, right?

1207
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,400
And the Shriners still wear fezzes.

1208
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,960
I mean, I'm sure that's not the best organization to get in.

1209
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,560
Is is Abu a member?

1210
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:23,520
Jason of sea or the Shriners of the either one is Abu the monkey.

1211
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,720
I would say definitely not the Shriners.

1212
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,680
I don't know that there's much a Latin connection.

1213
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,200
The other big movie that's kind of adjacent,

1214
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:37,160
the the sole fact of a picture, the Humphrey Bogart, Catherine Hepburn

1215
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:43,400
classic, the African Queen is kind of adjacent to see due to this picture

1216
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:47,680
that hangs next to Bengal Barbecue, featuring Humphrey Bogart,

1217
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:50,840
Catherine Hepburn and a Photoshopped in Albert the Monkey.

1218
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,920
Pulling in. This is like Space Jam.

1219
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,920
Have you heard of Space Jam? Yes.

1220
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:00,440
Has Casablanca and Casablanca franchise? Yeah.

1221
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,600
Yeah. I should have said Casablanca.

1222
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,960
That's a better way to say it. Casablanca is in it.

1223
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,000
What are what other properties are it?

1224
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:13,400
Space Jam is now part of a greater Time Warnerverse HBO.

1225
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,520
What's the company even called?

1226
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:17,360
Eight to eight. It's a part of a greater AT&T Time Warnerverse.

1227
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,280
Mad Max, Fury Road, I believe

1228
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:25,320
is mentioned, and this is all and this and none of this included.

1229
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:28,000
It's all separate from Ready Player One,

1230
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,200
which also like throws everything into a blender.

1231
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:36,360
Like it's how do you talk about charts and spreadsheets?

1232
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:39,920
How do you figure out what pop culture item is in which

1233
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,160
I've said this corporate umbrella and universe?

1234
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:47,120
I've said this before, and I know I didn't actually cause this,

1235
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:50,360
but it is like when I was 10, I wished on a monkey's paw

1236
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:53,760
that all entertainment would turn into Marvel Comics.

1237
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,840
And it's coming true.

1238
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,640
It's like that is happening.

1239
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,840
Now, here's I'll use that to segue into a feeling.

1240
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,160
I am a little I like see a lot.

1241
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,520
I'm I'm invested in it. I like it.

1242
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:10,400
I do worry it's swallowing up the park whole.

1243
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:14,040
And we'll maybe continue to swallow the whole park

1244
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:18,480
if there's a show that starts linking it to every like, oh, did you know that

1245
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:23,120
the man who owns the confectionary on Main Street is a member?

1246
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:25,320
The candy striper.

1247
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:28,160
Mr. You think there's too many things being pulled in?

1248
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,360
I think so.

1249
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:33,560
That might be controversial, but I feel like maybe there's too many things

1250
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,520
now being pulled into it.

1251
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:39,640
I like I there's it's obviously a personal taste thing,

1252
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:42,120
but I like it when it's a little bit less.

1253
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:46,480
I don't know. It feels like it's taking over versus a little bit more obscure.

1254
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,480
Do you know what I'm saying?

1255
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:52,280
Well, yeah, I think it is on the rise and we're only going to see more and more of it.

1256
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:55,400
But I think the thing that's going to stop it at the end of the day

1257
01:08:55,760 --> 01:09:01,000
is our dads not giving a shit about any of this.

1258
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,320
That is where point me to the rides, please.

1259
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,600
Well, OK, listen, Pop,

1260
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:09,640
Madam Zarkov is what is an adjacent.

1261
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,160
I'd say an advisor to see because Jason Chandler

1262
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:18,560
consults with her in a letter in the letter in the big thunder line.

1263
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,320
And she was in the Adventurers Club.

1264
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:21,680
She was a character there.

1265
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:25,320
Jason Chandler mentioned she's at the Museum of the Weird.

1266
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,240
So that connects three things.

1267
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,200
Jason, does your dad know about C?

1268
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,560
Because I think your dad of the thing.

1269
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:36,000
I think, yeah, I think my dad might know a little because I've explained

1270
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,640
or I've pointed stuff out.

1271
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,920
My dad listens to the podcast.

1272
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,200
I think I probably listen to almost all of them.

1273
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,480
He's probably listened a lot.

1274
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,160
He was not very into this, I don't think.

1275
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:50,120
He listened to one last week where he complained about her parents.

1276
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,480
He's a little behind.

1277
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,720
He's been working from home, so I think he's a little behind.

1278
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,440
He you know what? He would have mentioned that I spoke with him earlier.

1279
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:03,320
So I bet I don't think he would have.

1280
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,760
He does not. He's not like a guy who would have probably known C

1281
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,600
before listening to this podcast.

1282
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:11,760
Yeah, yeah. So my mom would think it was neat.

1283
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:15,240
I think if I started explaining all this to her and it ties all these things

1284
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:18,240
together, I think she would as a teacher, as an educator,

1285
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,480
I think she would she would find it all clever.

1286
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,640
It is all clever.

1287
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:24,280
And we agree, I think that it's all clever and fun.

1288
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:29,880
But yes, I am a little concerned with the seification

1289
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,400
of the Disney. I like I would like the idea that

1290
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,200
there's different little groups unrelated to each other.

1291
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:41,560
I mean, we've talked about there's like the Tomorrowland in Tokyo

1292
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:45,560
sort of mini universe kind of that links stuff together.

1293
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:49,040
It ties into Star Tours a little bit, which I think I might have been.

1294
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:52,200
I forget if I was saying that episode, I would like to tie that into like

1295
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:56,800
Red Rocket, the owner of presumably the owner of Red Rocket's Pizza

1296
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:01,400
Port, and I like that there's ogas and Rex there and Rex ties a lot together.

1297
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:05,800
So like the space restaurant universe, I'm really I'm into.

1298
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,680
Right. Yeah. But like you would I would think you would want to keep

1299
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,560
you would want to keep like something like Everest.

1300
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:15,040
I know Expedition Everest has a lot of backstory in the queue and stuff,

1301
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,320
but you would want to keep that a little more pure.

1302
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,800
You want to keep some of those rides.

1303
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,600
You don't need to tie in, Jason. Yes.

1304
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:26,480
I think it's already in canon a little in.

1305
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,200
But it's a little bit.

1306
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,680
It's just little hints like so Skipper Canteen.

1307
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:33,760
There's a lot of details in Skipper Canteen in Orlando.

1308
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:38,400
And the three books written by Harrison Hightower are references to Joe Brody.

1309
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:41,160
They they they're called Treasurer of the Animal Kingdom.

1310
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:45,760
Expedition Everest, Colin in Search of the Yeti.

1311
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,840
And the last one, I think, is a pretty solid joke.

1312
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,040
It's just called mine.

1313
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:52,400
Am I an E exclamation point?

1314
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:57,640
And that is kind of playing up on him being a pillager character.

1315
01:11:58,280 --> 01:11:59,520
So there's a little Everest.

1316
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,360
I just don't think we don't need E.L.

1317
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:06,560
Everest, the owner of the mountain character.

1318
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,520
I don't think we need that is what I'm saying.

1319
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,640
You know, not E.L. Fudge, E.L. Everest.

1320
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:16,680
There's kind of blank slates for the TV writing staff.

1321
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:20,720
Other there's characters like in Tropical Hideaway and Skipper

1322
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,960
Canteen mentions characters S.

1323
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:27,440
She Ho and Chef 10 10 dodgy.

1324
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,440
And then in Skipper Canteen, there's Luana Texera.

1325
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:34,600
You are going to keep trying to say names throughout the rest of this episode.

1326
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,520
I don't know how these names are said.

1327
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,440
They're just written down.

1328
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:41,280
Anytime there's a lull, you just start saying a photographer.

1329
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:46,120
Now, going back to Hong Kong, Disneyland, the Halloween overlays.

1330
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:50,000
Professor Garrett Reed was the disgrace star,

1331
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:54,160
disgraced excommunicated member, excommunicated by Dr.

1332
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:58,320
Henry Mystic. He is the star of Jungle Cruise, curse of the Emerald Trinity.

1333
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,920
Emerald Trinity, excuse me.

1334
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,880
And then there was a show called Horrors of the Amazon,

1335
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,000
which featured a character named Jonas Brisbane.

1336
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:11,720
Talking about how he was an aspiring member of C.

1337
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,440
He's a one. Jonas Brisbane is a wannabe.

1338
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:17,200
He's a hanger on. He's never getting in the groove.

1339
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,960
He's a leader. Holiday overlay shows.

1340
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:24,240
You don't care. You think you can hold water next to Barnabas Bullion?

1341
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:27,040
Yeah, F off Brisbane.

1342
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:29,880
Let's real real quick.

1343
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,680
And we've alluded to this.

1344
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:35,320
C is and I don't think they're seen like this,

1345
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,840
but C is a bad organization, right? They're bad.

1346
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:40,400
Like they're bad.

1347
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:44,480
Well, secret clubs are bad organizations or yeah.

1348
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,840
Isn't something in Scientology called C? C-org?

1349
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,520
Oh, yeah. C-org, yeah.

1350
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, that's weird.

1351
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,680
It is. I'll tell you that. It is weird.

1352
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:58,480
That exists and it is all Elrond is kind of this sort of guy.

1353
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:02,040
He's not like a pillager, but he's like he liked his boats and his

1354
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:05,080
weaving his tails is the master in.

1355
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:08,480
See, I like that.

1356
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,080
Well, I would love if the yeah, if the Phillips,

1357
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:14,160
you know, happens character, the name's not coming to me, but if he's in it

1358
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:18,080
and that fake Elrond Hubbard in that movie we talked about,

1359
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:21,960
but that universal guy made like there was like

1360
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:26,400
it was called like the Church of Scientific Skepticism or something.

1361
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,680
Yeah. Like like M.

1362
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:33,120
M. Ron Blowhard or whatever parody name they used. Yeah.

1363
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:38,040
Well, I mean, if you if you start to make a Paul Thomas Anderson

1364
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:42,240
universe with the master, then you start that gets so complicated

1365
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:45,120
because like, well, if you include inherent vice, that includes the Thomas

1366
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,760
Pynchon universe, right?

1367
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:50,720
And the crying of lot 49 is all just different warring secret societies

1368
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:53,040
that it's not clear what most of them do.

1369
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,440
How do the Heim videos factor in?

1370
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:01,120
Well, and then, yeah, where do the Heim sisters start to play?

1371
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:05,040
They are. They show up at the end of one with drumsticks.

1372
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:08,120
And then they just say like, we're starting a band, I guess.

1373
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:09,560
Yeah.

1374
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:15,280
Yeah. So so back to my back to my thought, though, about see, it's like.

1375
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:20,120
If the group, I think, is not portrayed as bad guys,

1376
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:24,840
but if you have Harrison Hightower in the group, you're a bad group.

1377
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,280
He's he's like pure evil.

1378
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:30,680
And even if Mystic is taking things from around the world,

1379
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,400
he's still taking the things.

1380
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:33,960
He's still a rich guy.

1381
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:36,800
Like, I I guess where I'm going with this is like

1382
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:42,480
what Disney won't do is make a series about like ten different Mr.

1383
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,920
Burns type characters.

1384
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:47,880
Yeah. Who are comically evil.

1385
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,120
And then eventually, we hopefully would get their comeuppance.

1386
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,400
I don't think that's going to happen.

1387
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,800
I think Disney doesn't see the characters like this.

1388
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:59,560
But let's be honest, see is not a good group.

1389
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,480
They can't be all bad.

1390
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:03,760
They all deserve ironic punishments.

1391
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,520
The most of them, I think some are fine.

1392
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:09,760
I think the Soren lady, she just likes she's a falconer.

1393
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,200
And here seems nice.

1394
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,720
Hey, this this bothers me, too.

1395
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:15,320
There should be a lady tyrant in this group.

1396
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,200
You know, yeah, I think it is.

1397
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:21,440
Yeah, they've they've made it so that the female characters are kind of like,

1398
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:25,240
you know, like kind and right redeemable.

1399
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:29,480
But yeah, maybe you do want like we got Cruella coming out.

1400
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:31,560
You know, you want your you want your villain.

1401
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:35,200
I'm worried Cruella is going to like save the day at the end of that movie.

1402
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,560
Like, you know, well, it is a weird.

1403
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:40,440
Yeah, does Cruella end up bad with all things about that?

1404
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:41,720
She was good. Yeah.

1405
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:45,400
At some point, I'm just saying for true, you know, true equality.

1406
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,840
You want ladies tyrants as well as male.

1407
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:51,280
Yeah. You know, you're really fiction.

1408
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,720
Not in real life.

1409
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:54,920
You don't want that Cinderella's mom.

1410
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:59,920
Can we know like, can we find out that Cinderella's mom was like a pillager?

1411
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:03,320
She like stole that house that they live in.

1412
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:09,280
Yeah, like kick somebody pulled some deed shit, some legalities and stole that house.

1413
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:14,360
If you there's a BBC documentary series called Can't Get You Out of My Head.

1414
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:17,360
It's from this guy, Adam Curtis, this documentary filmmaker

1415
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,960
made this big movie hyper normalization.

1416
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:24,600
One of the characters he follows in this documentary series was Mao Zedong's wife.

1417
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:27,280
And she might be one of the most evil people.

1418
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,000
She's like out of her mind.

1419
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:33,400
And the whole the origin story is she is a failed actress

1420
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,840
with a lot of grudges to settle.

1421
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,720
And this is what happened.

1422
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:44,760
Like she rewrote epic Chinese stories and operas to serve the revolution.

1423
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:47,040
And then when people started to turn on her,

1424
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:50,680
she turned like the young people against them.

1425
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,400
Like it's so crazy.

1426
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:55,440
Like she's the perfect kind of she's.

1427
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:58,240
Yeah, she should be one of the evil people in sea.

1428
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,680
Mr. Bird. Honestly, Mr.

1429
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:00,720
Burns could be in sea now.

1430
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:02,920
I'm thinking about it because Disney owns Disney.

1431
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:04,920
Yeah. And Mr.

1432
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,920
Burns was alive for some of Mr.

1433
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:10,600
Burns was on the earth at the same time as some of the members of sea.

1434
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:13,680
Yeah. So I just I think

1435
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:17,800
as fun as it is to see little plaques and to see the characters,

1436
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,880
I think that Disney should think of sea as villains.

1437
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:23,720
I think that's a more fun way to go.

1438
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:27,840
Like narratively, but I think sea is going to be all they're all going to be good.

1439
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:28,760
I have a feeling.

1440
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:33,680
I think it's going to be like Kingsman, where it's like the good guy secret spy agency.

1441
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,360
But then there'll be one or two traders.

1442
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:39,680
There'll be one or two, you know, heels kind of like when like

1443
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,960
like Sabretooth joins the X-Men for a few issues.

1444
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:44,960
And then he starts killing people again.

1445
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,840
You know, they're all and look, we own.

1446
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:49,040
I think I said it earlier. They're all going to be hot.

1447
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:51,000
Every now and then.

1448
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,800
That's where there's no way this is a bunch of old men.

1449
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,680
Right. Not happening.

1450
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:59,040
Right. I guess I maybe I'll speak for myself.

1451
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:02,800
My dream show, the bunch of old people who are really bad,

1452
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:07,880
like being bad and you enjoy it for a while and then they just get their comeuppance.

1453
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,120
I don't think that's the show.

1454
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,760
The show is going to be like sexy, spicy,

1455
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,000
and they're doing cool stuff.

1456
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,800
And they can't like kiss or anything because it's Disney and they stay away

1457
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:22,040
from sexuality completely can't be Riverdale, but it'll just be other like here.

1458
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,280
They're doing good things around the world.

1459
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:27,600
The hottest guy named Barnabas you've ever seen.

1460
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:32,480
They call him like Barn, Barney, Barney, Barney, Barney, still like barn, maybe.

1461
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,320
Come on, Barney.

1462
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:37,040
Oh, I'll be I'm very excited for the episode where Jason Chandler

1463
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,000
discovers human growth hormone.

1464
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,840
So everyone see can get like exactly jacked, like exactly the same way.

1465
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:48,680
Jack. It's like, yeah, River River Pills or something.

1466
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,480
Magic River Juice, the Enchanted Spring.

1467
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,840
Yes, that's OK. That's much better.

1468
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,720
Yes. Come and drink from the Enchanted Spring.

1469
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:01,440
It will make you more vascular.

1470
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:06,800
Well, that's what all those old pulp care, all those like doc, doc Samson and stuff

1471
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:12,000
like they all figured and even like I think the early Batman comics were like

1472
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:17,720
he became a peak physical specimen or like found some sort of serum

1473
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:20,360
that gave him super strength and endurance.

1474
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,000
There's always a lot about endurance.

1475
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Super soldier serum. Super soldier. America took it.

1476
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:26,960
Yeah. Yeah.

1477
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:27,840
Always a serum.

1478
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:31,000
But really, all they mean is just HGH, human growth hormone.

1479
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:35,480
That's right. The same thing that many of your favorite stars are on right now.

1480
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:40,880
As we speak, they're doing a cycle of HGH to get prepared for a new movie role.

1481
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,200
The real superhero origin story out it.

1482
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:50,040
Yeah, it's HGH and it's lean meats, very little carbs, some greens.

1483
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:54,680
How do you think they go from giant to like much less giant in a different movie?

1484
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,040
Come on, wake up, folks.

1485
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,560
I don't know why I'm arguing with somebody who's objecting to this.

1486
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:01,360
Who's denying the use of.

1487
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:05,320
I can just hear thousands of people saying, no, I don't believe it.

1488
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:10,080
They just put another five pound weight on each weight and they did it.

1489
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:11,920
They got big.

1490
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:14,600
Well, what then?

1491
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:19,880
Maybe do we need to like flesh out what is an example of something we want?

1492
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:23,000
Like, what is it? What does one of these characters do?

1493
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:24,880
It is bad.

1494
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,480
And it wouldn't be that bad because we don't want to see like inflicting

1495
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:31,240
pain on native populations and that kind of thing,

1496
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:33,760
unless the punishment is just an immediate.

1497
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,040
But like, you know, it is it does have to be in that Mr.

1498
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:40,320
Mr. Burns blocking the sun vein. Right.

1499
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,520
Well, it's yeah, it's like stealing.

1500
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:47,800
He's stealing like hairs and eye towers, stealing stone head and sure something.

1501
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,760
Or something else. Right.

1502
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:52,640
Yeah, he's making who's the assistant?

1503
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,960
Who's his smelly smelding smelding?

1504
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:59,360
He makes smelding carry each stone.

1505
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:04,240
He gets smelding too much of the magic serum.

1506
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:09,560
It makes him very strong forces smelding to take Stonehenge out block by block.

1507
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:13,360
So he can put it in his front yard and nobody else can have access.

1508
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:17,080
Or he just it's maybe he has his tower. Right.

1509
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:21,200
So he goes up on the seventh floor of the tower or the 13th floor,

1510
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:24,520
the unlucky floor, and he puts Stonehenge inside.

1511
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:27,720
This is in my building now, but it's too heavy.

1512
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:31,960
And all the stone and blocks crash through all of the subsequent

1513
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:34,920
floors and destroy the building. Yeah, that's good.

1514
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,800
Yeah, that's good.

1515
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:41,040
And then I bet the Lord Henry Mystic, probably the Professor X kind of character,

1516
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:44,840
Nick Fury kind of sending probably sends Jason Chandler

1517
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:50,360
and either Barry O'Shea or Camelia Falco is like you two are going in this office.

1518
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:52,720
Albert, keep an eye on them.

1519
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:56,240
OK, so they have to like look out for each other or try to land

1520
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,600
maybe to keep the organization under wraps.

1521
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,080
Yeah, yeah.

1522
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:04,400
I mean, I think if you want to make your Lord Henry Mystic or other characters

1523
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:10,760
like not evil, you probably cut down on them taking stuff from different cultures.

1524
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:13,080
That would be my that would be my punch up.

1525
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:19,360
Henry Mystic is going to learn about people and maybe he gets gifted things at the end

1526
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:23,880
for, you know, sharing his wisdom and their exchange of ideas.

1527
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:26,040
And then he brings that back to his house.

1528
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:27,880
As a poor how about this?

1529
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:30,320
What if it's people who did who like went?

1530
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:36,040
All right. They know people who went and bought things fair and square

1531
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:38,120
at marketplaces.

1532
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:43,440
They put money into the local economies and then the sea people like Hightower.

1533
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:48,200
They all like wait for things to be brought back to like a block away

1534
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:51,840
from where they live and then they go like sneak into people's houses and steal them

1535
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:54,240
for them and act like they got it.

1536
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:59,280
And like I'm trying to pull Falco in this Falco woman.

1537
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:04,440
And if we want unredeemable FEMA, she could send that bird to go steal.

1538
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:05,760
You mean salty?

1539
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,360
No, no, no. Oh, the other the Falcon.

1540
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:14,400
Well, sorry, no, any anybody can send any of their animals to go steal gems

1541
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,520
and rubies from place, bring them back for their own.

1542
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,760
I want all the animals to be evil. Everybody's evil.

1543
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,880
OK, everyone's evil. Salty is the evilest of all.

1544
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:25,600
I realize. Did you guys come across Barnabas T. Bullion's assistant?

1545
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:29,600
Nope. Oh, no. Oh, baby.

1546
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:36,560
Here we go. Barnabas T. Bullion's assistant has a name and the name is Willikers.

1547
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,880
Well, now, come on.

1548
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:45,120
Now, Jason Sheridan could easily play Willikers, please.

1549
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,760
Oh, I would love to play both.

1550
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:51,800
And then there's a little jokes of like, I feel like I've met you before.

1551
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,760
Couldn't be me, sir.

1552
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,400
Listen to that voice. He just did. Couldn't be me.

1553
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,000
So it is very time accurate.

1554
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:03,760
Yeah, I've already spent much of quarantine

1555
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,840
growing a mustache, you know, halfway there.

1556
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,840
George getting getting curlier.

1557
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:11,360
Once you can get that thing to flip up, you can get any of these parts.

1558
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:14,120
And certainly Willikers. Willikers had a mustache.

1559
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:16,160
It was more of like a wild west.

1560
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,880
I can share a screen and show you what Willikers look like.

1561
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:24,160
He's, of course, one of my favorite characters in fiction immediately.

1562
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:27,920
Here he is. George.

1563
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:31,600
So his name is G Willikers. That is correct.

1564
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:33,520
That's pretty cute.

1565
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,120
Scott, is that too cute for you?

1566
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:38,400
I guess I can give it up for G Willikers.

1567
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:39,800
All right, Scott, that's official.

1568
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:43,040
Scott gives it up for G Willikers. That's fine. I give it up.

1569
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,800
We have talked a lot on this podcast about our characters cute,

1570
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:49,040
but we have not dissected a lot of is this phrase cute?

1571
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:53,520
And I think we all agree that that's a cute phrase.

1572
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:55,240
Sure. Yeah.

1573
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:58,040
And something we should say instead of profanities.

1574
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:01,200
G Willikers that tease me off.

1575
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,480
Yes, because we're members of Sun

1576
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:09,760
who are very nice and obedient and follow the rules against cursing.

1577
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:12,720
Sometimes there's the discussion.

1578
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:15,080
What episode of Pakistan do you start with?

1579
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:18,600
This one I can definitively say no, not this one.

1580
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:21,800
Do you start with the one with a bunch of lists of name?

1581
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:24,960
Even they themselves are in a group and then they make up a bunch of groups

1582
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,440
that they'd like to see.

1583
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:28,560
This is the episode of the most capital letters.

1584
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,680
This is three of the show is going to have.

1585
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,280
I think they count podcast listens by if you completed it.

1586
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:38,440
And this is going to have a maybe like a couple, ten,

1587
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,880
maybe ten at most who actually finished it.

1588
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:44,960
I think a normal people will start it in earnest and go, oh, I see.

1589
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,840
I'd love to learn more about it.

1590
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:49,240
They may be by the end of throwing their phone out the window.

1591
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:51,840
You two are fun. And this was demanded.

1592
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,320
We were demanded. We're few weeks.

1593
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:56,440
People thought we were going to drop what we're doing every week.

1594
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:58,680
Some news happens. Do you see?

1595
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:01,840
And we're sons of bitches.

1596
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:02,880
We will. Yeah.

1597
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,840
I mean, they wanted to hear us discuss the fact that Auntie's Beach House Kids

1598
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:12,240
Club in Alani has a reference to see because it has a letter from

1599
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:16,280
the letter Perkins that references sea member Harrison Hightower.

1600
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:21,720
So it's on Adventurers Club Stationary and it's on Adventurers Club Stationary.

1601
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:26,080
And that they had to hear that Professor Garrett Reed was seeking out

1602
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:29,240
a legendary set of jewels known as the Emerald Trinity,

1603
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:33,960
a set of jewels that was hidden at the altar of souls at the Temple of Immortality.

1604
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,040
I don't know what is any of that.

1605
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:39,160
And also, they would.

1606
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:42,400
The one thing to pull from all that, though, is this guy, Garrett Reed,

1607
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:46,080
this disgraced guy, he was he was looking for jewels.

1608
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:49,360
Right. Wonder what do you think you wanted to do with them jewels?

1609
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,760
Maybe you wanted to suck them jewels.

1610
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:56,360
Maybe maybe Garrett Reed wanted to be sucking those jewels.

1611
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:58,640
Now, hold on a minute.

1612
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:02,080
You have a problem with the sea continuity, but you're going back in podcast

1613
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,160
content. You don't think that's so fun?

1614
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:08,200
All kinds of people who like to suck them jewels.

1615
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:11,040
Bugsy is not a member of Sun.

1616
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:13,520
I can definitively say that.

1617
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,960
That's why we spar with him so much.

1618
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:19,680
He is a different. Yeah, he is in whatever our podcast

1619
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:23,080
canon evil group is bad.

1620
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:28,000
It's it's Nick Mundy and Bugsy in a different group.

1621
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:33,440
And according to listener feedback, Jesse

1622
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:34,920
Jesse Farrar.

1623
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:39,680
Because he said once he doesn't like theme parks,

1624
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:42,760
he's now the biggest villain in the history of the show.

1625
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:44,960
It is a fearsome group, the injustice.

1626
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:47,480
I like for now. Right now, I'm calling them the injustice gang,

1627
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:50,400
which is the name of the DC villains.

1628
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:52,280
But we'll punch that up at a certain point.

1629
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:54,480
Wait, if it's big, Jason, it was bad, right?

1630
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:57,080
So is that how do we let's figure that out?

1631
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:00,280
Boys against decency.

1632
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,600
Oh, yes. Very good. Wow. Fantastic.

1633
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,520
We can say Disney, but that limits it too much.

1634
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,280
Yeah, boys against decency. Yeah, yeah.

1635
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:09,800
OK, great. So we have Sun and bad.

1636
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:15,600
Sun wars with bad bumper car boys are definitely

1637
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:18,880
part of Adams. I'm still scared we're going to meet them one day.

1638
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:22,120
Yes, we really know this episode should just be us

1639
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:26,920
unleashing every dumb piece of canon we have on the audience

1640
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:28,800
to really see.

1641
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,240
Let's see if we can get them to turn it off.

1642
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:32,200
Let's see.

1643
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,200
Let's see.

1644
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:37,040
Let's see if we can.

1645
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,400
Let's see. OK, what else?

1646
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:41,040
What other facts for first of all, do I have here?

1647
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,760
Oh, the United Kingdom Pavilion has a reference to see.

1648
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,760
It's got the hand of the fake handbook. Yes.

1649
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:48,640
Has the fake handbook. Yes, of course.

1650
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,280
We mean fake. What does that mean?

1651
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:52,440
What it's a bookshelf.

1652
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:55,320
It's like a peanut ceramic bookshelf and they paint.

1653
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:59,160
There's a lot of fake books in Skipper canteen written by

1654
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:02,200
C members or their fezzes, their ceremony.

1655
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:05,640
And the book is fake in that like everything's fake in a theme park

1656
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:09,680
or that are people writing fake books in canon?

1657
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:14,040
No, it's that. Well, it's it's books within the universe,

1658
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:17,680
but we perceive them just as like ceramic or plaster.

1659
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:21,160
OK, we perceive them.

1660
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:25,760
This is like that. What are what is tune stuff made of again?

1661
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:31,360
Yeah, our tune is our tune items and chairs soft or not?

1662
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:34,520
Well, or or their actual books like I can't picture it.

1663
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:38,560
It's actual books they bought at like an estate sale and then painted over

1664
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:41,880
for it to be like more of a prop. Right.

1665
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:44,000
An actual book.

1666
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,440
I think everyone should say the last things

1667
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:50,720
that are fun to them on their list of things.

1668
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:53,920
And then we should.

1669
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:54,760
Then we should.

1670
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:56,320
Mike has a wrestling.

1671
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:59,840
Yeah, Scott, blame it on my wrestling for the reason you want to get out of here.

1672
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:01,720
We do have a time cap.

1673
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:03,840
I will say, you know, this is such a condensed.

1674
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:06,080
This is such a condensed amount of information.

1675
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,560
The listener really should not have to listen to it for two hours.

1676
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,880
So I'm going through and seeing.

1677
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:13,280
We really didn't talk about Magellan's,

1678
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:16,120
which is the restaurant in Disney Sea, which I did.

1679
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:17,920
OK, here's how stupid I am.

1680
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:19,480
I did not eat at Magellan's.

1681
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:20,920
I did not really explore it.

1682
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:25,480
I didn't even realize there was a whole crazy underground thing by Mount Prometheus,

1683
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:28,280
which is like another thing that's kind of like,

1684
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:32,160
what would you call it, an explorer, an area to explore.

1685
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:36,960
There's a thing called the Chamber of Planets, which just watching the video

1686
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:41,160
is this cool, like observatory type thing that looks very expansive.

1687
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:44,160
And I go, what the fuck was it? Where did I miss this?

1688
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,280
I was there when in this.

1689
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:48,880
There's like a thing that there's a place with a lot of optical illusions

1690
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:52,440
and little like models and boats to play with.

1691
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,320
I think I did this.

1692
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:57,360
I miss this and I'm looking through it and it's like, this is so cool,

1693
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:59,040
whether it's even tied to sea or not.

1694
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:06,880
So, yeah, so looking on the other's various YouTube videos to see just sort of how much

1695
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:12,200
cool stuff, again, without the actual sea back story is associated

1696
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:15,800
is impressive, and it's not all fake books is my point.

1697
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:19,360
This is all Tokyo Disney is the is responsible.

1698
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:24,720
We maybe haven't said that the Tokyo the when Tokyo Disney Sea came into being,

1699
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:28,120
that's where they they planted the seeds of this, maybe when that without a plan

1700
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:29,720
to tie it all together.

1701
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:32,760
But this and this notion of this organization started there

1702
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:35,720
and it's only grown and grown. Yeah.

1703
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:39,680
Yeah. And those those imagineers that are drawn in some of the Mystic

1704
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:43,680
Banner portraits, Rob Coltrane and Joe Lance Acero,

1705
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:47,560
I think were some of the big like drivers of like, you know, they were

1706
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:51,960
they were working on this stuff and they're like, oh, let's connect it to this stuff.

1707
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:54,960
And so some of the early proponents.

1708
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:59,400
There is an immense amount of cool stuff that's been done in the parks

1709
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:05,280
in this genre, sort of like it did adventure explorative.

1710
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:09,480
I think some of the best stuff Disney's done recently is in this war.

1711
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:13,720
So it is a nice tribute to, you know, to all these great attractions

1712
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:16,360
that have come into being since 2001.

1713
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:19,920
And I did find it cool when when, yeah, when you're in that area

1714
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:23,800
that the in Tokyo, Disney Sea or in the birthplace of sea,

1715
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:25,840
that's where this whole weird mythology started.

1716
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,320
And I did think, oh, that's cool.

1717
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:30,280
I came all the way to Tokyo and there's a little outpost of this thing.

1718
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:33,000
And then there's you could go to Florida and see some of it.

1719
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,200
It is like a weird little like collect them all.

1720
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:38,280
You know, I have to experience every facet.

1721
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:40,360
It rewards your world traveling.

1722
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,600
If you go to all these parks across the globe.

1723
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,400
And it is it is nice.

1724
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:47,800
And as much as I said, like, I don't want it to like swallow up everything.

1725
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:50,800
It is nice because it's not in your face.

1726
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:54,000
It's not like you have to take a little quiz on what Barnabas

1727
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
T. Bullion's intentions were before you get on Big Thunder Mountain.

1728
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:00,920
So it is choose your own level of getting involved with it.

1729
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,840
It's like, you notice it, you want to read all the plaques

1730
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,560
and you enjoy that you can.

1731
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:09,760
But it's not it's not a necessity as far as getting on these rides

1732
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:12,880
or or eating a quick service meal.

1733
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:16,520
Yeah. And there's like there's an interview with Lance

1734
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:20,200
Ossera where he talks about like creating this universe,

1735
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:23,960
creating this believable backstory and a world history.

1736
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:26,000
And it's fun, but it's got a purpose.

1737
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:30,000
And it's just kind of like to help them while they're making the attraction,

1738
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,240
like flesh out the world a little and like inspire other ideas to like,

1739
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:38,480
you know, make the attraction feel more fleshed out and lived in.

1740
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:41,920
Yeah. So we like see, I think we do like.

1741
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:44,880
Don't get us wrong.

1742
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:49,360
Yes, it will be very interesting to see it adapted for.

1743
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:54,560
Yeah. Streaming TV because theme park adaptations are like

1744
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:57,560
so hit and miss for the most part, you know.

1745
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:01,040
And yeah, and like I just all really the only question is,

1746
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:03,400
how hot will the members of CB?

1747
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:05,680
That's the only question I have.

1748
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:08,160
And I'd like them to turn the dial up on it.

1749
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:10,960
It can't be Riverdale level I get, but but I want.

1750
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:13,520
Yes, as hot as possible, please.

1751
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,120
Get casting.

1752
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:19,920
Let's keep like maximum age on any of these people.

1753
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:21,480
Twenty four. Right.

1754
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:26,760
Yes. Before you have before skin starts to degrade like it does on my face.

1755
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:29,440
Well, it depends on who's consulting.

1756
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:32,320
Is it the Lucas film doctors or is it the Marvel doctors?

1757
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:34,800
Because Star Wars universe, a little grittier, a little dirtier.

1758
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:38,760
And that feels more appropriate for like a world adventuring,

1759
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:41,680
like dusty kind of world.

1760
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:43,920
But the Marvel is very glossy.

1761
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,360
Yeah. Well, let's see.

1762
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:50,040
Feige is Kevin Feige is only making 12 shows and five movies a year.

1763
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:51,600
I think he can oversee it yet.

1764
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,760
It's another cinematic universe here.

1765
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:55,760
So maybe and he's a big look.

1766
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:57,360
Ken Feige is a big parks fan.

1767
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:59,600
I know this is a fact.

1768
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:01,920
So I think he probably would be interested in getting in here

1769
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:06,840
and having to produce another 10 series a year and five films.

1770
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:09,160
So, yeah, why not?

1771
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:11,320
Why not put more on the man's plate?

1772
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:13,680
Let's do it. And Kevin, come on the show as well.

1773
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:15,720
Come on the show.

1774
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:20,000
And if you do, you will meet the obvious choice to play.

1775
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:25,960
G will occurs and what smell smell this smelding.

1776
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:30,640
All right. He's going to be both and new character created by Scott

1777
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:32,440
earlier in the episode I.P.

1778
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:34,760
Freely, the toilet magnet.

1779
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:39,600
Jason Sheridan is I.P.

1780
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,440
Freely. Sure.

1781
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:47,120
I dream of a place where there are no limits placed on where I urinate.

1782
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:50,120
And if if you want to know, is I.P.

1783
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:54,800
Freely on a cycle of HGH and a cycle of steroids, the answer is fuck. Yeah.

1784
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:59,240
He is huge. Jason Sheridan is huge.

1785
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:01,080
Oh, yeah, sure.

1786
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:04,800
Well, not again, just as long as the doctor is overseeing everything.

1787
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,360
You know, it is OK.

1788
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:08,000
Yeah. Yeah. Doctor feel good.

1789
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,400
Is it? Yeah.

1790
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:17,200
All right. You survived podcast, the ride, dense mythology edition.

1791
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:21,440
I have a headache. I have a headache.

1792
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:25,640
We'll try to present supplementary materials and visuals.

1793
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:28,720
You can understand everything that was just said somewhere

1794
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:31,800
on our social media between Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

1795
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,960
And for three, if you're adventurous enough for three bonus episodes a month,

1796
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:42,120
go to let set your compass to the second gate at podcast at patreon dot com

1797
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:45,040
slash podcast, the ride.

1798
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:50,480
Well, gentlemen, another successful meeting of sun has commenced.

1799
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:54,800
Let's do the sun official goodbye phrase.

1800
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:56,800
Is it just congolous?

1801
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,400
It is. It is congolous, please.

1802
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:03,160
Or like what's more polite?

1803
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:05,640
Congolous, if that's OK with you.

1804
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:07,760
I'm sorry. I have to.

1805
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:09,760
I'm sorry.

1806
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:12,200
I have to check with my mom.

1807
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:14,600
I need to get permission first.

1808
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:15,440
We have permissions.

1809
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:17,480
We have to get permission slips to do each podcast.

1810
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:18,960
Did you guys know that?

1811
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:22,040
Oh, shoot.

1812
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:24,080
We're doing. It would be best to keep everything orderly.

1813
