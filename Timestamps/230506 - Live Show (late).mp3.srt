1
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Warning.

2
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:06,880
The following second live podcast of the night is presented at the devilishly late start time

3
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,240
of 10 p.m.

4
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,880
The two hosts who are exhausted fathers may abruptly collapse and go to sleep right on

5
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:23,640
the stage.

6
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:31,400
The same goes for the childless host who just loves to nap.

7
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:38,700
And now because the Pete Davidson hosted SNL was canceled, only we get to say, live from

8
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:55,780
New York, it's Saturday night!

9
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:06,140
Audio isn't working!

10
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,660
Just imagine a theme song.

11
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,300
Yeah, the audio isn't, folks, the audio isn't working.

12
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,300
What's happening?

13
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,340
Okay, give us a minute.

14
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,940
We're excited to see you and I hope that you're excited to see us, but we are gonna need, we're

15
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,460
gonna need, we gotta hear the theme, right?

16
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,460
This show isn't a show without the theme.

17
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,460
That's right, everyone agrees.

18
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:34,580
Well, it wouldn't be a live show without a technical snafu immediately at the top.

19
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,540
Did I spill like pudding on this?

20
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,540
I mean, if I was gonna...

21
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:43,060
Ah, the old DeSantis trick.

22
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:48,580
My hero Ron fingers pudding and he gets it on his devices.

23
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,700
Whoa, 10 p.m., already getting a finger in there.

24
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,180
I put my fingers in the pudding, but that's not the kind of thing we should be saying

25
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,180
to our children.

26
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,180
I'm fingering the pudding.

27
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,180
I don't know.

28
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,180
We're gonna figure it out.

29
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,180
Well, that's why it was so good.

30
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,180
That's why you don't DeSantis is because...

31
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,180
Yes, there it is!

32
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:38,180
That was a high energy and intentional opening.

33
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:47,180
Oh my gosh, everybody, welcome to Podcast The Ride.

34
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,180
Hello to all of you here.

35
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,180
Hello to the live streamers.

36
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,180
Podcast The Ride, the late show.

37
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:01,180
Hosted by a bunch of adults who think it's fun to stay up late and make dirty jokes.

38
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:11,180
But actually, that could never compare to the simple innocent pleasures of a plot of grass.

39
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:23,180
Your response to that shows me that you listen to the show because otherwise you might think,

40
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,180
what is this attitude from this host?

41
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,180
I hate this.

42
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,180
If people didn't listen to the show and they came to the show, they would be furious.

43
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,180
It's so alienated.

44
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:38,180
There's like 2,000 people on the planet Earth who know what any of this is.

45
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,180
And that's why we do these things to get them all into one room.

46
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,180
Yeah!

47
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,180
Which is so cool to do.

48
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,180
Thank you so much for coming out and staying up late with us too.

49
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,180
I'm Scott Gertner.

50
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,180
Hi.

51
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,180
Let's go this way.

52
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,180
I'm Jason Chardon.

53
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,180
The name's Mike Carlson.

54
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,180
Thank you.

55
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:07,180
That was kind of like the, you're the Tin Man thing.

56
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,180
We met you on a dusty trail.

57
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,180
Trying something new.

58
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,180
If I clicked my heels too.

59
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,180
Whoa, that's pretty good.

60
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,180
My name is Mike Carlson.

61
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,180
You did it.

62
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,180
We all discovered that you can...

63
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,180
Like oil.

64
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,180
I think I was doing the scarecrow there, just actually not the Tin Man.

65
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

66
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,180
What would you rather be?

67
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,180
Wait, no, Tin Man moves worse, but scarecrow moves weirder.

68
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,180
Is there a...

69
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,180
Yeah, but it's fun.

70
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,180
It's like...

71
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,180
What would you rather be?

72
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,180
Because it's flexible.

73
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,180
It's flexibility.

74
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,180
I asked Lindsay this the other day.

75
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,180
Is anyone's favorite not the scarecrow?

76
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,180
Audience could tell us.

77
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,180
I don't know.

78
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,180
There's got to be some cowardly lion heads out there.

79
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,180
Just yell out who you like.

80
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,180
Yeah.

81
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,180
I guess.

82
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,180
What about scary trees?

83
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,180
Or is anyone...

84
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,180
Get away from me.

85
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,180
Get away, girl.

86
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,180
People like them better than the three.

87
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,180
Yeah, yeah.

88
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,180
I root for them.

89
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,180
I hope they throw...

90
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:19,180
This guy throws so many apples that this gang of idiots, they fall over and stop their quest.

91
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:26,180
Is anyone a fan of TikTok or Jack Pumpkinhead from Return to Oz over the original three?

92
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:34,180
We can eventually find something where no one agrees with the premise of what I'm asking.

93
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,180
You shut out a lot of the hosts there, I think.

94
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,180
Yeah.

95
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,180
They won't see it.

96
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,180
They won't watch it.

97
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,180
Wait, the movie?

98
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,180
I'll watch it.

99
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,180
Wait a minute.

100
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,180
I don't think that's ever come to...

101
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,180
They're refusing.

102
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,180
That's never truly come to a head.

103
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,180
No, Mike, we lost a mind.

104
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,180
Mike, we lost a mind.

105
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,180
Who this man?

106
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,180
Yeah, get him.

107
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,180
No, no, we'd love to watch it.

108
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,180
We just turned down watching it with you.

109
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,180
No.

110
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,180
Didn't want to come to your house.

111
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,180
But you didn't.

112
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,180
But you said you would watch the Franco one with me.

113
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,180
Of course.

114
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,180
Oh, anytime.

115
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,180
What?

116
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,180
Obviously.

117
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,180
That supersedes...

118
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,180
Yeah.

119
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,180
I'll go anywhere anytime.

120
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,180
Any weird house to watch.

121
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,180
Any land.

122
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,180
Any land of Oz with James.

123
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,180
Yeah.

124
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,180
Almost built at Disneyland, supposedly.

125
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,180
That's that weird...

126
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,180
Look, Scott, I know all about it.

127
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

128
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,180
I'm telling them.

129
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,180
But that's not...

130
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,180
They know, too.

131
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,180
They also know all about it.

132
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,180
How many people here know the unbuilt plans for the Franco-Oz land?

133
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,180
Pretty good.

134
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,180
You had to pay...

135
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,180
It was on the Season Pass podcast.

136
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,180
You had to pay like a dollar or two to hear Tony Baxter explain what it was going to be.

137
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,180
And I paid.

138
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,180
Even though we know Season Pass host Doug Barnes.

139
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,180
I can text him right now.

140
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,180
Whoa.

141
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,180
Whoa, dude.

142
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,180
You're a good man.

143
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,180
You're a good man.

144
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,180
You're a big...

145
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,180
Imagine that alternate reality where it's like, oh, yeah, they expanded Disneyland.

146
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,180
Oh, what did they build?

147
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,180
Like Star Wars or something?

148
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:06,180
No, it's the Sam Raimi, James Franco Oz movie.

149
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,180
It would have been Where Galaxies End.

150
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,180
Exactly.

151
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,180
It would have knocked that out of being a possibility.

152
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,180
Sorry.

153
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,180
It's Oz now.

154
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,180
And the bad Oz.

155
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,180
It's not even the good.

156
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,180
Oh, yeah, because you might go, oh, Oz.

157
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,180
No, no, no.

158
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,180
Stop thinking that.

159
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,180
If they were green lighting everything, they would have the bad Oz.

160
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:31,180
They would have had the Lone Ranger, the most cursed movie of all time.

161
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,180
And then Tomorrowland would have been retrofitted to look like the movie Tomorrowland.

162
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,180
The coolest movie of all time.

163
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,180
Did you do the...

164
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,180
I need to hang loose.

165
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,180
Wow.

166
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,180
Well, that's what tonight's all about is hanging loose.

167
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,180
Loosey-goosey, baby.

168
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,180
Yeah, because we've never done this before.

169
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,180
We've never done the second show after the first show.

170
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,180
How many people were at the first show?

171
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,180
Wow.

172
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,180
Wow.

173
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,180
Geez, they...

174
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,180
Oh, yes, I see a Frank Marshall mask.

175
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,180
Oh, Buffett's here.

176
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,180
Hey.

177
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,180
Isersky.

178
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,180
Oh, this is really helpful, actually.

179
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,180
To be fair, they could have brought those from home.

180
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,180
It's possible.

181
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,180
It would have been a...

182
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,180
Oh my God, I think almost all the mask holders potentially...

183
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,180
Wow.

184
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,180
That gives away the...

185
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,180
We did a big finale, kind of a phantasmic style finale.

186
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,180
I'm just going to spoil the other show.

187
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,180
You'll experience it at some point.

188
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,180
But we did that because the first show was about the Mark Twain.

189
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,180
Jason Stream.

190
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,180
Jason was a little captain.

191
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,180
You'll see her here later.

192
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,180
Little captain.

193
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,180
Little captain.

194
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,180
And that's...

195
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,180
A little.

196
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,180
A little.

197
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,180
A little.

198
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,180
A little.

199
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,180
But, you know, that's a pretty...

200
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,180
That's a wholesome topic right there, right?

201
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,180
That's a heartwarming, all-American topic.

202
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,180
And that's what you do at 7.30.

203
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,180
But here at 10, we can...

204
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,180
As you said, we can get loosey and goosey.

205
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,180
Bye-bye, safe harbor hours.

206
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:10,180
Chubby waters for us now.

207
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,180
Oh, yeah.

208
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,180
It's later.

209
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,180
It's looser.

210
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,180
We can get a little more effed up.

211
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,180
Yeah.

212
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,180
Not loose enough to say the curse.

213
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,180
Don't do it.

214
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,180
We're still...

215
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,180
Look, we're good boys, ultimately.

216
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,180
Scott, can I ask a question?

217
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:31,180
Has anyone here tonight consumed any adult libations?

218
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,180
Oh.

219
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,180
Oh.

220
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,180
Oh.

221
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,180
Oh.

222
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,180
Oh, my.

223
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,180
Okay, all right.

224
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,180
Anyway...

225
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,180
Well, I mean, I don't...

226
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:44,180
Look, I don't know if we condone this kind of behavior, but can I ask, is anyone here...

227
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,180
Would you describe your current state as...

228
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,180
Amory?

229
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,180
And the answer...

230
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,180
And nobody even faked applause.

231
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,180
No, no, no.

232
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,180
No one is actually...

233
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,180
Well, that's what this is all about.

234
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,180
Tonight is about getting a little wild, but maybe not that wild.

235
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,180
So maybe not that wild.

236
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,180
Still being polite, still being parts of polite society.

237
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,180
That's what we're doing.

238
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,180
Because this is no ordinary show.

239
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:14,180
This is Podcast the Ride, Body After Dark.

240
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,180
Body After Dark.

241
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,180
Yeah.

242
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,180
Nice.

243
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,180
Yeah.

244
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,180
Ooh.

245
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,180
Ooh.

246
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,180
Sintillating locos.

247
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,180
Oh.

248
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,180
That's right.

249
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,180
This is gonna get a little nuts.

250
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,180
We might...

251
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,180
Hey, you know, this is no rated G show.

252
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,180
We might get a little PG-13.

253
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,180
Although even like...

254
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,180
I don't know.

255
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:49,180
I mean, you get like the sex talk happens, you know, often around like 10, 11, 12.

256
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,180
Let's say PG-12.

257
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,180
10, actually.

258
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,180
Let's say 10.

259
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,180
Yeah.

260
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,180
Because 13 might be overshoot.

261
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,180
If you have actual kids, maybe they shouldn't be here.

262
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,180
Although even for part of it, they probably still could.

263
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,180
Mm-hmm.

264
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:04,180
We're gonna ramp up to the sex talk.

265
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,180
Perhaps a live sex talk.

266
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:15,180
When I say sex talk, I mean we're gonna bring out a teacher.

267
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:20,180
And they're going to explain how it works.

268
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:26,180
Because believe it or not, some of us don't know.

269
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,180
I won't say who.

270
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,180
Some of us have children, but it was artificial.

271
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,180
Didn't want to get too bawdy.

272
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:37,180
I got knocked out and nine months later a child showed up.

273
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,180
You still don't know.

274
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,180
You got a lot to learn.

275
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,180
Well, we'll learn all about it tonight.

276
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,180
Yeah, you know, like we can get a little...

277
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,180
We can get crazy here, you know?

278
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,180
We can finally speak our minds.

279
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,180
Because this is not gonna be a...

280
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,180
A phrase that's always comfortable.

281
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,180
Yeah.

282
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,180
Yeah.

283
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,180
Careful, careful.

284
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,180
You know something good's coming after that, right?

285
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,180
Because it's just us in this room, right?

286
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,180
We might not even put this out as a podcast or not for a while.

287
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:10,180
So the only way we could get canceled for what happens here tonight

288
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,180
is I guess the live stream, if they said anything,

289
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,180
or if you all talked or treated about it.

290
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,180
Plus people here tonight, you know?

291
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,180
Yeah, or if anyone confronted us about it in any way after the fact,

292
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,180
we would immediately buckle and apologize.

293
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,180
Sure.

294
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,180
But besides that, we're getting wild.

295
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,180
We're getting really wild here.

296
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,180
Yeah.

297
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,180
Yeah, we're ready to do it.

298
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,180
I think you guys are ready to do it, right?

299
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,180
Yeah.

300
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,180
I'm just gonna slip into something more comfortable real quick.

301
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,180
Hold on one second.

302
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,180
Bye some time.

303
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,180
Oh my.

304
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,180
Also a great prelude, that phrase.

305
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,180
Oh my.

306
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,180
Wow.

307
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,180
Off comes the Sonic sweater.

308
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,180
Wow, he's actually, oh my God.

309
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,180
Wait a minute.

310
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,180
Don't look.

311
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,180
Don't look.

312
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,180
Don't look.

313
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,180
Don't look.

314
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,180
Why are you actually taking your shirt off?

315
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,180
Don't look.

316
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,180
Don't look.

317
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,180
No, no, no.

318
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,180
And it's taking forever.

319
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,180
Don't look.

320
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,180
Don't look.

321
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:19,180
There was a way where you just kept the t-shirt on.

322
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,180
Let's make that.

323
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,180
Wow.

324
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:34,180
Look, I did sketch comedy on stage for free for years.

325
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,180
I've been on stage without my shirt on before.

326
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,180
But now you're making a pay for it.

327
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:45,180
You want the sweet meat?

328
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,180
Oh, regrets.

329
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,180
Regrets immediately.

330
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:53,180
Wait, you're in a bathrobe, but what kind of bathrobe specifically?

331
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:59,180
Oh, this is the official Hollywood Tower Hotel bathrobe.

332
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,180
There was a point to this.

333
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,180
I wasn't just being a massive weirdo for no reason.

334
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,180
I was being a weirdo for a purpose.

335
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,180
Thank you.

336
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:15,180
That is a, I will say this, the texture of that bathrobe, unpleasant.

337
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,180
How do you know?

338
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,180
How do I know?

339
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,180
Because I was probably there when he bought it.

340
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,180
You were there.

341
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,180
Yeah, so we both touched it ad nauseum.

342
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,180
Why did you have to do that?

343
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,180
Well, take a look.

344
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,180
When you're going through clothes you don't like to touch and see.

345
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:40,180
I don't do it for my friend.

346
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,180
Excuse me.

347
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,180
I'm buying a robe.

348
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,180
Would you come along?

349
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,180
I really need a second opinion about the texture.

350
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:51,180
We were there to ride the ride.

351
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,180
And it just so happened, yes, I touched a robe he was thinking about purchasing.

352
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,180
Wow, so you and this robe have a history.

353
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,180
Yeah, I know the robe very well.

354
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:06,180
You know the robe, because at the time I was making like $12 an hour at that shitty post-production house job,

355
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:10,180
so I was really agonizing over a $70 Bap, Bap Barf robe.

356
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,180
$70.

357
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,180
Maybe the most frivolous purchase you've ever made.

358
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:18,180
Probably, to this day.

359
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:26,180
If you discussed jobs where you weren't happy with your earnings twice in the first 15 minutes.

360
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,180
Let's see, let's get through all of them.

361
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,180
$12 an hour and also nothing.

362
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,180
Yeah, no, nothing's not good.

363
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,180
Look, that's why WGA is strong, right?

364
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,180
We don't want no more.

365
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,180
There!

366
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:43,180
I turned it into an elevated thing and not something petty.

367
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:50,180
Okay, I hope, please continue to like cheering, because there's a little extra space on the stage,

368
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:54,180
and that's because we have a guest this evening.

369
00:22:54,180 --> 00:23:02,180
Unlike the previous show, you late night freaks are gonna get a little extra something special,

370
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:08,180
and this is a guy who fits right in with the body affairs of this evening.

371
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:12,180
Let me tell you how slightly risque this guy gets.

372
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:22,180
He has this nickname that he goes by that contains the name of an intimate, but not necessarily sexual position.

373
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:28,180
Yeah, that's right. They call this guy the Spoon Man.

374
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:37,180
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up from Doughboys, give it up for Mike the Spoon Man, Mitchell!

375
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:47,180
Hey! Hi, bud.

376
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,180
Oh my god.

377
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:55,180
I came horny.

378
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,180
Been prepping all afternoon and evening.

379
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:04,180
I'm ready to go, ready for any hole Disney has to offer.

380
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:09,180
Backstage you were like, come on guys, I'm ready now, I want to go now, let's go now.

381
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,180
Let's do this. I'm actually truly very hungover, I told you this.

382
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,180
Oh yeah, yeah. Indeed, cool, cool, cool.

383
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,180
Worth it?

384
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:22,180
I'm very excited to be here, this is great, the live crowd here, the dynasty type right, is that where we are?

385
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,180
Yeah, that's great.

386
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,180
It's the Hayworth by Dynast.

387
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,180
Did you think we were at the Elysian?

388
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:33,180
I truly, I was like, all I have to do today is go to this show, and I was laying around,

389
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:41,180
and I ordered two subs from Jersey Mike's, and then I finally crawl out of my couch, and I came here, I made it, I'm here, and I'm excited.

390
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,180
Yes, that's the victory.

391
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:53,180
And, so sad that Disney doesn't have an animatronic Johnny Depp and an animatronic James Franco.

392
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,180
That would be so, oh man.

393
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,180
And an animatronic Armie Hammer.

394
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:10,180
Man, and just an animatronic lacer at the front, waving to people, give me a hug.

395
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,180
Do people know that? That's a known thing.

396
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,180
Yeah, that's a pretty known thing at this point, Mitch.

397
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,180
Yeah, yeah.

398
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,180
Do they know the diaper stuff? Am I going too deep now?

399
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,180
Yeah, that could be a little deep.

400
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,180
Wait, does that sound familiar to anyone?

401
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:31,180
No, there's so many guys that diaper could refer to.

402
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:36,180
People are going to be asking so many questions.

403
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:41,180
I said, I might wear a diaper, he maybe used to wear diapers. Anyways.

404
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:48,180
The four podcasters on stage are wearing diapers, apparently.

405
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:52,180
I'm so happy you could be here to give people exclusive...

406
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:55,180
Behind the Scenes Hollywood shit.

407
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,180
Yeah, that's right. You're a real Hollywood insider.

408
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,180
I'm a Hollywood, I'm like a TMZ guy.

409
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:05,180
I love to get the scoops, I love to let the people know them.

410
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,180
Body is a very funny word.

411
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:14,180
It's a word I haven't heard since my grandma died, I feel like.

412
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:18,180
Well, here's how Body started on the podcast.

413
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:22,180
Some people know this. I misused the word body.

414
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:30,180
I used body to describe King Kong's banana bread.

415
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,180
What did you think the definition was?

416
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:39,180
I thought it was a little bit of a lewd gag or an act.

417
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:43,180
I didn't know it was specifically sexual in nature.

418
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:47,180
Because you were making the argument that it's...

419
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,180
Because he's burping.

420
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:55,180
It's rude. Body means rude to me five years ago.

421
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:02,180
I think you know that I'm happy to keep a five-year-old argument up in the air.

422
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,180
As long as possible.

423
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,180
I was thinking about this, and it didn't occur to me then.

424
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:11,180
He's not burping. That's not burping. He was breathing.

425
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:16,180
If you smell garlic on someone's breath, they might be breathing it at you.

426
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,180
And even if it was burping, what would the problem be?

427
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:22,180
Well, it's still rude.

428
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:29,180
If you've been eating so many bananas that when you talk to a person that's 50 feet away...

429
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,180
And you can smell bananas on them, it's kind of rude to not know.

430
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,180
Unless you have a problem, like a deviated septum or something.

431
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:40,180
Mike, it's a monkey. It's what he's supposed to do is eat bananas.

432
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,180
I'm confused by the banana part.

433
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:47,180
There's a part in Kong where he eats a lot of bananas and then you smell his breath.

434
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:51,180
No, this is his headcanon. This is Mike's backstory.

435
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:55,180
Well, what else happened in the story of the ride, Jason? He ate a bunch of bananas.

436
00:27:55,180 --> 00:28:00,180
Yeah, I would also say that his destruction of the city was also kind of rude.

437
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:07,180
It was body. He destroyed the city and it was body.

438
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:12,180
Mitch, if you went on the tram tour, the robot version, not the screen version,

439
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:17,180
when you went by, you could smell bananas on his breath.

440
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,180
Oh, right.

441
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:22,180
Yeah, it used to be like, oh, you go by him, you smell the bananas,

442
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:26,180
and now you go on the ride and he breaks a T-Rex neck in half.

443
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,180
He kills.

444
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,180
There's no banana smell anymore?

445
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,180
No, I don't believe there's any.

446
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,180
Saving it for the Minions ride, I'm guessing.

447
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,180
That's true.

448
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,180
Do you smell bananas? I think there's a fart gun in play at some point.

449
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,180
There's a fart gun, yeah, for sure.

450
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,180
Which feels body.

451
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,180
Also, a little body.

452
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:47,180
Maybe we should consult the dictionary definition.

453
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,180
Please.

454
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:55,180
Dealing with sexual matters in a comical way, humorously indecent.

455
00:28:55,180 --> 00:29:00,180
Now, humorously, I think, is key, because anytime something body has come up,

456
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:04,180
Mike, you have acted as if it should be stricken from all public records.

457
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,180
Some people find this stuff humorous.

458
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:11,180
Okay, so this is an important distinction, I feel,

459
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:20,180
because there's certain things, like, Chase Meridian from Batman Forever,

460
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:26,180
when she makes innuendo towards Batman, sometimes it's body,

461
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,180
but then sometimes when she's just fully coming onto him, it's not body,

462
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:32,180
it's more straightforward, it's not humorous.

463
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,180
Can I say that most of the people on the stage and in the audience

464
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:40,180
don't remember all of Chase Meridian's lines as well as you do?

465
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,180
As well as you do.

466
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,180
But do they remember her eyes as well?

467
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,180
As I do.

468
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,180
This one also, this is Nicole Kidman in...

469
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:56,180
Oh, yes, I remember Nicole Kidman's in Batman, and she does something body at one point?

470
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:01,180
Well, she's exceptionally horny for Batman, and she kind of touches him,

471
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,180
and it's even, like, Michelle Pfeiffer is really horny,

472
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:07,180
but it feels almost less overt to me.

473
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,180
Chase Meridian is like me, number top, taking the jacket off,

474
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,180
I can't even say what happens.

475
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:19,180
You would say the character in the big leather suit is less over?

476
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,180
Who the fuck is Chase Meridian?

477
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,180
Who is Chase Meridian?

478
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:29,180
She's a psychologist in Batman Forever, and she's evaluating Bruce Wayne,

479
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,180
because he's obviously dealing with psychological problems.

480
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,180
Does she turn into another character that I maybe know her more as,

481
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,180
or is it Chase Meridian?

482
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,180
She just gets more amorous as the movie goes on.

483
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:44,180
She's only in this, it's in Batman Forever, and Mike saw it at a certain age,

484
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:48,180
a certain influential age, and Mike talks about it a lot

485
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,180
for being the one who's concerned about bodiness.

486
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:56,180
Now, let me tell you, when I leave here, I go back home,

487
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:00,180
the first thing I am going to Google is Chase Meridian,

488
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,180
and then click that video tab and see what comes up.

489
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,180
I'm excited to see it, but I mean, everyone kind of gets turned on

490
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,180
by the Batman suit, right?

491
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,180
I think that's the power of the Batman suit.

492
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,180
I guess that's true.

493
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,180
Who doesn't in the movies get turned on by the Batman suit?

494
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:23,180
Mr. Freeze, Two-Face, The Ripper, Commissioner Gordon.

495
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:26,180
No, I think Commissioner Gordon loves the Batman suit.

496
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,180
Okay.

497
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,180
I think Mr. Freeze, you can make an argument,

498
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,180
I'm excited by the Batman suit.

499
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,180
Max Shrek?

500
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:39,180
Max Shrek's dumb son.

501
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,180
Maybe not Bane, Bane might not get that excited either.

502
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,180
Yeah, Bane doesn't get it, he's just excited always.

503
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,180
Well, see though, when he started the prep, maybe he didn't go into that fight

504
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:52,180
thinking, I'm going to break his back, maybe he was hoping for some action.

505
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,180
His neck, his back.

506
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,180
Yeah.

507
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,180
I'm going to keep it clean, it's the body, it's not...

508
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,180
Yeah, it's body, it's not to the right point.

509
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:09,180
Yeah, we'll stop it if it gets too out there, if it gets too...

510
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,180
I'll break your neck, your back.

511
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,180
It's just funny picturing him singing it.

512
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,180
Was that the Tom Hardy Bane?

513
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,180
Yeah, it was very bad.

514
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,180
Do Tom Hardy Bane again.

515
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:29,180
I'll break your neck, your back, your pussy and your crap.

516
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,180
Nice.

517
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:35,180
This is why we need Mitch here, because he'll go all the way with it.

518
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:38,180
He's going further than the good boys will go.

519
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:41,180
If I think of something dirty, I'm going to go around and whisper it in your ear.

520
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:44,180
Please, please do.

521
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:52,180
I want everyone here to rock hard by the end of the show.

522
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:58,180
I can't wait until we see Daisy Duck in a pretty sweater or some bullshit.

523
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,180
Oh yes, you have no idea.

524
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:07,180
Let's explain what we're doing exactly, what Body After Dark is.

525
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:17,180
And the other reason for Mitch to be here, an outsider, somebody who will go past PG-13 barely slightly.

526
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,180
We're going to have you do...

527
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,180
You are here to be a...

528
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,180
Sorry.

529
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,180
He doesn't even care, he'll just crack open a liquid water.

530
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,180
It's the 10 o'clock show, he can crack open that...

531
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,180
Liquid death.

532
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:35,180
Canned water.

533
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,180
What you are going to do, we need you to act as the judge.

534
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,180
Got it.

535
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:47,180
As we all determine what is the body-est moment in theme park history.

536
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,180
Yeah.

537
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,180
Oh yeah.

538
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,180
Wow.

539
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,180
That's right.

540
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,180
We're swimming in it.

541
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,180
Oh man.

542
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:59,180
This is going to be funny.

543
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:03,180
That's the hope, that's the idea.

544
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:09,180
So we will show you some things and some of the things might be a little scandalous.

545
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:13,180
And probably a lot of the things you will go, that's the thing.

546
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,180
Yeah.

547
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,180
I'm sure.

548
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,180
So you're up for the challenge, you'll help us out here?

549
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:21,180
I would love to be a judge, this is great.

550
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,180
Oh boy, oh boy.

551
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:30,180
Okay, well, one thing, just before we get into, you know, sometimes you forget that,

552
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:35,180
like, we're going to talk about some body things in rides or from old specials or commercials or these kind of things.

553
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:42,180
But you forget that things get a little body sometimes even before you're even in the park.

554
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:49,180
Like when you're just on your way into the park and passing through the shopping district that is outside of the park.

555
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:52,180
I'm vaguely referring to City Walk.

556
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:55,180
I hope people like City Walk here.

557
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,180
Oh, fans, fans.

558
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,180
Yes.

559
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:02,180
And City Walk, of course, has a store called It's Sugar.

560
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:09,180
And I have a bag from It's Sugar.

561
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:14,180
And can anyone guess what might be the contents of the bag?

562
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:18,180
Oh baby, we got not one but two.

563
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,180
Oh yes.

564
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,180
Yeah.

565
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,180
This is sold on the Disney premises?

566
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,180
Not Disney Universal.

567
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,180
Oh, Universal. I'm sorry, it's on Universal.

568
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, yeah, Disney, that would seem straight. Yeah, this is Universal.

569
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,180
Okay, all right, sorry. I was shocked. I was like, all right, this is going to be great.

570
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:39,180
They sell Candied Mickey's little shorts.

571
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:47,180
They're like fruit, it's a fruit, it's an edible short pants with the two buttons.

572
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:51,180
I didn't really have a plan for these and what to do with them.

573
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:56,180
I guess I ordered these for the table.

574
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,180
I'll certainly eat one for sure.

575
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,180
Well, that was my question.

576
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:16,180
And this is also a bit of a runner, Mitch, because Jason in the past has talked a big game about your potential ability to down an entire candy thong in a live show.

577
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:21,180
All right, hold on. I was afraid this was going to happen.

578
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,180
But I have a confession to make.

579
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,180
Okay.

580
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:35,180
I went to City Walk at like nine o'clock Wednesday night, looking for candy thongs.

581
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:43,180
Because I was going to buy it and see if I could eat it on stage and they had nothing. I found none.

582
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:49,180
I was just there looking for candy thongs, but not to buy them.

583
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,180
Wait a second.

584
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:56,180
Why don't you guys text each other about who's going to get the candy thongs?

585
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,180
Because the element of surprise.

586
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:03,180
Mine was unrelated to this.

587
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:08,180
Uh huh. I was in It's Sugar with my parents.

588
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,180
And I was looking for the candy thongs.

589
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,180
Oh, do they still have the candy thongs?

590
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,180
And I went over. This was mere days ago.

591
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:21,180
I hope you did not do this in eye shot of them. Of your mother, Michael.

592
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,180
Well, there's a mug they sell there that says, I farted.

593
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:30,180
And I did point it out to my dad.

594
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,180
He liked it.

595
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,180
But they were right there. The thongs were right there.

596
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,180
I feel like you weren't looking in the right spot.

597
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,180
When I was there, they were stocking a lot of stuff.

598
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:43,180
So maybe the candy thongs were gone.

599
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,180
When was this? Wait, hold on.

600
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:48,180
Wait, where were you there?

601
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:52,180
I was there like early last week.

602
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:57,180
I was there this past Wednesday night after we had a meeting about this show.

603
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,180
Scott, when did you buy these?

604
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:04,180
This is crazy. I was there too.

605
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,180
Yeah, you wouldn't look at me.

606
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,180
I don't know what that was about.

607
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,180
I was going for the I farted shirt.

608
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,180
Well, that's fair.

609
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:13,180
You weren't looking at me because you were staring at that shirt.

610
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,180
You were really going back and forth.

611
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,180
It's on a top shelf.

612
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:23,180
The candy thongs, that's the only way I'll go down on someone.

613
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:28,180
You're a step up from DJ Khaled.

614
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:34,180
I'll do it, but you got to put this on first.

615
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:40,180
Make it appetizing. Come on.

616
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,180
I was there Tuesday morning.

617
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:46,180
Fuck me. Did you just buy them?

618
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:52,180
There were three and I bought these two because the last one, the box was open.

619
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,180
Didn't seem like a good suit.

620
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:58,180
I wanted to sample it before I bought it.

621
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:02,180
I also liked that Tuesday, just the guy who's working there is like, all right,

622
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,180
open up the store. It's nine a.m.

623
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:08,180
And wow, two candy thongs getting bought right away.

624
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:12,180
10 a.m. purchase of a candy thong.

625
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:20,180
And I was there with my three year old son.

626
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:24,180
We played with the candy thong.

627
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,180
He was delighted, but he was like, Walker, like, please, please get it.

628
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:30,180
No, no, no, son. This is body.

629
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,180
You may have.

630
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:36,180
They may have trashed that one and you may have bought the last two on the show.

631
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:42,180
And so when I went up there and I walked around the store five times looking like I was probably

632
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:49,180
because I put I had a hat on, I had a mask on and they're like, who's this creep who's just doing laps?

633
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:53,180
Who then eventually bought some bulk candy on his way up?

634
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:57,180
Can I ask you this? Where? Which part of the store were you looking at?

635
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,180
I looked at every part.

636
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,180
There's a dirty part of the store.

637
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:06,180
Everyone who knows that sugar knows where the dirty part is in the back, like a video store.

638
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:10,180
And it's in the it's like if you go straight, it's to the back right, like the very far back right wall.

639
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,180
And it's a high farted shirt. The candy thongs.

640
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:16,180
That was bad there. You know what? They had a little plush poop.

641
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:22,180
Yes. That area, I because I thought because it was weird and it was kind of in the shadows.

642
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:26,180
That was all something called an alcohol shotgun.

643
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,180
I have never heard of that before.

644
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:35,180
Jason was expecting a like, oh, the entire audience says I never together in unison.

645
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:38,180
It was like a like a gun for liquor.

646
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:43,180
I think I used that last night. I think I put it in my fucking mouth last night.

647
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:48,180
My plan was to pull out the candy thong from these bathrobe pockets.

648
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:53,180
Ew. Eat it. What? I watched this yesterday.

649
00:40:53,180 --> 00:41:00,180
And then try to eat it. But then also pull out a bucket from Home Depot of just like just in case.

650
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:04,180
In case you vomit at the candy thong. Jesus Christ.

651
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:08,180
You already took your shirt off in front of them. I didn't think I would.

652
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:11,180
Splash zone in the front row. It's the body show.

653
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:16,180
You came to the 10 p.m. podcast The Right Show and saw Jason puke on stage.

654
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:19,180
What a gift you would have been receiving.

655
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,180
I know they had an area rug on stage.

656
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:25,180
I was trying to be considerate of the wonderful workers here at the Dynasty Tie Printer.

657
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,180
Oh, you're pulling that. Yeah. Yeah.

658
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:31,180
Oh my. That was good. Great.

659
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:34,180
You took it out of the tailspin. Well, look, we could talk about.

660
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:42,180
I feel like so many of your listeners are here. I should pull like an inglorious bastards and lock the doors.

661
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:47,180
Have my co-host Nick Weigert laughing from the projection as they all burn.

662
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:55,180
The Maleficent Dragon shooting fire.

663
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:07,180
All right. We could talk about the process of getting the candy thongs for 20 minutes more or we could get this candy thong out of the bag.

664
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,180
That candy thong sucks.

665
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:12,180
Yeah, let's see. Oh, God.

666
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,180
That sucks.

667
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,180
So that's the back, I guess, is the string part.

668
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:22,180
It's like a candy jockstrap, too.

669
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:26,180
Sorry, babe. No deal. That's me.

670
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,180
What are we doing with these?

671
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,180
What is anybody want?

672
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:35,180
Jason's eating it.

673
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,180
Wow. Wow.

674
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:43,180
Now I do want to try some of it. Of course, we can share it.

675
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,180
It's for the table.

676
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:49,180
If you guys need anything to wash it down with.

677
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:53,180
Oh my God. They still make those.

678
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:56,180
They sure do.

679
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:01,180
Nice and room temp lukewarm Kool-Aid burst.

680
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,180
Just pass it down.

681
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,180
All right. Yeah. I'll crack one of these open.

682
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:10,180
Don't you hang over your room temperature Kool-Aid squirt.

683
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,180
Kool-Aid burst.

684
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:14,180
And a candy thong, dude. It works every time.

685
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:18,180
Do you want to try it? Oh, Jason's at it. Okay, okay, great.

686
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:22,180
What do we think? You think you have what it takes to go all the way?

687
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,180
That is a lot of candy.

688
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:29,180
Yeah, it's like the box says 14.

689
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:32,180
My head is too big.

690
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:35,180
The thing.

691
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,180
That's like a, it's like a candy bane mask.

692
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:44,180
My neck. My back.

693
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:48,180
I'll break your pussy and your back.

694
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:51,180
You know, I think when I was picturing it years ago,

695
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:56,180
I was forgetting about the front part being so oddly big and unsettling.

696
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:59,180
It's a lot of, it's 14.5 servings.

697
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,180
Oh.

698
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,180
How many calories per serving?

699
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:09,180
Surely with this and the Kool-Aid, I won't need the bucket.

700
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:12,180
Okay, so it's 35 calories and there's 14.

701
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:17,180
So 14, who can do 14 times 35 real quick?

702
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:21,180
No one is rain man out there.

703
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,180
Yeah. Wow. Wow.

704
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:26,180
I almost had it. Wait, did you use your phone?

705
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,180
Yeah, you did. You fucker. I saw it.

706
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,180
Pretty good.

707
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:36,180
This is just funny to me. It's like, baby, I'm wearing a candy thong.

708
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:40,180
And then you just hear like crunch.

709
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,180
Yeah.

710
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,180
It's fucking awful.

711
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:50,180
Mitch, you and I were at the same bachelor party where the bachelor,

712
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:54,180
there was supposed to be a whipped cream part of the routine.

713
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:57,180
And he said, no, no, no, I cannot go near that.

714
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:00,180
I'm lactose intolerant.

715
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:04,180
And everybody in the party was like, what can this be replaced with?

716
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:09,180
And somebody suggested a couple of ruffled potato chips,

717
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:15,180
which he then, well, he somehow more sexy than this.

718
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,180
This is awful.

719
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:22,180
He then ate it off of her chest and she said, ouch.

720
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:26,180
We were there. We were both there for this moment.

721
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:29,180
I don't know if that resonated with you as much as me.

722
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:31,180
Certainly. Yes.

723
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:34,180
It's one of those things where you're like, I'll never forget that for the rest of my life.

724
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:38,180
Don't out the person. Probably don't out the person.

725
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,180
I don't know.

726
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,180
No, no, we won't say who it is.

727
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:43,180
John Lasseter's bachelor party.

728
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:51,180
I had this on my face, so I don't know if you want to take a bite of it, but it is, it's horrible.

729
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:57,180
I mean, isn't that what it's all about is like getting mixed up with skin and hair?

730
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:01,180
That's what you're getting into if you have one of these, right?

731
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:04,180
I got an initial assessment.

732
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:07,180
It's like a worse NeccoWafer.

733
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:10,180
Yeah, that's right.

734
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,180
Ari, can I say this?

735
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,180
Did you eat candy necklaces growing up?

736
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:19,180
I was not a big candy necklace guy, but I was a big NeccoWafer household.

737
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:23,180
NeccoWafer's, I ate them, but they're bad.

738
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,180
It's a real old person food for sure.

739
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:30,180
Jason, when was the last time you purchased some NeccoWafer's?

740
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:36,180
Well, we usually put them in, everyone gets them in their stockings at Christmas.

741
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,180
Oh, still?

742
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:42,180
Yeah, if you can find them. NeccoWafer's and chunky bars, they're hard to find.

743
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:46,180
Did you offer me a NeccoWafer backstage right before the show?

744
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:49,180
I give them out like mints.

745
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:52,180
That's on my rider.

746
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:55,180
I think they're a Massachusetts company, NeccoWafer's.

747
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,180
This is okay.

748
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,180
I think so.

749
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,180
This is horrible.

750
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:02,180
The string gets caught in the teeth.

751
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:03,180
That's a component.

752
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,180
Did you ever eat a candy necklace as a child?

753
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:06,180
No.

754
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,180
Mitch?

755
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,180
Yeah, no, I had them as a kid.

756
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:15,180
I thought it would be the more fruit roll-up-y was what I thought we were going to get with the edible panties.

757
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,180
I was excited for that.

758
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:23,180
That's the more traditional type of edible underwear, is the fruit roll-up type.

759
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,180
Mike, go for it.

760
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:29,180
I know what I'm doing here.

761
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,180
Know your way around.

762
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,180
Here's what I first noticed.

763
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:40,180
Generally, a candy necklace is something that has a very thin string because you're eating it and they don't want to spend money.

764
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,180
This is a very thick string.

765
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:47,180
I don't know if nobody can see this, I'm sure, but this is not breaking.

766
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,180
It's also not string.

767
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:49,180
It's plastic.

768
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,180
It's also not string.

769
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,180
It's plastic.

770
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:55,180
I was fully expecting cloth string.

771
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:56,180
That's right on the box.

772
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,180
Gee, string.

773
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:59,180
It's a false advertising.

774
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:07,180
I think it's pretty cool that you can eat all the candy off it and then use it again if you want to.

775
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:10,180
Also, just want to say, also bad.

776
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:15,180
It's great to try two awful things.

777
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:20,180
The candy is bad.

778
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:23,180
It's not even as good as a normal candy necklace.

779
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:24,180
Should we just throw this in the audience?

780
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,180
Does anybody want this?

781
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,180
Wait, no.

782
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,180
It was on our faces and in our mouths.

783
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:32,180
I don't have COVID, I don't think.

784
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:37,180
We're all kind of sure, fairly, probably, maybe.

785
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,180
Who knows?

786
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,180
I have it.

787
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:42,180
I have it.

788
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,180
It's aerosols.

789
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,180
It's not surface stuff.

790
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,180
We know.

791
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,180
So the entire audience can share this candy?

792
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:53,180
Everyone can have one piece, and it's fine.

793
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,180
If we don't finish this, you guys don't leave.

794
00:48:55,180 --> 00:49:00,180
We have to finish this tonight.

795
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:01,180
Should we give them Jason's?

796
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,180
I think his is like 30% done.

797
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,180
Yeah, you're making good breakfast.

798
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:07,180
I'm trying to give it the old college try.

799
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:10,180
He's going to puke on stage.

800
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:15,180
I actually felt better when you did the math and did 490 calories.

801
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,180
Was that it?

802
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:20,180
That actually, it's not great.

803
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:23,180
It's like a sandwich.

804
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,180
It's like a lunch.

805
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,180
It's like a Big Mac.

806
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:30,180
I think it's around 500 candy calories per day is okay.

807
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:35,180
But this is reminding me, Mitch, I was on Doughboy's once

808
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,180
and did the late Great Ample Hills.

809
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,180
That's right.

810
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:43,180
And I got their like six scoop sampler and ate it myself.

811
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,180
He certainly did.

812
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:49,180
And by the end of that, here's the thing that happens to my body

813
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:54,180
if I have too much sugar, my throat starts to close up and it hurts.

814
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:57,180
So I'm on my way there right now.

815
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,180
Oh, no.

816
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,180
So we'll see how far I get into this.

817
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:04,180
But if the throat closes up, then you won't vomit.

818
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:06,180
Yeah, the seal up.

819
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:07,180
That's a fair point.

820
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:11,180
Jason, it'll come up and it'll like get trapped and then go back down.

821
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:14,180
Oh, that sounds awesome.

822
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:17,180
I wonder where else it'll go.

823
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,180
Out every pore in your body?

824
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,180
Out of your skin?

825
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:24,180
Can you puke out your skin?

826
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:27,180
I want to find out, brother.

827
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,180
All right.

828
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,180
For the love of God, everyone, please keep eating your candy thong.

829
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:34,180
I think you should give it to the audience.

830
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,180
I really do.

831
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,180
It hurts my teeth.

832
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,180
The audience wants it.

833
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:41,180
What I don't want is the throw because the throw is going to land

834
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:45,180
right in the face of somebody who does not want a candy thong.

835
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,180
Oh, come on.

836
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:49,180
It might land on the floor.

837
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,180
Toss the calculator boy over here.

838
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,180
You can take it.

839
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,180
He's earned it.

840
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,180
All right.

841
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,180
Here you go.

842
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,180
All right.

843
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,180
For calculator boy.

844
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,180
Calculator boy.

845
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:06,180
Do you want a Kool-Aid burst?

846
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,180
Oh, yeah.

847
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,180
Those might be more popular.

848
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,180
Grape is my favorite.

849
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,180
Oh, what's the greatest flavor on earth?

850
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,180
Wow.

851
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:14,180
Grape is the greatest.

852
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:20,180
I hope there's an audience member that just slurps it down like spaghetti.

853
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:24,180
My clone out there.

854
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:27,180
Your clone on the loose.

855
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,180
All right.

856
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,180
Please keep eating.

857
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:31,180
I would love you to keep eating.

858
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:33,180
And you too, of course.

859
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:37,180
But let's start looking at some stuff.

860
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:44,180
And I'm really glad that this topic came up because recently in the Easter season,

861
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:47,180
I saw something that I couldn't unsee,

862
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:49,180
and I knew exactly what I had to do with it,

863
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:53,180
which is make you not able to unsee it also.

864
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:56,180
And this is something from an Easter parade.

865
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:01,180
This is from the 1994 Walt Disney World Happy Easter Parade.

866
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:02,180
It was a big one.

867
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:05,180
Nancy Kerrigan was a big part of it.

868
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:12,180
And I believe the boys' choir of Harlem, I think, is who is performing

869
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:15,180
in the sequence I'm about to show.

870
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:22,180
And what you're going to see is the Disney characters doing like B-boy stuff.

871
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,180
Like, it's pretty good.

872
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:27,180
I think you will agree as this clip begins that this is pretty good.

873
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:32,180
But then a thing will happen that you will understand why I'm showing this.

874
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,180
I think we...

875
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,180
Wait, no, not that one.

876
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,180
Mickey in the red jacket.

877
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,180
There you go.

878
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,180
Okay, okay.

879
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:41,180
So let's all experience this together.

880
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:45,180
Wow.

881
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,180
Is it just a picture?

882
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,180
Yeah, yeah.

883
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,180
Well, yeah, I guess...

884
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,180
Okay.

885
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:50,180
I'm going to turn the camera off.

886
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,180
Wow.

887
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:52,180
Oh, shit.

888
00:52:52,180 --> 00:53:17,180
I think I'm going to like all these.

889
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:21,180
This is good stuff.

890
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:26,180
This is great.

891
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:30,180
Full mini upskirt.

892
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:33,180
And this is not a live special.

893
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,180
There was an edit done on this.

894
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:38,180
This was a specifically chosen close-up.

895
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:42,180
Mike Elizer watched and approved this.

896
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,180
He saw it and liked it.

897
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:49,180
He's not alone.

898
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:59,180
They should have panned to me, a 12-year-old me with a knife and fork right there.

899
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:05,180
With a bib in.

900
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,180
Wow.

901
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:07,180
I like it.

902
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:14,180
What's crazy is that is not the last moment of sexualization of Minnie in the same special,

903
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,180
which is why I bring it up.

904
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:24,180
A little while later, there is essentially a long soap opera parody filmed at the Waterpark Typhoon Lagoon.

905
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:31,180
And this is led by the actor Antonio Sabato Jr.

906
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:35,180
And I think that top one on the beach will be it.

907
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:48,180
Oh, my God.

908
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:07,180
Holy shit.

909
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:19,180
You can see her plastic smile going wider.

910
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:21,180
That was wild.

911
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:22,180
Yeah, that's something.

912
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,180
The intertwined legs.

913
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:27,180
Like a hairy man's leg.

914
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:29,180
We may have a winner already.

915
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:30,180
Yeah.

916
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:31,180
That might be the winner.

917
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:32,180
Could be it.

918
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:36,180
And it's made especially more disturbing by the fact that if you don't know,

919
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:40,180
Antonio Sabato Jr. is the trumpiest man in the world.

920
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:42,180
He is the most right.

921
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:45,180
He spoke at the 2016 RNC.

922
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:51,180
So if you were bothered by it before the context that he's a monster.

923
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:53,180
Now you know that he's a monster.

924
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:59,180
Now he's always saying he's anti having sex with an anthropomorphic mouse on the beach.

925
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,180
Look at him back then.

926
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:08,180
Is that kind of like is flocking animals that kind of start with Disney, do you think?

927
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:11,180
Like, is it like a thumper is like one of the first times someone was like, yeah.

928
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:15,180
Thumper.

929
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:17,180
Thumper looks like a real animal.

930
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:18,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

931
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:22,180
I'm just saying like hypothetically.

932
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:26,180
Many at least look like a human somewhat.

933
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:27,180
Body wise.

934
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:28,180
I'm just trying to get to the bottom of it.

935
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:31,180
Do you think it's like Disney started?

936
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,180
Like do you think it started mostly with Disney?

937
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:37,180
It started when Thumper hit the screen.

938
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,180
Interesting.

939
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:39,180
Well, Walt Disney was an innovator.

940
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:49,180
He did the first cartoon with sound and the first color and the first fuckable animal.

941
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:54,180
You don't think about like anthropomorphic animals you want to fuck before Disney, right?

942
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:57,180
Unless there's some like is there some early film with an anthropomorphic animal?

943
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:03,180
If I know Walt Disney, he stole the idea of anthropomorphic animals you'd want to fuck from somebody else that we don't even know about.

944
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:05,180
Oh shit.

945
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:09,180
So there might have been a precursor to it, but I don't know.

946
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,180
It's interesting.

947
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:17,180
Like I'm a big fan of Uncle Wiggly, which is a very old character who was we had a board game as a child.

948
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:20,180
There's four people that know what I'm talking about.

949
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:23,180
Yeah, one of them's on stage with you.

950
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:26,180
Well, when is that not the case?

951
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:31,180
But yeah, like he's he's Uncle Wiggly was the rabbit gentleman and he wore a suit.

952
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:36,180
And I could see if you were into like a distinguished man, you'd be like this Uncle Wiggly is kind of hot.

953
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:40,180
He's giving off he's giving off zaddy zaddy vibes.

954
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:45,180
Yeah, he's not letting his rheumatism get him down.

955
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:48,180
Because it's the late 1800s.

956
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,180
I'm also Scott.

957
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:52,180
I think you're Googling Uncle Wiggly, which I'm going to do as well.

958
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:55,180
I need to know what the animal you described is.

959
00:57:55,180 --> 00:58:01,180
Is is nemesis was always trying to give him quote ear nibbles.

960
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:02,180
No.

961
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:04,180
OK, cual a second.

962
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,180
Yeah, yeah.

963
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:08,180
This is insane.

964
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:10,180
No one is attracted to that thing.

965
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:13,180
It's as much of a rabbit as Thumper.

966
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:16,180
No, it's way less attractive than Thumper.

967
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:19,180
No, no, Thumper has big eyes appealing.

968
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:21,180
This is this is creepy.

969
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:22,180
It's like an old line drawing.

970
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,180
This is like a creepy old Lewis Carroll.

971
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:25,180
You think Thumper is hotter than Uncle Wiggly?

972
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:27,180
A thousand percent.

973
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:28,180
Yep, I'm with Mitch.

974
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:29,180
Thumper's got curves.

975
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,180
This is unbelievable.

976
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,180
This is madness.

977
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:33,180
Thumper's soft and beautiful.

978
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,180
This is insane.

979
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,180
Uncle Wiggly is like a man.

980
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,180
He's got like a man's body.

981
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:42,180
And just that sheer fact makes him.

982
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:45,180
I'm a normal guy attracted to real people.

983
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:51,180
Human shapes, even if there's an animal head at the top of the shape.

984
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:52,180
That's right.

985
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:57,180
I'm attracted to the Thundercats, but not to the lions in Lion King.

986
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:59,180
That's the difference.

987
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:00,180
I think you're right about that.

988
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:01,180
Which version of the Lion King?

989
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,180
New one or old one?

990
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:05,180
Old one.

991
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:08,180
I think there's some stuff in each one that works.

992
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:09,180
Personally.

993
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:16,180
Do you like Nala better in the cartoon or the new one?

994
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:18,180
It's a dead heat for me, honestly.

995
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,180
Alright, fair.

996
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,180
I think cartoon.

997
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:21,180
Okay, fair enough.

998
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:23,180
Adult Nala, by the way, Jesus Christ.

999
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:24,180
Yeah.

1000
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:25,180
Let's be, yes.

1001
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:26,180
Pose to Kuna Matata.

1002
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:28,180
They've walked all the way across the law.

1003
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:29,180
It's there.

1004
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,180
Time has passed.

1005
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,180
We're past.

1006
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,180
These lions are legal.

1007
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:37,180
Thank God you guys, thank God you guys said this or it would have been weird.

1008
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:38,180
Yeah.

1009
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:39,180
So thank God.

1010
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:41,180
Last thing we would want to do.

1011
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:42,180
Okay.

1012
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:45,180
What else do we got?

1013
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:46,180
I don't know.

1014
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:47,180
Okay.

1015
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:54,180
I don't know if this is cheating because theme parks are, there's the family hours, but then

1016
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:59,180
there is the late night, much like we're doing, there's the late night version, the Halloween

1017
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:04,180
Horror Nights and stuff like that where things get a little more risque.

1018
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:10,180
And I got curious if there was anything terribly sexual going on in the Bill and Ted Halloween

1019
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,180
show.

1020
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:13,180
You know about this, Mitch?

1021
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:17,180
I had the pleasure of going to it a couple times, yeah.

1022
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,180
It's a great show.

1023
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:21,180
I'm sad that it did.

1024
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:24,180
Fucking cancel culture, dude.

1025
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:27,180
Took away another beloved institution in my mind.

1026
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:28,180
Yeah.

1027
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:29,180
I think it helped Trump get in.

1028
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:31,180
People realize this is the last straw.

1029
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:34,180
You're going to take our country back.

1030
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:39,180
I heard they're going to do a Bill and Ted show at Joe Rogan's Mothership Comedy Club.

1031
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:42,180
That's going to be there in the Halloween season.

1032
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:47,180
I thought that it was genuinely, it was a funny, I guess for the wrong reasons, but

1033
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:49,180
it was very fun to watch.

1034
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:50,180
Yeah.

1035
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:55,180
Well, that whole, like, that all of pop culture is together and here's Dr. Evil doing the

1036
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:57,180
Macarena or whatever.

1037
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:59,180
There's something, you are laughing.

1038
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:01,180
I don't know if it's how they intend you to laugh.

1039
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:07,180
I'm not sure, but I got curious about body stuff in those shows.

1040
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:08,180
Here's one.

1041
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:10,180
I'll just read some synopses.

1042
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:11,180
This is 2001.

1043
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:18,180
The ladies from Sex and the City come out and the band camp girl from American Pie introduces

1044
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:19,180
Jim to them.

1045
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:20,180
That's Jason Biggs.

1046
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:23,180
And they say that he sucks in bed.

1047
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:27,180
Samantha from Sex and the City tells Jim she has a solution.

1048
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:33,180
He can have a video from her private collection with outtakes from her scenes in Porky's and

1049
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:37,180
what a page turner.

1050
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:41,180
That page turner it is.

1051
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:48,180
Okay, so gives her videos a bottle of lubricant and tells him to go practice, but then she

1052
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:55,180
interrupts the show later to say, oops, I gave Jim a tube of crazy glue instead of lubricant.

1053
01:01:55,180 --> 01:02:01,180
Also, American Pie are comedy movies and doesn't that happen to him in the movie?

1054
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:02,180
I think it does.

1055
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:06,180
He gets super glue on his dick, doesn't he?

1056
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:09,180
If it didn't happen in two, then at least in wedding.

1057
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:14,180
By the way, I just want to point out that every so often I just hear a click and it's

1058
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:17,180
Calculator Boy still eating the fucking...

1059
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:20,180
You never passed the candy thong to anyone?

1060
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:21,180
No, it's his.

1061
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:23,180
I thought we were hitting it to the audience.

1062
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:24,180
I think he can have all of it.

1063
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:25,180
All right, he can have the whole thing.

1064
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:27,180
I viewed that as that's for him.

1065
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:28,180
Yeah, yeah.

1066
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:31,180
Every two minutes I hit you, you just hear a click and it's him.

1067
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,180
The candy is hard.

1068
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:35,180
The hard piece are so hard to bite.

1069
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:40,180
Yeah, I'm having a pretty bad time over here.

1070
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:42,180
Are you slurring?

1071
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:44,180
Are you slurring your voice?

1072
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:47,180
Well, it's like, it's got a real texture.

1073
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,180
It's got like a sand texture.

1074
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:53,180
So my mouth is kind of like full of sand on one side.

1075
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:56,180
It does sound like your throat is closing slightly.

1076
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:58,180
Yeah, yeah.

1077
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:00,180
Ten minutes later.

1078
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:01,180
I don't know.

1079
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:02,180
It's getting weird.

1080
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:10,180
I'm seeing every memory from my life.

1081
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:13,180
There's one more Bell and Ted thing.

1082
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:16,180
There is a different later year.

1083
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:19,180
There's a scene where a Sharknado appears.

1084
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:20,180
Of course.

1085
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:26,180
And Kim Jong-un walks out to explain that the Sharknado came into existence

1086
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:30,180
as a result of Kristen Stewart sucking his dick too hard.

1087
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:32,180
What the hell?

1088
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:33,180
What?

1089
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:37,180
I gotta say, that's pretty body.

1090
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:39,180
I think that's disqualified too body.

1091
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:42,180
Well, that's what I, yeah, we might overshoot the ramp on some of these.

1092
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:45,180
And it's just, and it's not logical.

1093
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:47,180
Not logical and indecent.

1094
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:50,180
Indecency is not what I'm looking for in this competition.

1095
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:51,180
Yeah, yeah.

1096
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:55,180
Well, that's a good, well, does anyone have anything then that is kind of like,

1097
01:03:55,180 --> 01:04:00,180
if that's too far and we define body as PG-13 to PG-10.

1098
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:03,180
I mean, I'll just put, this is Jason.

1099
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:04,180
Oh, you go ahead.

1100
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:07,180
I was just going to, there's some quick, like, obviously we know like country bears,

1101
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:12,180
like Swing and Teddy Bear, and the Sunbonnet Trio.

1102
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:15,180
Explain these to Mitch, because I don't know that he knows.

1103
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:18,180
Why are these body?

1104
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:21,180
Okay, I get that one.

1105
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:24,180
Yeah, and she's above you.

1106
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:28,180
He's swinging up above you so you can look wherever you want.

1107
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:31,180
A weird little sex swing with a lady, I get it.

1108
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:34,180
What are the three babies all about?

1109
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:37,180
So the Sun, look, this is the Sunbonnet Trio,

1110
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:40,180
and they sing a song called The Guys That Turned Me On Turned Me Down.

1111
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:44,180
Wait, what?

1112
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:46,180
In the Country Bear Jamboree?

1113
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:47,180
Yes.

1114
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:49,180
Yeah, still going, still going strong.

1115
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:53,180
Yes, Mitch, you could go to Florida and see this tomorrow.

1116
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:56,180
The guys who turned me on turned me down?

1117
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:59,180
Yes, I'm trying to think of the lyrics.

1118
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:06,180
Every time I meet a guy who's got me shook, all I get for him is a dirty look.

1119
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:09,180
You know, the same thing everywhere I look.

1120
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,180
This is horrifying.

1121
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:13,180
Nothing ever.

1122
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:14,180
Mitch is going to bolt.

1123
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:17,180
All the guys who turned me on turned me down.

1124
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:18,180
Jesus Christ.

1125
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,180
Strapped.

1126
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:23,180
Just silently the audience singing along to that is fucking...

1127
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:24,180
Well, they aren't all singing.

1128
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:27,180
Some are eating candy thongs.

1129
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:30,180
And some could be secretly eating candy thongs, too.

1130
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:32,180
They just snuck them in.

1131
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:36,180
Yeah, and it's one of my favorite numbers in the show, I'll be honest with you,

1132
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:38,180
but it is a bit bawdy.

1133
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:39,180
Okay.

1134
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:41,180
Do we have video of that or no?

1135
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:46,180
We don't, but I guess I should have gotten it because I assumed everyone would be familiar with it.

1136
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:47,180
We knew the audience would sing.

1137
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:48,180
We knew they'd help you out.

1138
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:50,180
Yeah, they know the lyrics better than I do.

1139
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:58,180
I think the issue with that, I think they're using the term turn me on as more chaste than it is nowadays.

1140
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:02,180
Yes, in the old days maybe that didn't necessarily mean horned up.

1141
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:09,180
Yeah, it's not as horned up as the Samantha from Sex and the City saying,

1142
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:14,180
like, go jerk off with this bottle of unknown fluids.

1143
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:15,180
So some logic holes.

1144
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:19,180
Why does the character know about the actress who plays her?

1145
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:22,180
I can't get over that.

1146
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:30,180
I mean, I'm still, my issue has been that, okay, look, I will cede to them that if you sucked a dick very hard,

1147
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:34,180
it could create a tornado.

1148
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:39,180
Let's assume that is possible because of the swirling and the force.

1149
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:42,180
If it were like Superman sucked a dick, I guess.

1150
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:47,180
Yeah, Superman absolutely would create one if not more tornadoes.

1151
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:49,180
But it would also have to be like a very strong dick.

1152
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:51,180
I'm sorry, I want to get involved here.

1153
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:55,180
It would have to be the Hulk's dick or something because he would probably suck a dick off, right?

1154
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:56,180
Oh my God, yes.

1155
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:59,180
I'm sorry.

1156
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:11,180
Superman would have to, or like another Kryptonian who was also getting his dick got extra hard because of Earth's yellow sun.

1157
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:15,180
So it would be okay, it would stand up to it.

1158
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:16,180
Yes, yes, yes.

1159
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:18,180
That does make sense.

1160
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:27,180
I think Superman would know the level where it is like the force of a tornado, but it doesn't rip your dick off.

1161
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:29,180
He would know exactly the level of the...

1162
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:35,180
Just trust me, trust me on this one.

1163
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:40,180
Hey, can I go get the ship wheel for the first show and steer us out of here?

1164
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:42,180
Or the whistle or something?

1165
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:46,180
Jason, I think is just zoning out eating candy while we're talking.

1166
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:51,180
I kind of hit like a weird point where it's like I don't know where to find the break.

1167
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:56,180
It's very inconvenient when you get to the knots.

1168
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:58,180
And can you imagine if you...

1169
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:03,180
This was being eaten off of a body, off of a human body.

1170
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:08,180
And this was somehow supposed to be the beginning of a sexual experience.

1171
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:12,180
And instead like ouch, sorry, oops, sorry, oops, sorry.

1172
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:20,180
Yeah, one of the players could get like a nice eight hours of sleep while the other is working on it.

1173
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:27,180
That might be how long it takes to actually eat all of these if you don't go into diabetic shock beforehand.

1174
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:35,180
And I want to point out on the box, the lady who is wearing the thong has a tattoo of the It's Sugar logo.

1175
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:36,180
Wow.

1176
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:43,180
So she's a big It's Sugar fan to put the logo of It's Sugar on her pubic bone.

1177
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:47,180
Now I'm a big It's Sugar fan, but not this big.

1178
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:55,180
Oh, not big enough to do the Nexium branding shit for it.

1179
01:08:55,180 --> 01:09:00,180
Very intense to be an It's Sugar employee. They really need to know that you're committed.

1180
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:03,180
Can I... I just want to bring this up.

1181
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:09,180
Can I... I just want to say one thing. They need to sexy up that trio, I think.

1182
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:12,180
Make them not babies in bonnets?

1183
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:16,180
The fact that they're babies in bonnets is kind of confusing messaging, I guess.

1184
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:24,180
Well, the cartoon behind them, the animation that plays behind them, the slideshow is a little more, you know, adult.

1185
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:25,180
Oh, okay.

1186
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:28,180
Oh, come on. Wait, wait, wait. Now that he said that, go back to it.

1187
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:29,180
What are you talking about?

1188
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:35,180
Well, that's not them, though. Oh, I see. You're like... they're narrating the story of this other pantsless bear.

1189
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:38,180
It looks like two people of the same age.

1190
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:42,180
So the babies are kind of singing about these two, basically.

1191
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:44,180
They were so angry at the...

1192
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:49,180
And also in another way, yes, the language maybe meant something in the old days different,

1193
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:53,180
but I think wearing a bonnet was necessarily not a baby thing in the old days.

1194
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:04,180
Why are we trying so hard to help them turn me on? That's not what they meant.

1195
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:08,180
In your Easter, bonnet was not about a child, necessarily.

1196
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:10,180
So I think adults would wear bonnets.

1197
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:16,180
The engine that drives most modern podcasting is just people in current day going,

1198
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:19,180
Well, I don't have context for the past.

1199
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:24,180
Bring back bonnets, I say.

1200
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:27,180
Yeah, because I think the bonnets are tripping you up.

1201
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:29,180
The bonnets are definitely tripping me up.

1202
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:34,180
Adults start wearing bonnets so the babies are less creepy.

1203
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:37,180
Yes. Country bear jamboree. Clap emojis.

1204
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:39,180
Yes, clap, clap. Yeah, blah, blah, blah.

1205
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:41,180
Right, everyone's... yeah, this is a good cause.

1206
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:45,180
Can I play something real quick, Mike? Can you bring up the Disney...

1207
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:47,180
As long as it's quick.

1208
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:49,180
And as long as you keep eating.

1209
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:51,180
Which one are you looking for?

1210
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:52,180
The Disney Nights.

1211
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:54,180
Oh, this, I believe.

1212
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:57,180
Okay, so Mitch, just for some context, this is...

1213
01:10:57,180 --> 01:11:03,180
We did an episode yesterday, it came out, about the in-room Disney Resort TV.

1214
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:06,180
And this is a clip that played on that. Yeah.

1215
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:19,180
And now, set your sights on the evening lights.

1216
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:24,180
You're having some fun on those Disney Nights.

1217
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:33,180
Like that, that saxophone into that narration, into the graph,

1218
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:35,180
that's a little bawdy, right?

1219
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:37,180
That's definitely bawdy.

1220
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:39,180
I... it's a little bawdy.

1221
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:41,180
I think that's a little bawdy.

1222
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:43,180
That's a little bawdy, right?

1223
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:45,180
That's definitely bawdy.

1224
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:50,180
And also the, you know, the fountains exploding felt intentional.

1225
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,180
I mean, that's true, too.

1226
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:54,180
It felt intentional.

1227
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:58,180
That's my favorite because there's not a human in sight.

1228
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:07,180
Even seeing just like the castle in shadow, to me, felt a little bit bawdy.

1229
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:09,180
Yeah, what's going on up there?

1230
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:11,180
Like the lights are down. Yeah, what's going on?

1231
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:14,180
Like is everyone getting together?

1232
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:16,180
Who is everyone?

1233
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:21,180
Kings and queens and servants? I don't know.

1234
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:25,180
The little guy who holds the shoe and like ladies and gentlemen, he's...

1235
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:28,180
The little guy, he has needs.

1236
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:30,180
The little shoe holder has needs.

1237
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:33,180
He has a life outside of holding the shoe.

1238
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:34,180
Yeah.

1239
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:39,180
He's certainly got a shoe thing as far as the sexual fetish is concerned.

1240
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:41,180
That's why he does the job.

1241
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:42,180
Yes.

1242
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:45,180
They don't even know I'm getting my thing every day.

1243
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:48,180
He was like a Tarantino.

1244
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:51,180
He's got a shoe thing with the, you know...

1245
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:53,180
You know it's true.

1246
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:55,180
You say he's like a Tarantino?

1247
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:57,180
Yeah, the shoe, the little feet thing.

1248
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:59,180
Oh, he likes all the... oh, I got you. That makes sense.

1249
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:01,180
He's not a filth maker.

1250
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:07,180
Can you play that other clip I brought to Mitch?

1251
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:09,180
This was like a night life.

1252
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:11,180
We need a little more, Jason.

1253
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:13,180
Which one is that one?

1254
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:15,180
I hope I have it.

1255
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:17,180
It's in here somewhere.

1256
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:19,180
Just keep setting it up.

1257
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:21,180
If you're like in a honeymoon...

1258
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:24,180
Can you have your honeymoon in the castle? Is that true?

1259
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:28,180
Oh boy, well that's a complicated question with a lot of answers.

1260
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:30,180
That's going to be this.

1261
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:34,180
If they're running promotions, or if you're a very rich person...

1262
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:36,180
Or if you're a very famous person...

1263
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:46,180
Wait, that's it?

1264
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:48,180
Yeah.

1265
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:50,180
Yours are very boat based, by the way.

1266
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:54,180
It was the entire first show, Mitch. It was all boat based.

1267
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:59,180
He only picked stuff that he was researching for the earlier show because it was faster.

1268
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:03,180
So that was like ten years before. That was like 1983.

1269
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:06,180
The first clip was 1995.

1270
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:08,180
Okay, yeah, we got sexy little sex here.

1271
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:14,180
So that was the bodiness of like you dress in formal wear, you go eat a lobster thermidor...

1272
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:16,180
This is, we are stretching...

1273
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:18,180
That...

1274
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:20,180
But you're from New England, so you can see that much.

1275
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:22,180
Let's watch this again.

1276
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:26,180
Let's just try to find something that's fun.

1277
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:30,180
Yeah, this is about as horny as we get up in New England.

1278
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:32,180
That's what I'm saying!

1279
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:34,180
They show food on fire?

1280
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:36,180
That much seafood in one place.

1281
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:40,180
If I walked in that way, oh my god, excuse me, I should cover my eyes!

1282
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:42,180
It's crazy in here.

1283
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:44,180
Yeah, you get it. You get my point.

1284
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:46,180
I think that is a good...

1285
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:51,180
It highlights how sexy the world got in just a few years.

1286
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:54,180
Yeah, we weren't even thinking about Disney.

1287
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:56,180
We were thinking about Disney Nights.

1288
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:58,180
Clinton comes in, you know what I mean?

1289
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:00,180
They go crazy.

1290
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:03,180
I think that the country was maybe moving in that direction.

1291
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:07,180
But I don't know if I would say that clip is body, per se.

1292
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:09,180
Alright, fair enough.

1293
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:15,180
Maybe there was some sexual tension at the dinner? I have no idea.

1294
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:20,180
Wait, hold on, can you explain more why that would be body?

1295
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:22,180
Well, look...

1296
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:24,180
I feel like I've disappointed you.

1297
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:27,180
We're seeing it again.

1298
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:30,180
I feel like that's what people had to do with boarding back in the day.

1299
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:34,180
You had to put on a suit, you had to get something flambéed.

1300
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:37,180
And then you could go back to your hotel room.

1301
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:40,180
Mae West was 50 years before that.

1302
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:43,180
And she was like the queen of body stuff.

1303
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:45,180
The clip is like four seconds.

1304
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:49,180
I mean, I mostly wanted to illustrate how the marketing changed.

1305
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:51,180
Yeah, for sure.

1306
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:54,180
Before the TV channel in like 10, 12 years.

1307
01:15:54,180 --> 01:15:56,180
It's more of a marketing demonstration.

1308
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:58,180
He was talking to us before, he was like,

1309
01:15:58,180 --> 01:16:03,180
I'm going to trick Mitch into admitting that in New England he fucked a lobster.

1310
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:05,180
Yeah.

1311
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:07,180
Well, just ask, of course.

1312
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:12,180
We all assume, but we're nervous to ask.

1313
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:16,180
Does the Disney barf rule, does that go for all fluids in Disney?

1314
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:18,180
Like it's cleaned up?

1315
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:20,180
What do you mean by that?

1316
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:23,180
You know, it won't be on the ground for more than five minutes is what I'm saying.

1317
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:25,180
Oh, I hope.

1318
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:27,180
I really hope.

1319
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:31,180
Is there a liquid that'll let sit for longer than five minutes?

1320
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:33,180
I guess that's what I'm trying to figure out.

1321
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:35,180
Yeah.

1322
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:37,180
I mean, let's say Diet Coke is spilled.

1323
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:39,180
That's going to get cleaned up.

1324
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:41,180
Okay, puke, cleaned up.

1325
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:43,180
Yeah, yeah.

1326
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:45,180
If a little kid shits, that's getting cleaned up.

1327
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:48,180
If an adult shits, getting cleaned up.

1328
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:49,180
All right, good.

1329
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:50,180
That's what I want to know.

1330
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:52,180
That's what I'm just interested in.

1331
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:54,180
If it moved up for all fluids, I guess you could say.

1332
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:57,180
I mean, I can't think of any other fluids.

1333
01:16:57,180 --> 01:16:59,180
Nor can I.

1334
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:01,180
There's not one that I'm thinking of.

1335
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:02,180
You said adult shit.

1336
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:03,180
You said kid shit too, right?

1337
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:04,180
Okay, that's...

1338
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:05,180
Yeah.

1339
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:06,180
Yeah, I think we covered all of them.

1340
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:08,180
I think we got it, yeah.

1341
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:14,180
Okay, I'm going to also bring up something that came up in a recent episode.

1342
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:18,180
We did an episode about this New Jersey theme park called Bo Crafts Amusement Park.

1343
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:21,180
And something came up in that one.

1344
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:26,180
Mike, you sort of found this notion on the fly, the idea that...

1345
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:32,180
I forget why it came up, but that the tower at Six Flags Magic Mountain,

1346
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:36,180
the big red tower, that this was somehow...

1347
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:42,180
It ended up in Magic Mountain, but that it was somehow meant to be in Hugh Hefner's Playboy Club.

1348
01:17:42,180 --> 01:17:45,180
It was a weird thing to discover.

1349
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:47,180
And you didn't act like you knew that for sure.

1350
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:49,180
You just kind of found that on the fly.

1351
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:51,180
But I got curious how that was possibly true.

1352
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:56,180
How do you end up with a giant tall ride that is meant for the Playboy Club?

1353
01:17:56,180 --> 01:18:00,180
And there's a little bit of...

1354
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:01,180
It's a little bit confusing.

1355
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:07,180
What I can say, what I know, is that the company that designed this big tower

1356
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:13,180
did design, they did concept art of a tower like that with the Playboy logo on the side.

1357
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:14,180
Can you show this little guy?

1358
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:15,180
Of course, yeah.

1359
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:16,180
Yes.

1360
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:18,180
So, there's a little bit of truth.

1361
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:21,180
I don't know if this was anything that was ever on the table,

1362
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:24,180
but it says Playboy Club on the side.

1363
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:27,180
And there's a bunny up on the top.

1364
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:32,180
This is Hefner's ultimate dream of something he could have in a city.

1365
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:33,180
Where is this?

1366
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:36,180
What is he going to build where this is possible?

1367
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:38,180
This was supposed to...

1368
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:39,180
Where was it going to be?

1369
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:40,180
It was going to be in Six Flags.

1370
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:43,180
This is the tower that is now in Six Flags Magic Mountain.

1371
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:45,180
Do they move it or is that...

1372
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:47,180
What happened with the tower?

1373
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:52,180
There was a rumor that the tower was built for Hugh Hefner's Playboy Club.

1374
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:57,180
And then it wasn't possible there because it is a giant tall tower.

1375
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:59,180
And then it ended up in Magic Mountain instead.

1376
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:00,180
Wow, okay.

1377
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:04,180
So, a couple of sub points here.

1378
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:09,180
Is it occurring to anyone else that the tower is kind of phallic?

1379
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:11,180
A little bit.

1380
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:13,180
And you know, not like extremely.

1381
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:17,180
That's not like a perfect top to it, but...

1382
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:21,180
Dude, that's exactly how mine looks.

1383
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:25,180
Whip it out!

1384
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:30,180
But none of this is the body part exactly.

1385
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:36,180
The body part is that, I mean, looking into this story and thinking about how this thing is a little erectile,

1386
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:39,180
this is an actually true fact.

1387
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:42,180
That the construction of this tower, as it stands in Magic Mountain,

1388
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:48,180
was performed by a contracting company called Aggressive Erectors.

1389
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:53,180
And this is their registration information.

1390
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:54,180
It is true.

1391
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:57,180
Aggressive Erectors and Bridgemen.

1392
01:19:57,180 --> 01:20:03,180
So that phallic tower was built by Aggressive Erectors.

1393
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:07,180
How on earth did you find this out?

1394
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:10,180
You go to opencorporates.com.

1395
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:12,180
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm always, I'm perusing it.

1396
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:16,180
Just keeping an eye on what great corporations are joining the corporate world.

1397
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:23,180
There's a world where you find like the next Zodiac Killer, but instead you're a podcaster.

1398
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:26,180
Can you hit me with another cold one, by the way? Another cool inverse?

1399
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:28,180
Oh yeah, oh absolutely.

1400
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:30,180
Thank you.

1401
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:33,180
Hey, little phallic too. Think about it. Look at that.

1402
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:35,180
That's strange.

1403
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:39,180
This is most children's lunchbox. I don't know if they are anymore.

1404
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:41,180
Anyway, I...

1405
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:44,180
Oh Jesus Christ.

1406
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:47,180
If I get electrocuted by Kool-Aid Burst, it's...

1407
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:49,180
I can't think of a better way to go.

1408
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:53,180
It does have to be listed on your tombstone officially.

1409
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:55,180
Anyway, oh wait, I forgot the other thing.

1410
01:20:55,180 --> 01:21:00,180
That the actual slogan of Aggressive Erectors, the slogan of their company was

1411
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:05,180
Satisfaction Guaranteed with our Erections.

1412
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:07,180
So says this website.

1413
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:12,180
So now I'm like, am I crazy? Am I just seeing, am I the only one seeing the phallic nature of all this?

1414
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:15,180
And just to do a little demonstration, make sure I wasn't seeing things.

1415
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:28,180
I did a quick Photoshop of the Six Flags Tower into the iconic 1972 Playgirl centerfold of Burt Reynolds.

1416
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:29,180
That's pretty body.

1417
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:31,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes.

1418
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:34,180
I mean, they didn't do it. Six Flags didn't produce this. I did.

1419
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:37,180
But it is body.

1420
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:43,180
And a good idea also to put a little mini American flag at the top of your...

1421
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:47,180
You had to Photoshop out his actual erection.

1422
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:50,180
No, he doesn't. He's covering it with the...

1423
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:51,180
No, no, no. That's how...

1424
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:57,180
Again, to be PG-13, I could have chosen a photo with an actual erection, but I chose a self-sensor.

1425
01:21:57,180 --> 01:22:00,180
Not of Burt Reynolds, though. There's no Burt Reynolds erection photo.

1426
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:04,180
I don't know. Something for everybody to peruse when they go home.

1427
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:10,180
Chase Meridian, erect Burt Reynolds. You've got a lot of work to do tonight.

1428
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:14,180
It's just funny when you're like, man, I need like a structurally sound building.

1429
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:19,180
I need someone to build a building like, these guys are pretty funny.

1430
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:23,180
They're pretty funny. We should use them. Like, that's fucking insane.

1431
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:26,180
They put a little joke in their pamphlet.

1432
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:31,180
I don't care if it's structurally sound. They're going to be fun.

1433
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:39,180
I wonder if this is the time to do... Do you have any other quick hits, Mike?

1434
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:43,180
Yeah, in Knott's Berry Farm, there's a bench.

1435
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:50,180
The bench is very popular.

1436
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:56,180
And look, they don't say exactly what the profession of these ladies is.

1437
01:22:56,180 --> 01:23:03,180
But I'm assuming they work in some kind of brothel, deadwood situation.

1438
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:05,180
And they're just sitting there.

1439
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:09,180
And it is funny because they probably wouldn't be there at Disneyland.

1440
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:12,180
That's probably not, like maybe in the old days, but not now.

1441
01:23:12,180 --> 01:23:17,180
But they're just sitting there and it suggests something.

1442
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:21,180
And it's great. I like them there.

1443
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:24,180
Clearly.

1444
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:28,180
But you know, local people like to take photos with them.

1445
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:41,180
Again, like I said in the first show, you have a very detailed photo archive.

1446
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:43,180
Mostly of me.

1447
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:46,180
Mostly of you. A lot of Jason, that's true.

1448
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:53,180
These guys are good because they don't even look like they're that interested in Jason.

1449
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:56,180
I think anyone who's sitting there would have the same effect.

1450
01:23:56,180 --> 01:23:58,180
But they're kind of like...

1451
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:01,180
She looks like, what do you think of this guy?

1452
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:03,180
Seems like she's having second thoughts.

1453
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:07,180
The other one is truly like she's doing something with her pocketbook or something.

1454
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:10,180
Yes, it looks like you're creeping them out basically.

1455
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:12,180
Little distance.

1456
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:17,180
This to me actually kind of feels like quintessential theme park bodiness.

1457
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:21,180
This feels like right on the nose of what it is.

1458
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:27,180
Because you'll end up with, you know what you'll have is a kick line of can-can birds.

1459
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:30,180
That's what theme park bodiness is.

1460
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:31,180
Right, yes.

1461
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:33,180
You've got the little ribbon, the little...

1462
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:36,180
Not like Minnie Mouse. Do we have a photo of that?

1463
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:38,180
I feel like we did.

1464
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:40,180
What? Of can-can birds?

1465
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:42,180
I'm not sure. We really should have.

1466
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:44,180
Is it this one?

1467
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:45,180
Wait, what?

1468
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:46,180
I don't know. Click on that.

1469
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:47,180
Can-can birds?

1470
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:48,180
Yeah, there you go.

1471
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:49,180
Yeah.

1472
01:24:49,180 --> 01:24:50,180
Uh-huh. Is that body?

1473
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:51,180
That is pretty body.

1474
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:53,180
This is what body feels like.

1475
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:55,180
This feels like the perfect body.

1476
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:58,180
The Minnie Mouse stuff was smut.

1477
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:08,180
This is more what I feel comfortable with.

1478
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:12,180
Can you bring up the Jessica Rabbit?

1479
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:13,180
Sure.

1480
01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:15,180
Now we're talking, Jason.

1481
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:16,180
Here we go.

1482
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:21,180
Okay, so Mitch, in the early days of Pleasure Island, there was a store called Jessica's.

1483
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:24,180
And it was all Jessica Rabbit stuff.

1484
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:27,180
So you can see there's the...

1485
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:29,180
Mitch is speechless.

1486
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:31,180
That's like the counter.

1487
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:34,180
I'm so sad I never got to visit this. This is great.

1488
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:37,180
That's a bunch of Jessica Rabbit standees.

1489
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:38,180
Wow.

1490
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:40,180
Do the sign next.

1491
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:43,180
Yeah, there's the big sexy sign, the body sign outside.

1492
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:45,180
Is it here? I don't want to...

1493
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:48,180
And then the last one with the door.

1494
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:52,180
Yeah, so that's implied that her dressing room is there.

1495
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:53,180
She lives in the store.

1496
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:58,180
She lives in the store and she has a changing room where she can disrobe.

1497
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:00,180
We don't know necessarily. It could be just her office.

1498
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:03,180
Yeah, it could be her professional office.

1499
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:07,180
She might never change her wardrobe, but that is where she does her taxes.

1500
01:26:07,180 --> 01:26:08,180
Yeah.

1501
01:26:08,180 --> 01:26:10,180
It could be a tax facility, sure.

1502
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:14,180
Is it time... Does Mitch know this about what happened to Jessica?

1503
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:15,180
Dude, is she okay?

1504
01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:16,180
What? Oh.

1505
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:19,180
I tested her a few days ago. I hadn't heard anything back.

1506
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:22,180
I thought she was just busy.

1507
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:28,180
They put... Jessica Rabbit is wearing a trench coat now on the Roger Rabbit ride.

1508
01:26:28,180 --> 01:26:31,180
This is fucking bullshit.

1509
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:34,180
I'm so mad.

1510
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:35,180
Is this real?

1511
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:36,180
I swear to God, yeah.

1512
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:38,180
They covered her up.

1513
01:26:38,180 --> 01:26:39,180
Yeah, it's true.

1514
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:40,180
They made her a detective.

1515
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:41,180
They made her a detective now.

1516
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:44,180
That's fucking bullshit.

1517
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:49,180
Look, things are changing just a little too fast, all right?

1518
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:56,180
Speak our minds. It's four to your four.

1519
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:57,180
It's a late show.

1520
01:26:57,180 --> 01:26:58,180
I mean, it does.

1521
01:26:58,180 --> 01:27:02,180
They came for the pirate's ride. I did not say a word.

1522
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:03,180
Okay?

1523
01:27:03,180 --> 01:27:04,180
I'm getting mad.

1524
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:07,180
I'm fucking pissed off. I'm fucking out of here.

1525
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:12,180
I mean, if it makes you feel any better, it does make her look like a peeper.

1526
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:13,180
Oh, you're right. It's worse.

1527
01:27:13,180 --> 01:27:17,180
I can work with that a little bit. That's good.

1528
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:23,180
So there's a third thing for you to Google is peeper Jessica Rabbit when you get home.

1529
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:24,180
We don't have a pirate.

1530
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:25,180
We don't have a pirate.

1531
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:26,180
We don't have a pirate.

1532
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:27,180
We don't have a pirate.

1533
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:28,180
We don't have a pirate.

1534
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:29,180
We don't have a pirate.

1535
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:30,180
We don't have a pirate.

1536
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:32,180
When you get home.

1537
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:35,180
I should have put the photo because I didn't know if you knew.

1538
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:38,180
By the way, I'm so sorry to break it to you on stage.

1539
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:39,180
Yeah, I'm very upset.

1540
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:42,180
This should be between you and I privately in our little room.

1541
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:44,180
Between you and your gums.

1542
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:46,180
That's when I tell you, yeah, what happened.

1543
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:49,180
So there's something else.

1544
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:52,180
I think we should probably start heading to the end.

1545
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:53,180
What else you got, Mike?

1546
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:54,180
These quick hits.

1547
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:58,180
I mean, here, this is a thing that I got to witness at Tokyo Disney.

1548
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:01,180
And here is our guy.

1549
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:02,180
We got a little woo.

1550
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:03,180
Yeah, this is Donald.

1551
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:06,180
And he was about ready to go do a show.

1552
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:11,180
And all of a sudden, I see he's joined by his friend.

1553
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:15,180
And that's Jose from the three Caballeros.

1554
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:17,180
Did I pronounce that right?

1555
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:21,180
And then all of a sudden, they just start doing some antics with each other.

1556
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:22,180
And everything's fine.

1557
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:25,180
And again, I took these photos.

1558
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:27,180
I'm right here.

1559
01:28:27,180 --> 01:28:30,180
This is a show for like 20 people that they're doing.

1560
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:32,180
This is not the big show on the stage.

1561
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:34,180
And like all of a sudden...

1562
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:38,180
The fuck?

1563
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:39,180
Oh.

1564
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:45,180
Whoa.

1565
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:49,180
And then Jose turns, Donald turns around.

1566
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:51,180
No!

1567
01:28:52,180 --> 01:28:53,180
The fingers.

1568
01:28:56,180 --> 01:28:59,180
What on earth?

1569
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:05,180
So we'll go through them one more time.

1570
01:29:08,180 --> 01:29:09,180
Here they are.

1571
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:12,180
There's a guy in the background that gets in on the action.

1572
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,180
Watch. See this guy right here?

1573
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:14,180
Now go to the next one.

1574
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:16,180
Yeah, he likes it too.

1575
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:23,180
It's another peeper.

1576
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:24,180
He's a peeper too.

1577
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:25,180
There's a peeper.

1578
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:29,180
Wow.

1579
01:29:31,180 --> 01:29:34,180
Why are they doing this so close to you?

1580
01:29:34,180 --> 01:29:36,180
I don't know.

1581
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:38,180
Was there anyone else around?

1582
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:40,180
Like 10 people.

1583
01:29:40,180 --> 01:29:44,180
They're about to go into that entrance to do the real show.

1584
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:47,180
And they're waiting and touching each other's butts.

1585
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:48,180
Their seats.

1586
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:51,180
What the hell happens in the real show?

1587
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:54,180
More seat stuff.

1588
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:56,180
Seat play.

1589
01:29:58,180 --> 01:30:00,180
They were doing seat play.

1590
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:01,180
Wow.

1591
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:03,180
You got some private seat play.

1592
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:04,180
That's pretty lucky.

1593
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:07,180
Is anyone upset that we haven't done as much seat stuff lately?

1594
01:30:07,180 --> 01:30:09,180
No.

1595
01:30:11,180 --> 01:30:13,180
We call this thing we call butt seats.

1596
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:15,180
And I think it's worse.

1597
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:16,180
It's worse than...

1598
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:17,180
We said ass.

1599
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:18,180
It's so much...

1600
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:20,180
Seats creeps the hell out of me.

1601
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:22,180
It sounds like the people have spoken.

1602
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:24,180
Some of them did.

1603
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:26,180
Yeah.

1604
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:29,180
Look, we got seats in seats.

1605
01:30:29,180 --> 01:30:31,180
But if we...

1606
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:34,180
They didn't cheer when you talked about their seats.

1607
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:36,180
How does it feel now?

1608
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:40,180
Got to get the people what they want.

1609
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:41,180
I'll be honest with you guys.

1610
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:45,180
When I first heard about the podcast premise, I thought it was pretty thin.

1611
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:49,180
And then you did three hours on a parking lot with my co-host.

1612
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:53,180
And I was like, oh, okay, they're going to talk about fucking anything on earth.

1613
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:54,180
Yeah.

1614
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:56,180
We found a way.

1615
01:30:56,180 --> 01:30:59,180
Anything qualifies.

1616
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:00,180
I think you're doing...

1617
01:31:00,180 --> 01:31:02,180
Here's the deal.

1618
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:06,180
None of this has made me as horny as I've wanted to get during the show.

1619
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:10,180
I got one more up my sleeve.

1620
01:31:10,180 --> 01:31:13,180
And this might make me a little more horny.

1621
01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:14,180
Obviously.

1622
01:31:14,180 --> 01:31:15,180
Ooh, okay.

1623
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:17,180
Maybe this will do the trick.

1624
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:22,180
And this also feels to me like the epitome of theme park bodiness.

1625
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:24,180
Like as far as they go.

1626
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:26,180
And here's what it is in...

1627
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:28,180
You'll be happy it involves animals.

1628
01:31:28,180 --> 01:31:30,180
Hell yeah.

1629
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:40,180
This is such an interesting thread we've established for your podcast canon.

1630
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:47,180
This is something that would happen for many, many years, many decades,

1631
01:31:47,180 --> 01:31:50,180
in the Universal Animal Actors Show.

1632
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:51,180
Do you ever go to this, Mitch?

1633
01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:58,180
The show at Universal Studios where they say, hey, Binge's there and Lassie's there.

1634
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:02,180
And the animals do different tricks and demonstrations.

1635
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:06,180
And I think the iconic part of it to me, the centerpiece of it,

1636
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:10,180
is that a dog would be sent...

1637
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:16,180
They bring up a kid and a kid had to whisper to the dog a couple articles of clothing.

1638
01:32:16,180 --> 01:32:18,180
And they tricked it where it was always...

1639
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:19,180
The first one is always a hat.

1640
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:22,180
Like they tricked the kid and say, you know, any article of clothing.

1641
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:28,180
Like a hat or pants or a hat or a scarf or a hat or a hat or socks or a hat.

1642
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:32,180
So that the dog would always go get a hat.

1643
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:35,180
But then the second one, things...

1644
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:37,180
The second article of clothing would always lead to this moment.

1645
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:40,180
And the second article of clothing was a little bit bawdy.

1646
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:41,180
Wow.

1647
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:45,180
He has not missed the second item.

1648
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:48,180
So, Kia, we are going to see at least one thing on your mind.

1649
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:50,180
And that item is...

1650
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:55,180
You asked for this?

1651
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:01,180
Oh, wow.

1652
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:03,180
I'm very sorry.

1653
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:14,180
Wow.

1654
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:15,180
Classic.

1655
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:16,180
That's good.

1656
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:17,180
Theme park entertainment.

1657
01:33:17,180 --> 01:33:21,180
And it makes everybody laugh, I think, without making anybody uncomfortable.

1658
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:23,180
Really for everybody.

1659
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:26,180
People laugh at that, but that dog got like in big trouble.

1660
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:29,180
He's on like the same cell block as Harvey Weinstein.

1661
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:34,180
The dog's pretending to be really old.

1662
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:38,180
A walker.

1663
01:33:38,180 --> 01:33:40,180
When since when does he have a cane?

1664
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:47,180
They got Epstein surveillance on him now.

1665
01:33:48,180 --> 01:33:50,180
Overworks this time.

1666
01:33:50,180 --> 01:33:52,180
Yeah, it worked last time too.

1667
01:33:55,180 --> 01:33:57,180
Okay, so this is a thing.

1668
01:33:57,180 --> 01:34:00,180
Now this show recently ended.

1669
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:04,180
They got rid of it and they're building a roller coaster in its place.

1670
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:05,180
Boo!

1671
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:06,180
We hate roller coasters.

1672
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:08,180
We like this kind of thing.

1673
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:12,180
And so we don't get to experience the same thing.

1674
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:14,180
We don't get to experience the same thing.

1675
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:16,180
We don't get to experience the same thing.

1676
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:22,180
And so we don't get to experience that moment anymore.

1677
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:31,180
This great moment of the offended housewife monkey coming out barely dressed and snatching her bra back.

1678
01:34:31,180 --> 01:34:33,180
We don't get to do this anymore.

1679
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:35,180
Unless...

1680
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:38,180
A what?

1681
01:34:38,180 --> 01:34:39,180
Bitch.

1682
01:34:39,180 --> 01:34:40,180
If you're...

1683
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:44,180
If you have a live monkey you have to tell me before the show.

1684
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:48,180
Get my fucking nose ripped off at podcast ride.

1685
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:51,180
It's a no, it's fine.

1686
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:53,180
Hey, you didn't see nope, right?

1687
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:54,180
You didn't see nope.

1688
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:55,180
Okay.

1689
01:34:55,180 --> 01:34:58,180
Oh, hopefully only your nose.

1690
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:01,180
Let's be honest.

1691
01:35:04,180 --> 01:35:06,180
Bitches back to Doughboys finally.

1692
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:11,180
The first episode after having his dick yanked off live on stage by an ape.

1693
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:15,180
Can't believe he found it. That fucking wily monkey.

1694
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:18,180
Took him a while.

1695
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:20,180
Monkey detective.

1696
01:35:20,180 --> 01:35:24,180
30 minutes of a monkey rooting around.

1697
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:26,180
Trying to...

1698
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:32,180
Pulling off pubes.

1699
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:34,180
Examining them.

1700
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:37,180
You're gonna have a monkey reattach it too?

1701
01:35:37,180 --> 01:35:39,180
See if that's gonna work.

1702
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:41,180
Okay.

1703
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:49,180
What we have just in the corner over there is a towel and a shower cap.

1704
01:35:49,180 --> 01:35:54,180
And feel free to pass the baton and make somebody else do this.

1705
01:35:54,180 --> 01:36:01,180
But Mitch, we were really hoping that you might be able to recreate this moment here.

1706
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:02,180
Oh my...

1707
01:36:02,180 --> 01:36:04,180
You pieces of shit.

1708
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:08,180
It's over there?

1709
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:10,180
It's over there. You'll find it in the way...

1710
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:16,180
And I know that you're a great monkey impersonator from that big ad campaign you booked for Cebada Mobile.

1711
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:19,180
You're great in that. I know you have the skills.

1712
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:21,180
If you're down.

1713
01:36:21,180 --> 01:36:22,180
Okay.

1714
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:23,180
Okay, okay, okay.

1715
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:25,180
Mitch is doing it. Mitch is doing it.

1716
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:27,180
Do we have the music too?

1717
01:36:27,180 --> 01:36:28,180
I think so.

1718
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:33,180
Okay. So I think let's do a little quick casting.

1719
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:35,180
Jason, you're the boy.

1720
01:36:35,180 --> 01:36:38,180
Oh yeah. Unless you can't speak anymore.

1721
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:44,180
I mean, I'm not feeling great, but I'll do my best.

1722
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:50,180
All you have to do actually is whisper in Mike's ear. I'm gonna cast you as the dog.

1723
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:51,180
Okay.

1724
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:53,180
Okay, okay, okay. You ready? Okay, okay.

1725
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:56,180
Wow, that's great. Oh my gosh. Well, he never misses.

1726
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:57,180
Do I guess?

1727
01:36:57,180 --> 01:37:00,180
No, not at all. No, don't be like him. Not at all.

1728
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:02,180
No, oh my god. No.

1729
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:05,180
No, no, no, no, no. Just put it on over the, you'll see.

1730
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:07,180
Over the pants.

1731
01:37:07,180 --> 01:37:08,180
No, it's not.

1732
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:12,180
Okay.

1733
01:37:13,180 --> 01:37:15,180
I'm really glad we clarified.

1734
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:18,180
We're not that big of pieces of shit.

1735
01:37:20,180 --> 01:37:23,180
Okay. All right. So, hey, buddy.

1736
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:26,180
So look, he brought you the captain's hat just like you asked for.

1737
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:30,180
Incredible. Brought you the candy thong on the second try. That's great.

1738
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:35,180
But now we're gonna go for number three, and can you whisper something into Mikey's ear?

1739
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:38,180
Here, Kuwait, come on over. Okay, okay.

1740
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:42,180
All right. Just any article of clothing. Any article of clothing in the world.

1741
01:37:43,180 --> 01:37:45,180
A ladies brassiere.

1742
01:37:46,180 --> 01:37:47,180
Okay.

1743
01:37:48,180 --> 01:37:52,180
All right. Let's send him back. Can you go find somewhere?

1744
01:37:56,180 --> 01:37:57,180
Okay.

1745
01:37:58,180 --> 01:38:00,180
Let's see, what do we got?

1746
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:03,180
And what does he bring? Oh, oh my god.

1747
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:04,180
What?

1748
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:08,180
What in the world?

1749
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:13,180
This is the bodiest thing I've seen in all my life.

1750
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:20,180
This is very offensive to a couple of people probably.

1751
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:23,180
Oh my gosh, wait a minute. You asked for this?

1752
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:28,180
Give it.

1753
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:53,180
The great Mike Mitchell, ladies and gentlemen.

1754
01:38:58,180 --> 01:39:00,180
I didn't commit that well.

1755
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:02,180
He did great.

1756
01:39:02,180 --> 01:39:07,180
I just did this. Touching the towel, I was like, this is not a good towel.

1757
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:11,180
It was not fresh for the show.

1758
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:13,180
Do you think it's the better material than this?

1759
01:39:14,180 --> 01:39:15,180
Yeah, try it.

1760
01:39:15,180 --> 01:39:19,180
It's very similar to that. Very similar to that, though.

1761
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:22,180
It's what's known as an aggressive Terry claw.

1762
01:39:23,180 --> 01:39:27,180
Normally you get French Terry. This is like German Terry.

1763
01:39:29,180 --> 01:39:31,180
Are we done? Is that what we're standing for?

1764
01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:33,180
Well, we're pretty much, yeah, I guess so.

1765
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:35,180
Don't we have to pick a bottom?

1766
01:39:35,180 --> 01:39:37,180
Yes, well, that's what we have to do.

1767
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:40,180
That's what we're going to, we're going to listen to the full stripper, I guess.

1768
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:41,180
Why not?

1769
01:39:41,180 --> 01:39:43,180
Wait, you know what? Cue it up again while Mitch picks.

1770
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:46,180
You know what? I want to watch the Empress Lily clip again.

1771
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:49,180
Stand up. Let's give it a standing ovation. All right.

1772
01:39:56,180 --> 01:40:02,180
And select from three fine restaurants, the Empress Room, Fisherman's Deck, and Student's Court.

1773
01:40:06,180 --> 01:40:08,180
I mean, that's my winner.

1774
01:40:08,180 --> 01:40:09,180
Yeah!

1775
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:11,180
Whoa!

1776
01:40:11,180 --> 01:40:18,180
Come on. I think, come on. Is there anything more body than that moment?

1777
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:21,180
It's really hard to think of it. It's impossible.

1778
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:28,180
Only you could see through the matrix and know that is the bodyest moment ever in theme park property.

1779
01:40:28,180 --> 01:40:32,180
No, it's not a man fucking Minnie Mouse.

1780
01:40:32,180 --> 01:40:34,180
From behind.

1781
01:40:34,180 --> 01:40:36,180
From behind.

1782
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:40,180
It's this boat and dinner scene.

1783
01:40:40,180 --> 01:40:44,180
You did it, you found it, buddy.

1784
01:40:44,180 --> 01:40:48,180
Yeah, Jason did it! Jason got it!

1785
01:40:48,180 --> 01:40:53,180
I won both shows. Yeah!

1786
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:58,180
Mitch, thank you so much for being here. Thanks for being a good show.

1787
01:40:58,180 --> 01:41:00,180
Thank you.

1788
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:05,180
Watch Twisted Metal this summer. Big old show with this guy.

1789
01:41:05,180 --> 01:41:11,180
And you all survived Podcast The Ride. Thank you so much for being here.

1790
01:41:11,180 --> 01:41:17,180
Thanks everybody on the live stream. Thanks everyone at Dynasty Typewriter.

1791
01:41:17,180 --> 01:41:20,180
Thanks to the people who are watching.

1792
01:41:20,180 --> 01:41:22,180
Thanks to the people who are watching.

1793
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:28,180
Thanks everybody on the live stream. Thanks everyone at Dynasty Typewriter.

1794
01:41:28,180 --> 01:41:32,180
And, and, we have a little one more thing.

1795
01:41:32,180 --> 01:41:37,180
We haven't, you know, it's been so exciting to do this tonight because we haven't done it in a while.

1796
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:44,180
And we wanted to make sure to not let another year go by before we do another live Podcast The Ride.

1797
01:41:44,180 --> 01:41:51,180
And that is why we're going to say right here, we're announcing for the first time the next Podcast The Ride live show,

1798
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:58,180
which is in, which is Saturday, July 22nd in Las Vegas, Nevada.

1799
01:41:58,180 --> 01:42:00,180
Yeah!

1800
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:03,180
I smell a road trip.

1801
01:42:03,180 --> 01:42:04,180
Uh oh.

1802
01:42:04,180 --> 01:42:07,180
Soak to see some of you there.

1803
01:42:07,180 --> 01:42:10,180
You guys were great. This was so much fun. Really appreciate it.

1804
01:42:10,180 --> 01:42:11,180
Thank you very much.

1805
01:42:11,180 --> 01:42:15,180
Everybody who did both, oh my God. We love you so much.

1806
01:42:21,180 --> 01:42:24,180
Numbers.

1807
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:28,180
Anyone want the other one?

1808
01:42:28,180 --> 01:42:32,180
Eisner wants it. Eisner's really, okay.

1809
01:42:32,180 --> 01:42:36,180
Yay! Young Hot Eisner gets the candy thong.

1810
01:42:36,180 --> 01:42:41,180
So long everybody. Bye! Thank you! Bye!

1811
01:42:51,180 --> 01:42:55,180
The world that you will find in your imagination.

1812
01:42:55,180 --> 01:43:03,180
Mysteries and magic, visions and fantasies, leading to strange and wondrous dreams.

1813
01:43:03,180 --> 01:43:13,180
Dreams that make believe, what could they all come to?

1814
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:23,180
You
