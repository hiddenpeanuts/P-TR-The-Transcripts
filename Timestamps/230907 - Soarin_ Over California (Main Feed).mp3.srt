1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,480
Forever!

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,540
Dog!

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:05,440
Warning!

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:11,200
The following podcast has very little CGI, which is kind of what makes it charming?

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:18,880
It may contain hypothetical buttons with earth-shattering consequences, fierce debate over golfer identities,

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,040
and little sailor suits.

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,600
Okay, let's review, no CGI buttons, golfer, sailor suits, anything else?

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,020
Oh yeah, have a nice flight.

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,760
It's Soarin' Over California on Podcast the Ride.

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,560
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the only podcast that releases special scents to complement

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,400
each host's introduction.

12
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,600
So get your phone nice and close to your face if you really want to get them.

13
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:09,320
You might be at this point sensing a full-bodied chardonnay with hints of apple and pear and

14
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,260
a buttery finish.

15
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,060
That'd be me, Scott Gardner.

16
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,140
Hello, hope that's a nice one for you.

17
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,820
That's kind of dissipating and now we're getting, what is this?

18
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,700
Oh, you know what it smells like is a six-course family-style dinner with roasted meats, mashed

19
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,160
potatoes and gravy and fresh baked rolls.

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,320
That's the preferred meal of a solo adult man on his way to the airport, Mike Carlson.

21
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,720
Hi, I'm here and you're forgetting, of course, the special ingredient to that scent, perspiration,

22
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,780
because the meal has to be finished fast.

23
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,380
So that is the secret ingredient to that delicious scent everyone is smelling right now.

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:42,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,160
Well, assuming you're hearing this early, towards the end of the day, maybe some of

26
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,060
the, you know, it's dripped away and you're not getting that full perspiration, but you

27
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,680
know, you get a crisp in the morning and you're getting the scent.

28
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,140
Oh, and this one, god, this one's a little hard to place, but now I'm getting, oh, and

29
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,080
I think I know it.

30
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,860
I think it's big old blunt.

31
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,140
That's Jason Sheridan.

32
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:07,100
I was wondering if it was going to be that or like Nathan's hot dog on a flat top grill.

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,260
Oh, that's not a bad one.

34
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,300
Hot dog water.

36
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,820
Hot dog water.

37
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,920
Hot dog water and chocolate, chocolate starfish.

38
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,040
That'd be good for the spray effect is getting hit with some hot dog water.

39
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,020
Oh, yeah.

40
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,440
Well, we hope you enjoy that because that's we think it's the scents that really make

41
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,540
this podcast a great podcast.

42
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,640
And here we are back from a little break on the main feed and we're coming back with

43
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,160
a big ride.

44
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,180
Who says we don't do big rides on this show?

45
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,020
Damn it.

46
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,940
Whoever said that is a fool and a liar.

47
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,500
And we're and we're we have it out for you now.

48
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,620
We're doing a big ride.

49
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,320
How's it feel?

50
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,300
Yeah, I'm mad at you.

51
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,160
Everyone is listening for saying things about me and this podcast.

52
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,360
Yeah.

53
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,140
So but but you're going to enjoy this.

54
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,440
But just know I'm mad.

55
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm you can hear it in my voice for you to enjoy for us to be upset, but to be angry

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,640
for making us stick to the premise of our own podcast.

57
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,300
No, it does.

58
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,220
It does feel good.

59
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,300
It feels good to be doing like a back to basics, a big blockbuster one.

60
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,900
But it's also we're doing it like we do it in twenty twenty three with some divisions.

61
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,460
Of course.

62
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:20,800
Yes.

63
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,260
There have to be which I think is it's in everyone's best interest because it creates

64
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,920
more episodes.

65
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,820
I mean, and that's the better way to do it.

66
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:35,100
Like, could we do a single five hour about all Soren possibly?

67
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:35,700
Yeah.

68
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:42,580
But the voices go at a certain point and our children cry for us.

69
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:42,820
Yeah.

70
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,820
So so we'll break it up.

71
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,660
And but you know what?

72
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,760
I also think I think we don't have to be so so crazed about the last thing we need here

73
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,120
is another haunted mansion style fiasco.

74
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:55,400
Right.

75
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,580
So let's just why don't we just we'll talk for 90 minutes to two hours.

76
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,040
We'll see.

77
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,620
It'll be roughly Soren over California.

78
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,580
This is how we've presented the title.

79
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:05,920
Right.

80
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,860
We don't get through all.

81
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:13,180
So maybe some California drips into drips into world or fantastic flight or whatever

82
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,600
you want to call flight the other ones.

83
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,040
Yeah.

84
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,440
Did you get to do it?

85
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,700
No, that was not happening.

86
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,100
No, no.

87
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,300
OK.

88
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,000
But oh my goodness, that Q.

89
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,500
Yeah.

90
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,100
Boy.

91
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:22,700
Yes.

92
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,780
That looks good.

93
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,900
What does it I don't know.

94
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,360
I don't want to start off underselling what we have here in California and what we chose.

95
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,700
But is it somehow better to you than photos of old aviators?

96
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,540
Oh, like, that's the North of Fairfield.

97
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,000
Like a museum on a budget.

98
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,640
You mean?

99
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,340
Yeah.

100
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,000
Perhaps.

101
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:45,440
Yeah.

102
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:45,940
Yeah.

103
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,560
Oh, severe budget, I should say.

104
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,060
Not like an original character, Camelia Falco.

105
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,200
Is that her name?

106
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,460
Yeah, that is.

107
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,280
It's close, at least if it's close.

108
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:56,860
The right name.

109
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,300
It is.

110
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:57,960
It's close.

111
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,060
But does she keep her urine in jars like Howard Hughes?

112
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,600
I don't think so.

113
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,160
But do you but have you been in the queue?

114
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:06,900
Do you know?

115
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,760
Do they address if Camelia Falco, who's in C, the Society of Explorers and Adventures?

116
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,320
Maybe they do say she keeps her pee in a jar.

117
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:15,980
I don't know.

118
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,420
I mean, I sincerely doubt it.

119
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,280
They got those crazy futuristic toilets in Japan.

120
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,020
So they do now, but she's from the past.

121
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,640
She's from the past.

122
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:29,060
I can only assume she would have like some steampunk really gigs sort of contraption.

123
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:29,740
Steampunk toilet?

124
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,280
Steampunk toilet?

125
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,160
Yeah.

126
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,940
So you pee in there and the steam shoots out and it powers another part of your plane,

127
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:37,400
maybe.

128
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,600
Yellow steam.

129
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,160
Then your plane is powered by your own yellow steam.

130
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,120
That's the process that Camelia Falco invented.

131
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,520
But we have an original character in this.

132
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:48,980
That's true.

133
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,420
We do.

134
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,860
Flight attendant Patrick.

135
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,360
And it is a legit popular, very popular character.

136
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,980
I'd say so.

137
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,140
One of the most beloved original theme park characters.

138
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:03,840
Does he play on a simple television set and not an eye popping holographic effect or not

139
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,340
hologram?

140
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,300
That's not the word.

141
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,280
I wouldn't think.

142
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,420
I don't know what it is.

143
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,440
That's how eye popping the effect is.

144
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:16,360
But you know, we're not here to be jealous of and chase after a ride that isn't close

145
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:16,960
to us.

146
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Whenever we get to world.

147
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,840
But let's just, you know what?

148
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,340
This will be, we'll try to get through California.

149
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,600
And if some world creeps in, then it does.

150
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,120
And if some California creeps into the other, because it's all one thing.

151
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:32,840
Ultimately.

152
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,580
Yeah, the ride itself isn't really that different.

153
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,280
No.

154
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,380
And thank God, because I think when there was a redo, there were some basics that you

155
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,680
don't want to lose.

156
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,880
I didn't want, I wasn't ready to lose chief flight attendant Patrick.

157
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,360
Right.

158
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,480
I wasn't ready to lose the score or at least the basis.

159
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,040
Yeah.

160
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,620
Of the score.

161
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,180
So it feels like they know what this franchise is.

162
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,040
What are the things that make the franchise the franchise?

163
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,300
the score with a red hot chili peppers track just to see what it would be like, but they

164
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:05,820
didn't do it.

165
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,180
And I don't think that's going to happen now.

166
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,200
Well, they got, they got letters about, I'm sorry.

167
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,160
Well, they got one letter about it.

168
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,800
Uh, signed Michael Carlson.

169
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,260
Yeah.

170
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,420
Um, I guess the one letter wasn't enough.

171
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,020
I, I, I synced up, uh, three different tracks from red hot chili pepper stadium,

172
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,120
Arcadium, just to show them what it would be like and close that in a hard drive that

173
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,520
I sent in a letter.

174
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,020
The bomb squad immediately blew it up in a controlled explosion.

175
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,440
They knew what it was too.

176
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,900
They didn't think it was a bomb.

177
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,300
That's why they knew what it was.

178
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,480
Sir, I'm not seeing any actual bomb capability.

179
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,320
No, no, no, no, no.

180
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,380
That's not what this is about.

181
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:43,920
Blow it.

182
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,560
It's a different kind of mission.

183
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:44,780
Yeah.

184
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,240
We're sound guarding guys.

185
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,400
They destroy it.

186
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,140
Yeah.

187
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,200
So yeah, they kept the core stuff that we like.

188
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,620
Um, and it's core stuff.

189
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,720
I will say I like a lot.

190
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,540
I'm a big soaring person.

191
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,460
I don't know.

192
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,920
This it'll keep it interesting.

193
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:06,320
If this is like a debate episode, I don't know if you guys are not as hot on Soren,

194
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,360
but I'm pretty hot on Soren.

195
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,160
Uh, this is a good question because I am hot for Soren, but as far as you soren

196
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,520
is an e-ticket I would say, right?

197
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,900
I don't think you'll find any debate in that respect about e-ticket.

198
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,240
Yeah.

199
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,500
Yeah.

200
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,180
But as far as the tickets, I do feel like maybe it's the one I go to the least.

201
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,640
Sure.

202
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,380
Of all of them.

203
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,460
And I was trying to analyze why that must, why that might be.

204
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,680
Um, so, so I don't want to say, I feel a little bit wrong saying I'm so hot for

205
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,780
Soren when it's not something that I go to every time I'm there, I don't make a

206
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,800
point to try and do it every time.

207
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,960
I don't know if I do either.

208
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,220
I think it's one where you gotta, you gotta watch that line pretty hard.

209
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,180
Oh, you got it.

210
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,020
And this is a struggle.

211
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,200
I think it's had the whole time.

212
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,680
I think in the early days in California where it was the only good thing to do

213
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,980
in California adventure, that wait time is getting way up there inordinately up

214
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,840
there and it's not the, it is not the most interesting line.

215
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,200
No.

216
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,020
There's things that I love in the line, but you know how it, there's, it's a

217
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,120
line where you might get stuck in the same spot for a good stretch of time.

218
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,820
And the spot might be a little bit claustrophobic.

219
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,260
Yeah.

220
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,060
Not as opposed to, I would essentially wait any amount of time for a

221
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,440
radio Springs racers, especially in single rider, which moves pretty, because

222
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,900
it's just a nice place to be.

223
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:35,820
This is one of the e-tickets where I might say the line is not necessary to do

224
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,360
ones.

225
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:37,900
Wow.

226
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:38,420
Wow.

227
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,720
Because you're not, what are you missing?

228
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,520
Wow.

229
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,000
Right.

230
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,840
I can't believe my ears.

231
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:44,800
I've done it.

232
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,060
So there's one I'm saying I've out of all of the like e-tickets because like,

233
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:49,940
yeah, what are you missing?

234
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,620
You're missing like the theme from Apollo 13 played for a couple of minutes.

235
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,900
Some of them aren't even like about like American president or something.

236
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,220
Yeah, I think so.

237
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,780
Just generally stirring music you get to hear that wasn't all made for this.

238
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,680
I think I saw Dragon Heart.

239
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,920
I think there's one song at Dragon Heart that is played at most theme parks.

240
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,420
Yeah.

241
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,700
In my experience, a number of miniature golf courses.

242
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,300
Because it's just, it's very starry.

243
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,940
You've been at multiple miniature golf courses that play a Dragon Heart theme.

244
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,920
I, I, well, there's two next to each other.

245
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,020
Um, wait, I'm, that's

246
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,020
doesn't count next to each other.

247
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,480
Which one?

248
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,820
I want to hear across the country.

249
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,440
No, I'm thinking of the one at Ocean City.

250
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,720
Maybe Castle Park played it at some point.

251
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,800
That sounds like an emotional round of golf.

252
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,560
It is cause they do like the pirates of the Caribbean.

253
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,580
Cause there's a pirates themed golf course.

254
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,120
And then it's just a lot of movie, orchestral themes.

255
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,400
And it is emotional.

256
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,140
Cause then you're thinking about everything Johnny's been through.

257
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,240
The way he's been running through the whole.

258
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,700
Yeah.

259
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,140
Fairly.

260
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,920
And, uh, and you're remembering the cologne you're currently wearing.

261
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,060
The Dior cologne.

262
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,380
Yeah.

263
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:00,560
Yeah.

264
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:00,840
Yeah.

265
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,780
Well, you start crying for Johnny and then the tears kind of mix up with the cologne.

266
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,960
That's all over your body and face.

267
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,100
Your chains, the wallet chains, the five wallet chains you have on.

268
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,520
As you walk, those like whip around and that smacks the cologne.

269
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,880
That's soaking it all over you.

270
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,920
Don't get one of those tangled in a putter.

271
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,240
You're going to be there all day.

272
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,660
I'm tangling that bad boy.

273
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,120
Whoops.

274
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:23,700
Whoa.

275
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,880
You fall into the lake.

276
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,700
Wow.

277
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,780
So Dragon hearted a miniature golf course.

278
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,100
Yeah.

279
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,500
Interesting.

280
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,420
Okay.

281
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,740
Um, well, yeah, no, I, I, I hear you.

282
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,900
Cause you get putty still.

283
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,820
You still get.

284
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,520
Patrick.

285
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:36,340
Uh huh.

286
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,340
Well, is this one of those situations where I, you know, if you could just get put

287
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:44,280
there, then you, which I can't imagine how you get in the ride without having to

288
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,080
watch Patrick.

289
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,800
Yeah.

290
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,420
Uh, so I, I don't know.

291
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,200
I might skit.

292
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,900
It's a skipper.

293
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,800
It might be a, you don't have to do it.

294
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,820
I only ever have to do it.

295
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,080
Wow.

296
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,860
It's, it's validating for me.

297
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,700
And then you would do there are any examples of this.

298
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,160
I don't think that's soaring in fantastic flight though.

299
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,600
Oh yeah.

300
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:00,940
Yeah.

301
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,080
No, that thing was a man.

302
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,220
It was extremely worth doing.

303
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:03,740
Yeah.

304
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,040
Disney world.

305
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,940
I was, I did it a couple of years ago and we had like extended hours.

306
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:15,180
So we walked through the queue and like walked right on and it's mostly just

307
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,920
glowing blue walkways.

308
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:18,760
Yes.

309
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,380
Now.

310
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:19,960
Yeah.

311
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,940
If I'm not saying the queue is good in Disney world, cause I really have only

312
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,280
done it once or twice, but at the very least you're walking in an old Epcot

313
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,680
building.

314
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,300
Yeah.

315
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,120
You're walking in an old Epcot building and I think those glowing blue walls

316
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,040
kind of add to the vibe.

317
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,820
Like the vibes on this ride are very good on the ride itself.

318
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,240
Yeah.

319
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,640
Extremely.

320
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,500
That's probably maybe the big selling point.

321
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,880
I think the big selling point.

322
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,340
Yeah.

323
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,040
Yeah, absolutely.

324
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,760
So there's like, there's like a sleek simplicity, I think to the Epcot version.

325
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,160
Yeah.

326
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,480
Well, this is, you know, maybe like debating the queues can be part of, I figure

327
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,060
that we can sort of save debate until we've heard both sides.

328
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,220
We've heard the plaintiff and the defendant.

329
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,960
Right, right, right.

330
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,840
Not to define which one is which in this, but let's, well, you know, we hear all

331
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,020
sides and then in closing arguments and number two, we can talk about, maybe you

332
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,000
score some points for a better queue.

333
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,520
Sure.

334
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,560
Well, I will, well, can I say this about the queue?

335
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,080
Go ahead.

336
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,180
Um, I, the outside is pretty brutal.

337
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,140
Um, it's just kind of nuts.

338
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,980
The outside line, the outside line.

339
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,560
I like the outside of it.

340
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,880
I like, oh, I like the exterior.

341
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,660
Don't get me wrong, but the switchbacks are just kind of nothing.

342
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,160
That's why I don't always do it.

343
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,380
I think you don't want to get caught in switchback land.

344
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,780
I like the old aviators, the old planes and the old aviators and stuff, but it is

345
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,160
kind of like on a slant downwards.

346
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,480
And so it's a little awkward to like comfortable.

347
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,400
You're like shifting your weight a lot.

348
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,700
I might not be very close to those pictures either.

349
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,000
Yeah.

350
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,140
And you're not very close.

351
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:52,940
Yeah.

352
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,420
Yeah.

353
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,520
So in the music, the museum aspect of it, yeah, it does feel like a museum.

354
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,720
That's maybe going under maybe selling off bits and pieces.

355
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,820
Underfunded museum.

356
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,660
There's one room open and they just took some pictures and threw the blurbs under

357
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,880
because they had to sell all of the actual artifacts.

358
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:10,940
Yeah.

359
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,380
Times you think they would've gotten an influx of, of support when it switched

360
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,380
from condor or flats to grizzly peak.

361
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:17,740
Nope.

362
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,600
This museum still going on.

363
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,080
Yeah.

364
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,940
The city didn't help the county.

365
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,620
Grizzly peak airfield for the completeness.

366
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,840
Grizzly peak airfield is not any condor flats anymore.

367
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,140
No.

368
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,080
Now.

369
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:31,720
Okay.

370
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,760
Uh, we're in the weeds.

371
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,520
The weeds are good.

372
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,540
We should be in the weeds.

373
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:35,680
Okay.

374
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,720
We'll get out of this.

375
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,740
A mildly accessible episode for two minutes.

376
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,140
All right.

377
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,780
Well, this is the ultimate ride.

378
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,260
I think where you know that like, uh, you know, that this ride is a hit with, with

379
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:51,520
regular folks, a great, a big ride, a great ride for people who don't go to

380
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,480
theme parks all the time.

381
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,720
And you know that a lot of people who don't, uh, you know, stay there mentally

382
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,480
and make this their whole lives, they go back home, they describe it to their

383
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,160
friends and they say it's, you know, what I really liked was the hang gliding ride.

384
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,460
And that's basically, that's the sum total of what we're talking about.

385
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:12,100
This is essentially the hang gliding ride, a simulated trip through the air

386
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,600
where you get to kick your feet and it's fully immersive and you see beautiful

387
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,800
sights today, more often you will see sites of the world.

388
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,340
You will see the real Matterhorn and the Eiffel tower, depending on where you are.

389
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:30,020
Uh, but as it started, it was sites of California and it was really the ride

390
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,140
that tied California adventure together.

391
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,200
Um, that's one way to put it.

392
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,380
That's the positive way to put it.

393
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,940
The negative way might be the only good ride that California adventure.

394
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,280
Saving grace of the whole park.

395
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:42,860
Yeah.

396
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,120
Yeah.

397
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,740
Might not be around were it not for someone.

398
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:46,500
Yeah.

399
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:52,880
And it is like, like you said, it kind of saving grace of California adventure.

400
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:59,440
And when you look at all the different notable places and scenery, mountains

401
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:06,000
and the beach and, uh, kayaking through the redwood, it's like, Oh yeah.

402
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,700
California is pretty terrific.

403
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,160
Huh?

404
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,680
Like pretty cool stuff here.

405
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,040
Huh?

406
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,920
It's almost, it, it makes you say the thing that the entire park

407
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,640
was supposed to make you say.

408
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,880
But even, but then it got, it gets muddied by it's cause it's

409
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,420
some of the same things, right?

410
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,360
It's like, ah, the beautiful redwoods.

411
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,880
But then there's like a, there's a big like statue of a goofy bear and there,

412
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,600
you know, like, uh, uh, and there's like, yeah, there's water, but then it's

413
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,940
all like purposefully chintzy carnival rides and a big orange and like, I think

414
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,900
what I think it was probably supposed to be grandeur in California adventure.

415
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,720
And I think there is today to some extent, but when it opened, I think the only,

416
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,140
the only bit of like true magic and awe that you're getting out of that park is

417
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,980
all in this ride.

418
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:49,940
Yeah.

419
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:56,420
I, I definitely a place making upgrade, uh, in the area when, when it went to

420
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:01,220
Grizzly peak airfield, cause I feel like craftsman style, the American arts and

421
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,720
crafts movement always in fashion, like mid century modern always looks good.

422
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,440
Always tasteful, very pleasant.

423
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,940
You know, I like that tint.

424
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,980
I like that green that the building greens and browns.

425
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,060
And then the kind of mustard yellow.

426
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,180
Uh, it was the color of Conan O'Brien's original set before.

427
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,060
Yeah.

428
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:20,780
Yeah.

429
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,760
I've got a must, a mustardy set, uh, made a little more pleasing by like 95.

430
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,260
This whole section of the park was very X games.

431
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,280
Yeah.

432
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,060
Take feud.

433
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:36,240
The X games pretty quickly losing Steve around this time.

434
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,440
I think too.

435
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:37,760
Yeah.

436
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,580
Um, the fonts had worn out their welcome.

437
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,160
Yeah.

438
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,840
Um, I think let's, let's say something towards the top here to, to quote, uh,

439
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,800
one of the great quotes in the show ever by a guest, Matt Appadaka, who said,

440
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,640
uh, this is a ride that moms love.

441
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,480
It's the Josh Groban of rides.

442
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,280
Um, a great quote, a quote that bears repeating and that really, that really

443
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,760
says it, I think that that it's that it's a, it, that makes it, I mean, sure.

444
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,520
That makes it sound lame, perhaps.

445
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:07,880
Sure.

446
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,300
Unless you're a big Groban head.

447
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:17,160
Uh, but I think it's like, um, it, the fact that it is this, like, that is this

448
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,300
relaxing ride and it's a ride that your mom can go on and your mom will love.

449
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,560
And pretty little kids can go on it.

450
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:29,820
Uh, I don't know what, what age you start being, uh, height eligible or, uh, but

451
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:37,740
like it is, it's, it's a rare ride that has big impressive, huge technology that

452
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,840
leaves you pretty astonished that this can even be done, but that isn't

453
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,740
scary or too thrilling.

454
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,600
Yes.

455
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,120
Yeah.

456
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,260
So it's a little exciting.

457
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:46,960
Uh huh.

458
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,680
You know, there's wind, you're kind of being moved around a little.

459
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,280
There's giant screen that you, if you sit in the right place, you

460
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,760
don't even see the edges.

461
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,100
It's the gentlest of all the e-tickets in a way, perhaps.

462
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,920
Are any other e-tickets gentle?

463
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,100
Are any other e-tickets gentle?

464
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,240
It depends on, I mean, literally the e-ticket.

465
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,460
System.

466
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,040
Um, uh, when it was in the park, I think by that, like it's a small world might

467
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,600
have been an e-ticket, but we kind of now define it as like the big blockbuster.

468
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,860
And those are usually kind of action oriented and credit coaster guardians.

469
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,060
That's interesting to a recap space mountain, um, big Thunder

470
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,540
radiator Springs, which is gentle.

471
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,340
But then you get fast and you get mild drops.

472
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:33,640
I don't know.

473
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,080
Is big Thunder a knee ticket anymore?

474
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,720
I almost think that's a step step.

475
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:38,600
All right.

476
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,160
That's a sad splash was any tickets.

477
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,240
That feels like, like downgrading Pluto.

478
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,980
It's a bummer.

479
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,740
I think it might not be.

480
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,220
I love it.

481
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:46,660
Yeah.

482
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,640
Do you think haunted mansion and pirates are e-tickets?

483
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,420
Just do do.

484
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,980
I don't think they are anymore.

485
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,580
Anymore.

486
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,720
I think they are.

487
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:02,020
I think you define it as, um, scope and scale and entertainment value.

488
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,120
And that makes it, um, like, like sheer volume of stuff.

489
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,480
I don't think I'm not going to give it to them.

490
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,120
Like, I'm not going to give it to them.

491
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:10,580
Wow.

492
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,160
Wow.

493
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,700
Roger Rabin.

494
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,020
No, no way.

495
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,460
Okay.

496
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:18,640
Fine.

497
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,860
We're all in agreement on that.

498
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,660
So it's pretty gentle.

499
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,080
Oh, it's star tours, but not Millennium Falcon.

500
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,700
Money, not an e-ticket, even though technology is crazy.

501
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,780
Impressive rise of the resistance.

502
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,540
Definitely.

503
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,540
Pushing to, I guess the next would be F, but you know what?

504
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,060
Uh, that's a strange way to put it.

505
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:38,780
Yeah, that's a strange way.

506
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,220
Maybe it breaks your system.

507
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,560
You skip it.

508
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,660
Like the, uh, you skip it like the 13th floor and you go to G, you go to G ticket,

509
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,460
which is, which is transformers, the ride only at end of story.

510
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,160
Well, I would, well, I, I like to call it an e-ticket for emotional ticket ticket

511
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,000
for your heart.

512
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,400
Yeah.

513
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,980
H ticket heart ticket.

514
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,300
Um, here's another big thing generally about this ride and any iteration of this

515
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,780
ride, um, it is a, it's non IP.

516
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:12,720
It is non IP and like a big popular ride that is non IP, but then also it's not

517
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,260
original IP, which is something we're starting to depart from the idea that

518
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,640
this will even happen again.

519
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,780
Cause what we, you know, you're like, I don't want it to just be characters from

520
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,860
the movies and Marvel P, you know, I want to, I want it to, that there's somebody

521
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,360
like shows up and like, I'm professor hog bottom and I'm here to, you know what I

522
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,740
like, you picture that with original theme park IP, which would be great.

523
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,340
That's what we want, but I don't think we're getting it so much.

524
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:42,160
So this is like a way it's, it's, it is neither, uh, it's just not IP at all.

525
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,300
It's not existing IP and it's not original theme park IP.

526
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,120
It's about vibes to go back to what it is.

527
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,280
Yes.

528
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,860
It's about vibes and it's got the, like the closest thing I was thinking about

529
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:58,860
this too is, and does this play into like, it doesn't have a ton of personality or

530
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,680
personalities other than Patrick.

531
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,420
Yeah.

532
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,440
The ride itself was very straightforward in a lot of ways versus a lot of the

533
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,000
other rides or almost all of the other rides.

534
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:08,900
It's kind of rare.

535
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,200
Okay.

536
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,380
We said, you know, we're talking about original characters and yes, there is

537
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,400
Patrick and you could do a toy of Patrick.

538
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,580
You could do a, you could do a Funko pop star.

539
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,600
It was a vinyl nation of him maybe, but not a park star.

540
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:21,800
Okay.

541
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,320
Oh, that's good.

542
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,080
I should get that.

543
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,740
I could be wrong.

544
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,900
Um, but, but you know, you would still have to squint at that.

545
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,620
What is that?

546
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,840
That's not, that's not.

547
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,360
Figment or, uh, I don't know.

548
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,180
Um, the, what else is a binder?

549
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,080
Uh, yes.

550
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:34,360
Yeah.

551
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:34,700
Yes.

552
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,520
Mainly those, uh, Leonardo Columbus.

553
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,060
You don't come out of it.

554
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,420
Yes.

555
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,060
Thinking of like the great iconic character like Leonardo Columbus.

556
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,440
Um, but it shows you that's okay.

557
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,020
I, you know, it's, it feels like in that sense, like the updated version of.

558
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:53,320
Maybe original, you know, people probably went to Disneyland in the early days and

559
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,340
we're just, we're wowed by, uh, mine train through nature's wonderland.

560
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:57,680
Yeah.

561
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,780
Or just, or being on the canoes of the Mark Twain, uh, uh, that, you know, you

562
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,380
start to think rides are where you meet a character and he gives you a mission or

563
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,540
whatever, uh, but this isn't that.

564
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,800
And, um, it, it proves that that works.

565
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,140
Yeah.

566
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,620
And it's definitely like, it's, it's in the tradition of like dream flight or

567
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:18,880
even like circle vision or all these different things that were presented much

568
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,660
more straightforward versus having professor hog bottom show up and dust his

569
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,580
coat off or low caught me at a bad time.

570
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,040
We're flushing them out and he's

571
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,380
going to have to flesh out for his.

572
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,060
But I think he's like, I think he's debuting a new contraption.

573
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,140
And of course your help.

574
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:37,600
Yeah.

575
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,540
If I had to guess what's going on with hog bottom, I don't want to push too far.

576
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:48,780
Feel like something's maybe gonna go not quite right with that contraption.

577
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,300
Okay.

578
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,220
Hog bottom hasn't dotted all the eyes and crossed all the T's maybe is a little

579
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:53,760
eccentric.

580
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,580
We're either going to be chasing that contraption or we're going to be on

581
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,760
the contraption and he's going to be chasing us to try and stop it.

582
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,860
Yeah, I think that's right.

583
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,540
Oh boy.

584
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,740
Well, I hope, uh, I hope he's up for the task and mainly I hope I'm up for the

585
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,240
task.

586
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:18,420
So let's, let's talk some history, how this thing ends up in the park, uh, kind

587
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:23,720
of an elongated history to it, seemingly a history predating California adventure.

588
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,460
It seems like they were maybe talking about this for Disneyland proper.

589
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:32,800
I don't know where or for what purpose, but you can, you can catch the original

590
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,540
working title ultra flight.

591
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,480
That's the coolest.

592
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,220
Yeah, that's pretty good.

593
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:42,520
But it's better, but it doesn't, it's not better for the ride that they made.

594
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:48,100
No, cause soren is by the way, wait, is it okay.

595
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,940
And some there's definitely sore.

596
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,980
Is it always soren apostrophe?

597
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,380
Is it always kind of that relaxed?

598
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,160
Oh, I know.

599
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,100
Slangy.

600
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,860
You mean on each?

601
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,000
No, in other countries it's got the G.

602
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:00,920
I see.

603
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,420
I see.

604
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,380
But here in, but okay, but it is soren over California.

605
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,140
It's soren.

606
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:05,460
Yeah.

607
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:05,700
Yeah.

608
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,820
Uh, in Florida and California, it's soren around the world.

609
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,300
Okay.

610
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,940
What that kind of casual chill.

611
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:12,440
Yeah.

612
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,600
That tells you what you're in for.

613
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,720
That's the right title for this.

614
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,680
Ultra flight is a cooler ride.

615
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,240
Ultra flight.

616
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,860
Yes.

617
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:25,900
Is probably way more futuristic and kind of gets psychedelic or rainbow road.

618
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,400
I would love to go on ultra flight.

619
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,840
Ultra flight is not relaxing.

620
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,000
I don't want that to be.

621
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,920
Well, it depends.

622
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:39,500
It could be relaxing in that like, like vapor wave or whatever the way.

623
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,300
Sure.

624
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,680
It could be relaxing until something goes wrong.

625
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,260
Yeah.

626
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,100
Well, it could be that too.

627
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,440
Professor Hogbottom didn't calibrate the instruments correctly.

628
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,420
Does he fit?

629
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,900
Is that to tomorrow land of a title and is professor Hogbottom to

630
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,360
Frontier land of a character?

631
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,180
Or do we think this could all tie together?

632
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,640
I mean, dream finders in the future world.

633
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,180
So, uh, could be.

634
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:16,240
There's discovery Bay and there is, you know, sort of the more Jules Verne

635
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,740
tomorrow land in Paris.

636
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,900
It could be a more, this could be a more steampunky premise.

637
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:21,320
Yes.

638
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:21,600
Correct.

639
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,100
Yeah.

640
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,520
Okay.

641
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:22,880
Yeah.

642
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,040
Ultra flight to me.

643
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,360
I don't know.

644
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,260
It feels like in the, whatever the Tronified tomorrow land.

645
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,420
It's like, are you pictures like kind of an out run, like you're, you're

646
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:35,320
traveling over a grid and the way those grids have like the, uh, like the

647
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,500
mountains way in the distance.

648
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,060
Uh, you know what I'm talking about?

649
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,880
That kind of like, yeah, maybe almost to me, it feels like going, if you've ever

650
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,460
seen, there's these great like long mega mixes and it'll be like Japanese city

651
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,460
pop or something on YouTube and they've got such like a cool, like anime

652
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,340
background that like loops.

653
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,140
Yeah.

654
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,540
And it's just kind of this, like, you got to get like hypnotized by it.

655
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,960
It's some version of that.

656
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:04,020
I think I buy your premise that ultra flight is the first city pop ride.

657
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,660
Oh my God.

658
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,020
I'm willing to come in and if hog bottom fits in this, he does, he

659
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:12,000
does it, but, uh, I don't think Disney, Hey, if they never built it, I don't

660
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,540
think they can lock that title down.

661
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,060
That's true.

662
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,760
It's going to be up for grabs at some point.

663
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,140
It's true.

664
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:16,460
Yeah.

665
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,800
Let's keep ultra flight in mind.

666
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:23,200
If for blue sky, I was kind of imagining if we're thinking about when, like

667
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,860
the late nineties, it seemed like they're working on ultra flight.

668
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:33,000
I'm thinking of in hackers when they're zooming through the internet, like

669
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,740
the internet is like fake computer cities.

670
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:36,560
Yeah, sure.

671
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:36,980
Yeah.

672
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,700
That's also, I now know from just watching it for some reason, that's

673
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,360
also the beginning of you've got mail.

674
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,040
So, yeah.

675
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:51,660
If you want a good sense of what ultra flight would be like, it's a digitized

676
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,680
kind of a circuit version of New York city, man.

677
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,120
Yeah, that's cool.

678
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,760
The ultimate cyberpunk movie.

679
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,960
You've got mail.

680
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,400
So subversive.

681
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,220
Yeah.

682
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,620
And they introduced the ride.

683
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,440
Hi, I'm Kathy.

684
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,960
And I'm James Fox.

685
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,300
Yeah.

686
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,000
Is that it?

687
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,780
Uh, I just watched it and I don't remember.

688
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,640
That's very pleasant vibes based movie.

689
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,160
Yeah.

690
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,040
It hooked us.

691
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,240
We, we put it on like, let's put it on cause it's stupid.

692
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,060
And then by the end, it's like, God, I hope they get together.

693
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,480
Okay.

694
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,680
I hope when she figures out it's him, she's not mad.

695
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,840
We were pretty shocked.

696
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,120
I've actually never seen it.

697
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:30,980
Uh, check it, check it out.

698
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:31,880
It's on Max.

699
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,980
It's your home for something dumb and I'll hate it.

700
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,680
Easy ultra flight.

701
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,520
Easy.

702
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,020
I only like cool shit.

703
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,960
Watch it with Lindsay to make fun of it.

704
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,800
Not cause it'll bring you together as a couple.

705
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,320
Yeah.

706
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:44,780
Good.

707
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,040
Good advice.

708
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,220
Um, but so the ride here, it's, I think this is one of these, like we haven't

709
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:55,040
had an idea for a ride and we want to simulate hang gliding, but now let's get

710
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,860
into logistics and the logistics we're getting them down.

711
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,100
How does this work?

712
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,500
It seems like there was, um, they, they talked about how they wanted it to be a

713
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:09,640
dry cleaning type mechanism, uh, of, you know, like the big belts that, uh, your

714
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,360
clothes go on and that that's still tough for me to picture, but that's somehow

715
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,080
like big chains kind of like swing you out and then you're invalid.

716
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:22,680
But imagine with that, that it's more like Simpson's ride back to the future.

717
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,000
Yeah.

718
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,060
Three levels.

719
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,860
And we've all been in irritating delays on that.

720
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:32,400
That ride takes either iteration of that ride takes forever to take off.

721
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:37,460
And then you're staffing every level of, uh, of that ride and it's a very slow load.

722
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,960
So that was, I think getting them down logistically, uh, how do we possibly like,

723
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,660
you know, the boring stuff got in the way.

724
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:52,800
So it got kind of sidelined until an Imagineer rose to the occasion and did

725
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,520
something that will be a story in every Disney special that goes behind the

726
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,780
scenes from now on their five timer.

727
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:06,400
This is a now a Disney special five timer, but I celebrate it and I will look

728
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,120
forward to watching it every time.

729
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,120
Uh, I will always watch when the little demonstration is done.

730
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,920
Does anybody else want to explain this or should I?

731
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,480
Do you have his name?

732
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,640
Mark Sumner.

733
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,620
Mark Sumner.

734
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,040
Yeah.

735
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:19,920
Huh?

736
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,500
Reclaiming the name Sumner for good away from the clutches of, uh, weird,

737
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,660
weird old foot robe fetishes.

738
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:37,360
Elderly pervert from now on when you hear the name Sumner.

739
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,860
Oh no, please explain the erector set story.

740
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,580
If we get him started on Sumner, we're never getting out of here.

741
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,960
Erector set.

742
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,980
It gives me the machinery that makes it.

743
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,980
I own erector set at all times.

744
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:52,480
Dr.

745
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:56,740
Hawk washes to trash has been taken over by the ghost of Sumner redstone.

746
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,400
I'm an engineer has worked for 10 years to make mine work again.

747
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,040
And they finally figured it out.

748
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:02,880
Thank you, Mark.

749
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,540
So nervous.

750
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,680
The hardest job they ever did.

751
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,180
They started with a dry cleaning mechanism, but it didn't work.

752
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,040
Just irritated down there.

753
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,680
They almost had to chop it off and start over.

754
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:18,560
Okay.

755
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,920
Now we've said horrible things.

756
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,100
What's the, the actually nice story from Mark Sumner?

757
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,200
Because he's thinking about it.

758
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,160
He's like, there must be a way.

759
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,520
There's gotta be a simpler way.

760
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,980
Like he's kind of feeling it, seeing how we can make this mechanism work.

761
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,080
But then he's got a, he goes home.

762
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,060
He goes into the attic.

763
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,740
Should I just do it?

764
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,160
Oh yeah.

765
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,000
Yeah.

766
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,920
Well, he finds an erector set.

767
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,160
He starts tinkering.

768
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,060
I love this story is about imagineers tinkering.

769
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,880
Like this, the story about Tony Baxter trying to get hired there.

770
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,480
And they're like, yeah, yeah, we see dark ride presentations all the time.

771
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:58,500
Then he takes them down to trunk of his car and he's got like a whirly

772
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,360
bird, like a Rube Goldberg kind of device.

773
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,480
And they're all like, Oh, everyone come out here.

774
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,120
Like, didn't you make a whole Mary Poppins ride?

775
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,400
Well, that was just drawn.

776
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,100
I believe.

777
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:09,580
Yeah.

778
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,600
That's a video online of that, which is good.

779
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,180
Looks cool.

780
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:16,080
Which I think that didn't get him that got him on people's radar, but I

781
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,160
don't think that got him the job.

782
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,640
Oh, okay.

783
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,180
Yeah.

784
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:22,780
But this, this sort of like the way it's described, it reminds me of the

785
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:28,900
like rolly crump tower, the form winds where it's just like a lot of moving

786
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,460
practical moving parts.

787
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:30,960
Sure.

788
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,280
Sure.

789
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,320
So that's another tinkering story.

790
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,200
And this is what the erector, he built sort of like a proof of concept with an

791
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:44,040
erector set of like, what if we, we load people in these rows and then we rise

792
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:48,920
them all, raise them all up where they are all on one level, but then one big

793
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,760
arm swings out, but they're all on like different, I will be out of my depths

794
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,980
as soon as I try to say anything.

795
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,660
Even though I think they all dangle down from there.

796
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,560
They like, they, the, each row like fans out.

797
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:06,300
Essentially it, it goes from like facing a flat on the ground and it goes 90

798
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:06,980
degrees up.

799
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,160
So they're all stacked and then swings back down.

800
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,720
It's like a mall.

801
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:15,000
It's like a, it's like a shoe caddy when it's on the floor and then you pull it

802
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,260
up and all the caddy little things open up so you can put shoes in it.

803
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:18,680
Sure.

804
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,920
That's the way I like to think of it.

805
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,980
I don't have one of those and I need a refresher of what a shoe caddy is.

806
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,940
Jason, you know what I'm talking about?

807
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:25,980
I know what it is.

808
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,380
I don't think you're making it up, but I just haven't had one.

809
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,780
Just kind of a kick them under the bed or under a chair kind of guy myself.

810
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,240
How many pairs do you have?

811
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,620
I have like eight or 10 pairs of shoes.

812
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:38,200
Okay.

813
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,160
You need a caddy.

814
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:39,800
Yeah.

815
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,520
I need a caddy.

816
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,340
Well, I'm moving.

817
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,680
Maybe I get myself a caddy.

818
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,220
Or somebody can get it for you for a present.

819
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,620
Oh, I guess I'm getting a caddy.

820
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,840
It feels like you're volunteer.

821
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,720
If you're the one saying you need a cat, it seems like now you have to.

822
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,280
Maybe you're, we could start a GoFundMe for his shoe caddy.

823
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,280
Amazon wishlist for Jason.

824
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,660
Oh man.

825
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,000
No times are tough.

826
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,660
No, the economy's not great in inflation, but there is a guy he, uh,

827
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,660
has he not entertained you for, for years now?

828
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,320
Have podcasters started posting their Amazon wishlist.

829
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,420
And it's all yours is all just shoe caddies.

830
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,100
It's all different shoe caddies.

831
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,540
Well, I got to try them all and then I'm going to return the ones that don't work.

832
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,980
Either you have store return.

833
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,640
It's, it is convenient.

834
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,360
Yeah, of course it is.

835
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,120
Um, uh, then you'll need a caddy for shoe caddies.

836
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,260
A shoe caddy caddy.

837
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:31,840
Oh yeah.

838
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,760
We're getting real into the bag hutch.

839
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:34,920
Tori.

840
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:35,660
Oh yeah.

841
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:41,240
Um, but yeah, basically with this invention, and it is such a revelation when you see

842
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:46,220
it in a special the first time it's crazy to see up like a mechanism that you know,

843
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:49,960
and that you're impressed by every time you go on and then to see that this rusty

844
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,220
old or these erector set pieces perfectly replicated.

845
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,640
I'd freak if I saw the erector set in person.

846
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,120
I don't know if he just keeps it.

847
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,020
Uh, yeah, cause it seems like he seems like he has to keep it so he can bring it

848
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,060
out for specials every now and again.

849
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:07,260
But if he ever decides to donate it or don't sell it, don't sell it.

850
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,760
It belongs in a museum, a better museum than the one in the line.

851
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,400
It should be in the line.

852
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,660
I guess so.

853
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,860
They should make a little, I mean, I guess there's no physical.

854
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,780
Um, it's like a great of flights.

855
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,100
Yeah.

856
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,760
And they can make a, yeah, yeah, yeah.

857
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,560
They should do that.

858
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,080
Yeah.

859
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,200
Um, well, good idea.

860
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:23,600
Do it.

861
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,920
Disney take that one for free.

862
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:30,360
Um, but yeah, it's, um, it's, it's so cool and a genius and it helped him load quicker.

863
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,980
And it really that, you know, that what that leads to is that you're, you get in

864
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:39,920
there the first time, especially you get in and you're confused about what exactly

865
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,940
you're in for it.

866
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,560
Cause maybe you can't see the size of that screen yet.

867
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,600
It's just kind of that gentle blue, which that's a thing I really love.

868
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:51,060
I like, I like that room before anything happens.

869
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,160
There's just kind of, you know, it's not a full score, but it's just kind of this,

870
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,780
like, uh, this hum, this drone that's a little exciting and the anticipations

871
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:02,760
building and the specific blue, I think is very relaxing.

872
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:06,620
And then those lights on the floor and you can always feel that there is, I

873
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:10,420
think every time that you're in there that aren't, that aren't new people who

874
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,580
haven't done it before.

875
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,780
So you could feel that you could feel everybody going, is this going to be a

876
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,460
scary one or what is this?

877
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,000
Um, it's always, it's exciting.

878
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,440
The pre-launch is very exciting.

879
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:24,300
The big blue circle, uh, very much feels like a sci-fi thing.

880
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,820
Like we're about to transport somewhere to me.

881
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,080
That's like a star gate or something.

882
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,960
Um, but it is, like there's a hum in there.

883
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,120
It's like, just a little hum that gives you a little mood, but it's not, I guess

884
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:42,140
it, it does, it's not sinister, but it could, that's the closest the ride is to

885
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,160
making you feel nervous.

886
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,220
I think it's that.

887
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,840
It's ominously neutral because it would fit a ride that gets scarier.

888
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,340
Right.

889
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,500
And you kind of assume that like, I know how these things go.

890
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,840
This is going to be, it's going to do something I don't expect.

891
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,040
And that's going to be scary.

892
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,540
Right.

893
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,500
And then it subverts the expectation.

894
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,580
well, is it only going to build from here?

895
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:09,640
But in fact, that's kind of the only mildly nerve wracking thing that happens.

896
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,220
Yes.

897
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:10,520
Yes.

898
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:16,720
It's, uh, it's, I wish we've, I've, I've been on these things hundreds of times.

899
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,280
I don't know.

900
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:21,020
I don't think I've been on soren a hundred times, but I probably been on soren

901
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,700
like 50 times, 40 to 40 times.

902
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,200
Right.

903
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,240
I'll tell you what I wrote it a lot.

904
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:34,840
I'd say like 10, 15, 10, 15 years ago or so at this point, I think when they were

905
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:42,860
really redoing a lot of California adventure and I think soren it would have

906
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:50,500
long waits, but especially in the fast past days, it does eat up like 87 people

907
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,480
at a time.

908
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,260
Yeah.

909
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:52,880
Sure.

910
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,840
Is that, are you saying that's a lot or are you?

911
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,540
No, no.

912
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,880
I, yeah, I'm saying that's a lot.

913
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,360
Each theater holds 87 people.

914
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,160
Yeah, it does.

915
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,260
And there's two theaters, I believe.

916
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:02,660
Yeah.

917
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,140
Cause there's two.

918
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:04,380
Yeah.

919
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:08,100
I was going to say though, this ride backs up a lot.

920
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,480
Yep.

921
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,860
And like, even though it seems to eat a bunch of people at once, I cannot

922
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:16,620
count the amount of times I'm just stuck in that hallway back there waiting.

923
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:22,180
You're not wrong, but when the whole park was a construction site, it was one of

924
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,120
the few things that was like untouched.

925
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,340
Saved it then too.

926
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,300
It's been the savior of this park twice.

927
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:27,660
Yeah.

928
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,060
Yeah.

929
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:32,080
Um, but I just wish I could remember like the first time I ever went on it.

930
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,200
Cause now it's become, I've become so comfortable on it.

931
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,420
I'm so comfortable on it.

932
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,620
I even like lean forward in the belt, which is not something.

933
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,920
Cause you know, me and the legs dangling, this is the most comfortable legs dangling

934
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,180
ride.

935
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,120
I have no fear on this ride with as far as my legs dangling.

936
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:54,080
I had this question cause we can keep doing it in order and history and

937
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,640
that kind of thing.

938
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:59,260
But in terms of our just basic experience stuff, what are you doing with your

939
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,240
legs on these rides?

940
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,200
What do you, do you have any like, I know I'm going to be on that thing and am I,

941
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,640
am I going to kick back and forth?

942
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,000
Am I going to stretch out?

943
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,740
Uh, or do you just sit normally?

944
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,740
I can tell you what I do.

945
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,600
And this is going to seem like I'm the daredevil of the group and maybe I'm,

946
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,860
but maybe I'm not, maybe everybody does.

947
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:15,280
Wow.

948
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,240
A new itemizer being what I do.

949
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,040
Here's what I do.

950
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,360
I, I'll obviously the first row is the best.

951
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,120
And the hot tip is you ask the person if you could go in the front row and they'll

952
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,180
generally hold you for a second.

953
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,280
If you've ever done this,

954
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,700
um, hold you closer.

955
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

956
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,000
I was going to ask, yes.

957
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:35,940
Hold you tight.

958
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:36,520
Long hug.

959
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,160
Yeah.

960
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,900
Um, but the front row, that's the one where you can't really, you can't see

961
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,240
anyone, there's nobody above you.

962
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:47,480
Uh, and then I have the belt, you know, and then basically what I do is I put,

963
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,280
put all my weight forward on the ride.

964
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,140
So I'm kind of like going like this with my legs out, use it like with my weight

965
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,100
against the belt.

966
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,680
You're trying to, okay.

967
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,620
If you're enveloped by the whole thing from the start, but then you are trying to

968
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,640
like get even past your mechanism.

969
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,800
So it looks like, so you're just like free flying through the air.

970
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,880
I want a little float.

971
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,000
I want a little float.

972
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,740
What you're like, you're like Supermanning a little bit.

973
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,120
Yeah.

974
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,920
As much as you can in a chair, but yeah, that's what I like kind of do.

975
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:21,100
I kind of like to put my arms and feet out and try to immerse myself even more,

976
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:25,340
but it is definitely a little bit of a daredevil thing for me.

977
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:25,660
Yeah.

978
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,680
I'm really being honest.

979
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,260
I like kicking my little legs a little, but you're not leaning forward.

980
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,540
You're just kind of kicking them.

981
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:31,880
Not really.

982
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,240
No, you're not doing the cool thing.

983
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,700
I'm not doing the thing I am doing.

984
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,600
You're not doing the brave thing I'm doing.

985
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:42,040
No, if I get a chair, I immediately figure out how to sit back into it.

986
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,780
I was really get relaxation.

987
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,660
Is there one that reclines in the row?

988
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,640
I don't think so.

989
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,940
You're in the chair that reclines in this room.

990
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,340
Yeah, sorry.

991
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,060
If you ever, that's up for grabs.

992
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:56,900
You can do it.

993
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,320
I'm sorry.

994
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,740
Guys, when you come in for the show, just call shotgun.

995
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,200
And I'm leaning forward right now.

996
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,120
I mean, I've gone back.

997
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,320
That's you got very excited.

998
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,900
Well, yeah, I like to kind of put all my limbs forward.

999
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,140
Well, you're on the right recording.

1000
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:16,520
I remember going on this in 2006 for the first time, like me and my buddy.

1001
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,180
We're out here for college internships.

1002
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:24,680
And we they had already done like the day trip to Disney World.

1003
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,720
And I had already been Disney World a lot of times that semester

1004
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,940
because it was one of my main interests, Disney World and

1005
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,020
going to shows at UCB.

1006
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,620
And now you could say Disney World three times in a row.

1007
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,080
Disneyland.

1008
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,580
No, Disney World.

1009
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,960
I was in Disney World the summers of 2005 and 2006.

1010
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:52,140
And an effort we tried to do soaring it at ridiculously long waits.

1011
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:52,760
Sure.

1012
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,660
So it was very new.

1013
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,500
I had no idea what it was,

1014
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,940
because if you remember the marketing on like billboards and park maps,

1015
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,700
it's just kind of a poorly Photoshopped family and a hang glider

1016
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,260
in front of like the Golden Gate Bridge.

1017
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,260
Mm hmm.

1018
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,360
Doesn't tell you exactly.

1019
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,240
It doesn't tell me.

1020
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,580
You can't make out your tails what that vehicle is necessarily.

1021
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,160
Yeah.

1022
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:22,220
And I think, you know, YouTube just starting to catch on in 2005, 2006.

1023
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,300
So it's not like nowadays where you get 4K video of rides

1024
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,560
from every possible angle you could want, you know.

1025
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,320
Yeah.

1026
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,160
So it was mysterious, you're saying.

1027
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,440
It was a little mysterious.

1028
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,780
And when you walk in the room with the lights and the blue glow and big screen.

1029
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,800
So you kind of remember the first time you went on it.

1030
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:44,500
I remember like, oh, I kind of don't know what this is.

1031
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:48,740
But I know it seems to be the most popular thing in this park.

1032
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,100
Sure.

1033
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:49,240
Sure.

1034
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:49,640
I remember.

1035
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,120
I don't know if I remember my first.

1036
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,300
Isn't it funny you build up the first to this?

1037
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:54,640
I know.

1038
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,860
It's going to be this like momentous thing.

1039
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,520
And then it's just kind of it's just lost in the pile.

1040
00:42:58,620 --> 00:42:59,060
Yeah.

1041
00:42:59,240 --> 00:42:59,960
I need to get hypnotherapy.

1042
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,220
Take the pressure off the first.

1043
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,920
It's not a big deal.

1044
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:08,100
Also, the first time we went to DCA, we had gotten a park hopper

1045
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:13,040
and we did pretty much 90 percent of the park by noon.

1046
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:13,820
OK.

1047
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,540
So yeah, pretty damning.

1048
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:15,940
Yeah.

1049
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,620
That's the you miss the old DCA, you said.

1050
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,180
Well, it was very relaxing.

1051
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,940
You got half the day waiting for you and do nothing.

1052
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,300
You know, no pressure.

1053
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,180
You had a pressure.

1054
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,160
If you had a OK, I put two buttons in front of you.

1055
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,180
OK, one keeps it DCA as is now.

1056
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:36,120
The other button changes it back to what it was in the first two years.

1057
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,040
This is Oppenheimer.

1058
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:38,920
You're a monster.

1059
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,560
Uninvent this.

1060
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,200
Which button do you hit?

1061
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,040
No one will know.

1062
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:43,900
By the way, I'll say this.

1063
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,000
They'll be anonymous.

1064
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,760
No one will know that you've reverted it back to original Disney's

1065
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:48,880
California.

1066
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,760
Like, you are going to know if they heard the scenario.

1067
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,760
It's changed, but they won't know.

1068
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,680
Like it'll erase their mind.

1069
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:56,540
It'll erase their mind.

1070
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,820
Our machine, you'll know what you did.

1071
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:01,420
You'll have to live with that on your conscience.

1072
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,520
What does it take?

1073
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:03,380
Give me a year.

1074
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,320
This is pre we got no cars land.

1075
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:06,200
No car.

1076
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:06,420
Yeah.

1077
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,520
Pre all the all the good stuff is gone.

1078
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,560
It's back to early.

1079
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,520
You got the what's the farm called?

1080
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,480
Bountiful Valley Bountiful Valley.

1081
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,500
Farmers back bigger bread samples, bigger sourdough bread.

1082
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,300
Fact, it's not so your star limo is there.

1083
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,480
Let me ask.

1084
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,960
Am I taking it all the way all of the world back to

1085
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,560
the first half of 2001?

1086
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,480
Because I feel like there's more important stuff I should do that.

1087
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,440
OK, she can't do that machine.

1088
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,980
All we can do is revert the theme park back to its state.

1089
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,920
Back in like those years.

1090
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,460
But Richard Kelly's the box.

1091
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:41,680
Yeah, you could.

1092
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,600
There's so many scenarios this exactly like.

1093
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:44,780
Wouldn't it, though?

1094
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,200
Wait, that's a good question.

1095
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,680
Would it erase 9-11?

1096
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,960
The way I've invented it, no.

1097
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,280
But I guess if you want to give us an area where everything else

1098
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,780
that would invent 9-11.

1099
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,220
Yeah, yeah, everything still happened.

1100
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,940
It's like the end of when they bring all the characters back in end game

1101
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,740
and the world has still happened, but they are bringing them all back.

1102
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,960
It's just that that life has changed.

1103
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,160
And now they are going to have to adapt to what's happened in five years.

1104
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:14,760
OK, OK, so the twin towers are still gone.

1105
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,820
But is the Tower of Terror there?

1106
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,540
Oh, but yeah, the Tower of Terror will be gone before Tower of.

1107
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,780
Four is right before.

1108
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,060
OK.

1109
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,760
Well, this isn't my question for me.

1110
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,600
I will let Jason answer.

1111
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,220
The Tower of Terror is being built.

1112
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,080
You can see it.

1113
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,300
It's not open yet and it won't open.

1114
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,400
Well, why won't it open?

1115
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,840
There's an issue with the fall over.

1116
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,800
It's going to well, there will be an issue with building it.

1117
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,640
And then it kind of gets stuck.

1118
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,540
And it's like kind of like that target on sunset.

1119
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,160
It's just going to be like that for a while.

1120
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,580
I kind of well, that also means there's now going to be dozens of vloggers

1121
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,280
who are like, what up, fam?

1122
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,500
We're going to get Big Macs, a burger invasion.

1123
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,120
And we're going to eat them on the machines.

1124
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,580
The Baltham Valley Park, the dinosaur with the sunglasses is back.

1125
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,800
I bought sunglasses there once.

1126
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,900
OK, stop avoiding the question.

1127
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,660
Yeah, what do you think?

1128
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,360
I don't think so.

1129
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,120
At the very least for Guardians and the giant candy bar

1130
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:11,480
that I got to give another chance to the giant candy bar.

1131
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,860
Oh, do you not like the giant candy bar?

1132
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,320
Well, we give it another chance.

1133
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:20,360
His list of things that he wanted to retain had something that then you're

1134
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,380
now you're qualifying.

1135
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,060
Well, I still got to give it another chance.

1136
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,660
We ate it like the third day was open very quickly.

1137
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:29,820
Everyone wearing masks outdoors.

1138
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,420
We barely got a table.

1139
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,800
I thought that was really good.

1140
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,980
The big candy bar.

1141
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,120
I was really, really hard on all the frozen and I don't know what was wrong.

1142
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,520
Something seemed wrong.

1143
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,180
I mean, but the food I had the second time was better.

1144
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,100
I think it was you on the day, though.

1145
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,320
It might have been me on the day.

1146
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,400
And I don't know what it was.

1147
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,760
I'm saying something off.

1148
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,020
It was a pretty rough roll out that first day.

1149
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,880
But when I when I eat the candy bar, I'm like, this is good.

1150
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,420
And then Jason's like, I don't know about this little too much.

1151
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:01,740
I think the karma was really pulling on my my molars.

1152
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,180
So wait a minute.

1153
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,920
Your list of why you won't blow up the theme park is Guardians Mission Breakout,

1154
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:12,980
not Radiator Springs racers and the promise of the big candy bar.

1155
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,260
The promise of the big candy bar that you didn't like and it pulled on your molars.

1156
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,040
Big plant based people.

1157
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,520
I love Guardian.

1158
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,320
You never know what song you're going to get.

1159
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,180
I wasn't arguing.

1160
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,660
I don't want to make sense to me.

1161
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,600
I wasn't here.

1162
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,100
If you're not bringing it's just weird that radius.

1163
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:30,940
Those are the two choices.

1164
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:32,680
Okay.

1165
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:34,080
Okay.

1166
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,160
Okay.

1167
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:35,560
Hold on.

1168
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,340
I hate to.

1169
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,360
I hate to do this.

1170
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,400
This episode is going to go on.

1171
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,900
Yeah, we're not going to get to the sequence of scenes.

1172
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,440
Say you save it and you go back to California Adventure and you try that big candy bar again

1173
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,200
and it sucks.

1174
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:47,680
Shit.

1175
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:48,880
You hate it.

1176
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,640
I put the two buttons on the table at Pym Test Kitchen again.

1177
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,280
Do you hit the button to change it back?

1178
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,560
I don't think so.

1179
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:03,500
I don't think so because in 2001 there was also no churro toffee.

1180
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:05,620
And that's pretty good.

1181
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:06,480
Churro bar.

1182
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,560
Whatever they call it.

1183
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:14,080
I just asked because you have said that you really you miss it and I've never.

1184
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,380
I've not heard that very much.

1185
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,860
That's the only reason I offer this scenario to you.

1186
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:20,880
I mean it was just kind of fun to have a part to yourself.

1187
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,040
It was just kind of.

1188
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:23,520
All right.

1189
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,440
Stretch out.

1190
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:31,240
Well you need a button that just like you know like makes millions and millions of people disappear.

1191
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:31,940
Okay.

1192
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,480
You need the Thanos a bunch of them.

1193
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:33,780
Yeah.

1194
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,580
You just need to snap some and I'm sure they're fine people.

1195
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,680
You have nothing against them but.

1196
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,920
So I'll throw the infinity glove down on the table at you with all the stones and then you'll

1197
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:47,680
snap and get rid of most of the people in California Adventure which is what you're looking for.

1198
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,900
Oh can I use any of the other stones?

1199
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,720
Can I do anything else with the glove?

1200
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,720
No you can just kill everybody.

1201
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:57,200
I feel like Mike could stop.

1202
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:02,520
So well now look I was going to say we're going to stop 9-11 but this itself is a much worse tragedy.

1203
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:05,100
We already met so many more people.

1204
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:05,680
Half the earth is gone.

1205
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:06,500
Yeah.

1206
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,080
No this dwarfs 9-11.

1207
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:08,400
Yeah.

1208
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,240
9-11 is nothing now.

1209
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,140
Well that's fine.

1210
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,300
If you can do it or get with Professor Hogbottom and see if he's got.

1211
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:18,900
He has his own special glove but we don't have to get into that now.

1212
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:19,320
Yeah yeah.

1213
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,900
No we're building his IP slowly.

1214
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,100
We're here to talk about Soren.

1215
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:28,800
Okay so I mean maybe we just got to.

1216
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,100
I'm just going to say it.

1217
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:30,960
I'm just going to say it.

1218
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:31,420
War burden.

1219
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,040
Let's make sure we can talk about other stuff in the line.

1220
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:39,340
Museum we don't like.

1221
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:39,720
Sure.

1222
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,220
Or we can talk about the great.

1223
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:41,960
The man.

1224
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,980
One of the great pre-shows.

1225
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,080
Question the best video.

1226
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:47,520
Who?

1227
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,300
The best video.

1228
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,740
Yeah that's.

1229
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:50,660
Well.

1230
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,040
Well you answer.

1231
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:52,680
What do you think?

1232
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,660
I'm trying to think.

1233
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:55,210
Yeah it's.

1234
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,180
I might say top three.

1235
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,900
Because I can in good conscience.

1236
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,380
Not.

1237
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:03,940
I don't know where.

1238
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,880
I don't know if it's number one but back to the future of the ride.

1239
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:07,360
Yeah.

1240
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:12,000
Original Chris Lloyd is Doc Brown and original Thomas Wilson is Biff.

1241
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,560
And they're being themselves and they got it and they nailed the time that thing.

1242
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,380
It's so long you get so much more of them.

1243
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:23,040
It's hard to not say plus rules plus that add a lot of great rules too.

1244
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,860
This is a very good unfurling of rules.

1245
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:26,660
Yeah yeah.

1246
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,760
One of like one of the classic just ways to get rules.

1247
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,940
I mean I yeah.

1248
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:35,440
The Simpsons ride is frustrating sometimes I think so much of that is was fun.

1249
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:39,100
Not that it's better necessarily I'm just trying to think of.

1250
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,340
I'm almost like well this isn't fair.

1251
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,100
You got to group all videos together.

1252
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:50,920
Ultimately but I'm like videos where a person says welcome to this.

1253
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,220
Here's what you got to know.

1254
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,060
Yeah right.

1255
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:53,980
It's pretty good.

1256
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:54,920
It's pretty good.

1257
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,480
I wouldn't be mad at a number one placement though.

1258
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:58,300
Yeah.

1259
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:59,660
I wouldn't be offended by that.

1260
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:02,560
Is any I mean does anything else strike you is it mean is it just.

1261
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,010
Well it's somehow just like original star tours or.

1262
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:10,220
Yeah original start was up there but I feel like so much this.

1263
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,640
Ended up being more iconic in a way.

1264
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:15,240
Yeah maybe more memorable.

1265
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:20,460
That it stays that they didn't replace it when they changed it to world.

1266
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:24,400
And there's something almost hypnotic about the.

1267
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:30,940
That it's not I can sit when I think about it I think it's funny.

1268
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,780
But it's not trying to be funny right.

1269
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:39,800
Well funny one would be maybe more.

1270
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,080
Okay you're right.

1271
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,760
It's the key is is always like his persona is funny.

1272
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,120
Yeah yeah I was gonna say a funny something with like more actual jokes.

1273
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,720
You might honestly get tired of it might be better the first time.

1274
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:57,780
But then you've kind of heard the jokes and then they're not fresh anymore.

1275
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:01,620
Something like this it's kind of perfectly the line of like.

1276
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,580
Is it funny that the guy has mouse ears.

1277
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:09,140
It gets a laugh I but it's not I don't get tired of it.

1278
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,140
I would weirdly get tired of a better joke.

1279
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:15,120
I feel like the there's a lot of good.

1280
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,660
What I'll say is age eight to eighty jokes you know.

1281
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:24,540
It kind of works for every age group it's kind of evergreen.

1282
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:28,120
It's the sort of thing they try to manufacture.

1283
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,820
And it just doesn't work as well.

1284
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:34,000
Yeah but just when they were trying to do.

1285
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:40,940
A straightforward ride video with like some funny stuff here and there.

1286
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:45,840
You know some and he's just such a good performer.

1287
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:50,280
He doesn't feel like he's but if this is his phoning it in.

1288
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,280
It's a great phoning it in but I don't think it is.

1289
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,760
I don't think it is either no I think he gives it as I think we've seen way recently we've seen.

1290
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,420
More popular actors phoning it in.

1291
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:06,980
Yeah in pre ride video this is I think he is seizing this opportunity.

1292
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,360
I think he knows people are going to see this over and over again.

1293
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,740
It's not just like what is this I'll get this done.

1294
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:17,340
The closest thing to a joke in it is these little beauties like.

1295
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,240
Yes and then the kind of the sort of Costanza S.

1296
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,860
Command well of course who sadly this is another element of it.

1297
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:27,680
Is that this is coming off of Seinfeld.

1298
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,360
And he's one of the funniest side characters on Seinfeld.

1299
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:38,980
He is a revelation in the they like all of them every character who gets to show up in the finale.

1300
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:43,720
All of the like greats they all it's Seinfeld just had they just hired.

1301
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:49,840
The best people and gave them the best direction or lane to they it's all these like human cartoon.

1302
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:54,980
Characters yes and not in a way where they're like sitcom broad crazy they're just like.

1303
00:53:54,980 --> 00:54:01,420
It just everybody makes big bold choices and it's so often it's people you haven't seen a thousand times.

1304
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:06,260
Before that so him and maybe the closest number to John O'Hurley is Peterman.

1305
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:11,080
Yeah both like I just remember being a kid and watching these and like who are these guys.

1306
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:18,280
I don't ever want to stop seeing these people and yeah oh yeah yeah the side characters on that show are unbelievable.

1307
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:22,480
And like they even figure like putties almost like I feel like he has a late.

1308
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,780
Seinfeld Renaissance in a lot of ways because he was on an episode where he's a little scarier.

1309
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:35,360
That's the first episode oh like he maybe like he was he felt a little specific and then they had to find a way to like how do we keep you how do we not make him this like.

1310
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:40,620
You know because soup Nazi they could only use once exactly yes but how do we keep this guy in the fold.

1311
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:48,520
But you know when he's at the late the car dealership that's a great episode the eight ball jacket those are the last two seasons I believe.

1312
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:53,840
Which you know I still really like those last two seasons but they're a little bit different.

1313
00:54:53,840 --> 00:55:00,420
He's some of the best of you start thinking like you know towards the end it's getting weaker but then putty does some good stuff.

1314
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,080
Yes you're back on board.

1315
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:11,520
There was on AEW they had the eight ball jack didn't it didn't daddy magic Matt Menard wasn't he wearing the eight ball jacket.

1316
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:18,520
And as soon as he walked on screen and then I started laughing just seeing the eight ball jacket again.

1317
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:28,680
Just remembering the Seinfeld just you know yeah the devil one I think that's so great that yeah and then the side with the when they're on the.

1318
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:36,800
Her and he and Elaine are on the long plane ride oh yes and he's just like staring straight because he's vacant he's the dumbest guy.

1319
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:44,020
Everyone talks about like Carrey's boyfriends on sex in the city oh there's Aidan oh there's Mr.

1320
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:44,460
Big.

1321
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:50,380
But like Elaine's boyfriends I mean putty's got to be number one with a bullet right yeah oh yeah.

1322
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,060
And other other great ones there's there's a ton of great people.

1323
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:56,480
Keith Hernandez sure Toby Hus says the whiz.

1324
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,020
Very strong yeah let's just think about the whiz.

1325
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:07,740
Toby Hus a guy very similar to Patrick Warburton just like good in everything always excited to see Toby.

1326
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:13,680
Oh and him you like you start to calculate he was the from P and P and he's the voice in King of the Hill.

1327
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:20,360
And he like he from P and P King of the Hill and Halton catch five like those three alone anyone would be like.

1328
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:27,860
A feather in your hat on that yeah that the one performance little yeah hey Toby Hus fan club here for sure.

1329
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:33,840
But Patrick Warburton he had what he was on a sitcom where he was like a lead for a while that I've never seen before.

1330
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:39,180
I don't think anybody got more heat off of Seinfeld than Warburton because you end up like.

1331
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:46,900
Well Wayne Knight he was on Third Rock oh sure and moving well he's also getting work before sort of Seinfeld too.

1332
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:56,120
So yeah I mean he's definitely one of the again top three side characters that gets the actor gets a lot of work coming off of it.

1333
00:56:56,120 --> 00:57:03,660
But I think like you're just you're you're living in I loved him on Seinfeld and I'm not like sick of him ever.

1334
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:08,700
And it's like every time you see him you're just so happy to see him because of the memories.

1335
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:15,360
Uh-huh absolutely but then he brings it and everything yeah too brings it in this he's great in this.

1336
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:22,220
Let's briefly talk about the alternate universe where it was potentially not him they were talking about who to do this with.

1337
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:26,080
And they needed a well you know he defines himself as chief flight attendant.

1338
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:33,860
But there was you know maybe I don't know if they were thinking it's more pilot or we're just aiming for somebody associated with planes with an interest in planes.

1339
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:40,780
This was only recently revealed a couple years ago by I forget which Imagineer on Twitter Travolta is who they were going.

1340
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,860
Recent little leak from the Imagineering brain trust.

1341
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,900
I wouldn't have been mad.

1342
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:47,800
Yeah.

1343
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:49,120
It would have been weirder.

1344
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,380
Oh yes absolutely.

1345
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:55,300
Well especially because one of the things about it I mean I think that I think there were multiple obstacles in the way.

1346
00:57:55,360 --> 00:58:01,220
But one of them was that I think he was interested there were discussions but I don't know and I don't know what he was movie was filming at the time.

1347
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:04,280
But he had some odd little soul patch.

1348
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,580
Oh of course he had it in.

1349
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,380
Is that swordfish.

1350
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:13,120
Maybe yeah he has that in swordfish and I'm trying to remember what his facial hair is in old dogs.

1351
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:14,540
Old dogs is later.

1352
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:18,080
It's like 2005 but that's with every little step.

1353
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,980
I don't feel earth is before this.

1354
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,060
Yeah oh wait no I was wrong.

1355
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:28,520
The thing the problem was that he grew his hair into giant thick dreadlocks that he could not cut.

1356
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:34,740
And he had surgery on his eyes to transform them like mostly pure white.

1357
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:39,080
Well yeah he was shooting in the sound stage next door.

1358
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:43,420
He's like you know I can I just come over and they're like can you.

1359
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:44,980
Is there any chance.

1360
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,260
Can we clean you up.

1361
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,300
You're going to have to CGI it.

1362
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,640
Yeah because like I was what it was one of the what they have shot this 2000.

1363
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,440
Zone yeah I think maybe I was getting down there.

1364
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,820
I think it's like this and this is how I talk.

1365
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:03,660
Yeah it's that kind of like that crickets like a male share a little bit.

1366
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,460
Yeah yeah.

1367
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,300
Where there were crunching a little bit.

1368
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:10,840
It wasn't fully there where you had like that kind of vocal fry kind of thing going on.

1369
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:14,060
So yeah you're getting swordfish Travolta.

1370
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:14,620
You're getting.

1371
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:18,540
You're getting squint you're getting like head shaking.

1372
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,090
Yeah you're like two or three years after face off.

1373
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,240
Which is good which I'm not saying I just saw that.

1374
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:24,460
I just saw that.

1375
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,240
Oh is that first time you ever saw it.

1376
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,460
No it's been a while.

1377
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,320
Oh I love face.

1378
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:31,100
Oh it came in right in the middle grid perfect hotel room movie.

1379
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:32,240
That's exactly what you want.

1380
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,520
Greatest hotel room.

1381
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,660
Yeah yeah oh we're very lucky I know that we were.

1382
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,860
Face off too coming soon I think.

1383
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:39,820
What is that right.

1384
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:41,940
What is John Wuback talking about.

1385
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:45,600
Face off to I believe is being written by the guy who did that Godzilla Kong movie.

1386
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,420
I could be wrong.

1387
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:49,860
Okay I don't know if it's green like they're going to be in it though.

1388
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:53,900
I believe that I mean there are days are either either of them are they.

1389
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,460
Too busy they're too busy.

1390
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:59,540
Face off to yeah there it is.

1391
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:03,200
I don't know man that's the only I mean it look it depends on the.

1392
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:07,820
It's it's a tough bar the directions got to be is good or any worry but.

1393
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:09,680
Oh January 6th.

1394
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,720
Guys are crazier now.

1395
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:15,840
Face off to is coming and Nicholas Cage's description of the plot sounds wild.

1396
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:19,940
This is from January he says I think face off sequel.

1397
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:23,980
Is a sequel that lends itself to a lot of twists and turns and unpredictability.

1398
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:28,880
Well you got to turn and a twist right away because spoiler skip ahead spoiler.

1399
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:32,180
Nicholas Cage dies so how is there.

1400
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:33,580
Caster Troy dies.

1401
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:35,500
Caster Troy King of that.

1402
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:37,280
What am I saying.

1403
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,860
Have you ever seen face off.

1404
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:39,360
Oh yeah.

1405
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,120
Oh yeah okay.

1406
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:40,720
Yeah.

1407
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,920
Make sure so I get I don't know if it's like green but they've.

1408
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:47,260
There's the sign that I think the guy yet Godzilla Kong.

1409
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:50,780
Adam Wingard who we talked about before because he said he.

1410
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:54,200
Based some stuff from the Godzilla Kong movie on back to the future the ride.

1411
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:59,160
Oh yeah okay yeah there's some shots in there I like Godzilla Scott.

1412
01:00:59,220 --> 01:00:59,820
Yeah I did too.

1413
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:03,360
It's all about director though that directors got to be maybe he'll direct it.

1414
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:07,960
Maybe he's directing it not that I don't know if John Woo is nuts but he made it nuts.

1415
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:08,320
Yeah.

1416
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:12,900
So I don't know is this a job for Bay does it have to be a.

1417
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,220
Is it to see that small potatoes for Bay.

1418
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:19,140
I'm not sure when maybe he's maybe Adam is doing I'm not sure.

1419
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:22,300
I don't know it sounds like it's not fully ready to go.

1420
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,340
Sure sure.

1421
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,360
But it's like they I think he's right he got paid probably to write it.

1422
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:28,360
Okay well that's exciting we're on the way.

1423
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,700
Okay 70 year old Travolta.

1424
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:35,420
Usually I'm not on or usually a way past its prime sequel.

1425
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,820
But those they're going to be so much crazier.

1426
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:40,620
It has to be yes it has to be insane.

1427
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:45,980
Neither both of them have had both of them are less tethered to reality.

1428
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,680
Seemingly that's what we want.

1429
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:52,480
Did you ever watch when I wish I've we've talked about just doing is there some second gate.

1430
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,840
That's all Travolta stuff.

1431
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:54,520
Yes for sure.

1432
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:58,080
Did you ever watch when he Travolta does like a big hide and seek with a youtuber.

1433
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,020
Did I send you guys that I don't want to go.

1434
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,740
No no I'm how you I have to find where I can hide.

1435
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,680
No I've not seen this really long bizarre.

1436
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:10,600
Why is it him that it's him is not really acknowledged.

1437
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,520
He's doing one of eight people hide and seeking in a 20 minute long.

1438
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,860
You know musical commercials with the scrubs guys.

1439
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,180
So my remember that right.

1440
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:20,020
Yeah yeah.

1441
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,220
Huh yes.

1442
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:21,840
Enjoyed that.

1443
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:23,720
Yeah my stuff is all going to be just him and pitbull.

1444
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,640
Oh sure do that yeah.

1445
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,520
Let's do this.

1446
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:27,360
This sounds yeah sure.

1447
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:29,500
All right Travolta oddities sounds great.

1448
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:34,920
Okay but we got more but I think it was that they were like they needed a backup.

1449
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:39,420
They started thinking who else do we do and Emperor's new groove had just happened

1450
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:40,940
and he's the scene stealer of that.

1451
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:41,900
That launches it.

1452
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:45,900
He's like he's seen stealing on TV and then now he's seen stealing in movies

1453
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:51,300
and what a tie it felt like a real you were you're really seeing a movement happen.

1454
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:52,640
Yes oh yeah.

1455
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:53,660
So much more Burton.

1456
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:54,960
Oh I love that person.

1457
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:59,820
To suddenly be seeing all the time out of no it is an odd energy a specific energy.

1458
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,180
Always loved him so great.

1459
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:06,640
The bad guy in that she should be walking around oogie boogie bash.

1460
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,220
Who should?

1461
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:09,840
From Emperor's new groove.

1462
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,920
Oh yeah yeah.

1463
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,020
Oh man.

1464
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:16,220
They got some fun they got that judge we've all seen that judge doom clip.

1465
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:17,320
Judge doom yeah.

1466
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:19,500
That's fun little scary thing.

1467
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:21,720
We've never gone to one of those.

1468
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,640
I know because I think it's sold out immediately.

1469
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,620
Yes we have an annual pass you know like 140 dollars.

1470
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,160
On top of the annual pass.

1471
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,060
I can't even go the full day.

1472
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:31,880
Yeah.

1473
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,560
I mean I guess you can if your annual pass you could go.

1474
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,780
And you wouldn't get me out of those street trails.

1475
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:37,540
Well I we got to send.

1476
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:40,220
The children need to get through we're running out of candy.

1477
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:45,240
Hey buddy I got a whole box of hefty bags here you film faster and I'll move.

1478
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:50,420
Maybe next year we'll make a send you to one of these so we can get you on the treat trail.

1479
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,300
Can we call a shot next year you agree to that?

1480
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:55,560
That's part of the GoFundMe all right.

1481
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,140
Virtual queue.

1482
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:03,540
I'll do it.

1483
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:03,820
I'll do it.

1484
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:05,500
Because they sell out within minutes.

1485
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:06,920
I mean we'll all three of us will go.

1486
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:10,500
But we need to see we need to see you get on that treat trail.

1487
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,180
It's going to be all about.

1488
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:11,420
Sure.

1489
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:12,380
Spotlights going to be on you.

1490
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:13,420
Yes for sure.

1491
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:21,480
Any moments that we like in this video especially I think he okay a couple he gives it he really

1492
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:26,840
gives it his all with the every very his specific manner of delivery with that big like hello.

1493
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:30,940
Yeah yeah.

1494
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:32,560
You're off to the races there.

1495
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:32,920
Yeah.

1496
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:36,520
And then I really like this kind of a moment like it's kind of a beat you kind of get a

1497
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:42,880
little air he's not rushing into it he I think he's dealt with the either the kid or the

1498
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:47,620
the mouse ears guy and then kind of like turn pause soon you will be airborne.

1499
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,340
That's a nice moment.

1500
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:49,940
Yeah.

1501
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:50,460
Yeah.

1502
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:50,880
I mean I don't.

1503
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:56,160
The kid moment when he tells the kid like does he say great job buddy or great job pal.

1504
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,000
Nice work pal.

1505
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:57,920
Nice work pal.

1506
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:04,560
If Patrick Warburton said nice work pal to me that that might be like Mike

1507
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,080
getting a thumbs up from Optimus Prime.

1508
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:12,380
Yeah yeah yeah uh huh yeah the trusted figure of Chief Flight Attendant Patrick.

1509
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:12,840
Yeah.

1510
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:17,120
I have to bring up that I can't not bring up I cannot make it about me for a minute

1511
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:22,880
I did I got to live in the fantasy camp of this video and of interacting with Patrick

1512
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:28,280
Warburton because probably the height of my funny or die career and the thing I was

1513
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:33,720
gunning to make happen as soon as I got in there I mean I have access to higher budgets

1514
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:39,860
and celebrities there is something I want to do so badly and that is a fake pre-ride video

1515
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:45,780
for a roller coaster that doesn't exist and it took months to get this thing together.

1516
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:49,440
If you can imagine having to like I just I need a

1517
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:56,180
roller coaster car that actually moves and that can go along a track and stop in place and it's

1518
01:05:56,180 --> 01:06:02,380
western themed so it does need to be wooden so therefore extremely heavy and yeah we need to

1519
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:10,340
find a ranch to do it this is just like I am like yeah I'm aiming high for this thing and thus we

1520
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:15,520
need the celebrity to justify it was like it's the funnier die was like the blockbuster system

1521
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:20,980
sure we can release more budget but you need the star to justify it and we were you know I'm

1522
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:25,720
surprised I don't know maybe we were talking about Travolta I don't know there was there was talk of

1523
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:31,140
like in order to justify doing this it's got to be a degree of celebrity who and we're so we're

1524
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:34,940
talking about people who have no funnier die relationship probably don't want to make something

1525
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:39,980
like this aiming just like insanely high and then like oh that'd be and probably you can only get

1526
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:44,940
them for two hours or whatever anyway so I start thinking about who's done funnier die videos who

1527
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:49,840
would be down to come back and do another one and I start looking in the archives and there I see

1528
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:56,300
Patrick Warburton I forget what he'd done before but I thought oh my god I love that guy hero he'd

1529
01:06:56,300 --> 01:07:01,720
be so great it's got to be this like crazy cowboy giving you the rules he'd be great I said can it

1530
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:06,760
be him and they start reaching out to him and I swear I didn't somehow put together the math

1531
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:12,240
that he is this that he's in the real world really I started the wheels on it just because I love him

1532
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:17,500
because I thought maybe he'd do it if he's done it before and then like oh my god and it's him it

1533
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:22,440
would be him from soren that'd be so crazy that's wild I on some level you must have in the back of

1534
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:28,400
your mind yeah probably yeah it was it wasn't far away yeah yeah but I but let me just that's just

1535
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,840
to attest that's how much I wanted to meet him and get his insane energy in this thing and then what

1536
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:38,500
a dream to get the news that he he's interested in doing it but he wants to meet you guys first

1537
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:44,620
and we're summons to a Jerry's deli in Encino me and producer Josh Martin and we just get to have

1538
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:51,140
a lovely like lumberjack bread I remember he did the like big old hash plate he like ate how you

1539
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:55,700
you would expect him to eat and talk to you'd expect him to talk he has that thing the entire

1540
01:07:55,700 --> 01:08:00,700
time and he's like clearly he's just like making sure we aren't crazy and making sure it's worth

1541
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:06,160
his while but just that that alone like getting to have breakfast with this guy was fantastic and he

1542
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:10,880
starts talking I'm talking shop he brings up the thing and like it is great it's a fun area you

1543
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:17,900
know I'm in a real one of these things and I'm like oh I know I know sir yeah you have no idea

1544
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:23,740
how much I know about all of this but then we start we get to talk about how he's proud of doing

1545
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:28,900
that thing and he's proud of and that he just he loves the theme part he loves the Disney parks

1546
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:35,160
and he he said something along the lines of that I won't forget with his intonation uh well you

1547
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:39,600
know it's kind of a wimpy thing to say but uh there's magic in the air at that place

1548
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:48,320
yes yes great like retaining the machismo he has to like do it just so you know I am a

1549
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:53,480
you know I'm a big strong guy but uh you know uh you get kissed by a little tinkerbell pixie

1550
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:58,580
does it yeah it brings a cheer to your eye um so great so I knew I was up to the races and I got

1551
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:02,740
to make this thing and I'm so proud of it listener newer listeners that we've maybe hasn't come up

1552
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:07,100
shown a while but uh roller coaster safety with Patrick Warburton is on youtube or I can post a

1553
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:12,800
clip or something uh but check it out and I feel like this video is like a calling card for me to

1554
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:19,420
like it probably let people know oh this guy who's putting videos out is a is a theme park guy yes

1555
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:24,720
because I remember when I met Doug Jones the first time he's like that video you must actually like

1556
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:30,920
this stuff right yes yeah it's not a like shitting on theme parks kind of video I've seen a lot of

1557
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:35,320
didn't this happen with the season pass guys too or something was that a different video

1558
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:39,240
that was a thrill when we're at knots berry farm with them and they were because they know a lot

1559
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:43,700
of people in the industry and they said that they had seen it sent around by people who actually

1560
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:48,900
work on roller coasters and stuff and that they could tell it was a fellow traveler right as it

1561
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:54,380
were um the other one I have to shout out just because I could not I do love this video so much

1562
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:59,140
and I was like when I got to make my tv show movie city I'm like I gotta get Warburton again that

1563
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:05,360
was so fun that was such a blast and knowing that I wrote into the script him saying this little

1564
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:11,640
beauty and it was in there and I don't know if he knew why he was saying it I don't think he caught

1565
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:17,860
it yeah yeah but I was such a thrill to like watch him say that line in that case about a piece of

1566
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:23,260
the the Bermuda triangle that he had in an amulet on his or no there was like a pin because he was

1567
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:30,080
like a decorated military guy right um so let that be my if all of that is not credibility of my

1568
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:36,600
love of this video in this aspect of Soren that's great and that was before he was on star tours

1569
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:41,600
right when you made this or no was it right after he remember yes during the shoot he gave a little

1570
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:45,920
preview okay a little not supposed to be talking about this oh wow yeah yeah that's good inside

1571
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:51,700
information and then and then it was confusing to go on it and kind of go well where is he I don't

1572
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:56,860
hear him and it maybe takes a time or two to go up that is maybe a little voice pitch up yep on

1573
01:10:56,860 --> 01:11:02,780
that one robot it's pretty easy to miss yeah the inflections the way he said certain things you can

1574
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:08,460
kind of catch it it's just that it's so good his different speeds of it because the way him on the

1575
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:13,240
ride is not the same as putty is not the same as great it's all the same family of yeah yeah but

1576
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:19,920
there's little adjusts but then it basically has that and the big you know like breathiness I think

1577
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:25,200
he's an Adam West fan is what I've I believe I ever I think makes driving for that kind of like

1578
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:31,240
there's nothing he's not it's silliness as silly as you can be without like making a silly face

1579
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:37,540
you know it's all in it's all in it's it's the silliness of bravado essentially it's so fun I

1580
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:42,200
mean I'm not talking I'm not talking about him when I'm saying this but it's so the the bravado

1581
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:49,900
always works when a lot of or not always but it often works when the performer does also kind of

1582
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:55,640
your Shatner's and your Adam West both like know when they're being funny but also do have

1583
01:11:56,140 --> 01:12:02,980
it's in them that's a speed they can dial up like there's probably a more sensitive right real person

1584
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:09,300
yeah but then there's performance mode and it has yeah so I feel like if bluster it's it's awesome

1585
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:17,120
it's always self-aware bravado ends up being yes the right way you can dial properly yeah um and

1586
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:23,960
in both of my war burn experiences he was a much uh he did not shatter on me okay well that's good

1587
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:28,960
if you recall is playing that clip is that second gate that was second gate yeah we played a

1588
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:35,700
shatter being mad at a voiceover director and he decimated this man mentally my god scarring so

1589
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:43,080
scarring um okay well anything else pre-ride or do we start talking about scenes here uh uh

1590
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:48,240
you know what I mean I always I'm sure I've talked about this before but I always as a

1591
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:53,400
California native I like that before war burden appeared and this I'm always a little frustrated

1592
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:57,620
in this part because maybe you've gotten caught in a line for a while and maybe and you're I'm

1593
01:12:57,620 --> 01:13:03,020
excited to see the war burden video so I don't really like when I am like I'm getting close but

1594
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:08,660
it's kind of a tease and all I have to entertain me right now are the names of California cities

1595
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:12,380
oh yeah yeah and there's a real mundane-ness

1596
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,280
is it because there's one that I don't even know if this is actually where they filmed it but

1597
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:21,640
there's one that they define as camera Rio yes and if you're not from around here um or you've

1598
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:28,160
never been here camera Rio's a kind of a mundane play it's a place with an outlet mall uh it's a

1599
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:38,640
place with a Marie calendars if I had a good friend who lived and I looked forward to I don't

1600
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:45,100
when some rides take you to Endor another I guess don't take you to Endor so what's

1601
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:49,240
the way all right give me a real what's a real one some rides take you to where what's Jar Jar's

1602
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:54,460
planet the Gungan city yeah yeah some rides take you to Gungan city and other rides take you to

1603
01:13:54,460 --> 01:14:01,660
camera Rio right a real place known for an outlet mall for a while it had the um is it Cavalier the

1604
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:07,320
horse show with the big 10 oh were they hosting Cavalier yeah they had the big 10 the big white 10

1605
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:15,920
was hosting Cavalier by like the access roads and the railroad tracks high the five yeah yeah

1606
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:22,480
gotcha so that's good for camera Rio I'm not so I've had good times in camera rail

1607
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:29,680
love giant sprawling Edwards theaters I miss those Edwards theaters with like the you know

1608
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:34,600
giant neon displays and they're loud because they're old I like any there's a lot of those in New

1609
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:39,100
York Beach you find one find a big one in camera Rio too the only thing would make this bad this

1610
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:44,580
part better is if it's like Buena Park and that came out at you yeah you can fly over there yeah

1611
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:49,020
that's a good hmm yeah what you're missing some plus in it up already greatest city in the if

1612
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:56,960
you're a big fan of the the OC and you want to see Chino the home of Ryan the main character yeah I

1613

by an easy off-ramp oh I need a bathroom I stopped at that cracker barrel on the way back from Vegas

1618
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:39,300
and how was that it's look it's fun and it's cheap to be there and it's yeah I bought a sailor suit

1619
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:46,860
for my daughter I okay I know we got a lot to get through I don't look I don't want to accuse you of

1620
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:52,120
child abuse but I don't you didn't want to be in a little sailor suit when you were a kid we've

1621
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:56,520
told people talked about being embarrassed in little sailor suits and here you are repeating the

1622
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:02,000
cycle well look it was well I don't know his daughter might be a little boogey-woogie bukele

1623

1624
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:14,380
okay uh if you're this I'm gonna I'm like why don't we record your house next time and then I

1625
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:19,960
sneak into a closet yeah yeah yeah if you guys if y'all try to put it on her and she starts

1626
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:25,880
immediately screaming you have to text us like I think she's gonna sailor suit is a no-go

1627
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:32,120
yeah I had two separate sailor suits I have pictures in when I was so is is two the line for

1628
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:37,860
you like I'm only it's only one one sailor suit you get one sailor suit that's the way I feel

1629
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:42,800
oh look it's Halloween she's doing stranger things she's doing the one season stranger

1630
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:47,140
thing she works at the mall the ice cream barler that sailor theme I've never seen

1631
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:52,300
past one episode and I know the ice cream parlor and I know the kind of monster one of our

1632
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:58,300
Baskin Robbins here in Burbank got turned into the sailor ice cream parlor I remember scoops ahoy

1633
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:02,540
yeah what separates the sailor suit from other what's is there anything on the fanny

1634
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:08,580
what would be on the fan what do you mean like you're thinking of like pajamas I'm thinking of

1635
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:14,600
a Simpsons uh there at least is shopping for embarrassing swimsuits with marge and uh

1636
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:18,700
there's a little starfish on the fanny yeah no I don't think there's anything like that

1637
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:23,260
that helps that helps it's not like a duck costume or anything with a little tail

1638
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:27,320
okay okay although that would be cute too yeah that's not good that's not go over I'm adjusting

1639
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:30,960
to the side you're trying to you're gonna talk me into the sailor suit well I shouldn't have

1640
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:35,020
approval over those we're just concerned we're too late in the episode for me to do my full speech

1641
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:39,380
on why the sailor suit is good and I'll play the three I'll play like patriotic music under it too

1642
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:45,660
separate sailor suits episode um I don't know I think we're there let's talk yeah let's talk

1643
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:50,860
ride baby yeah um and I don't know I don't know that we even need to like go in order let's try

1644
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:55,540
it let's try to hit everything but let's hear let's where's your where's your heart in this

1645
01:17:55,540 --> 01:18:02,280
what's like when you think about specifically soaring over California the original ride film

1646
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:07,000
and I don't want to you know we'll save the discussion of what's better yeah this is the

1647
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:12,400
one but um what do you flash to when you like when you think about loving the California one

1648
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:20,340
well I think in terms of vibes the best vibes are the I'm just reading off of Wikipedia the

1649
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:26,460
Redwood Creek the people kayaking through the Redwood Creek are flying over them yeah absolutely

1650
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:32,480
that's the first I think that it gets it starts grand with Golden Gate Bridge yes um and you feel

1651
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:36,320
grand because you feel like you're in the full house opening yeah yeah despite the music being

1652
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:42,860
different uh but then that's the first that we get serene and you're also really impressed that

1653
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:47,340
how much you're able to sink into the creek like you don't you don't really know the mechanism this

1654
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:51,500
is being shot it's not like whoa we're getting pretty low we're getting pretty close to those

1655
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:56,680
guys it was probably a pain in the ass to film that in 2000 now we got these tiny drones you

1656
01:18:56,680 --> 01:19:02,680
can fly through anything sure CGI can finish the rest they were still doing helicopters though for

1657
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:09,920
the world look like it I feel like you might need to for stability I mean we can that's we can also

1658
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:15,180
talk about we'll talk scenes but we talk technically about it it does seem like because helicopter

1659
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:20,180
footage can be uh uh awful that's like you think yeah you think footage and helicopters are going

1660
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:25,120
to be compelling automatically but it can be very shaky and I'm sure and and these are like

1661
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:31,180
this these have to the second one had to shoot 8k imagery so that's like yeah you need a you need a

1662
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:40,260
3d piece of machinery so um yeah that rigs gotta be real well eight IMAX cameras circa 2000 are

1663
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:45,420
probably massive oh yeah I know I said like as if 8k is if you need a bigger camera to shoot 8k

1664
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:49,180
that's how it works you need a case size camera but you're right the originals were probably

1665
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:55,520
bigger clunkier uh uh what did they shoot on was it film or was it some early digital back then do

1666
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:59,700
we know that oh that's a good question I know that that was projecting an IMAX so it was originally

1667
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:05,020
the movie was projected in film okay um and then they switched over to digital a year or two before

1668
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:10,320
uh sort of over the world they've upgraded here and there they but I remember when it was like okay now

1669
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,860
the picture is going to be digital and I remember going on it it was a little clearer they were

1670
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:21,700
shut at IMAX HD originally which implies digital okay I think but it looks fantastic interesting

1671
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:28,640
yeah it does have some of the warmth I would associate with film yeah maybe the lenses are

1672
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:35,600
I could be wrong though on the foot shooting shooting all that like in kind of like the

1673
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:44,260
Monterey Bay like coastline yeah like that is a risk to fly over those rocks and the

1674
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:51,600
breaking waves and all the animals sure yes um vibes are good there too vibes are also good at

1675
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:57,920
the hang gliding in Yosemite yeah yeah all of the nature stuff is pretty spectacular yeah and all of

1676
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:03,040
I'm pulling some of this from theme park tourists they had some stories about the logistics of

1677
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:07,460
shooting this thing which you do you know you're you're lost in the ride you're not thinking about

1678
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:12,660
what it took to put it together but those some of those are some of the most uh biggest pains

1679
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:18,920
he has to do that part of Yosemite there has not been an airborne vehicle there in nearly 50 years

1680
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:23,620
wow yeah clearance on this stuff it took them I did read that it took them forever to like

1681
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:29,820
negotiate some of this like working over the parks and the low whatever your rules are which

1682
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:35,000
are probably very specific being like protected uh yeah lands the last plane that was in here

1683
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:42,000
was some crop duster asshole who got lost and like a says he didn't have a permit he didn't have a

1684
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:50,480
permit just drunk it was Harrison Ford playing a crop duster drinking moonshine yeah a big x

1685
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:58,180
bottle yeah um Monterey the super blue one that's how I think of it that is a marine life sanctuary

1686
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:04,020
so it took years to clear and there's a boat that's visible in the shot and that's not just for

1687
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:09,840
production value the boat was like making sure that animals were making sure animals weren't

1688
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:16,720
getting disturbed by the helicopters flying by yeah um so this is like pretty unprecedented

1689
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:24,440
you know star tours was models and later digital they didn't have to go to a moon and

1690
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:31,360
deal with the local ordinances of the moon to shoot the stuff yes very true so I really

1691
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:39,380
appreciate what they had to do to do this thing the other one the the desert one with the the

1692
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:49,120
flyby from the jets yes yeah that's the most insane one because okay a research team okay

1693
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:57,260
they did they made disney hire archaeologists to make sure that any artifacts were not getting

1694
01:22:57,260 --> 01:23:03,940
or bones I don't know uh to make sure that nothing was getting disturbed in that area

1695
01:23:03,940 --> 01:23:10,760
just in the area that you're shooting which is four square miles and what that actually meant was

1696
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:18,740
dusting so four square miles had to be dusted oh wow I didn't read that yeah that's nuts

1697
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:24,940
that's so tedious and crazy this is what they did for us this is what they did to to make us

1698
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:32,360
entertained and nowadays the Walt Disney Company is using money like that for um

1699
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:39,020
330 000 crisis p uh pr people and you know whoever they're gonna hire is gonna be the

1700
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:45,180
scariest motherfucker you've ever met and fucking ray donovan getting hired

1701
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:52,180
but it's all gonna work out that scary ray donovan guy is gonna make everybody think that

1702
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:57,540
is nice again yeah so now you're like is that josh brolin or leave shriver

1703
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:07,880
is is it really them are they moonlighting i'm terrified yeah they'll undo months of bad pr for

1704
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:14,660
disney yeah months and months of public opinion being cemented i don't know what the i would i

1705
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:20,340
would like to see the pitch meetings if how does the how does the ampt very good question when

1706
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:26,820
pitch decks oh man i think whatever delusion we're imagining in those meetings it's 50 times

1707
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:33,280
worse yeah because you'd be like look just quit like guys you lost we lost why don't you just

1708
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:40,920
accept it i the the story alone of is it zaslav on oprah's boat and they were gonna watch an

1709
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:46,500
episode of fleabag and they like he had a fucking breakdown because there was sex scene in it

1710
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:51,300
what is wrong with you i think you've said this before and i hope i'm not gonna look into it but

1711
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:57,760
i hope it's right no i think so is he like the millennials who are like posting about sexes

1712
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:02,740
there's no shouldn't be a sex that's another type of brain worm this is a different a different type

1713
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:08,660
of square we need to show he's cool by associating him with those very online millennials yeah you

1714
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:12,680
want it yeah he wants to get rid of sex because it's cool to get rid of sex

1715
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:22,760
uh what's some other okay oh wait okay okay well all right so we know the erector set story

1716
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:30,720
you sure do like the urban legend about this is that when they fly over the palm springs golf

1717
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:36,180
course yes it's michael eiser hitting the golf ball i don't think that's an urban legend well

1718
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:42,540
well this is why do you say that mike because i read it somewhere today oh you guys where though

1719
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:50,320
oh no is it like the fans because people on the message board 20 years ago are losing their

1720
01:25:50,320 --> 01:26:00,120
goddamn minds and okay the the what i read it being associated as and i don't know if it's real or

1721
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:08,480
k-fabe is that eiser was on a larry king show i don't know if it's the podcasters at cnn show

1722
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:15,560
but he was promoting his book camp and he mentions like well my cameo in soren

1723
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:21,660
but then there's other posts where people are like oh no he wasn't that's a stunt man he

1724
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:25,760
wasn't available that day well i don't think we need to be a stunt man i think he just swings

1725
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:31,400
there was a lot of talk about stunt performers i guess well but my beef is with those commenters

1726
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:36,740
i don't know i don't know i'm just asking questions on camera it has to be a stuntman

1727
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:42,880
i don't know well i don't know i don't look i've certain i've said that out loud i'm sure a lot of

1728
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:47,920
people listening have said it out loud i've never put it under the microscope but we pick soren as

1729
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:52,160
the top as the topic i start putting it under the microscope i start because i want to know

1730
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:56,660
you're right if we're gonna say it we want to know that it's real and you're right i start looking

1731
01:26:56,660 --> 01:27:03,040
and it's a lot it's very divisive it's very nice message boards some people were saying i went on

1732
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:10,760
a disney tour the tour guide said it interesting so this is one of the most i feel like i've seen

1733
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:17,180
this a lot heard it a lot yes more so than the if we can't talk about the fans on that's too much

1734
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:23,260
to talk about but like i've heard it more for sure than the fans yes the fans my mind is new to me

1735
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:27,920
and it probably hit my ear where if you haven't heard that episode we discussed whether some of

1736
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:35,360
the speed of space mountain is simulated by cold air being blown on you by fans and we've been we've

1737
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:40,260
put it out to the you know and you know what i feel like i haven't been proved i i say that's bunk i

1738
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:45,140
say there are no fans i haven't been proven definitively right but i haven't been proven

1739
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:50,660
officially wrong either no one has been proven right or wrong i've seen many interesting theories

1740
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:56,580
about the fans that would put it closer to jason being right but no one seems to have the definitive

1741
01:27:56,580 --> 01:28:01,600
what do you mean you put it closer to jason i haven't seen that that's not how i perceive it

1742
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:06,280
have an idea of like it's not fans in the traditional but like vents near work sort of

1743
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:11,720
the start of the ride systems come into play my memory starts coming up like i'm just saying it's

1744
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:15,840
cool i'm not saying cold air is being blown yeah i'm not actually saying like i just mean i've seen

1745
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:20,560
theories that are go okay well that's a type of fan and it's in a different place than i would

1746
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:24,820
think versus what we were talking about giant industrial fans a little more in the middle yes

1747
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:30,800
i believe i believe we can rule out that there are like this ride has this ride does have fans

1748
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:36,220
yes yeah and that's part of the it's part of the simulation and that's what blows the sense on you

1749
01:28:36,220 --> 01:28:42,220
too um but i i think we can rule out like fans air cannons because that's easy you just watch the

1750
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:46,660
you watch the lights yeah you don't see that there so i'm not trying to reopen there i'm just trying

1751
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:50,780
to keep the ball in the air because i do want somebody to definitively prove this right or

1752
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:56,760
well yeah i we are i i am waiting to bashfully take my mousers off

1753
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:03,160
uh little beauties but i'm also waiting to confidently put my seat belt through that

1754
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:08,160
middle strap which i think the first few times i wrote it i did too because i'm like well i'm

1755
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:12,360
smaller it confused me i know i was like do i need to yeah i've watched the video a bunch of

1756
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:17,820
times then i'm still like do i have to do the strap um well all right if i believe there

1757
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:22,440
are other terms to that wager but if you end up being right i will say nice work pal oh

1758
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:26,780
that's good that's not from me and now i know you you want to hear that it's not not as good as

1759
01:29:26,780 --> 01:29:31,240
this is like this and then we will do this eventually i just want to quickly address this

1760
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:37,860
this is like the story of the hemisphere dancer and yes rest in peace jimmy buffett yeah uh we

1761
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:42,320
don't have time for that either but you're right either yeah it's a bummer it might not happen

1762
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:47,560
immediately but we will get to a big episode i think we are building to i think we all know

1763
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:52,420
eventually where it's going where we will properly do our buffet we don't want to jam

1764
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:59,180
something out of course uh we want to do it with love and respect uh take our time so this feels

1765
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:04,680
similar to uh something about the hemisphere dancer about who was actually on the plane

1766
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:11,080
there's a live been down message board rabbit holes is was jimmy on the plane when the incident

1767
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:15,420
happened where they were shot at by the jamaican government yes so we will get into all that later

1768
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:21,960
this is i i i'm upset with myself for not being more suspicious now because you're about to

1769
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:26,780
this about the eisner issue about the eisner issue because yes that that was theme park fact in my

1770
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:31,740
head and i'm thinking does he think is he even addressing it as like the character michael

1771
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:37,540
eisner appears in the ride what does that mean basically meaning like he doesn't have to like

1772
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:45,020
he doesn't appear okay basically in the narrative of the ride michael eisner appears but he was not

1773
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:50,800
there that day for some reason well my argument there would be that makes no goddamn sense if

1774
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:56,640
that's the case eisner's out of his fucking mind that character is me the golfer is me it's possible

1775
01:30:56,640 --> 01:31:01,500
because it's not what he's been for that it's being filled people know they're being filled those

1776
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:07,480
people the golfers knew what was going on so he could be trying to say that's me as a character

1777
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:14,600
that's my character you can't see his face so i've never seen the evidence that he is insane

1778
01:31:15,020 --> 01:31:21,140
i think we have a little look not that kind of insane okay all right since i've been seven i've

1779
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:27,040
been destroying my mind with comic book logic in the last few years i've been destroying my mind

1780
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:33,020
more with wrestling logic so my brain is just soup at this point what if michael eisner had his face

1781
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:44,560
removed and replaced with another ceo his face came off off and then he appeared there with a

1782
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:51,000
not with my face i hate golf no don't do it a different face that day and it's his body and

1783
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:57,040
his brain but not there was that weird couple of years where castor troy was the head of warner

1784
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:02,060
brothers yeah exactly eisner's body looked like there's different dimensions all of a sudden

1785
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:09,820
um i have my argument for why i don't think this is michael eisner is twofold one is he is a busy

1786
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:15,620
man this shoot we have now just talked about some of the coordination that it took to put this shoot

1787
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:20,820
together and i'll say a couple other things about that um okay the rock climbers in in the yosemite

1788
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:27,760
scene uh they they had that that all took six hours they had to hang off of the rocks and reset

1789
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:33,420
and go up and down for six hours something i something i read said which is funny somebody

1790
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:39,500
was like these were not candid shots i was like okay i didn't think they didn't just go

1791
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:44,320
start shoot whatever it's cinema verite i was like i don't know what we get that was not

1792
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:50,180
no much coordination the uh now granted this is harder to get than um somebody swinging a golf

1793
01:32:50,180 --> 01:32:55,420
club however um there's another thing about the desert sequence with the it's the flyby from the

1794
01:32:55,820 --> 01:33:04,300
um and i i forget what where that desert is i think the name is uh onza berago um so the

1795
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:10,420
helicopters going through the onza berago desert um the thunderbirds to arrive at that point when

1796
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:17,860
they do right they took off from nellis air force base near las vegas nearly 200 miles away so it's

1797
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:26,280
action we go these this amount of feet you travel from vegas to here yeah so this is the level of

1798
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:31,860
coordination and and you know i think every one of these shots is a full day endeavor uh it's it's

1799
01:33:31,860 --> 01:33:37,340
crazy to do there's a lot of people to coordinate in this thing now i'll give you that maybe this

1800
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:42,880
was done with stand-ins and then mr eisner were ready for you but he's a busy guy i mean maybe

1801
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:49,460
vacationing there maybe he's in palm spray or indio specific is it like actually yeah but um so

1802
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:56,040
maybe he would have to be there already or they were they drive him out there for a full day of

1803
01:33:56,040 --> 01:34:01,160
this maybe he's getting work done he's on the floor he's on a vacation and then they just slide him in

1804
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:06,120
right before i'll give you that but it seems it seems complicated and think about look the guy

1805
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:10,940
does like to be on camera we know this he loves camera we've seen many many clips of this but

1806
01:34:10,940 --> 01:34:18,340
those shots are all a you know a close and a two shot hello i'm michael eisner and it's done feet

1807
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:25,900
from his office um is he really going to hang around to be a dot that he barely takes credit for

1808
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:31,120
like as opposed to introducing himself as the chairman of the walt disney company

1809
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:37,660
with a close-up you know where it's very clear yeah go ahead but he knows these rides can last

1810
01:34:37,660 --> 01:34:44,860
for decades sure decades and the other thing is palm springs as a small airport which you can

1811
01:34:44,860 --> 01:34:51,480
fly burbank to bond springs i'm assuming that's a 30 minute flight could be so maybe he was in his

1812
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:56,060
office they had him back uh back in the office for a conference call at the end of the day well let

1813
01:34:56,060 --> 01:35:02,860
me go back to the thing i said that confused everyone uh what if they said to him it would

1814
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:07,400
be really fun if you were the golfer in palm springs that would be really he goes that great

1815
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:12,020
i've never really done it on the ride blah blah blah this is great so then they're sort of

1816
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:16,680
logistically explained to him how long it takes he's going as well this is gonna take forever

1817
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:19,340
who gives it and then they're like well you know what they're not gonna really be able to see your

1818
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:26,240
face and he goes all right well uh my wife will get a polo shirt out of my closet let's just throw

1819
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:32,320
it on a kid a pa and they'll do the golf swing and we'll say i did it it's me we'll say i'll do

1820
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:38,380
this way and like it's his clothes technically he's not on there this makes more sense than you than

1821
01:35:38,380 --> 01:35:44,540
him creating a fictional character and but that is that is uh like that is it's a more practical

1822
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:50,140
way to explain the same thing yes you're right it's a more reasonable let's just get a me-esque guy

1823
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:55,340
yeah and i'll say it's me and that's fun because i'm a little cameo like alfred itchcock or something

1824
01:35:55,340 --> 01:36:01,200
guess so yeah yeah possible maybe it's that maybe it's possible it's a strange answer but it's

1825
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:09,660
it's i i guess i buy it yeah that's a theory well my my other thing is that like i feel like by the

1826
01:36:09,660 --> 01:36:16,700
year 2000 they're like all right we're bailing out water on this california adventure shit

1827
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:24,160
like izer's spending most of his time picking out carpet samples for the hotel you know and the hotel

1828
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:31,760
is terrific you know and the area is adjacent to the hotel pretty nice so you're saying he doesn't

1829
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:36,480
have time because he's picking out carpet samples well i feel like everyone's just losing like the

1830
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:41,520
movies aren't making the money they want them to make certainly the golden age of his tenure at the

1831
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:45,680
company but that seems like a time where you don't want to you don't want to go deal with the hassle

1832
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:54,060
of being in the ride yeah and where you like and where you know you got busy and maybe you don't

1833
01:36:54,060 --> 01:37:01,200
in the special so in the disney war book everyone talks like everyone hated the abc merger

1834
01:37:01,740 --> 01:37:07,420
they're like why are we doing this you know as opposed to all other mergers which have been good

1835
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:12,080
for everyone oh sure you think they're dark merger do you think anyone pitched a different thing like

1836
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:15,840
all right michael you're gonna fly by in the jet you're gonna have to learn how to fly the jet and

1837
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:21,060
we're gonna you're gonna turn your head and go hello this is the jet goes by or he's one of the

1838
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:26,240
primers or like was there ever a i think in a hot air balloon basket would be more

1839
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:30,760
or less oh that's great because they just rewaves yeah and that's the hidden mickey in the ride which

1840
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:35,100
we don't talk about that's a long weekend in napa out of it i think you should have had him be we

1841
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:41,180
didn't talk about this the hang glider when you do see an actual hang glider in yosemite yeah and

1842
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:48,360
one of the complaints about uh the world's version is the cgi yes there is some cgi that is undoubtedly

1843
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:54,800
a digital hang glider so why not go further with it why not have him spin around and say hello

1844
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:58,460
i'm michael i'm there in full suit he's not even chairman of the walt disney company and today

1845
01:37:58,460 --> 01:38:00,540
chairman of uh the sky

1846
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:09,380
yes can i present one more argument for why i don't believe go ahead that it is him okay jason you

1847
01:38:09,380 --> 01:38:16,040
alluded at the beginning of this to um the the most plausible source on this is that maybe he said it

1848
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:23,240
was on a radio show maybe maybe it was larry king i found him on larry king in 2004 and you can

1849
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:29,200
search the transcript so i searched and soren did come up and i lit up perhaps this could be it but

1850
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:35,860
instead what it was is a caller because larry king took callers and it's a caller shockingly

1851
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:41,140
saying uh hey i just want to say i agree with what roy disney has said and i don't think that you have

1852
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:47,660
park in california adventure whoa the only thing we liked was soren uh over america got the title

1853
01:38:47,660 --> 01:38:55,620
wrong uh and saying false hoods to our our hero uh but he like but said our woman i think complained

1854
01:38:55,620 --> 01:39:00,320
on the phone that's crazy um and he goes right into kind of pitch mode and says well you know we have

1855
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:05,940
tower of terror uh ma'am have you been on tower of terror in florida i think she hung up okay she

1856
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:09,800
hung up but anyway tower terror is one of the most popular rides and it's coming so he goes into

1857
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:14,520
defense mode something he does not say is well you know soren actually it's interesting i'm the

1858
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:20,560
golfer and uh soren he doesn't bring it up there then i thought this is not it because the uh another

1859
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:26,720
thing that message board person said is he was promoting his book camp this was the camp was

1860
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:32,560
not the now bestseller classic camp about his days in summer camp was not out yet so we gotta do an

1861
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:37,320
episode of a camp we're gonna have to read camp at some point oh that's a good one the camp is not

1862
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:43,720
very long and i think the library lending app has the audio book but i think it's a bridge

1863
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:49,600
so i don't know what they need the full version what how dare they that's like censoring that's

1864
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:53,720
like when blockbuster would edit the videos for content and like cut the sex and violence

1865
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:58,520
that's that's that's akin to book burning don't fuck with camp yeah don't fuck with camp

1866
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,740
but um i started looking for when was he promoting the book camp and he did make an appearance

1867
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:11,540
promoting camp on the charlie rose show just host his tenure so a lot of the discussion is that he

1868
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:15,300
is out of the company he's also trying to put a good face on that it's actually better it's better

1869
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:22,180
than this happened uh so he's in that mode while also selling his now classic book camp um but so

1870
01:40:22,180 --> 01:40:26,760
you know i'm not finding soren is not mentioned in that transcript i'm not finding what i need

1871
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:33,660
there but strangely what does come up is golf there's a discussion of golf and how do you relax

1872
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:39,380
what are you gonna do now are you gonna golf and he says uh well my problem is i think golf should

1873
01:40:39,380 --> 01:40:45,140
be 13 holes he gets tired of golfing he doesn't and charlie rose responds you don't like golf

1874
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:51,100
i don't like the last five holes it's too long so i can't play golf charlie rose comes back to it

1875
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:56,280
a minute later you don't even play golf i used to play golf twice uh now i loved writing this book

1876
01:40:57,040 --> 01:41:07,340
so i say to this why is he in a scene as a golfer when it's not something that he even likes to do

1877
01:41:07,340 --> 01:41:13,500
why would he take the time to why would he do this sport that he abhors at first on camera say he

1878
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:20,560
likes the first 13 holes i guess so but but another thing then he kind of perhaps you uh let me submit

1879
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:28,920
this into evidence what hole was this scene filmed on on the arnold palmer designed pga west course

1880
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:36,320
in indio what hole why it's a par four and it is hole 16 do you think he played the whole that was

1881
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:40,360
part of the timing of the whole thing is he had to play the hole and get 16 as the helicopter

1882
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:45,460
swooped in maybe it's why maybe if charlie rose had let him keep talking uh maybe they were getting

1883
01:41:45,460 --> 01:41:48,880
towards the end of the hour and he said you know i don't like it because you know you're waiting

1884
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:53,420
around it takes forever you have to wait for the helicopter to go by it takes hours they tell you

1885
01:41:53,420 --> 01:41:56,900
it's only going to be a minute but then they're going to do other takes uh you know frankly

1886
01:41:56,900 --> 01:42:04,080
because of the imax camera i just don't like playing golf any i just said you know the biggest

1887
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:10,080
in my head probably in all of our heads we're thinking it i that makes sense eisner is a ceo

1888
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:14,700
ceo's golf it's a cheeky little thing that he's well why doesn't the golfer be uh why isn't the

1889
01:42:15,540 --> 01:42:20,900
eisner but he does not he does not but we know hockey is his sport he might be in a hockey scene

1890
01:42:20,900 --> 01:42:27,220
but why is he golfing if he could also be though a little joke we know michael doesn't like to golf

1891
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:32,500
so he's the golfer that hits the it's the drive well you would have to be a deep eisner fan as we

1892
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:37,900
are from the vantage point of 2023 because he had not yet publicly announced his distaste for golf

1893
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:42,700
on the charlie rose show in 2005 he needs to do the show there's so many questions that keep

1894
01:42:42,700 --> 01:42:47,160
popping up and it's and none of them will be about anything serious this is what he needs to

1895
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:53,060
understand they will all be about his acting we want to do an inside the actor studio with michael

1896
01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:58,780
eisner it's just like is he in the video yes acting wise and like what was it like to act with micky

1897
01:42:58,780 --> 01:43:05,500
mouse and yeah yeah just in camp half of it will be about camp yeah once we've done that episode

1898
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:11,040
once we fall in love with his book camp yeah it's gonna be all partners his other book about creative

1899
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:17,740
partnerships yeah we'll do it well i see nobody writes better books than ceos oh maybe maybe

1900
01:43:17,740 --> 01:43:24,400
former presidents but uh besides a second to ceo oh they're all normal and they're all chill

1901
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:29,540
anyway i don't think i've definitively proved it and let me just say you're good rather good

1902
01:43:29,540 --> 01:43:33,320
evidence you have good it's pretty good evidence i didn't expect to find that the transcript of

1903
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:38,860
the charlie rose interview um i would love to be proven wrong because it's better it's more fun

1904
01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:43,620
to think yeah was it was i happier when i was when i was going on the ride and thinking you know

1905
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:49,480
that's michael eisner and now here i am now i've become like this bilmar skeptic oh yeah now like

1906
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:55,660
you really believe you believe you're a thinking person and you think that michael eisner plays

1907
01:43:55,660 --> 01:44:01,360
golf no this is good this is good the fan thing i think has really lit this under you and i think

1908
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:07,740
this is good because this is again accepted fact i accepted it as fact and maybe we need to

1909
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:15,040
evaluate a lot of things we think we know about theme park that's what this is that's what this is

1910
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:20,800
about yeah deeper thinking harder thinking more clearly right which is why we need to go back and

1911
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:30,860
do indiana jones again before we get time we go clear we gotta we need to go clear on indiana jones

1912
01:44:30,860 --> 01:44:41,120
here i've got to clear out some things i i will say one thing i i found uh out that seems to be a

1913
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:49,040
certainty the the music the music unsworn terrific terrific but one thing however is certain

1914
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:57,560
the music is fantastic toes must be tapped extra extra the guy who did the score jerry goldsmith

1915
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:06,020
jerry goldsmith fucking guy's a legend he's a legend uh uh tora tora tora uh patent list them

1916
01:45:06,020 --> 01:45:09,840
alien folder guys cheer jason on l.

1917
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:13,960
a confidential the mummy you're not even getting to my favorite

1918
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:20,120
of all of them gremlins and gremlins too that's a good one too but no i'm we're talking star trek

1919
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:26,520
first contact well he did the like the main picture right yeah yeah yeah what we know is

1920
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:33,440
the movie yes this guy did so much like i i guess john williams probably still wins

1921
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:39,900
but like this is a close second i think even as far as iconic stuff and really the apes you throw

1922
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:48,480
that in and the ears and erector said story the first time he went on the ride he came down on

1923
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:55,340
it was crying he was in tears and he said his father was a pilot who loved everything about

1924
01:45:56,280 --> 01:46:02,700
california and he would do anything to be a part of this ride wow yeah he also i believe said

1925
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:09,280
because it meant so much to him uh he would have done it for free um i'm pretty certain he did not

1926
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:14,640
do it for free because i believe we got to hang out with the person who brokered the deal richard

1927
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:20,960
craft yeah his knee collector yeah yeah so i think he wouldn't i think he did not allow free to be

1928
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:27,320
if you act in a ride video you make nothing you make like well with something to ask eisner

1929
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:33,900
yeah of course i gotta do it i need a i need a 200 bonus sure i made 30 meals this year

1930
01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:38,680
meal penalty i've been here a long time trying to get on the sag health insurance it's better

1931
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:44,480
you know only 20 20 i'm wearing my own ceo's guild isn't so good wearing my own slacks it's an extra

1932
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:49,460
50 bump it's dry cleaning wear and tear on these shoes i had to wear golf spikes that's that's

1933
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:55,540
equipment needies no shoes don't count stunt performer bump 300 dollars helicopter's

1934
01:46:56,100 --> 01:47:01,880
stunt golf is stunts i hate golf so it's a stunt to do it uh uh so i completely lost my train of

1935
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:07,100
thought uh acting in a video is uh nothing you don't make anything and you don't make residuals

1936
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:12,940
but music in the park i've heard and i don't know if it was from him i think no i think it was i

1937
01:47:12,940 --> 01:47:17,380
think well somewhere i heard you have to sort at a certain point you have to count the amount of

1938
01:47:17,380 --> 01:47:24,260
a song even plays in the park and it all goes through whatever wow so negotiation when you

1939
01:47:24,260 --> 01:47:30,840
were huey lewis in back to the future the ride era yeah oh man breaking it in and yeah i hope

1940
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:37,160
the news got in on that too michael jackson estate when do the bart man plays at universal yes uh so

1941
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:41,940
yeah i think you make i think you make your money if you have a song playing yeah yeah well i think

1942
01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:47,280
other of his scores were playing in that there are some of the film scores in that uh in the line

1943
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:53,700
and you know what it's not his only theme park money because i didn't realize jerry goldsmith

1944
01:47:53,700 --> 01:48:02,940
the universal fanfare all right this guy but maybe this guy beats shan williams no heresy

1945
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:08,240
look i don't i don't want to speak ill of the dead jerry goldsmith passed away three years after

1946
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:14,380
doing this uh yes score but uh not not quite because come on indiana jones star wars star

1947
01:48:14,380 --> 01:48:18,700
wars or the star trek first contact theme well that's you have to be you have to view things

1948
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:25,000
from a certain lens yeah first con for first contact specifically yeah outside of the other

1949
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:32,220
star tricks to be what pops for you but incredible uh very great work and so much of what

1950
01:48:32,660 --> 01:48:37,780
holds the whole thing together right that's so much above the heart of it and yes it's doing

1951
01:48:37,780 --> 01:48:41,600
a half almost half the work i'm not saying the rest of it's not doing all the work and it wouldn't

1952
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:47,020
be fun but it does so much of the work of the five obviously because it's just such a good

1953
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:55,260
piece of music and goes a long way into making it mom's favorite ride other uh other senses sense

1954
01:48:55,260 --> 01:49:00,500
literal blasting you with sense that i feel like by the way you know what i'm going to propose this

1955
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:05,420
just so we're not russian uh i think a little california can leak into world i don't know when

1956
01:49:05,420 --> 01:49:09,720
we're gonna do world but you don't feel like you gotta like jam it all in we could talk about sense

1957
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:16,060
right now because i got some really weird flying theater stuff okay so we'll save that other format

1958
01:49:16,060 --> 01:49:20,220
of flying theater that's a perfect thing does it well that's what we're gonna cover the other

1959
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:25,320
fake ones too and the fake ones fit perfectly into the other one unless that's it we might

1960
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:31,300
discover that's its own episode too i don't know possible i have a lot of uh information here's a

1961
01:49:31,300 --> 01:49:37,920
tease i've got a lot of information about the uss john c stennis the aircraft carrier in the san

1962
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:42,320
diego sequence so stennis heads we aren't forgetting about you yeah it'll come later

1963
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:46,200
okay but anyway don't feel free to what were you gonna say i'm just gonna say we we skipped over

1964
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:51,620
before we talked about like the malibu and the coast yeah that is the best in my mind at the end

1965
01:49:51,620 --> 01:49:58,540
towards the end yes yeah my number one my favorite part of it absolutely that is just like that is

1966
01:49:58,540 --> 01:50:05,840
the most gorgeous pink it is so relaxing um like getting so dim it's got to be like the dimmest

1967
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:11,180
you can still be shooting and you can barely see the waves you could barely see the surfers

1968
01:50:11,180 --> 01:50:18,580
but the sound is so calming that's my favorite part of the music it's like rippling it's magic

1969
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:23,880
by that point yeah and you also not to be not to make it about me again we did skip over me and

1970
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:29,720
what i do with my legs on the ride oh yeah we did i stretch out because i'm usually doing this

1971
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:35,640
towards the end of the day and i'm usually doing it with some wine this is a perfect it's the wine

1972
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:44,480
tasting of rides so you know i want that to kick in especially for this malibu sequence and yes at

1973
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:49,360
the end of a long theme park day i've been walking and walking and walking and i have very tense calves

1974
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:54,200
in general i don't know if i've opened up about that on the show they get real tense they're pretty

1975
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:59,600
meaty if you ever get a look at them because i ride my bike a lot uh meaty calves i got them from my

1976
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:03,620
dad can you do a little more war burden on that one uh meaty calves i got them for my all right

1977
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:11,400
no they're fucking bricks yeah scots have meaty calves my hamstrings are dog shit just totally

1978
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:17,920
shot doing physical therapy um yours are which i've heard other podcasts and you go out and talk

1979
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:24,300
re uh past guests also uh i messaged him because what a time to be alive they were talking about

1980
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:28,940
their ailments physical therapy and it's like that makes me feel a lot better that's nice

1981
01:51:30,060 --> 01:51:37,280
podcasters connecting over leg over leg ailments um it's got some meaty leg muscles well look i

1982
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:41,280
stress you stretch them out and you know what yeah that's kind of the only like muscular part of my

1983
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:46,220
body exactly the same as my dad so anyway they're they're tense by the end of that day and it's

1984
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:51,340
exactly at that part that i give them just a big old stretch as far as they can go and then i feel

1985
01:51:51,340 --> 01:51:58,040
better it's the best place to be doing it um i feel so peaceful at that specific part of the ride

1986
01:51:58,040 --> 01:52:01,400
here's the thing okay this is maybe a larger conversation so i hate to do it but it's an

1987
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:06,320
interesting i think it's interesting and if it's not tell me to fuck off there sometimes when we've

1988
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:13,480
been on these rides board board fuck off all right let me finish the thought all right all right

1989
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:18,620
no it's okay it's okay i'm comfortable with it uh sometimes you know when you go on these rides a

1990
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:24,060
lot and and you get i would say sometimes even you're tired you're there and maybe this is more

1991
01:52:24,060 --> 01:52:28,920
in our younger days when we were there more often you go on a ride that's a classic ride you love

1992
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:35,140
it and there would be necessary the magic sometimes would be a little bit gone for part of the

1993
01:52:35,140 --> 01:52:40,040
experience in the sense that like okay yeah i'm on whatever i've been on hono mansion a ton of times

1994
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:45,380
on it again but i think there's always a moment in almost all these rides where it's impossible

1995
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:49,560
for the magic not to hit you a little bit you know what i'm saying like yeah like sometimes

1996
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:52,780
you're it's just there and you've been there forever and everything is just fresh and it's good

1997
01:52:52,780 --> 01:52:56,680
again and then sometimes you're on things and it feels a little sleepier and you're not getting

1998
01:52:56,680 --> 01:53:03,120
the spark you want but this malibu using this as an example this malibu seen on soren always gets

1999
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:08,640
the magic in my brain that always that's the perfect time i've never not felt that feeling

2000
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:13,860
that feels special in that part and i would be interested to know on all of the rides if there's

2001
01:53:13,860 --> 01:53:19,640
kind of a moment that actually like rips you from reality back into the it always hits yes yeah

2002
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:25,880
that's interesting well i think one thing in soren's favor this ride is nearly five minutes

2003
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:32,900
it's like i think i saw four minutes 51 seconds thrown around that is long that's a pretty long

2004
01:53:32,900 --> 01:53:38,120
ride yeah you get to really escape and that's deep into the escape and you're not anxious to

2005
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:43,440
get out of there right and it's kind of before it's sort of like a little bit of peace before the

2006
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:48,780
the grand finale where it gets a little more active and bombastic uh and we'll take i mean

2007
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:52,380
we'll talk about those things later why not that's this is a pretty good amount i think we got

2008
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:57,220
through a lot of amount of yeah but now we now with now the other stuff can breathe and is this

2009
01:53:57,220 --> 01:54:04,920
ride not about breathing relaxing not rushing uh so that's perfect and no like i think you're right

2010
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:09,240
that moment always hits some moment always hits yeah so you know there's magic in the air there

2011
01:54:10,060 --> 01:54:16,000
you survive podcast the ride uh i think right are we done we yeah i agree yeah i'm fine with it

2012
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:23,100
anymore policy isn't this better than like no no no no we're gonna not gonna move on until

2013
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:27,720
well it's funny sometimes so it's not always better but it's funny sometimes but i love

2014
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:33,020
stretching i love doing the stretch yeah yeah yeah i agree well i think i think we've had a

2015
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:38,060
moment here as nice as the malibu yeah sequence and now we get to we'll pick it up maybe it's

2016
01:54:38,060 --> 01:54:42,520
not till 2024 we'll see what other business we have to do uh because there's a lot of stuff coming

2017
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:48,380
we're getting uh scary soon we're heading into haunt cast yeah uh but more rides come in your

2018
01:54:48,380 --> 01:54:53,760
way and it won't be all rides look you know this podcast now it's not always gonna be right we also

2019
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:58,780
talked about rides in the vegas yeah we did yes we a thousand percent did some of the weirdest

2020
01:54:58,780 --> 01:55:03,360
like we're discovering we're discovering rides that could have been forgotten so that's yes i

2023
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:19,160
because you always kind of get that because like i said there's always newbies on it right but i

2024
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:22,880
just we just kind of like we're mad at people and now i'm not gonna tell them to clap for us
