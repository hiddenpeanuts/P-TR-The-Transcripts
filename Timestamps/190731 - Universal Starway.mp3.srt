1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,860
A lot of people have asked when will Podcast The Ride

3
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,420
do an episode about an escalator?

4
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,120
More specifically, multiple escalators.

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,960
Four escalators.

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,080
Four escalators to be specific.

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,800
And the day is finally here.

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,280
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,220
I'm Mike Carlson.

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,640
Joining me is always Jason Sheridan.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,480
Hi.

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,300
Scott Gairdner.

13
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,700
Yeah, and you know, I was thinking we could do the thing

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,420
where we like downplay and be like fake excited

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,500
about the mundane things.

16
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,980
But I'm really excited to talk about the Starway.

17
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,080
As soon as we, you know it's a good topic

18
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,000
when we have the idea in an episode

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,020
to quickly turn it around and do it.

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,720
We can't wait to do it.

21
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,960
And this is, it's a great day.

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,760
When is Space Mountain coming?

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,080
When is this one coming?

24
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,520
When is Guardians coming?

25
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,760
Slow down, killer, slow down.

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,600
Yeah, gentlemen.

27
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,160
We got a bank of escalators to talk about, friend.

28
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,200
Gentlemen, we met at Disneyland a couple,

29
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,180
like a week ago or so.

30
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,000
He goes, when are you gonna do Space Mountain?

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,080
And I was like, we're gonna get there.

32
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,840
We have a lot of important things.

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,340
And I didn't say specifically,

34
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,860
we were gonna talk about escalators before,

35
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,700
but that's, I knew in my head.

36
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,100
Let's just say there's an episode coming up

37
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,900
that involves the stars,

38
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,660
that involves slowly going up a hill

39
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,860
to find much excitement on the other side.

40
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,180
And that is the Starway.

41
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,180
The Starway.

42
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,500
Look folks, it's like golf.

43
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,900
It's a long game, you know?

44
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,700
We don't wanna burn off everything

45
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,020
in a one year, two year span.

46
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,220
Or sometimes we don't wanna burn off anything.

47
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,060
Yeah.

48
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,020
Should we wanna just sit and talk about escalators

49
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,860
for a while? Sure.

50
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,780
Yep, so here we are.

51
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,500
Universal Starway,

52
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,900
in case you don't know what we're talking about.

53
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,620
Because of the weird setup of Universal Studios,

54
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,620
this is a bizarre workaround to get people to an area

55
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,780
that's very, very, like how many stories below

56
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,220
Yes. the main park.

57
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,300
If you have not been out here,

58
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,380
Universal Studios Hollywood, of course,

59
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,580
a theme park built out of a movie studio,

60
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,340
which is an incorporated city within Los Angeles County

61
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,100
that happens to be built in and around a mountain.

62
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,700
We can call it a mountain, I think.

63
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,900
A large hill, a mountain.

64
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,180
Sure.

65
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,020
Yeah, I'll call it a mountain.

66
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,020
Give them the credit, yes.

67
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,860
Yeah.

68
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,460
Which, you know, inspires some fun and creativity.

69
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,660
I'm not sure that we would have the Jurassic Park ride

70
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,740
where they're not that slope to deal with.

71
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,740
Right. That seemed to me like

72
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,900
if we build a flume into the hill a little bit.

73
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,740
Yeah.

74
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,980
And use that double nature.

75
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,900
So we got that out of it.

76
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,380
And, but yeah, it's this bizarre

77
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,260
where a lot of the theme park stuff

78
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,820
was on the top of the hill and some was on the bottom

79
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,020
and they wanted to expand.

80
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,500
And where do we expand?

81
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,020
We don't want to expand on the bottom.

82
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,700
They set up this lower lot area,

83
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,740
but what are we gonna do?

84
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,220
How are we gonna get people down there?

85
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,820
Lots and lots of escalators.

86
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,900
Lots of escalators.

87
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,020
Recently, four rows of escalators,

88
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,900
for a long time, three rows of escalators.

89
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,340
The big Starway fans will know that it is now four.

90
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,540
They added a fourth bank.

91
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,500
Replacing stairs, is that what happened?

92
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,460
So there's a set of stairs on one side.

93
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,180
I think there was a second set of stairs

94
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,660
that they cleared out to add another bank of that,

95
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,500
which is four.

96
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,620
It takes four escalators each trip up and down.

97
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,540
You had to go up four escalators.

98
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,020
So this is gonna get confusing.

99
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,980
There's a bank of four across.

100
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,820
Left, right, up, and down.

101
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,340
A bank of four across.

102
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,140
But also, four down.

103
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,740
Four down, and those are also connected by little walkways.

104
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,740
Little landings.

105
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,140
Progressively less interesting landings.

106
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,300
I want to give credit.

107
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,940
Because that fourth set of escalators added

108
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,300
within the last two or three years,

109
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,220
Inside the Magic, a popular theme park news blog,

110
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,780
put up a video of it.

111
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,300
And I have to give them credit for this audio.

112
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,100
["Pirates of the Caribbean Theme Park"]

113
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,860
Opening a Baywatch or something.

114
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,860
The most exciting, dramatic public,

115
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,380
I can only assume public domain music,

116
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,220
covering a four to five minute video

117
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,540
of riding an escalator.

118
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,620
Drama foreboding, mystery, intrigue.

119
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,660
Those are the key words you'd search.

120
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,020
That is like a syndicated show from the 90s

121
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,780
that takes place on a beach, the start of it.

122
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,980
That's the start of the theme song.

123
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,180
It's Thunder in Paradise, it's Baywatch.

124
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,900
Just a drum, exotic drums.

125
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

126
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,300
Surf riders.

127
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,220
Baywatch nights.

128
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,540
Wave kickers.

129
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,380
Relic.

130
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,380
Well, mine was real.

131
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,180
Relic Hunter.

132
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,020
What's real?

133
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,860
I don't know about Relic Hunter.

134
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,860
Oh, Relic Hunter is Tia Carrera.

135
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,260
Oh man.

136
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,660
Carrera?

137
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,340
I think Carrera, yeah.

138
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,980
Yeah, it was like a syndicated where she was like

139
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,220
a Lara Croft style excavator of, I'm surprised.

140
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,060
This is a...

141
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,900
Don't know it.

142
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,820
Is Cleopatra 2120 on your radar?

143
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,060
That sounds familiar.

144
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,460
Cause that's in the same genre of like...

145
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,740
Never seen it.

146
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,900
Sexy badass woman does a cool thing.

147
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,740
That's more spy, I think.

148
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,860
That was a team of them.

149
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,700
It was a team.

150
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,540
Oh, it was VIP.

151
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,380
And then VIP, of course, for Panmaners.

152
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,700
Valerie Irons Protections, yeah.

153
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,540
What does it say in there?

154
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,140
Valerie Irons Protection.

155
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,980
Yeah, cause...

156
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,820
Her name is the VI?

157
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,580
Yeah, her name is, she runs a bodyguard protection agency.

158
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,500
Irons.

159
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,100
Yeah, we should do...

160
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,700
We'll do a Patreon on Relic Hunter and VIP eventually.

161
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,540
Oh, for sure.

162
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,860
Can do, we're slowly stretching the confines

163
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,060
where to me, if it's like theme parky

164
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,260
and it's silliness and campiness, I think it counts.

165
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,940
I'll guarantee to the listener,

166
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,020
we'll get to Relic Hunter and VIP before Space Mountain.

167
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,860
Yelled, for sure.

168
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,380
That is a guarantee to you, the listener.

169
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,220
Yes.

170
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,100
Some many topics we're afraid of.

171
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,940
Yeah.

172
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,540
Cause what do you do when it's gone?

173
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,900
That's not on your checklist.

174
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,460
Well, in fairness, Mike is afraid of those shows

175
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,100
because they are a little sexy.

176
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,420
A little sexy.

177
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,900
But they are sexy, not sexy, like too sexy

178
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,140
that they couldn't be on Sunday afternoon on WGN.

179
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,580
Yeah.

180
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,420
I've been doing a Baywatch dive recently

181
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,100
because I don't think I realized how sitcom bad it was.

182
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,020
Yeah, oh yeah.

183
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,940
I think I thought it was just, it was like stupid action

184
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,660
but it's a lot more like...

185
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,500
But it, but it didn't, didn't, didn't, didn't, like,

186
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,820
like, like, oh, CJ, it's very high jinky.

187
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,340
And so with that, like, from my recent Baywatch experience,

188
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,700
if you're not into the boobs or the butts,

189
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,580
around any corner is a crazy old man,

190
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,300
like, who lives in a trash can and calls himself fella.

191
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,780
Or like, you know, guest stars of the past,

192
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,580
like, Connie Stevens or who played the talk show.

193
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,460
I mean, I just found one with Jay Leno.

194
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,140
Didn't you post one with Geraldo?

195
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,900
Yes, Geraldo.

196
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,780
Yeah, yeah, credits to Brennan Campbell who alerted me.

197
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,380
If you're looking for celebrities on Baywatch,

198
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,940
there's one where, with Geraldo, and does he play Geraldo?

199
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,500
No, he plays an unrelated nerd character.

200
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,620
That's how Brennan conveyed it to me.

201
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,420
I could not have watched this episode quicker.

202
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,540
And he's playing a nerd, but he's clearly very tan

203
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,020
and very buff.

204
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,020
So you, like, no dorky shirt is going to hide that.

205
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,740
And it's a lot of to hassle off, like,

206
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,980
but I can never be like you.

207
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,060
I don't have what you have.

208
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,740
But he's like, I think maybe more in shape than.

209
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,300
I'm sure he is, because as we've said on the Little Mermaid

210
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,220
episode, he's as jacked as King Triton is now.

211
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,060
Oh, that's right.

212
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,060
Oh, he came up.

213
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,860
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

214
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,740
Because he's so chiseled and he's got that sloping crotch

215
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,220
thing.

216
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,540
The D'Angelo video crotch.

217
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,020
Yeah.

218
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,900
What do you call that?

219
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,980
What actual part is that, like, V?

220
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,540
Your pelvic?

221
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,380
Yeah, I guess.

222
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,860
If you got a jacked pelvis, like Batman suit.

223
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,660
I just call it dinner.

224
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,660
Right?

225
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,420
What?

226
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,140
Right, fellas?

227
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,140
Yuck.

228
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,140
Oh my god.

229
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,620
Get me a bib and a fork and knife.

230
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,140
Gee whiz.

231
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,540
It's the most outrageous thing anyone's ever said on the show.

232
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,620
No, it doesn't even make sense.

233
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,940
Eat me some pilv tonight.

234
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,460
It makes sense to me.

235
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,180
It's highly sexual in nature.

236
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,300
It's a come on, in fact, to the old D'Angelo.

237
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,500
Your usual bow tie is spinning and your dickie has curled up

238
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,180
and slapped you in the face.

239
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,060
Like when Big Bird dresses up.

240
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,820
That's what I'm wearing.

241
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,940
I have to say, the world of Cleopatra 2020 and Relic

242
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:28,340
Hunter and all that, all of those TV sci-fi sets are often,

243
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,340
these sets and effects are often just awful.

244
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,660
And it kind of nails in the chalkboard to me.

245
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,780
But if I could walk through that set in a theme park,

246
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,180
I'd be like, oh, this is pretty good.

247
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,860
I like this.

248
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,900
Oh, that's a good point.

249
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,660
Sure, sure, sure.

250
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,940
Your standards are different.

251
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,180
Yeah, standards are different.

252
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,420
Yeah, we loved every Knott's Maze.

253
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,220
Like, wow, this is like the most, this is the best art design

254
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:50,940
I've ever.

255
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,340
Yeah, short term seasonal attraction.

256
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,820
Great.

257
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,660
12 season Highlander TV show.

258
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,940
I don't know.

259
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,540
Yeah, the graphics on UPN's Deadly Games,

260
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,060
my favorite of all these short lived shows.

261
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,180
That's the one, of course, where Christopher Lloyd plays

262
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,260
Sebastian Jackal.

263
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,100
And they go into a computer and it's like the net.

264
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,020
I think they call it the net or whatever.

265
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,220
Like the web maybe.

266
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,260
Brent Spiner plays a very Joker-ish villain.

267
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,180
And they speed him up and it's good.

268
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:28,660
Look it up.

269
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,540
Speed him up?

270
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,180
Yeah, it's like he's doing something quickly.

271
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,220
I mean, they did that to honestly,

272
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,340
they did that to him on Star Trek when he was doing something

273
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,740
his data because he could type very fast.

274
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,740
That's something he could do as an Android.

275
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,380
But on Deadly Games, he's going through like fucking something

276
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,140
up in a lab or something and they keep speeding it up

277
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,420
to make him seem like scary or outrageous or like,

278
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,180
I don't know, or like superhuman.

279
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,620
Like he's able to dash from place to place like a ghost.

280
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,860
Yeah, yeah.

281
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,700
But yeah, look up Deadly Games, another Patreon

282
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,500
that I will guarantee before Space Mountain.

283
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,300
Yeah.

284
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,940
We'll do the character Sebastian Jackal.

285
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,460
He gets the character episode before Space Mountain.

286
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,260
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

287
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,860
But for now, hey, let's live in the now

288
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,100
in our dream episode we're currently doing, The Star Way.

289
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,700
Now, I mean, it is unique.

290
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,540
No, I can't think of another theme park

291
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,860
that has a giant system of escalators

292
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,820
to transition from one part of the park to the other.

293
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,340
Is there any other multi-tiered theme park

294
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,420
that exists on two different planes?

295
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,580
Well, there is a Lionsgate vertical theme park

296
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,540
opening in Asia, but we don't know.

297
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,380
They haven't revealed all of that yet.

298
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,220
Sure.

299
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,060
We don't quite know what that looks like.

300
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,540
Disney Quest is multiple floors.

301
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,020
Yeah, Disney Quest is multiple floors,

302
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,420
but it's still inside.

303
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,780
But do you get to ride a mall,

304
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:52,420
but essentially a mall escalator with a very slight covering?

305
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,660
I can't think of many other escalators

306
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,020
that have to withstand rainfall.

307
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,060
Yeah, that's a good question.

308
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,060
Oh, that's true, yeah.

309
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,580
I have some escalator facts.

310
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,420
Oh, great.

311
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,460
Did you also get the facts from

312
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,060
Probably the same thing you did.

313
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,060
Keepitupdavid.wordpress.com?

314
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,420
No, I didn't.

315
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,260
Oh, wow.

316
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,940
I went to somebody's website that was about

317
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,460
staying fit at theme parks,

318
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:25,460
and it seems like this guy lost like 100 pounds

319
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,460
and uses theme parks for fitness a lot.

320
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,140
And it is true that if you were to go up and down

321
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:36,700
the starway a couple times, that's a major workout.

322
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,540
The stairs on the side of the starway.

323
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,140
You would have to do the, yes, let's be clear.

324
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,900
Yeah, the remaining stairwell is what you would have to do.

325
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,380
Quarter mile long though, this is a quarter mile long.

326
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,740
That's kind of, that many stairs are pretty brutal.

327
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,140
I've done it, I did it once.

328
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,660
I don't remember when, but I did do the stairs up once

329
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,860
and it was crazy.

330
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,380
It's, yeah, it's bad.

331
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,740
Especially in the summer, don't do it in the summer.

332
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,700
Down is okay.

333
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,540
Oh yeah, down is fine.

334
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,380
I think I've done it down, yeah.

335
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:05,060
Yeah, down, down, historically much easier than up

336
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,900
when it comes to stairs.

337
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,980
I'm saying folks, folks, you heard it.

338
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,300
Yeah.

339
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,300
Breaking news.

340
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,140
But your facts.

341
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,060
Oh yeah, my dry facts.

342
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,500
There are an estimated 700,000 elevators

343
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,780
and 35,000 escalators in America.

344
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,100
Oh, these are not starway facts.

345
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,940
No, no, these are just general escalator facts.

346
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,540
I didn't get them from keepitupdated.com.

347
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,820
No, no, no, keep it updated.

348
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,460
This is from eesf.org, which I assume is some sort

349
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,380
of like government board that keeps track

350
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,740
of escalators in America.

351
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,740
Over 245 million riders take an escalator daily.

352
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,300
About 210 billion riders travel on elevators

353
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,940
or escalators each year in North America.

354
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,380
So there you go.

355
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,220
Wow.

356
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,060
People use it a lot.

357
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,900
Keep it up escalators.

358
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,260
Yeah, escalators though, not as,

359
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,220
it seems like they're not as widely used as elevators.

360
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,820
Well, hang in there.

361
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,300
Yeah.

362
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,540
Preferable.

363
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,700
I enjoy an escalator.

364
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,060
You like an escalator better?

365
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,700
I like an escalator better.

366
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,700
Less likely to get stuck in.

367
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,540
Although I've never gotten stuck in an elevator, thankfully.

368
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,780
Well, I would say that's true,

369
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,940
but if there's an accident sometimes on an escalator,

370
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,220
like we'll get to, I think here, it could be real bad.

371
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,260
It can be horrific.

372
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,100
Yeah.

373
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,940
It's true.

374
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,700
There's a bunch of people just sliding down

375
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,660
and landing on top of each other.

376
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,100
It's a horrible thing.

377
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,940
Yeah.

378
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,740
Hopefully it just stops and then it's fine.

379
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,940
It just turns into stairs.

380
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,780
Sure.

381
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,540
I just got to go to, I just rode on perhaps

382
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,300
the most crucial escalator in all of history,

383
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,740
the Trump Tower escalator where at the bottom,

384
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,180
Trump officially announced his candidacy

385
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,820
and told everyone that they aren't sending their best.

386
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,900
And what I didn't know was that at the very end

387
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,580
of that escalator is a swirly handwritten sign

388
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,260
that says Trump's old fashioned ice cream.

389
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,900
They try to convey as if he invented an ice cream formula.

390
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,420
He perfected a good buttery,

391
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,980
the way it's supposed to be made.

392
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,980
There's no picture of him with an old ice cream scoopers,

393
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,340
like a little paper crown.

394
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,140
No, there's not a cartoon version of him.

395
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,260
There's not a big head caricature bobble head guy,

396
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,980
which I wonder if maybe that was presented

397
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,500
in the initial design and he was like, no,

398
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,180
it makes me look like a fool.

399
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,460
Burn this.

400
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,700
That pushed his sense of humor.

401
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,540
A caricature is too comical for Trump to like it.

402
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,380
Yeah, I think he would want him to be

403
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,500
a young and sexy character

404
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,700
that had nothing to do with ice cream.

405
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,060
Like a hot 20 year old version of Trump.

406
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,900
In a suit.

407
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,740
That's what he would want.

408
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,740
Yeah, right, in a suit and that would be on the wall

409
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,340
of the Trump's old fashioned ice cream.

410
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,180
Yeah.

411
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,020
It doesn't make sense.

412
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,140
He's standing nowhere near an ice cream of any kind.

413
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,980
Yeah.

414
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,800
Well.

415
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,800
No napkins, that shows weakness.

416
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,940
Absolutely no napkins.

417
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,780
The other Trump ice cream is his Olly G segment.

418
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,220
Oh, oh, that's right.

419
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,540
Where he pitches a.

420
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,300
His Olly G pitches him ice cream gloves.

421
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,380
And Trump is very proud later.

422
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,980
He claims he knew it was a fake thing.

423
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,700
I mean, he does leave during it, but.

424
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,180
Yeah, I guess you gotta give him credit for that,

425
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,020
that he does.

426
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,060
But he's a performer.

427
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,900
He knows a ruse when he sees one.

428
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,740
Right.

429
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,380
He's very keen to the entertainment business.

430
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,140
So yeah.

431
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,980
But.

432
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,180
So was that the most exciting escalator ride you ever had?

433
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,460
I think so, knowing that was the spot,

434
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,540
and I went down it and did not realize

435
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,420
till I turned and looked back, oh my God, that is it.

436
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,580
I didn't know that I had just written it.

437
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,140
Is there a more important escalator in history?

438
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,620
Perhaps the Starway?

439
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,900
Yeah, I would, I can't think.

440
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,380
Yeah, I think that's probably at this point,

441
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,060
not for a good reason, but yeah, historically.

442
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:03,900
It's really.

443
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,180
No other world leader.

444
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,260
It wouldn't have been possible for Genghis Khan

445
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,420
to announce anything via escalator ride.

446
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,020
And it's such a perfect, that whole video of him

447
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,100
coming down the escalator to announce

448
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,940
is just the perfect encapsulation, like the whole thing.

449
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,300
It's just so perfect.

450
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,300
It's terrible looking.

451
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,100
He's coming in like it's a mall, right?

452
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,380
It's like, yeah, you landed in a mall.

453
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,980
It's like Trump's bar, Trump's pizza,

454
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,140
and then right at the foot of the escalator,

455
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,180
Trump's ice cream.

456
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,780
So just know if you're thinking about that moment

457
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,860
that he was staring at a sign that said Trump's ice cream.

458
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,660
Sully to mall food court.

459
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,260
Like a twisted version of a thing we all know and love.

460
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,420
A mall with escalators.

461
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,860
With like marble and 80s fonts.

462
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,660
It's a thing I would absolutely love were it not for.

463
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,500
Anywhere.

464
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,940
The underpinnings of it.

465
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,420
Yeah, it's a shame.

466
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,860
But luckily, I don't know if people know this,

467
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,140
but if you go across, if you look across the street

468
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,420
at Tum Tower, there's a lot of people

469
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,620
giving the tower the finger.

470
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,460
Oh, they're doing it.

471
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,300
Right, right, right.

472
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,180
We're gonna wear it down one finger at a time.

473
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,660
And of course, a nice transition to the starway

474
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,020
is someone related to Trump as well.

475
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,980
Oh, good point, yes.

476
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,260
Is Billy Bush, who does a lot of the,

477
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,100
well, all of the narration.

478
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,460
Does he still?

479
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,300
I don't believe.

480
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,140
He's a lot more minions now.

481
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,180
He was replaced by minion noises.

482
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,020
But for many years.

483
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,180
Is it just pure minion noises?

484
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,780
There's safety warnings and music

485
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,340
and a generic theme park announcer,

486
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,380
and I feel like a lot of banana.

487
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,460
Really?

488
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,900
I didn't know that part of it.

489
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,020
I've heard that, but I don't know

490
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,060
that that's all over the place.

491
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,220
I mean, they play Happy.

492
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,300
That's the memory I have now of it in the last few years

493
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,300
is that Happy is constantly playing on the starway.

494
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,140
Happy is constantly playing.

495
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,180
Happy is Universal's theme song.

496
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,220
It's there when you wish upon a star.

497
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,060
Yes.

498
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,460
Billy Bush, yeah, took over.

499
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,140
And the Access Hollywood, was it just him?

500
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,860
The Access Hollywood Access.

501
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,620
I don't remember if Nancy O'Dell was in there.

502
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,220
It was never Pat O'Brien.

503
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,060
Never Pat O'Brien.

504
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,820
Yeah, they didn't have ownership of it

505
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,780
until the Billy Bush era.

506
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,580
Of course, at the end of the Universal tour

507
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,180
for a long time, your reward at the end

508
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:23,180
was to take a picture with a wooden Billy Bush in Nancy O'Dell.

509
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,420
So they had a big presence in the park around this time.

510
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:30,780
Starting in 2006, 2006 was when that went in.

511
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,020
I have a confession to make.

512
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,780
In high school, there was a stretch of time

513
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,700
where I watched Access Hollywood a few times a week.

514
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,540
Really?

515
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,500
The Daily Show came on at seven.

516
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,980
The Daily Show re-air from the night before,

517
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,060
which I would usually go to bed around that time.

518
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,660
I watched the Daily Show re-air

519
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,940
and then flip over to Access Hollywood.

520
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,900
It was on?

521
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,580
It was on and I liked to entertain,

522
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,660
I liked knowing about movies coming out

523
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,620
and TV coming out and that.

524
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,500
Was there not a 730 Seinfeld or Simpsons?

525
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,660
I feel like on various channels at various times,

526
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,900
there's reliably 730 is a slot I associate

527
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,460
with one of those shows.

528
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,820
Our Simpsons was at 630.

529
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,460
Sometimes there was a Seinfeld,

530
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,260
but they'd move it around a lot.

531
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,140
But I know what you mean.

532
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,260
Was Entertainment Weekly opposite?

533
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,340
Because where I'm from,

534
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,620
Access Hollywood and Entertainment Weekly

535
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,700
on at the same time.

536
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,020
Entertainment Weekly?

537
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,860
Entertainment Tonight.

538
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,700
Oh, Scott, I'm losing my mind.

539
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,540
Entertainment Tonight.

540
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,820
Yeah, I think on at the same time.

541
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,460
I think Access Hollywood aired on NBC

542
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:44,580
and I think I just usually would turn on NBC as default.

543
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,060
Extra had their own space carved out.

544
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,100
Extra's not part of this horrible game.

545
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,380
Yeah, I guess.

546
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,340
This bloodthirsty, this blood sport.

547
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,860
Yeah, Billy Bush.

548
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,500
I remember not having good feelings about Billy Bush

549
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,340
even before everything.

550
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,660
Just because I tend to have a weird visceral reaction

551
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,980
like this smarmy guy who doesn't really do much of anything

552
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,460
and has no discernible talents

553
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:18,460
and just kinda talks and has good composure.

554
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,500
I is not a type of person.

555
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,180
I am like, hooray, I'm glad they're on television.

556
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,980
But what's the difference?

557
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,300
And I agree with what you're saying

558
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,340
and I'm thinking out loud.

559
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,100
Is the difference with him and Regis

560
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,300
that Regis is just old and we like Regis?

561
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,740
Yeah, maybe I just inherently try.

562
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,340
I don't know, I think the past versions of these people

563
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,300
were stranger and funnier.

564
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,740
Uh-huh, yeah.

565
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,420
Even Dick Clark is always pointed to as the original that

566
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,980
but I find he seems a little more sincere

567
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,660
and is associated with picking good music

568
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,260
to present to America.

569
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,540
But it's also screwed many people out of royalties

570
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,860
and there's a whole controversy surrounding him.

571
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,420
Well and as Michael Moore conveyed

572
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,860
and I forget which one in Bowling for Columbine,

573
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,620
all the shootings are his fault.

574
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,460
Oh right.

575
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,220
And that weird part where like,

576
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,580
yeah, you did this sir as he's getting in a van

577
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,940
and Dick Clark probably doesn't even know

578
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,980
what he's talking about.

579
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,300
Right.

580
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,740
So all the shootings are on Dick Clark's hands.

581
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,060
I hate to keep pitching Patreon episodes

582
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,660
but then Dick Clark had a restaurant chain as well.

583
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,940
Uh-huh.

584
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,860
And there was one in Schomburg.

585
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,700
Oh.

586
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,700
Also in Schomburg.

587
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

588
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,980
Why was it so, is it just like middle of the country

589
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,620
just makes it chain restaurant?

590
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,900
Yeah, I mean it's Woodfield I think specifically.

591
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,740
Yeah.

592
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,020
Because this was in the mall next,

593
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,060
the outdoor mall next to Woodfield.

594
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,880
Okay.

595
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,700
Did you have a Cheeburger Cheeburger?

596
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,820
That was a chain based on the SNL.

597
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,660
Cheeburger?

598
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,500
Cheeburger Cheeburger.

599
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,220
But wasn't it just Cheeseburger?

600
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,980
No, they must've spelled it.

601
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,660
Yeah, they spelled it in a weird way.

602
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,500
Yeah, yeah.

603
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,340
Oh, I didn't even know that was the.

604
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,180
CHEE.

605
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,660
I know what you're talking about

606
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,900
but I don't think we have one near in the suburbs.

607
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,260
I remember one of their things was that on the table

608
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,540
there was a box of trivial pursuit cards at every table

609
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,140
so you could pass the time while you waited for your food.

610
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,980
Wow.

611
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,500
And then there was some eight by tens of SNL cast members.

612
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,340
Acroid.

613
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,180
Acroid.

614
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,020
Of course.

615
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,540
Those Greek guys who barely spoke English

616
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,280
would not be able to play trivial pursuit

617
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,300
and probably don't have a working knowledge

618
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,940
of American pop culture.

619
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,300
Probably not.

620
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,660
Although I don't know that Billy Bush

621
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,620
had much working knowledge of American pop culture too.

622
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,900
Probably just read whatever is it.

623
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,580
Seems like a husk of a man.

624
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,420
Yeah, yeah.

625
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,460
Member of the Bush family as well.

626
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,500
So that got that going against him.

627
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,300
I think George W. Bush's cousin, is that right?

628
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,140
Something like that.

629
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:48,980
Or nephew, maybe?

630
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,300
It was like an optical illusion looking at that man

631
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,260
and it would bug you out seeing the Bush in him.

632
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,540
Yeah, right, cause it was there.

633
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,700
Him and the number of times on the Starway

634
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,300
they would play the Access Hollywood sting,

635
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,100
it would just drive me crazy.

636
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,060
I mean it's a long, seven or eight minutes on an escalator

637
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,020
does feel long.

638
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,180
Is that how long the whole thing takes?

639
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,060
I believe seven to eight minutes depending on crowds.

640
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,180
It's pretty fast to get you that far down.

641
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,380
I would have told you it takes you 20 minutes.

642
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,820
If you asked me yesterday, I would have said,

643
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,100
oh like 20 minutes before I looked into it.

644
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,220
It feels long.

645
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,540
So I was gonna say, to me the Starway

646
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,980
is a pretty big barrier to entry for me

647
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,340
even getting down to the lower lot.

648
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,300
I've had an annual pass and during the entire City Walk

649
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,420
saga where I had a pass and we were up there all the time,

650
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,140
how many times did I go to the lower lot?

651
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,140
Maybe once, maybe not at all.

652
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:43,980
Wow.

653
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,700
Because you got Harry Potter,

654
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,820
you got the best thing in the park on the upper level.

655
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,780
I don't like Transformers that much.

656
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,260
I don't, you know, now I'm more of a launch queen

657
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,300
than I was then but I was not doing Mummy.

658
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,580
Jurassic Park is a no for me.

659
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,820
So that hurts it all too.

660
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,780
I guess, all right, if you look at it from a different angle,

661
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,140
some of the best rides are on the lower lot

662
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,700
but it's ones that I avoid.

663
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,860
But also just the inconvenience of,

664
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:15,020
I also live not that far from the studio

665
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,300
so it always feels crazy to me that like,

666
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,540
taking the Starway feels like I took the longest,

667
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,700
secludedest route back to my house.

668
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,540
Right.

669
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,980
When Homer perks in the furthest end

670
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,300
of the nuclear plant lot

671
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,740
and then it's butting up against his backyard.

672
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,580
Right.

673
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,940
That's how going all the way up

674
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,940
and all the way down feels to me.

675
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,100
I'll give a tip though,

676
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,700
if anyone is visiting and needs to not,

677
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,540
like do all of Universal in a day

678
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,900
and don't wanna feel rushed,

679
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,700
if you get there when the park opens,

680
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,660
go straight to the lower lot,

681
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:51,660
you can do all three of those rides in an hour or less.

682
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,300
And then you have a lot of multiple times too.

683
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,660
Multiple times probably.

684
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,980
Now this may change when Jurassic World opens,

685
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,300
hopefully this year.

686
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,980
But yeah, you can,

687
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,660
most people immediately go to what they see on the upper lot

688
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,660
or immediately go to Harry Potter or the tram tour.

689
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,420
I feel like a lot of people go right to the tram tour.

690
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,620
Don't do that.

691
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,140
Sure, don't need to.

692
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:16,980
Yeah.

693
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,940
Yeah.

694
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,820
And then Nintendo is going here too.

695
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,660
Yeah.

696
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,060
So that's a certain point.

697
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,500
And there will be so many people on this starway

698
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,260
and it will break, it will buckle.

699
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,100
The whole thing will fall off the side.

700
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,140
Yes, the entire starway is going down day one

701
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,860
of Nintendo, I'll feel horrible if I predicted it.

702
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,700
And I hope that's not right.

703
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:41,340
Like the blocks in Mario Brothers level that like fall

704
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,860
if you stand on them too long.

705
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,700
Oh yeah.

706
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,860
The starway will keep moving.

707
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,220
Keep moving, keep moving.

708
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,660
I'll say that, I mean, they need to that lower lot.

709
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,980
There's some weird, like there's restaurants down there

710
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,580
that are sometimes open, sometimes never open.

711
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,780
There is an ice cream stand down there where like we got,

712
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,020
look, we brought the crazy ice cream from Florida,

713
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,540
big milkshakes and stuff that seems to close much earlier

714
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,860
than the rest of the park.

715
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,300
Oh, that's, cause that's happened.

716
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,900
This is the experience we had, is that right?

717
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,780
Well we had that, I think I had it one time before,

718
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:12,740
but it's a weird holdover of universal,

719
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,740
we ran down there though.

720
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,860
It was busy days.

721
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,460
We ran down there right before close.

722
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,820
And I think you had your eye on that ice cream

723
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,660
and it was closed.

724
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,620
Well we blitzed through, I mean,

725
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,020
we did at least transformers.

726
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,380
We wanted to do something else.

727
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,140
Yeah, but I was like, oh, maybe I'll get an ice cream

728
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,260
down there and it closed.

729
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,260
Nope.

730
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,060
They have all, they do have the fun transformers,

731
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:34,700
like for greeting or the characters greeting people

732
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,500
and goofing on people too.

733
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,340
So that's cool.

734
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,260
What I remember about the lower lot is that it used to have

735
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:44,460
a big billboard for coach on the outside of a soundstage.

736
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:51,420
And a lot of coach, on the tour,

737
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,580
I like to talk about coach as much as possible.

738
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,860
That was a thing if I was bored was just say that coach

739
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,020
filmed at every single spot.

740
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,020
And there was some clip that I played over where I did it

741
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,820
as coach, it was not coach.

742
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,580
It was a clip of Al Roker or something.

743
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,060
And I'd dub it over.

744
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,900
Hey folks, it's me coach boy.

745
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,180
A lot of fun times filming coach.

746
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:16,220
27 seasons, I think it was.

747
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,340
Which coach long off the air when you were doing the tour.

748
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,180
Oh yeah, yeah.

749
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,020
Yes, many decades.

750
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:21,860
But did it come back?

751
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,820
No, they talked about it, but it didn't come to pass.

752
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,420
I was trying to remember, like,

753
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,260
did I see a coach reboot?

754
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,140
It was like NBC or whatever, was it NBC or ABC?

755
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:29,980
NBC.

756
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,820
NBC.

757
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,660
They announced it.

758
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,500
They announced it, yeah, yeah.

759
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,340
And it just didn't happen.

760
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,180
And then it didn't happen.

761
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,020
For some reason.

762
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,940
And someone remembered that nobody likes coach.

763
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,780
Right.

764
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,900
Despite it being on TV for a year, a decade.

765
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,980
Was it, or did it switch at one point in time?

766
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,140
It switched networks, yeah.

767
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,220
Okay, that's why.

768
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,500
Because I was just rewatching

769
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,460
the Dana Carvey Show documentary

770
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,180
and the final episode was yanked from its slot

771
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,940
and replaced with a special coach

772
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,660
that I think Troy Aikman was in or something.

773
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,620
Oh, I believe that.

774
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,300
Coach also feels like it started in 1980

775
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,340
and ended in 1998.

776
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,180
Yeah, absolutely.

777
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,460
It started like it bridged two decades.

778
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,140
Many presidents.

779
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,180
I don't even wanna look at it.

780
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,020
Presidents, world events.

781
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,460
I will, but I don't want to.

782
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,300
I don't actually wanna know.

783
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,860
I think that's a nine season.

784
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:22,700
I feel like that happens more and more nowadays.

785
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:26,620
Shows switching networks with all the digital outlets

786
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,460
and streaming outlets.

787
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:32,020
I mean, one day at a time just saved by CBS.

788
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,500
They're putting it on pop TV

789
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,540
because they can't put it on CBS All Access for a while

790
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,740
due to non-compete issues of Netflix shows.

791
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,980
It is a big deal that Netflix is letting the show continue

792
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,540
because of the draconian contracts saying

793
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,300
you cannot move this to another streaming service.

794
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,220
Putting a show on pop TV is saying

795
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,900
we're gonna air the show exclusively in a hole.

796
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,020
We're throwing the show in good news.

797
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,340
It's on pit.

798
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,160
Is that a channel?

799
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,500
No, we're throwing the show into a pit.

800
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,940
But I don't know that CBS All Access is that better.

801
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,780
It may just be there for a couple years

802
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,100
until they can get it to CBS All Access.

803
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,420
Which more people. So pop TV is a safe house.

804
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,820
Yeah, essentially.

805
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,620
We gotta protect the show.

806
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:18,960
But I just saw Netflix saved Designated Survivor

807
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,020
for third season.

808
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,380
Netflix picked up. Oh, really?

809
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,220
I didn't know that.

810
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,100
Designated Survivor ran two seasons on ABC.

811
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,540
This is Kiefer Sutherland is the cabinet member

812
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,940
who survives a bombing.

813
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,460
He is the Designated Survivor,

814
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,540
the head of housing and urban development

815
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:35,420
becomes the president due to the line of succession.

816
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,060
Netflix has picked it up for a third season.

817
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,900
These are all-

818
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,540
Less fun King Ralph.

819
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,380
Yeah.

820
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,060
He doesn't do any, no boogie woogie piano

821
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,900
in that line of succession.

822
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,140
But equally idealistic.

823
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:52,060
But can he stay idealistic in this new position?

824
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,580
These are all just like shell games

825
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,140
that these corporations are playing

826
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,340
where it's like if you move money around here

827
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,820
and get another one of our channels

828
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,260
to take the show, we can then move it into syndication,

829
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,060
which will then give us another 100,

830
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,460
it's all just math.

831
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,020
It's not, some of these things are not based on

832
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,380
even if people like it.

833
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,220
So like coach-

834
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,580
Not like when things were-

835
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,060
Coach was pure.

836
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:14,900
Yes, yeah.

837
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,380
The demand from the public was so great.

838
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,220
Yeah.

839
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,820
And Deadly Game was pure.

840
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,660
Yeah.

841
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,780
They just wanted to make a great show

842
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,460
and tell a great story about Sebastian Jackle.

843
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,300
Yeah.

844
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,540
This wasn't about finding some weird secret money

845
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,220
in Finland or whatever.

846
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,460
No, this was yes, for the love of the game.

847
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,300
The tale of Jackle.

848
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,300
When Deadly Game got canceled, heaven got another angel.

849
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,900
Can we, when we finally figure out

850
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,180
how to purchase Marvel McFay,

851
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,980
can we also purchase the IP from Deadly Games

852
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,300
so we can own Sebastian Jackle

853
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,540
and license him out in the theme parks?

854
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,380
I think we can.

855
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,380
I think so.

856
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,580
We're slowly amassing,

857
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,220
we're gonna have the best miscellany lineup

858
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,580
of properties outside of Six Flags.

859
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,420
Right.

860
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,500
Because yeah, we'll have Marvel McFay,

861
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,500
what else have we talked about getting, owning?

862
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,820
Oh, the Berry Tales?

863
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,100
We can't just like do a drawing of something we like.

864
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,500
We have to own the-

865
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,340
Yeah, we have to figure-

866
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,700
Character in the song.

867
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,340
I've looked into the Marvel McFay IP.

868
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,420
It's very confusing.

869
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,660
And I think it's just blanket owned by,

870
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,380
well, not Warner Brothers anymore

871
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,700
because they sold Six Flags,

872
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,540
but I think it's just,

873
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,460
it's lumped into all those Six Flags.

874
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,180
Yeah, it's probably in a Warner Brothers vault somewhere.

875
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,500
Yeah, we just gotta get a lawyer-

876
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,580
A fire prone Warner Brothers vault.

877
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,420
Oh no.

878
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,460
We have to find a lawyer

879
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,380
that will look through the documents and see,

880
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,540
and then try to convince someone to negotiate with us.

881
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,820
I mean, do we think Travis Barker has pitched on it?

882
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,820
Was he too young?

883
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,700
I mean, Travis Barker, who did the Astroworld album,

884
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,420
did he ever experience Marvel McFay?

885
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,900
From Blink-182?

886
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,900
Travis Scott, sorry.

887
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,220
Yeah, what?

888
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,060
Travis Scott.

889
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,060
Travis Barker.

890
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,900
I was like, oh fuck, do I not know

891
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,500
there's another Travis Barker?

892
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,340
I am an old, old man.

893
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,180
I love it.

894
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,060
You've been right so many times with modern references.

895
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,740
Now you lose, Jason, I win.

896
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,860
Yeah.

897
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,700
Thrilled.

898
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,980
I mean, whatever makes you happy, Michael.

899
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,420
I don't quite understand the angle on this victory,

900
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,620
but I'll give it to you.

901
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,580
Jason's face turning 8% red, slightly.

902
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,420
Yeah, yeah.

903
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,260
That's your victory.

904
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,540
Travis Scott's Astroworld.

905
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,340
It's possible, yeah, we could look into that.

906
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,180
There were no pictures though of him

907
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,300
with Marvel on stage or anything.

908
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,140
No.

909
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,100
I think he was probably too young.

910
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,500
I think they had shuttered.

911
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,900
I think anyone is too young unless they were like 54.

912
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,380
Wasn't Marvel McFay a long time ago?

913
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,220
Yeah.

914
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,060
Well, yeah, oh yeah.

915
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,500
Maybe like an 80 or whatever.

916
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,540
Did I answer the coach question?

917
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,380
No.

918
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,620
Eight seasons of coach.

919
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,580
Wow.

920
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,420
One less than Seinfeld.

921
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,420
That's true, yeah.

922
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,500
But it does feel like it was there forever.

923
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,340
Mm-hmm.

924
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,180
Wow.

925
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,020
So.

926
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,940
But not, I don't believe included in the medley

927
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,140
of theme songs that you're likely to hear

928
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:08,020
while you're on the sky, the starway.

929
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,860
Starway.

930
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,180
Starway, not Skyway.

931
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:14,500
That's a topic we're too scared to cover as well.

932
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,340
Oh yeah.

933
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,180
Starway is now.

934
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:22,540
So like in both the Billy Bush X's Hollywood era

935
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:26,860
and the other era, before Billy Bush,

936
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,140
it was a generic radio station

937
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:34,020
that played exclusively on the starway called KUSH,

938
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,220
which spell that out.

939
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,060
We love it.

940
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:37,900
What do you get?

941
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,860
One of our favorite, oh it does.

942
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,060
Yeah man.

943
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,900
Kush baby.

944
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,740
Kush baby.

945
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,580
Kush radio.

946
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,660
Was that on purpose?

947
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,620
That's a body joke.

948
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,020
I know Universal's the body of the park.

949
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,380
No, I think it didn't occur to them.

950
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,580
Yeah, I don't think they knew.

951
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,500
Yeah, that was a total boardroom.

952
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,340
I think just a lot of Los Angeles stations

953
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,140
used to be K blank, is that correct?

954
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,740
Yeah, yeah, that's K rock.

955
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,820
Well and City Walk had, it was like seven burger,

956
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,780
world's KWB, what was it?

957
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,660
Oh yeah.

958
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:09,260
Greatest Burgers, KWGB.

959
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,900
Yes, the radio station themed burger restaurant.

960
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,660
I mean folks, we love our fake radio stations,

961
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,340
the one from Twister.

962
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,020
The one from Rockin' Space Mountain?

963
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,820
The one from Rockin' Space Mountain.

964
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,860
Is it like K Star radio?

965
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,700
I don't remember.

966
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,980
Isn't it like Intergalactic radio or something?

967
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,820
Yeah.

968
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,980
And that's on the, what's the platform?

969
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,580
Or am I thinking of a different thing from Tomorrowland?

970
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,620
Oh yes, so I think the radio station gimmick

971
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:40,260
was used a couple ways in Tomorrowland.

972
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,740
I don't know, we have to go back.

973
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,860
And you can listen in on radio signals today

974
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,020
in Star Wars Galaxy Z.

975
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:47,860
Yeah, that's true.

976
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,260
And one of them is that you're like picking up music.

977
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,740
You can hear Rex and what's playing in the Cantina

978
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,140
somewhere else in Galaxy Z.

979
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,780
Yes, yeah, yeah, I've heard that.

980
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,020
Why or where?

981
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,500
And then I was in the bathroom

982
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,300
on one of the many Batuu visits.

983
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,580
Oh yeah, that's radio.

984
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,860
And there's a radio and it's like,

985
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,220
there was just somebody was live narrating

986
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:10,220
some sort of Intergalactic chess game between aliens.

987
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,060
That's fun.

988
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,380
And it was like he wipes his tentacle,

989
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,460
like he wipes his brow with his tentacle.

990
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,020
Like it's a very dry, like jokey alien chess game

991
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,940
they're narrating.

992
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,540
And then also Space Mountain had like a TV station.

993
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:28,540
That's a whole other theme park exclusive radio stations

994
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,020
and TV stations.

995
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:33,900
That's a whole excuse for an episode.

996
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,060
Yeah, that's true.

997
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,780
That may be even a Final Four.

998
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,140
Yeah, that's a pretty good one I think.

999
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,380
Yeah.

1000
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,940
Best fake theme park radio station or TV station.

1001
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:48,940
Will Kush beat W Chess radio in Batuu?

1002
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,500
My chess thing was funny.

1003
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,340
Yeah.

1004
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,180
It's gonna be hard.

1005
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,000
Yeah, yeah.

1006
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,220
This, I keep jumping all around here,

1007
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,060
but there's a,

1008
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,260
did anyone ever catch the other weed reference

1009
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,660
on the starway?

1010
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,500
No.

1011
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,540
During Horror Nights?

1012
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,380
Uh-oh.

1013
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,940
Horror Nights, they have a whole different narration.

1014
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,780
Oh my.

1015
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,900
And it's just an aggressive guy like doing this.

1016
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,740
Yes.

1017
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,460
And then he's like, before he tells everyone the rules,

1018
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,980
he goes, shut the hell up.

1019
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,620
And then I swear he goes,

1020
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,180
and there's no smoking on the starway.

1021
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,020
That includes weed.

1022
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,780
And I was like, weed?

1023
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,220
That's not even.

1024
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,540
My bow tie started spinning.

1025
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,980
I was spinning.

1026
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,940
I've never heard that in a theme park before.

1027
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,780
Whoa.

1028
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,620
That's history.

1029
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,940
That includes weed.

1030
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,180
This narration was like the last thing.

1031
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,820
And they're like, oh fuck, this is doing half an hour.

1032
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:43,980
Don't write it.

1033
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,540
Can you write it with a hammer?

1034
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,060
If you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

1035
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:51,180
Like just, don't couch it in jokes or,

1036
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,100
just say what we talked about.

1037
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:53,940
We'll do it live.

1038
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,060
Weed, yeah, we'll do it live.

1039
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,540
Don't smoke weed, idiots.

1040
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,060
It is all, I don't know if they officially called it this,

1041
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,900
but one of the YouTube videos referred

1042
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,500
to the Halloween specific starway as Evil Starway.

1043
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,780
No.

1044
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,500
I don't think Universal actually called it that,

1045
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,820
but I could be wrong.

1046
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,580
But a lot of it is just,

1047
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,660
there is no smoking on the starway.

1048
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,500
Yeah.

1049
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,460
Please don't sit on the stairs as you descent.

1050
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,300
The one-

1051
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,140
It's all like friendly info.

1052
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:22,980
Right.

1053
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,820
It's red mean.

1054
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,740
Mine, the one I was watching,

1055
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,940
the video I was watching, it goes,

1056
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,060
he's like, don't sit down on the starway

1057
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,860
or it'll chew your ass up.

1058
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,780
We might've watched it.

1059
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,180
Maybe the one I watched is from a year

1060
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,460
where they realized they needed to like change the copy.

1061
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,220
Cause he also goes like, he goes like,

1062
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,300
don't stare straight ahead while you're on the starway.

1063
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,940
Don't look to the right and stare at that hot girl

1064
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,820
on the opposite escalator.

1065
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,580
Don't try to get her phone number

1066
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,340
cause you'll look like an idiot.

1067
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,500
I get the whole-

1068
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,340
What?

1069
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,460
He's roasting everybody.

1070
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,260
You'll be too scared to do it, you will.

1071
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,340
You're gonna pee your pants before you even get a word out.

1072
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,900
After the sun goes down, the starway becomes the neg way.

1073
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,100
We're negging you all the way to the bottom of the hill.

1074
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:13,020
You've paid a piece of shit.

1075
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,660
Your imposter syndrome is correct.

1076
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,980
You are a fraud.

1077
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,180
Starway is the alpha of this group.

1078
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,780
He refers to himself as starway.

1079
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,820
Your girlfriends with starway now.

1080
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,260
Starway.

1081
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,060
You never have a size complex

1082
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,980
when you're at a quarter mile long.

1083
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,980
Kiss me now on the stairs.

1084
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,900
Kiss me, come on, do it.

1085
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,780
Get on your knees. Do it for your friends.

1086
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,380
I'm giving you special permission

1087
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,940
to sit on the stairs for once.

1088
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,380
You can kiss him.

1089
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,180
Give it a lick.

1090
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,980
Do get your tongue stuck in the stairs.

1091
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,620
See if anybody cares.

1092
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:57,660
Vice's lid blowing expose

1093
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:02,100
on the universal Hollywood Horror Nights starway.

1094
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,260
Okay, so we can't have the little fun

1095
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:07,140
on the escalators anymore, huh?

1096
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,580
Thanks a lot, Vice.

1097
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,820
I'm the Facebook group of like save evil starway.

1098
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,660
Wasn't it better when evil starway was around?

1099
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:21,580
I wrote for evil starway from 2012 to 2018.

1100
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,700
I did as well.

1101
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,540
Yes, me too.

1102
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:27,180
They had like a 13 person writing staff for some reason.

1103
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:36,060
Yeah, that was, I also, evil starway was in no other way

1104
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,540
like an evil escalator.

1105
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,580
They didn't do like scary lighting or anything.

1106
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,420
No.

1107
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:45,260
But you do pass by the side of the Jurassic Park building.

1108
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,780
And I don't know if this was in reference

1109
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,640
to a maze or something, or if it was just its own thing.

1110
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,340
But in the video I watched, it pans over to the side

1111
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,700
and there's a light spinning around and around

1112
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,380
and it's like filtered to spell out a word

1113
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,780
and it says skulls with a Z.

1114
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,860
Skulls, skulls.

1115
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,620
Is that a brand of some kind?

1116
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,660
I'm not sure, was it a tie in?

1117
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,940
You guys weren't such pussies, you would know.

1118
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,660
Skulls.

1119
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,900
It's my gang.

1120
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,260
The skulls, well what's that?

1121
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:20,260
The skulls way, take the skulls way to the lower lot.

1122
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,660
The lower lot is still called the lower lot.

1123
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,860
Not everything here is evil, but a lot of it is.

1124
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,460
We need to keep some stuff the same

1125
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,740
for the fire department.

1126
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,820
It's a zoning issue more than anything.

1127
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,020
Well, skulls way.

1128
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,060
Skulls way, yeah.

1129
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:43,580
You were starting to talk about KUSH, the radio station.

1130
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:48,100
KUSH, and it's not what you think Kush radio might play.

1131
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:53,100
They don't play any string cheese incident, unfortunately.

1132
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,660
They, you have a host on, before it was Billy Bush,

1133
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:02,860
there was a guy who introduces himself as Clip Jockey Brad.

1134
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,060
So they invented a new type, there's disc jockey

1135
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,260
and there's video jockey and there's clip jockey.

1136
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,260
He kind of sets up, all right, we're gonna do a little,

1137
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,620
here's a little Spielberg medley coming at ya.

1138
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,860
They present it like he's kicking off a song

1139
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:20,620
and then it's just a big mix of Spielberg scores

1140
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:25,620
and falling home into clever girl.

1141
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,060
So that's fun.

1142
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,220
They also take fake callers.

1143
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,620
They do trivia games and they ask for who,

1144
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:39,300
like the, wait, we're naming title stars director.

1145
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,380
They'll play the Back to the Future score

1146
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:46,380
and then somebody calls a really overacting,

1147
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,260
hi, my name's Lisa.

1148
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:51,300
I'm a mom and my kids love that movie.

1149
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,700
Let me see, Back to the Future, Michael J. Fox,

1150
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,500
Christopher Lloyd, famously also Sebastian Jackal

1151
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:02,020
and Roberts and Ekas.

1152
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,220
And she wins something, right?

1153
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:07,860
She wins a ride on the Starway

1154
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,340
and then she seems really put out.

1155
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,940
She seems really like, oh, okay, thanks.

1156
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:14,860
Is that what it is really?

1157
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,940
Yeah, that's what happens.

1158
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:16,980
Oh, that's kind of funny.

1159
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,500
Yeah, so.

1160
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,820
Only valid for Starway, not Skullsway.

1161
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:24,340
Yeah, Starway, yeah, you cannot.

1162
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,180
There's also like a.

1163
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,260
Oh, come on, let Lisa ride me.

1164
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,460
Oh, God.

1165
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,660
Come get your prize, Lisa.

1166
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,860
Who can escalate her up?

1167
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,380
Did you hear the portion of that

1168
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,980
that was like a Valley girl calling?

1169
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,180
I did not know.

1170
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,180
She called, it's like, I think it's this movie

1171
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:48,380
and then the DJ is like, Brad is an asshole.

1172
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:51,860
He's like, oh, like, yeah, I think it is like that.

1173
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:56,220
And it's like, what is this condescending Valley girl bit?

1174
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,140
Like.

1175
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:57,980
Geez.

1176
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:58,820
Whatever.

1177
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:02,940
Brad, whatever you make on a clip jockey salary

1178
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:07,940
does not make you some upper tier elite citizen, okay?

1179
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,300
Yeah.

1180
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,420
You're here in the muck with us, clip jockey Brad.

1181
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,460
Don't you forget it.

1182
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,540
What an asshole.

1183
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,900
Boy, I guess everyone on all the narrate

1184
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,460
and then Billy Bush who seemed benign enough.

1185
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,300
Right.

1186
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:25,180
We didn't know, you know, he had already participated

1187
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:29,740
in the famous tape, you know, as he recorded this.

1188
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,140
Oh yeah, that's true.

1189
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,180
In the back of his mind, he knew.

1190
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,340
He knew it was coming for him.

1191
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,100
Do you think it occurred to him as anything?

1192
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,580
Probably not, cause nobody would have thought

1193
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,660
he was gonna run for president.

1194
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,540
No, and there's probably like a hundred other incidents

1195
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,380
similar to that with other celebrities.

1196
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1197
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,300
That like no one cares about.

1198
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,540
Yeah, yeah, there were nobody's seeking the tape.

1199
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,380
Right.

1200
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,780
Yeah, so nobody cares about the Trump one either.

1201
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:53,620
Yeah, that's true.

1202
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,260
I do remember going, oh, this will probably sink him.

1203
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,100
Nope.

1204
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:58,940
Nope.

1205
00:44:58,940 --> 00:44:59,780
No one cared.

1206
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,460
Yeah, I was on my way to meet you, I think at a desert trip.

1207
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,900
Oh, that is the desert trip weekend.

1208
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:04,740
Yeah, yeah.

1209
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,900
I get to hang out with Mike and see some good bands

1210
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,500
and we can all just celebrate knowing

1211
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,340
that the Trump campaign is dead.

1212
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,100
It's over cause this came out, right?

1213
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:10,940
Yeah, yeah.

1214
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,660
Oh man, it's gonna be sick.

1215
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:16,580
Most of it was sick.

1216
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,620
It was not that bad.

1217
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,020
The, what else?

1218
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:23,420
You get a bunch of, hey, you get some retro theme songs.

1219
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:27,740
You get a little bit of Rockford Files and Magnum PI.

1220
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,700
And what are both of those?

1221
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:29,740
Mike Post.

1222
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:30,580
Yep.

1223
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,020
Two of the great Mike Post themes.

1224
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,700
Rockford Files is a funky one.

1225
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,700
That one's great.

1226
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:35,540
Yeah.

1227
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,060
Yeah, PI, obviously classic.

1228
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:41,700
Also Mike Post, who we realized was involved in Halyx.

1229
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,540
I think we can tease some Halyx stuff coming.

1230
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,380
Yes.

1231
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,220
Coming down the pipe.

1232
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,180
And here's confusingly not necessarily from us.

1233
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,020
No.

1234
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,580
No, yeah.

1235
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,980
Let your imagination run wild.

1236
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:55,820
Yeah.

1237
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,780
But Halyx is coming back in a big way.

1238
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,740
Whatever your guess is, it's not that.

1239
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:01,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1240
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,380
Oh, and there's also, and then they do like every type

1241
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:08,420
of like little radio station format.

1242
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,460
Like there's a little bit of weather.

1243
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:14,340
Clip Jockey Brad predicts 100% chance of some heavy fun.

1244
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,180
I like that.

1245
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,020
That's good.

1246
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:17,860
Sure.

1247
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,100
He also does, there's also other trivia where he lists

1248
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,860
like, now who's the actor who played Frankenstein?

1249
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,140
Was it Lon Chaney?

1250
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:25,940
Was it Boris Karloff?

1251
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,940
And the answer is none of the above.

1252
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:31,300
Frankenstein is the, it's Frankenstein's monster,

1253
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,900
not the doctor.

1254
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:33,740
Oh, right.

1255
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:34,580
That's rough.

1256
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,580
I wanna like rule that.

1257
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:38,660
That's one of those edicts I wanna set.

1258
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:41,580
Correcting people and reminding them that Frankenstein

1259
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,420
is the doctor, not the monster.

1260
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,260
This is done.

1261
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,540
We are done with this.

1262
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,060
This does not need to happen ever again.

1263
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,540
We're all set.

1264
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,900
Yeah, we're good.

1265
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,020
Well, but in your scenario though,

1266
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:55,700
just do all people realize it is Frankenstein's monster?

1267
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:56,620
And they just call it that?

1268
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,500
Or you're saying if somebody calls him Frankenstein,

1269
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,340
it's fine.

1270
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,180
Let it go.

1271
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,740
I think it's, you know what everybody means.

1272
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,940
The monster, he is Frankenstein.

1273
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,860
Like, come on.

1274
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:06,700
We're here.

1275
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,220
The monster, I'm looking at the monster.

1276
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,140
The monster is Frankenstein.

1277
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:13,380
I know technically it's Frankenstein's monster,

1278
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,420
but hey, we're, come on.

1279
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,420
It's more fun to just say that's Frankenstein.

1280
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,260
It is more fun.

1281
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,140
I didn't know this until a couple of years ago.

1282
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:21,980
Or I didn't realize it.

1283
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,900
You didn't read the very boring book?

1284
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,540
No, I always liked Frankenstein.

1285
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,860
He was my favorite of those monsters.

1286
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:28,700
He seemed fun.

1287
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,540
Much more entertaining.

1288
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:32,660
And I like Herman Munster who was a Frankenstein.

1289
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:35,860
If you follow the logic,

1290
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,300
a lot of iterations of Frankenstein,

1291
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:41,100
the monster calls Victor Frankenstein father.

1292
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:44,060
So then by that logic, the monster would be his son,

1293
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,820
so would be a Frankenstein.

1294
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,660
There you go.

1295
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,020
And it's like the Holy Trinity

1296
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:50,860
where God and Jesus Christ are one in the same.

1297
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:51,700
We're all the same.

1298
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,820
Also societally, we've decided Frankenstein.

1299
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,020
That's Frankenstein.

1300
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:58,260
Yes, we get to make the rules

1301
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,100
when there's a popular vote here.

1302
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,340
That's Frankenstein.

1303
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:03,340
Look, I go to the Frankenstein parking,

1304
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,500
which is a similar escalator that goes to it

1305
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,580
to the star way.

1306
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,860
Right, it doesn't say Frankenstein's monster is parking.

1307
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,900
Yeah, it's not Frankenstein parking

1308
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,420
in a picture of the doctor.

1309
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,900
Right. That's Frankenstein.

1310
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:17,420
New Holy Trinity, Frankenstein,

1311
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:20,060
Frankenstein's monster and Herman Munster.

1312
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:23,740
They are all Frankenstein and they are all one.

1313
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:26,300
And they shot Munsters on this lot.

1314
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,580
Yes. Yeah.

1315
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:28,700
Multiple Munsters.

1316
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:29,700
Multiple Munsters.

1317
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:30,940
Oh, the new weird one.

1318
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:32,580
The Brian Singer.

1319
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,860
Well, the Brian, no, not Brian.

1320
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:34,700
Was it Brian Singer?

1321
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,740
No, Brian Fuller.

1322
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:37,580
Wasn't it?

1323
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:38,420
Are you sure on that?

1324
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:39,260
Second mistake.

1325
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:40,580
There is no Brian Singer Munster.

1326
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:42,500
Did he produce it?

1327
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,340
Look it up if he produced it.

1328
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:46,260
Fuller made the show.

1329
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,420
It was Fuller for sure.

1330
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,620
But did Singer produce it?

1331
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,580
That's possible, that's true.

1332
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,020
But it's Fuller for sure.

1333
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:53,380
I watched an open secret.

1334
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,900
They didn't zoom in any frame of a Munsters

1335
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,260
where there were pedophiles hiding in the background.

1336
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,300
Yeah, Jerry O'Connell.

1337
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,180
Everyone is clear in the new Munsters.

1338
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,460
I'm sure this is Brian Fuller.

1339
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:06,660
Whatever, it is for sure.

1340
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:09,260
The one that was 1313 Mockingbird Lane.

1341
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,660
That's Brian Fuller for sure.

1342
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:13,060
There is a chance he produced it or was involved,

1343
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,420
but Fuller was the main guy in charge.

1344
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,260
100%.

1345
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:17,460
Yep.

1346
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,860
And they built, I was on the tour.

1347
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,540
I would put all my money on this on KUSH radio.

1348
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,380
If I were live on the air, I'd be willing to do it.

1349
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,140
Jerry O'Connell and Eddie Izzard.

1350
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:27,980
Yes.

1351
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:28,820
Okay.

1352
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:29,640
Those are the stars.

1353
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,500
Very slowly loading.

1354
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,700
Director, Brian Singer.

1355
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,700
Brian Singer has made a comfortable living

1356
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:37,500
directing pilots, directed the pilot for House.

1357
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,140
What the fuck, really?

1358
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:41,900
He directed 1313 Mockingbird Lane,

1359
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:44,060
written by Brian Fuller.

1360
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:45,980
Oh no.

1361
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:46,900
Jason.

1362
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,900
Wow.

1363
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,340
Regrettably back on top.

1364
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,260
Jason wins again.

1365
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,100
No.

1366
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:52,940
No.

1367
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,580
He evened it out.

1368
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:55,420
No.

1369
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,740
With thanks to Jason's vast wealth

1370
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:00,420
of Brian Singer knowledge.

1371
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,380
He's back on top again.

1372
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:05,300
And then ruined the X-Men.

1373
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,500
The worst thing he ever did in his life.

1374
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,960
Jason stands right now across the world are standing up.

1375
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,160
They've knocked over what food or beverage they have.

1376
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,200
They're cheering.

1377
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:18,840
The victory, their hero has again thwarted Mike and Scott.

1378
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,480
A college professor, this is a lesson

1379
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,680
I always remember from college.

1380
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,280
They're like the most desirable job in town

1381
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,760
is if you can direct the pilot of a TV show

1382
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,720
because if it gets picked up,

1383
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,840
then you get paid every time an episode is made

1384
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:37,080
because you helped define the vibe, the look of the show.

1385
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:37,920
Yes.

1386
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,800
So it's essentially money for nothing.

1387
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,920
After a week or two of work, money for nothing

1388
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,200
for as long as that show runs for.

1389
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,400
Chicks for free.

1390
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,640
What?

1391
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,960
That's from Dire Straits song.

1392
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,120
Oh yeah, okay.

1393
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,280
The Dire Straits lyrics do not represent my feelings.

1394
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,000
Sure, yeah, yeah.

1395
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I was just quoting a song.

1396
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,840
Well, so thankfully he did not make money

1397
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,440
into the end of time.

1398
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,680
No, due to the 1313 Mockingbird Lane.

1399
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,360
And probably will not be involved in the newer attempt

1400
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,400
to reboot the Munsters that Seth Meyers was attached to.

1401
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,240
Oh, is that true?

1402
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,080
Is that real?

1403
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,360
It's a 2017 Deadline article.

1404
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,960
I want a shot at the Munsters.

1405
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,320
Right now I'm throwing it out there.

1406
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,720
I want a shot at the Munsters.

1407
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,920
Isn't Grandpa still alive?

1408
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,760
No.

1409
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,600
Okay.

1410
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,800
Why did I think he was alive?

1411
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,960
I will empty my bank account right now.

1412
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,800
I will prove that's for sure.

1413
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,720
He was alive in our lifetime, right?

1414
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1415
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,400
Did he run for office or something?

1416
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,240
He ran for governor, I think,

1417
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,320
when everybody ran for governor.

1418
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,880
He was a fucking maniac.

1419
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,800
He was on the Howard Stern Show all the time.

1420
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,160
I'm saying we could have gotten him back.

1421
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,120
If he was alive, we could have gotten him back.

1422
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,560
We got Lando back.

1423
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,160
He died in 2006.

1424
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,640
Okay, okay.

1425
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,640
Any new Munsters pilot, I would say,

1426
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,720
it has to be like when Carrie Fisher died

1427
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,840
or Marlon Brando with Superman.

1428
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,800
It all has to be old footage of Grandpa.

1429
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,640
We're gonna go to-

1430
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,720
No one else can play Grandpa.

1431
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,840
Deep fake Grandpa Munster.

1432
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,440
We're gonna do some face mapping on whoever,

1433
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,600
whatever lucky person out there has a face

1434
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,960
closest to Grandpa Al Lewis.

1435
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,600
He had a restaurant called Grandpa's.

1436
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,480
Yes.

1437
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,880
Like in Jersey.

1438
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:16,720
Whoa.

1439
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,840
He was just there outside and he didn't own it.

1440
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,520
They just called it Grandpa's and he was the mascot.

1441
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,200
He was just sleeping, standing up outside it.

1442
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,680
Yes, he was just smoking cigars, being rude to people.

1443
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,480
It was crazy.

1444
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,320
You have to look at it.

1445
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,160
Don't come in and see if I care.

1446
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,280
Yeah.

1447
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,400
Billy West has a lot of good stories about knowing Al Lewis

1448
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,560
and going to that restaurant.

1449
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,400
Oh, great.

1450
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,560
And they're fantastic.

1451
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,200
And he's a crazy, Al Lewis was a crazy man.

1452
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,560
There's a whole other Munsters called the Munsters Today.

1453
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,480
And there's a part where they like do a,

1454
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,320
there's like a, they win a music contest.

1455
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,040
They're a band and this was a late 80s one.

1456
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:55,000
I've seen some of that, but I don't know it very well.

1457
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:55,840
Yeah.

1458
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:00,480
I want, no, this is, no Munsters has worked

1459
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,320
since the first Munsters.

1460
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,160
Why?

1461
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,000
Yeah.

1462
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,760
Although Munsters Today, three seasons.

1463
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,600
Really?

1464
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,440
Yeah, somehow.

1465
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,280
Yeah, everything used to.

1466
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,800
Oh, another one of these secret shows.

1467
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,160
Boston Common, The Single Guy.

1468
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,200
No, I'm just saying like everything used to get

1469
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,400
two or three seasons.

1470
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,320
It was bad.

1471
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,160
It had to be a.

1472
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,880
Munsters Today had three seasons?

1473
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,080
It had to be like.

1474
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:21,920
How did I not know this?

1475
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,680
I just learned about this one season show

1476
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,840
called the Hat Squad.

1477
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,240
Scott, you must know about the Hat Squad.

1478
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,960
I know, I'm sad that I don't.

1479
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:28,800
Oh my God.

1480
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,800
Well, I'm going to send you Hat Squad stuff later.

1481
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:35,800
It is a show about three grown orphans.

1482
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,840
Okay, it's three, they became orphans.

1483
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,680
Their parents were all police officers

1484
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,160
who were killed on the line of duty.

1485
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,240
Another police officer adopted them all,

1486
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,920
trained them all and they became police officers.

1487
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,240
And they are in 90s clothing,

1488
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,680
except big trench coats and fedoras.

1489
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,520
Oh man.

1490
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:57,240
And there's a clip online of them stopping,

1491
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,520
villains robbing a convenience store with automatic weapons,

1492
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,320
with like Uzis and stuff.

1493
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:05,280
And then they catch, they get all these bad guys

1494
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,600
and they stop to get a white guy and they tie him up.

1495
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,640
And one of the bad guys looks up and he goes,

1496
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,600
oh, are you the Hat Squad?

1497
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,960
They're like, yeah.

1498
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,280
And they put on the hats.

1499
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,440
It's insane.

1500
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,400
So that only got one season.

1501
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,240
But.

1502
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,200
There's still a full season of Hat Squad?

1503
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,200
Yeah.

1504
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,040
God.

1505
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:24,880
I believe one season.

1506
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,360
Everyone I know is pitching five shows a year to no avail.

1507
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,320
It's peak TV.

1508
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,160
Boy, it's good times.

1509
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,200
There's more shows now than ever before.

1510
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,480
Nothing ever gets past the first meeting.

1511
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,400
Meanwhile, Hat Squad gets an entire season.

1512
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,480
Hat Squad reboot.

1513
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,440
Some people were posting images of it on Twitter.

1514
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:45,520
The Hat Squad.

1515
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,440
Oh, apparently a favorite punching bag

1516
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,000
of David Letterman at the time.

1517
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,360
Oh, very good.

1518
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,640
Okay.

1519
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,920
I'm looking at a picture of the cast of Munsters today.

1520
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,600
If I showed you a photo and said,

1521
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,840
oh, one year my family dressed up as the Munsters,

1522
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,960
you'd go, oh, oh yeah, those are pretty good costumes, I guess.

1523
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,480
Yeah.

1524
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,400
It looks fake.

1525
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,960
It was very, very chintzy.

1526
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:09,800
Yeah.

1527
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,720
Extremely.

1528
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,320
Three years.

1529
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:12,800
Yeah.

1530
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:16,400
The son, Eddie in that one, played by Jason Marsden,

1531
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,600
who's a voice in all the Disney stuff and the voice.

1532
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,040
It was in all the TJF shows.

1533
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,000
He's a Max in a goof troop.

1534
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,440
Tying it all together, it'd have been weird.

1535
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,960
I've had a thing, and this is a good tip for anybody

1536
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,920
trying to get through anything they don't like,

1537
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:37,600
but especially sitting through a boring network notes call.

1538
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:41,040
I developed a secret with my friend Tommy Blotched

1539
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,360
that when we were on a notes call

1540
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,160
that we were really dreading and it was just going to go and go

1541
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,840
and everybody's droning on and it's a bummer because you

1542
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,240
don't disagree with the notes.

1543
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:54,320
What we did is we put on the Munsters on mute.

1544
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:57,120
And any time we were bummed out about what they were telling us,

1545
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,600
we would then point to the screen

1546
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:01,600
and Herman would run out of a building in fast motion

1547
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,600
and his butt would be on fire.

1548
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,880
And we could just get a brief.

1549
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,000
We'd just look over and like, hi, look at that.

1550
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,240
All right, back to this.

1551
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,320
So anything similar to that, if you're sitting

1552
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:14,200
on some boring call or like, hey,

1553
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,120
if you're going to sit at the DMV for a while

1554
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,680
and you can bring a laptop with you, Munsters on mute.

1555
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,160
Great.

1556
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,520
Any situation go down.

1557
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,920
It's like a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.

1558
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:25,880
It is a great tip.

1559
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:29,640
And they were using the they pioneered that fast forwarding

1560
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,840
footage that would be used later on Deadly Games.

1561
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:36,040
There would be no Deadly Games at the Munsters.

1562
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,840
It's like when Marilyn's boyfriend sees Herman

1563
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,760
and he has to run over the he gets scared

1564
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,720
and he runs out so fast to his car and they sped that up.

1565
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:47,000
That was an innovation that the Munsters made.

1566
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,480
Also deployed by the monkeys to show that they were having fun.

1567
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,440
That's true.

1568
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,800
And like so much fun.

1569
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,160
Hopping around hills and behind trees

1570
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,760
and they don't come out the other side.

1571
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,720
I guess also Benny Hill did this.

1572
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,720
But a little body, a little body, though.

1573
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,720
A little body.

1574
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,960
So I should know in this uniforms flying off,

1575
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,800
revealing cheeky, you would call it, full stocking lingerie

1576
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,840
sets underneath.

1577
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,400
OK, so I do for again, for listeners

1578
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,520
who have never been on the Starway.

1579
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:22,880
It is important in Universal history in that it was Universal.

1580
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:28,560
It connected, you know, expanded the actual theme park in 1991.

1581
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:32,080
When all of this open, when the lower lot open, the Starway opened.

1582
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:35,200
And of course, ET opened down there.

1583
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:40,400
That was Universal's attempt to break out of were more than just a tram tour.

1584
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,200
And that that was a stigma that they were trying to break out of.

1585
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:49,760
In more recent years, they've been trying to add attractions and make it

1586
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,120
were a full day park.

1587
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,640
Will they ever be a multi day park?

1588
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,760
Who knows?

1589
00:57:54,760 --> 00:58:02,120
Now, that said, 21, 28 years ago, just like right now, all of this OPT,

1590
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,360
June, July of 1991, all this stuff.

1591
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,760
Lower lot, the ET adventure, the world of Cinemagic,

1592
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,120
which was the show where you go from stage to stage and see Hitchcock

1593
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,680
and Back to the Future and the Statue of Liberty arm.

1594
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,960
That was part of the tour, but they made it something Lucy attribute

1595
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:21,120
to get there. And they started having the studio tour leave from what is now

1596
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,600
Jurassic Park. So that moved later.

1597
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,280
But you're all of this stuff opened.

1598
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,440
Oh, and also full episode AT&T at the movies.

1599
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,200
Anyone did you guys ever know you were kids here?

1600
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,160
No, no.

1601
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:36,240
I have fond memories of whatever AT&T at the movies was.

1602
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,800
I think you like go inside a giant phone.

1603
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,040
Really? Sponsored by MCI.

1604
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,480
That's not what I thought you were talking about.

1605
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,600
So, wow, that sounds great.

1606
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,520
Yeah, I got to remember what the hell it was.

1607
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,320
But I remember liking it a lot.

1608
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,720
I liked all the boring on ride stuff.

1609
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,280
Going inside a phone, I would be psyched.

1610
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:57,440
Yeah, I'm sure there was some sort of ET stuff in some sort of AT&T stuff in Florida.

1611
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,440
Oh, also the ET toy closet.

1612
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,200
Let's not forget.

1613
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:03,360
Oh, yeah, we got so many lower lot episodes to do.

1614
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:07,360
Do you do remember when this all this expansion opened?

1615
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:11,240
I think I had not been before all this because I was six.

1616
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:16,920
So I think my first time, it was probably with a freshly minted starway.

1617
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,120
Wow. Great.

1618
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,120
It was sparkling.

1619
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,520
It was never in better shape.

1620
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:27,160
I found in LA Times article from July 5th, again, 28 years ago this week.

1621
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:30,440
Whoa. As we record this.

1622
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:34,520
That it was mostly about ET opening and they got Spielberg on record

1623
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:38,320
and they were like, yeah, we think ET could be like Universal's Mickey Mouse.

1624
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:43,480
And for a long time, their promotional materials had ET next to the logo or on the logo.

1625
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,720
But today, today, they're Mickey Mouse's Vin Diesel hanging off of a helicopter.

1626
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,840
Yeah. Helping a minion.

1627
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,840
He's holding like a minion fell out of it.

1628
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,280
He's trying to catch you.

1629
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:01,400
Sure. The so it's a lot again, a lot about like this is expanding.

1630
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,680
We're bringing stuff from Florida back to the future is coming down the line.

1631
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,200
This article is one of the oddest leads.

1632
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,800
I've ever seen. It's one sentence long.

1633
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:15,400
And it just says, the little bald guy from outer space is back.

1634
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:22,640
What? That is the LA Times, the article and about covering ET

1635
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,720
opening the little bald guy from outer space is back.

1636
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,560
The little bald like the little bald guy.

1637
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:33,920
It sounds like someone writing in like an Internet joke format,

1638
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,200
like that little guy we all know and love.

1639
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:41,320
The little guy from outer space is back like it's so weird.

1640
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,440
Well, the bald thing is what I'm the bald guy.

1641
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,000
The little bald guy. He's an alien.

1642
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,320
I didn't expect him to have a hair like a head full of hair.

1643
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,480
Yeah. The little bald guy.

1644
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,360
It's how Andrew Dice Clay would roast ET.

1645
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,000
Or tell that also Telly Savalas would refer to him as the little bald guy.

1646
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,000
Lovingly so. Right. Because he was bald too. Makes sense.

1647
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,240
I love it. I stay in the hotel.

1648
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,960
They clean up after sloppy telly.

1649
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,520
I go see the little bald guy from outer space.

1650
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,400
Got an annual pass. I see the little bald guy every day.

1651
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:17,320
Yo, Barkeep, did you hear the little bald guy from outer space is fucking back.

1652
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:20,120
Hey, let me get on the phone with my wife.

1653
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:23,280
Hey, Diane, you heard the little bald guy is back.

1654
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:25,360
Let me tell you something.

1655
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,960
I'm going to give you this passport and you're going to you're going to make it

1656
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,760
say Telly. It's not going to be Tommy.

1657
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,160
It's not going to be Timmy.

1658
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,360
I want to. He's going to got to say Telly.

1659
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,600
We'll build up to sloppy Telly in one of these days.

1660
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,880
If you don't get this right, I will crack your fucking head open.

1661
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,840
Have a nice day. Be right in the mouth, you little bald fuck.

1662
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:53,200
He has nightmares back in his hotel room where he's like trying to hit E.T.

1663
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,720
Say my name right.

1664
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,880
Telly's falls off E.T.

1665
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,120
ride, attempting to punch the robot.

1666
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,880
I'm going to get you.

1667
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,880
So this also this would have been the start of this studio tour being

1668
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,120
45 minutes long, which is about the same length it is today.

1669
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,960
So you never experience the two and a half hour experience.

1670
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,040
No, yeah, I didn't.

1671
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:16,920
Actually way longer if if earthquake broke down or oh, God.

1672
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,120
Yeah, you'd get like a 45 minute backup just waiting to go in

1673
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,560
earthquake while and then she's having.

1674
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,720
Yeah, yeah.

1675
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:27,200
Yeah, I never saw MGM Studios by the time my family went in.

1676
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:31,360
Florida had expanded to, you know, a full park and it wasn't just

1677
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,880
a facsimile of a back lot tour.

1678
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,920
Mm hmm. A tour of a fake back lot.

1679
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,560
Yeah. Yeah.

1680
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:42,520
Yeah, it is weird how Universal evolved and was not really

1681
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,560
they very slowly came to being a gated

1682
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,680
theme park. Yeah.

1683
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,120
The Starway is a big thing that made that possible.

1684
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,800
So thank you, Starway. Thank you, Starway.

1685
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:54,800
Thank you, Starway.

1686
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:59,240
I mean, it's crazy to think about MCA's odd like Earl of like,

1687
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:04,680
we're a technology company and also a artist management and tours.

1688
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:10,480
You know, tours were the biggest tour tour, like museums or old house tours.

1689
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,080
We do tours like that is such an odd concept, but tour company.

1690
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:15,800
Yeah. Yeah.

1691
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:20,440
But I mean, there are companies that do tours, but like got like

1692
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:27,160
20 minute tours like MCA would design those for places like for other places.

1693
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,200
I think so. Yeah.

1694
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,920
Really? Like early, early days of like 60s and stuff.

1695
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,880
So like a factory. Sure.

1696
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,640
Hmm. Hmm. All right.

1697
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:39,360
MCA's other tours, I guess we got to learn about.

1698
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,280
Yeah. What else?

1699
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,400
What have we missed?

1700
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,720
There was an accident in 2008. Uh huh.

1701
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:49,920
The thing snapped and like 20 to 25 people just like shot

1702
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,680
like the thing shot backwards, knocking everyone down.

1703
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,480
Oh, I think.

1704
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:55,680
Wait, the escalator?

1705
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,280
Too much weight on it. It buckled.

1706
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,800
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, God.

1707
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,720
I found this too. Uh huh.

1708
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:04,680
Yeah. So but I think some people went to the hospital.

1709
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,880
I think everyone was OK.

1710
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,840
Hopefully, or they hit it and we don't know.

1711
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,520
There's not really any cast members or team members

1712
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,280
guiding you. It's pretty much self guided.

1713
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,080
There is one hot dog stand on the second landing.

1714
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,480
I'm glad you noticed.

1715
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,600
There's a hot dog and snack stand.

1716
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,760
The third landing, fucking nothing.

1717
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,280
The first landing course has the scenic overlook.

1718
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,320
With the Apollo 13 capsule.

1719
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,800
Apollo 13 capsule.

1720
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:36,720
And you could take a photo with Hanks and Pax and.

1721
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,720
Yeah. And then Bakes.

1722
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,160
You know, all of them.

1723
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,040
They're all my buds. So I use their nickname.

1724
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:44,280
Sure. Yeah, you're right.

1725
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,840
I like that description that, yeah, the first landing is bigger.

1726
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:49,680
It's got a great view.

1727
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:52,320
You can see it's one of the best places to see,

1728
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,160
you know, the beautiful city of Burbank.

1729
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,640
Yes. The other lots.

1730
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,440
You could see Warner Brothers.

1731
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:00,200
You could see Disney.

1732
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:03,640
You could see Lakeside Country Club, a property that Universal

1733
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:06,000
would murder people to get their hands on.

1734
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,480
Yes, they want that so bad for a future expansion.

1735
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:09,880
A possible expansion slot.

1736
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:15,400
And then you go down to the second level, hot dog stand, third level,

1737
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,560
nothing, fourth level. You're you're down there.

1738
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:18,280
You're down there.

1739
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,320
Diminishing returns. Diminishing returns.

1740
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,560
Oh, fun fact. A part of that golf course

1741
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:26,680
was or may still be or was.

1742
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:29,200
I don't know if they still the house was on the market again.

1743
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,560
I don't know if they were selling this with it.

1744
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:34,920
Bob Hope's house, including a three whole golf course.

1745
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,280
Yeah, he had his own golf course.

1746
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,840
He had his own golf course adjacent to the countryside.

1747
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:42,040
Country Club. That's a very hard house to sell because how many people

1748
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:45,520
can just buy a 25 million dollar estate?

1749
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:50,240
I've been not fully inside, but I picked up some money there once.

1750
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,400
You're at the door.

1751
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,440
Essentially, yes.

1752
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,440
Drug deal. I honestly I don't think I've ever told the show

1753
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,080
told this story on the show and I won't.

1754
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,480
I'll do the brief version of it.

1755
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,960
When I worked for Catherine Crosby, being Crosby's widow for a little while.

1756
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:11,040
So one time when I was a P.A.,

1757
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,840
I got a call from Catherine Crosby on my phone.

1758
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,840
And she said and she was she was like, Michael, we're handing out money

1759
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,840
at the Hope Estate if you want to come by.

1760
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,520
What? Handing it out?

1761
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:27,440
Well, she was just going to pay me for the like what I like.

1762
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:31,120
Basically, she was doing a live show and I was just doing the tech for it.

1763
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,280
So she knew she owed me some money.

1764
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:37,000
So she personally called me, left me a message on my cell phone

1765
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:41,080
and then invited me over, which I did not get to go fully in, which was really.

1766
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:44,440
I was like, oh, my God, I'm going over to Bob Hope, Bob Hope's house,

1767
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,480
which is five minutes from where I worked.

1768
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,360
Yeah. And the Warner Brothers

1769
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,720
ranch. So wow.

1770
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:57,680
So Crosby invited you to the whole on a road trip to the

1771
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,760
Hope House. What a dream.

1772
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,480
And Dolores Hope, his wife is still alive at that point.

1773
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,160
I remember. Wow. Wow.

1774
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:08,680
So they had very my family would make a point of

1775
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:14,640
actually my family would do a yearly Christmas trip to City Walk.

1776
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,960
And before that, we'd go get an Italian meal

1777
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:21,840
in Toluca Lake and then drive around the houses and we would see the beautiful,

1778
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:25,480
gigantic Nativity scene that they put out at Bob Hope's.

1779
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:27,520
Oh, yeah. State. Mm hmm.

1780
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:28,400
I don't know if I did.

1781
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,320
I not say that we did a yearly Christmas City Walk trip.

1782
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:32,680
I don't think so. Walks.

1783
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:36,840
I don't know. Call it to get some Christmas shopping done or just to see it.

1784
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:39,280
Just to see it. Walk around and see the city.

1785
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:43,240
And you'll see the Santa hat on the King Kong.

1786
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:44,400
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1787
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:48,120
I think there was some like there was there was some snow

1788
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,840
drops and like some foamy snow drops.

1789
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,360
And then when we saw the Radio City Rockettes at the amphitheater.

1790
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,640
That's fun. Yeah. Gams.

1791
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,880
But an Italian restaurant, you want to I guess that's convenient.

1792
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,960
So the Nativity scene.

1793
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:04,920
Because McKelley's is right by the other.

1794
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,360
No, not. No, we were we're a Barone's family.

1795
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,240
Oh, sure. Classic. Yeah.

1796
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,480
But I'll say that I'll save that for my Valley Relics

1797
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:16,520
podcast. Yeah. Old school restaurant.

1798
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,840
It's amazing. Old school restaurants.

1799
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:22,360
I wonder if we could get in the Hope House now and do an episode about that.

1800
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,080
Maybe maybe if we pretended we were going to buy it.

1801
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,600
Yeah, we can. We all don't wear like T-shirts.

1802
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,120
If we all wear full suit.

1803
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:32,240
You mean I shouldn't wear shorts and a Bucky O'Hare T-shirt

1804
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,160
to pretend I'm a multi multi millionaire.

1805
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,840
OK, maybe this guy owns Bucky O'Hare.

1806
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:41,400
I will wear a captain's hat and a Navy blazer with gold buttons.

1807
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:43,200
That's all. I'm serious.

1808
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,440
And Navy blazers with gold buttons.

1809
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,960
What are we captains of? Our own destinies.

1810
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,840
And that's why we'd like your estate.

1811
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:56,120
There was a worse tragedy, actually, than people getting

1812
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,360
thrown from the starway.

1813
01:08:58,360 --> 01:08:59,360
I don't know if you know about this.

1814
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:03,800
There was this other thing where I mean, this this was ongoing.

1815
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,400
And I think maybe thousands of people fell victim to this.

1816
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:10,560
The people on the starway were roasted by the Grinch,

1817
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:15,840
who was a big billboard by the 2018 Grinch.

1818
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,440
I did hear about this. Yeah.

1819
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,520
So, God, I don't even something.

1820
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,520
Should we talk about it?

1821
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:22,800
I guess I can get the wherewithal to do it.

1822
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:27,040
But he there was a billboard and he, you know, he was making comments

1823
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,680
about Universal Studios and he said, Oh, look, everybody's on the,

1824
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,840
you know, on the the funnest ride of all, the escalator.

1825
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,840
Well, we have to, dude.

1826
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,960
How else are we going to get to Transformers?

1827
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,240
Give me a break, Grinch.

1828
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,480
There's no other way. There's no elevator.

1829
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,200
You think I want to? Yeah, I can't like go.

1830
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:48,360
I can't go sledding down the entire hill like the Hoos.

1831
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,720
No, things are different in our world, Grinch.

1832
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:54,600
Yeah, as you stay on your hill, the impolite green creature

1833
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:58,280
from Mount Crumpet is back.

1834
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:59,840
What a headline.

1835
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:04,640
The non bald, very much haired, covered and haired

1836
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:07,960
as unballed as can be.

1837
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:10,360
The unballedest man is back.

1838
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,600
Um, uh, what else?

1839
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:17,480
Well, maybe it's time for me to talk about the absolute highlight,

1840
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,640
the greatest thing that ever happened on the Starway.

1841
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,760
And do you guys know where I'm heading with this?

1842
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,560
We may have talked about this at one point in time, but I don't know.

1843
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:27,400
It was a while back.

1844
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,240
I would actually hear it. Wait, a couple.

1845
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:30,880
One quick other thing.

1846
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:35,240
You know, you know, it's weird is it's not labeled Starway anymore.

1847
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:39,280
When they put in those extra rows now, it just says lower lot. Right.

1848
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,840
But it'll always be the Starway in my heart.

1849
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:48,440
And there and though there have been other signs up in the in the famous

1850
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:53,160
half circle entrance of the Starway, I found pictures of this

1851
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,280
that there was something called going on in the lower lot

1852
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,680
called Ultimate Marvel Mania.

1853
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:00,480
Do you guys know about Ultimate Marvel Mania?

1854
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,760
Oh, it was in like 2003.

1855
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,920
It wasn't that long ago. Go on.

1856
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:07,680
And then you keep going down and there's different things on the signs.

1857
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,600
You know, there's a bunch of them.

1858
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,960
It says superpower celebration.

1859
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,360
And then good.

1860
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:17,760
Daredevil Live, Daredevil Live.

1861
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:20,320
What? I was like, what's up with Daredevil Live?

1862
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:24,080
And what Daredevil Live was, was a very brief show where

1863
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:28,520
Daredevil did a flip off of the building.

1864
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:31,040
What? There you go.

1865
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:34,840
Here's a just a man in like a red suit, like the kind you would wear

1866
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:37,120
if you were had to disappear in a green screen.

1867
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:40,080
From here, it could be Magneto without a cape.

1868
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,360
Yeah, it's not particularly.

1869
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,360
Yeah. Wow.

1870
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,640
Really? It's around the time of the Daredevil movie,

1871
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:47,960
but that's not the Daredevil movie costume.

1872
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:50,920
No, it's just a generic unlabeled.

1873
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,160
You said 93, right?

1874
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:53,640
2003. Oh, 2003.

1875
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,400
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

1876
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:59,760
So the Starway at one point was your path to huh?

1877
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,320
To Daredevil Live.

1878
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,280
Daredevil Live.

1879
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,360
To a one flip stunt show.

1880
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:05,520
I've never seen anything about that.

1881
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,720
Yeah, that was news to me.

1882
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:07,960
Thanks to the studio tour.

1883
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,640
This is incredible.

1884
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:16,080
But at another another point in time, the if you went up the well,

1885
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:21,160
in an alternate dimension, if you went up the Starway,

1886
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,960
that would be your ticket to Sky High Plaza.

1887
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,640
Let me explain.

1888
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,200
This is all due to a I had to go back.

1889
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,800
I found the tweet.

1890
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,880
I know the fan listener of the show at C.

1891
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:38,240
Goodman to on Twitter alerted us that after the City Walk Saga,

1892
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:41,960
and I regret that we didn't get this out, that there is an episode of the show.

1893
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:47,720
Slider slider season three, episode 12 called Seasons Greetings.

1894
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:52,200
And this episode, I mean, we might have to do a little more of a dive into this.

1895
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,920
But I think a couple sliders, actually, that's true.

1896
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:58,000
Several episodes of sliders filmed on the lot.

1897
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:01,880
I think it all found a lot, but used the theme park and used City Walk, in fact.

1898
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:07,800
But he I'll read his tweet in another episode.

1899
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:12,560
They slide to a world that is basically a mall and they go to one that exists

1900
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,240
in the clouds at the top of the universal star way.

1901
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:17,760
Eat at Fallen Brother, Jody Moroni's.

1902
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,840
And it's not even called anything different.

1903
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,760
There's at Jody Moroni's, Jerry O'Connell's eating hot dogs.

1904
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,440
They get jobs at Files Playland in the park.

1905
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,320
That's labeled something different.

1906
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,720
And then visit City Walk at night.

1907
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:30,320
And he sent some pictures of this.

1908
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,000
And I will never forget C.E.

1909
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,920
Goodman sending this and just check our Twitter and I'll repost this.

1910
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:42,760
But this shot of an infinite star way going into the clouds.

1911
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,600
I remember this. Look at this thing.

1912
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:47,600
Oh, man. It's got some Christmas stripes on it.

1913
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,520
And it just like there's the practical ones.

1914
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:54,680
And then it just goes and goes a big tube into a cloud city.

1915
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:58,040
And I watched the episode and that's Sky High Plaza.

1916
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,440
It is a world that's totally a mall.

1917
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,080
There's scenes on the escalators.

1918
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:06,640
They like there there's a little like, well, not a walk and talk.

1919
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,960
Aaron Sorkin couldn't have imagined.

1920
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:11,440
Oh, yeah. Escalade and talk.

1921
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,760
Never got one of those into the West Wing.

1922
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:17,840
But Jerry O'Connell, John Rhys Davies are there.

1923
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,040
And then they they stop at one of the plazas.

1924
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,720
I think the Apollo 13 one.

1925
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,000
And they look at a map of Sky High Plaza.

1926
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:25,920
And it is so huge.

1927
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:29,640
There's so many sectors, you'd have to say, of Sky High Plaza.

1928
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:34,800
And they say, since when does a mall have schools, libraries and hospitals?

1929
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:38,160
Because this is a mall that you live in.

1930
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:42,360
And people become essentially indentured servants to the mall.

1931
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:45,720
They're paid. They get jobs at places like Jody Moroni's.

1932
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,280
And they're given plaza cards.

1933
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,880
So you're paid in money that can only be used there.

1934
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,040
And you have to live in Sky High Plaza. Right.

1935
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,800
So there's this dystopian mall world.

1936
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:59,880
And the entrance to it is the Starway, an infinite starway.

1937
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,600
That's not infinite. Just one that's like a mile longer.

1938
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:03,440
Right. Right. Right. Right.

1939
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,800
It's such a good comp.

1940
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:11,640
Like the the the the infinity starway is an amazing moment in television.

1941
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:12,880
Yeah, really.

1942
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,400
I know one's used it other than that. Right.

1943
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,040
We couldn't we didn't have at least seen it.

1944
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,240
Not that I've heard of.

1945
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:22,520
But anybody I'll issue this challenge like a KUSH clip jockey.

1946
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:27,200
Call in if you know any other uses of the starway in media.

1947
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,000
But there needn't be another one.

1948
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,360
Yeah, that's the ultimate. Yeah.

1949
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,600
So excited. That's the best one.

1950
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,440
Sliders went up the escalator.

1951
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:37,400
That's great. Yeah. Yeah.

1952
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,920
So thanks. Thanks for sliding.

1953
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:44,000
Thanks for and they really predicted the Americana in a way.

1954
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:47,280
A mall that has everything you want. Right.

1955
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,600
Yeah. Right. Right.

1956
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:49,600
Mm hmm.

1957
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,400
So that will be everywhere, I think.

1958
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:53,960
Yeah. Yeah.

1959
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:57,880
It may already be happening in Northern California in Silicon Valley.

1960
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:02,480
Oh, is that right? You're a different version of it of like tech companies

1961
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:07,400
building apartments and dormitories on the campus like work here, live here.

1962
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:10,200
Right. Sure. Get paid in campus.

1963
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,800
But yeah, yeah. Don't go anywhere else.

1964
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,120
Yeah. Facebook's. Mm hmm.

1965
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,480
Pity the people who only got paid in.

1966
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,360
What's Elizabeth Holmes?

1967
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,400
Oh, there is a paid in the air.

1968
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:25,640
But yeah, you don't want that.

1969
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:27,880
There are bucks are probably worthless.

1970
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:31,400
I don't look, I don't make a lot of money, but I can get all the blood tests

1971
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:36,200
I could ever need that my children's children could ever need for the rest of time.

1972
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:41,160
I've worked here for three years and I've been paid

1973
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:45,000
one hundred thousand hypothetical blood tests.

1974
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:51,640
There are bucks, there are bucks.

1975
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,320
That's the way.

1976
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:55,000
So anyways, have we missed anything?

1977
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,880
I'm trying to think the last the only other thing I was going to say is like

1978
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:00,160
the idea with the starway, was it that

1979
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,200
it's going to be full of stars?

1980
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:07,240
I mean, I know it's like it's like stairway, not stairway, it's starway.

1981
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:10,680
And seeing Apollo 13 cast there,

1982
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:15,400
you would think maybe the idea was it's going to be full of these type of photo ops.

1983
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:19,040
And like the star, this is a glamorous way to go down a hill.

1984
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:20,880
But it's like there's just a little photo op.

1985
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:23,080
Were there more at a certain point?

1986
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,160
I don't recall.

1987
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:26,040
I don't. I can only remember.

1988
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:28,480
I mean, I think they really want to keep people moving.

1989
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:29,920
I think that first.

1990
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:30,880
Oh, yeah, that's a good point.

1991
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,520
Is a concession of like, OK, this is a beautiful view.

1992
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,920
People want to take pictures, especially tourists not from here.

1993
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,560
So we need something.

1994
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:42,880
And they've got some of the binoculars you can put a quarter in. Right.

1995
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:46,440
But then those other two levels are like,

1996
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:49,280
here's an impulse by Snackart.

1997
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:53,600
And then the third one where it's just not kind of get a view of Jurassic Park.

1998
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:55,240
Now Jurassic World.

1999
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,320
But I think it's just like her.

2000
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,440
Get the get the fuck down there.

2001
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,520
Get all. Yeah.

2002
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,240
Because they had more photo or attractions on the start.

2003
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:05,640
Yeah. Very few benches, if you notice, on those landings.

2004
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,920
Yeah, because they don't want people.

2005
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,840
Yeah, I don't think there's any lingering. Yeah.

2006
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,120
Yeah, they don't. They want you.

2007
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:12,280
Yeah, because there would be a whole jam.

2008
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:16,120
If they put up a picture of the Lorax on one of these things,

2009
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:17,720
people would stop, I guess.

2010
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:18,720
It wouldn't make any sense.

2011
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:20,280
It wouldn't be practical.

2012
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,040
You'd stop and take a photo with the Lorax.

2013
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:23,800
Your friends from Sing.

2014
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,560
Sing. All those singing guys. Right.

2015
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,920
Coach. Alfred Hitchcock.

2016
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:30,320
That's actually one people would like.

2017
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,640
I would like Hitchcock.

2018
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:35,000
Well, if there were, I mean, I would want cutouts of Jerry O'Connell

2019
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,800
and John Rhys Davies being

2020
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:41,240
beleaguered at the idea of the Sky High Plaza.

2021
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,600
If I could pose with them and go, I know it's insane.

2022
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,440
A hospital in a mall.

2023
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:49,880
I would want all the different casts of the Munsters, different shows

2024
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,960
to pose with. Sure.

2025
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,160
Monster Original, Munsters Today.

2026
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:57,680
Jerry O'Connell. Jerry O'Connell in the Mockingbird Lairn.

2027
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,200
Yeah. And then like the guy who wrote that show,

2028
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,280
but maybe not the guy who directed it.

2029
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:05,360
So, yeah, I get it.

2030
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,440
OK, so we don't want a Bryan Singer cutout.

2031
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,920
Yeah. You know what? Let's not do that.

2032
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:12,600
Let's not have that there.

2033
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:16,720
Today, I probably shouldn't have Hitchcock either, let's be honest.

2034
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:21,960
Yeah. Today on KOS Rage Radio, like, OK, Bohemian Rhapsody.

2035
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:25,000
Name the name the stars and director.

2036
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,120
OK, let me see.

2037
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:28,600
Rami Malek and the film had no director.

2038
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,320
That's correct. Let's not talk about this anymore.

2039
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:34,280
Surviving members of Queen kind of just called the shots, I think.

2040
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:36,920
Wow. They're multitalented.

2041
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:38,480
What about the guy who helped finish it?

2042
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,320
Do we need to know? No, don't worry about it.

2043
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:42,160
It just wasn't. It wasn't directed.

2044
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,760
It wasn't directed.

2045
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:46,840
You went a ride on Starway.

2046
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:48,320
You went a ride on Starway.

2047
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:51,840
I'll say as a local, as someone who lives in LA,

2048
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:56,800
this is probably less of a complaint for people visiting from out of town.

2049
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:03,160
Kind of kills the forget about the outside world aspect of theme parks.

2050
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:06,880
I like, you know, sometimes there's none of that already.

2051
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:10,520
Yeah, I mean, it never did.

2052
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:16,000
But when you can see all over the world, like literally as far as the eye can see,

2053
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,720
definitely puts that in perspective.

2054
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:20,120
There's no bubble. The bubble effect shattered.

2055
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:25,880
But I mean, it's a creative solution that everywhere in Universal Studios,

2056
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:29,160
you can see the Toyota dealership with lots of creepy mannequins.

2057
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:29,680
Yes.

2058
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:30,800
Crawling all over it.

2059
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,080
That is terrifying. Yeah.

2060
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:35,120
Yeah. From like many vantage points.

2061
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:36,200
Can you see that? Yes.

2062
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:39,840
Like when you get there's one, there's whatever you get on the 134

2063
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,040
and you pop up and all of a sudden it comes into view.

2064
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:43,920
Do you know what I'm talking about? Yeah.

2065
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:46,920
I think you got off like get on a riverside or something maybe.

2066
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:50,640
And you go up and I like you turn left and like, ah, it's like right there.

2067
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,240
Yeah. Anyway, we'll do an episode.

2068
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:54,560
So yeah, we'll cover every mannequin. Yes. Yeah.

2069
01:20:56,160 --> 01:21:00,160
Oh, the only the only dry fact I missed three hundred forty five steps.

2070
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:03,080
Interesting. Yeah.

2071
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:07,360
But each as special as the last and each comprise the rich tapestry

2072
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:09,240
that is the Starway.

2073
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:10,960
Thank you, Steps, for your service.

2074
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,600
Thank you, Steps. Thank you, Steps.

2075
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,120
Thank you for listening, listeners. Yeah.

2076
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:21,200
And if there's any escalators you'd like us to talk about, let us know.

2077
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:23,280
Oh, you know what?

2078
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:26,920
There's also there's a little escalator in Universal Japan

2079
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,840
that they named the Starway.

2080
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,280
Oh, that's great.

2081
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:33,800
It's not as long as its older brother, and it doesn't have the balls

2082
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:37,240
and the attitude of the evil, the skulls way.

2083
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:38,800
Oh, it's trying its best.

2084
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,800
Let's not forget, I've never been in this because you need a cast member

2085
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:42,840
with a key.

2086
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,880
There is an elevator to the lower lot.

2087
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:49,040
I don't know. Is there is there one all the way down, though?

2088
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,120
I thought you had to like I don't think there's like one

2089
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,240
that goes all the way down.

2090
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:56,160
I think for ADA compliance, you have to get in like a truck or something.

2091
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,080
Is that right? Yeah.

2092
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:01,480
I could be wrong, but I think I think I was reading that there's not just a single

2093
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:03,120
like one way elevator.

2094
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,640
I go down to the fire road.

2095
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:08,600
At one point, you go over a fire road that the trams go in a tram.

2096
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:10,000
Yeah, there's something there.

2097
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,880
Some we should know this, honestly.

2098
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:12,960
This sucks.

2099
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,680
This is no Starway.

2100
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,880
That makes me appreciate the Starway more than ever.

2101
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:18,760
Now, I'm leaving this episode.

2102
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:20,280
Let's get a really long elevator.

2103
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:21,760
appreciation for the Starway.

2104
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:25,000
Have a long elevator already from the Hilton to the Sheraton.

2105
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,920
Yeah, we love that elevator.

2106
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:28,080
Yeah. Yeah.

2107
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:31,480
When it works, sometimes it just doesn't work, but it's fun.

2108
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:32,480
It's fun to ride in.

2109
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,560
Step it up, Staravator.

2110
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:35,560
Mm hmm.

2111
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:38,400
Are you looking up an elevator piece of info that we have to

2112
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:41,400
not end the episode until you get it?

2113
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:43,400
All right, let's end it now and leave a cliffhanger.

2114
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,600
Oh, boy. All right.

2115
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,600
Is there an elevator that goes all the way down?

2116
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:50,440
You'd be a cliffhanger if you didn't make it all the way down

2117
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:51,840
the side of the mountain.

2118
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,720
Well, you'll find out on Starway to

2119
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:56,680
all right. Starway, Patreon, too.

2120
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,680
Stay tuned. The other TV show.

2121
01:22:58,680 --> 01:22:59,680
Survive, guys.
