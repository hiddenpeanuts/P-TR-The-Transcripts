1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Forever.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,540
Dog.

Warning, the following podcasts may contain space fears, the shapes that fried dough can

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:19,400
take, gravitron related skull damage, and strict dip and dot meal plan restrictions.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,020
All this plus Ashley Crystal Hairston joins us to talk wild waves on today's podcast, The

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:27,440
Ride.

7
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,280
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a theme park podcast hosted by three men who love lazy rivers

8
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,860
so much they zoned out in school when learning about more productive rivers like the Mississippi

9
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,960
or the Euphrates.

10
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,680
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always Scott Gairdner.

11
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,500
How productive could it have been if it didn't help anyone to relax?

12
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,140
That's what I'm always saying.

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,660
Jason Sheridan, do you agree?

14
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,340
I would say so.

15
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,080
I haven't thought about the Euphrates in a while.

16
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,020
Yeah, what a poll.

17
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,760
I wrote Euphrates last night and I was like, is this a Dennis Miller-like reference?

18
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,080
It's not so obscure, I guess, so it's not classic Miller.

19
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,220
He would have gone with something much more obscure, but it was still in the zone of like,

20
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,040
I'm really like fancy reference boy here.

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,780
Yeah, it made everyone believe for a second that you knew about history unless they've

22
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,140
heard every other episode of this podcast.

23
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,500
Yes, then they would know that I only know about like X-Men history and different like

24
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,020
historical places that things have happened in the X-Men universe.

25
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,200
That's really more-

26
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,480
We all do.

27
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,960
I know the history of various malls that I've never even been to.

28
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,000
Where do you know where Sail on Sailor was recorded?

29
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,360
Well, that was on Holland albums, so it was probably done in Holland.

30
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,500
It wasn't just a name, they did the whole record in Holland.

31
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,820
So Holland is the answer.

32
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,000
Holland is, that's pretty good.

33
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,320
Yeah, hey, I did get it.

34
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,300
Jason, do you know where Devil Dogs are manufactured?

35
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:29,900
Oh, usually I think there's like regional baking facilities for freshness sake.

36
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,160
Okay, so you think there are multiple different locations where Devil Dogs are-

37
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,120
I think so.

38
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:34,620
Okay.

39
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,020
Yeah.

40
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,820
That's less impressive.

41
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,780
Our guest, go ahead.

42
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,320
I was just gonna say, still pretty good.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,600
He gave a specific, it's funny, our guest was asking what is the format of the show

44
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,500
right before we started.

45
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,780
And now, I guess we have to break it to you.

46
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,520
The format of the show is quiz.

47
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,960
We'll be asking you a series of questions.

48
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,600
No!

49
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,880
We may not, we won't unlock the room.

50
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:03,680
It's gonna be location-based questions based on whatever micro niche stuff you're into

51
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,940
is what the topics of the show are.

52
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,900
You can also take a little nap if we go off too much about snack cakes and the beach boys.

53
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,180
Oh, good, because yeah, I didn't know anything you were referencing just now.

54
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,620
We went straight to deep cuts.

55
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,860
You woke up very quickly.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,060
You're a real pro.

57
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,640
Like, oh shit, what is this?

58
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,560
Let's bring her in though.

59
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,280
From Tiny Toons Loonaversity and the upcoming show Fairly Oddparents, A New Wish,

60
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,380
it's Ashley Crystal Hairston.

61
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,880
I don't know why I'm so excited.

62
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,380
Yeah, we're excited.

63
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,680
We're loving it.

64
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,380
It's the best, it's the biased energy anyone's coming with.

65
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,960
Despite us trying to put you to sleep.

66
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,160
Oh gosh, great.

67
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,040
Good, good, good.

68
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,240
Happy to be here.

69
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,280
Thanks for having me.

70
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,600
Of course, thank you for doing it.

71
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,760
I guess I was gonna ask any famous rivers you like.

72
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,520
We don't have to talk about that.

73
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,620
Thank God we do.

74
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,420
The Nile.

75
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,080
Yeah, the Nile's a great river.

76
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,060
The Nile, yeah.

77
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,580
We're getting, if we're doing the Family Feud,

78
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,020
the board of kind of like the rivers you think of,

79
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,940
I think nobody got X'd.

80
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,600
Maybe Euphrates.

81
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,080
No.

82
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,960
Euphrates might be too.

83
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,200
Well, usually it goes, I think it's like Tigris and Euphrates.

84
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,560
They go together usually.

85
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,480
So that would be probably a combined answer on Family Feud.

86
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:18,920
I'm guessing.

87
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,500
Show me Tigris and Euphrates.

88
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,720
Nile and Mississippi are jockeying for one and two.

89
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,680
So you would have been up there.

90
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,740
Oh, Mississippi, right.

91
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,760
M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.

92
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,080
One of the main points of the American education system

93
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,240
is teaching that little memory.

94
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,680
That's all I remember.

95
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,040
Any word that doesn't have one of those, I'm screwed.

96
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,140
I got this pile of five that I'm wrong every single time.

97
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,100
And I'm not coming up with them, but.

98
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,120
I can't think of it either.

99
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:55,540
How old are you?

100
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,280
How do you not know that?

101
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,020
There are words that I will spell wrong every single time

102
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,020
and will not take an extra five minutes to learn.

103
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:02,920
Same, same.

104
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,200
So like Cincinnati is probably jealous right now,

105
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,520
because Cincinnati, I don't believe, had one.

106
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,520
And I always get confused about how many N's

107
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,020
and how many T's there are.

108
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,200
Yeah, I don't know what offends.

109
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,920
I don't want to try.

110
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:17,780
I don't want to.

111
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,660
There's this really bonkers, you know Babes in Toyland,

112
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,800
the old Disney movie.

113
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,680
Oh my gosh.

114
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,480
There's that, but then there's this weird one from the 80s

115
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,360
with a very young Drew Barrymore and Keanu Reeves.

116
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,060
Oh my gosh.

117
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,560
And they're from Cincinnati, and there's a song

118
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,420
where they spell it.

119
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,220
But it's very unmemorable, and it doesn't help that it's

120
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,320
Drew Barrymore and Keanu Reeves singing it,

121
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,060
because maybe they're a little pitchy, right?

122
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,600
They're not known for their singing,

123
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,280
so it doesn't help me keep the melody in my head.

124
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,460
Well Keanu doesn't sing in Dog Star, right?

125
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,560
I don't think in his band.

126
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,520
Is he the bass player of Dog Star?

127
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,520
Oh, it's his band.

128
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,140
Yeah.

129
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,680
I'm like, I've not seen that movie.

130
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,160
I'm sorry.

131
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,680
You'll discover that I'm terrible with references.

132
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,280
This is when we all discover.

133
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,180
But throwback me, I love it.

134
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,600
You should know Dog Star.

135
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,120
Oh no.

136
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,300
Not just because, look, Keanu's, I feel like the film

137
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,080
is called Keanussance, which has nothing to do with his band

138
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,800
Dog Star.

139
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,500
I love that.

140
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,280
But they're back.

141
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,980
They were on Kimmel a couple of weeks ago.

142
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,380
Dog Star Band.

143
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,980
The band, he was just on for the band.

144
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,960
Oh my gosh.

145
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,400
They have a newer album, yeah.

146
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,040
So he's having kind of a moment in movies,

147
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,920
and he's also having a music moment.

148
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,840
And he's motorcycle enthusiast.

149
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,600
Oh.

150
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,700
And is that new?

151
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,360
He loves, well, I just watched John Wick for a few years ago.

152
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,280
A few years ago.

153
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,200
A few days ago.

154
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,640
And there is very clearly, he gets on like a racing bike,

155
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,060
or a speed, John Wick at some point gets, I'm like, oh,

156
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,420
of course he gets on a very cool motorcycle.

157
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,660
So were you basing his motorcycle moment on this movie you watched?

158
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,200
Or do you know other information?

159
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,180
No, I believe he was helping design ones.

160
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,180
Oh, that's cool.

161
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,320
And he helps restored ones, and sells them and stuff.

162
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,320
I love that.

163
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,460
Well, that's great.

164
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,360
I think we all love Keanu Reeves at this point.

165
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,160
We all can agree.

166
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:26,600
Yes, yes.

167
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,780
And we love everything he does.

168
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,300
Yeah.

169
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,860
From motorcycles to music.

170
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:35,260
He's the motorcycle character in, he's Duke Kaboom in Toy Story 4.

171
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:35,960
Oh my gosh.

172
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,700
So he's having an animated motorcycle moment.

173
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,400
And Scott loosely ties it back to Disney and theme parks.

174
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,380
Sort of.

175
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,780
Not that, well I tied it back to characters who you might need at a theme park,

176
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,720
but I don't know if there's any characters at the theme park we're talking about.

177
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,780
Maybe you can correct us on that.

178
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,280
I know, I was looking around.

179
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,120
But yeah, so we're talking today about a place that you've been, Ashley.

180
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,920
Yes, yes.

181
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,340
Wild waves.

182
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,120
Yes.

183
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,160
But yeah, we could real quick just kind of feel out,

184
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,860
what's your general theme park interests, where they lie, how often you go to them.

185
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,220
Right, right.

186
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,420
Do you like them now as an adult?

187
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,800
Oh my gosh, I love theme parks, yes.

188
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,300
Grew up going, we're like a theme park family.

189
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm from Seattle, Washington, so not much to do.

190
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:25,980
That's a question, yeah.

191
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,320
So theme park, we go to Disneyland and Disney World to get away for our vacations often.

192
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:40,700
That's my childhood vacation memories, we're like going to California for Disney and Universal

193
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,920
Studios and Florida, all that stuff.

194
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,020
And then, yeah, oh I had family in St.

195
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,420
Louis, Missouri, and I remember going to Six Flags

196
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,280
there when I was a kid a few times, yeah.

197
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,000
And that was scary because there was always like twisters happening.

198
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,580
Oh god, really?

199
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:07,820
Yeah, I remember my first tornado, well first, my only.

200
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:08,940
Thank god, thank god.

201
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,080
I've not been in many tornadoes.

202
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,680
I hope it stays that way.

203
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,540
That's good.

204
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:17,140
But that was our first tornado hurricane situation was at Six Flags in Missouri,

205
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,700
and I remember the sirens went off.

206
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,920
I don't remember how old I was, I was probably like, I know I was 10 or under

207
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,900
because my sister was around that age and we're four years apart,

208
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:33,860
but I just remember them like parading everyone into one of their like auditoriums,

209
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:39,980
and we all had to stand along a wall, along like just like lying the wall of the hole,

210
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:45,740
and I remember just looking out at everyone stuck against the wall in case, I don't know,

211
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,620
I guess that's how you hold up a structure or something.

212
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,940
That's what they had us, because I'm from Illinois, so we would have a tornado warning

213
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,900
once in a while, and they would take us out in the hall and you just line up against the wall.

214
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,200
What is that?

215
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,040
I don't know, because I think in the old days it was under the desk,

216
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,380
but then I think they determined that that was bad.

217
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,900
I mean, that was also what they would do if like you got the like nuclear bomb warning

218
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,720
in those old videos, you get on your desk and like this, and you're like,

219
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,680
I don't think that's gonna.

220
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,240
What they think that's gonna do.

221
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,040
If there's a nuclear bomb heading for Schaumburg and Illinois,

222
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,340
I don't think that's gonna stop it, but I guess, yeah, I guess the feeling was like you go near

223
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,640
the strongest wall.

224
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:29,660
Yeah, for support maybe, like the wind will push your back up against and you'll just be stuck

225
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,600
to the wall maybe.

226
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,120
It'll be like a gravitron, right?

227
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,060
Yeah, exactly.

228
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,060
Oh, it's fun.

229
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,600
Yeah.

230
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,960
And then he's all, we'll all start sliding up.

231
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,680
If you're in the eye of the storm, yeah, then you actually, maybe it's a little funny.

232
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,220
Oh, gosh.

233
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,300
You get a ride out of it.

234
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,760
I didn't even think about the eye of the storm.

235
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,400
Just spinning.

236
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:45,980
You got it.

237
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,960
Wait, isn't the eye of the storm?

238
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,540
No, the eye is the peaceful part.

239
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,460
The eye is where it never ends.

240
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:49,980
Where it slows down.

241
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,660
Oh, right.

242
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,200
I don't know about science, weather, or history.

243
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:59,520
The eye is where the teenager working the ride would stand in the middle and watch as you were

244
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,520
on the outside of the gravitron having a fun time getting smashed up against the wall.

245
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:04,860
Sure.

246
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,360
Yeah, which was the worst ride.

247
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,240
I'm sure you all probably talk about that a ton on the show.

248
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,840
I liked that ride as a kid.

249
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,200
You did?

250
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,820
Yeah, yeah.

251
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,000
I had so many head injuries from that.

252
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,060
It's dangerous.

253
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,600
Because it would just fling you up.

254
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,700
So the cylindrical, just kidding.

255
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,860
No, what's the word?

256
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,580
The force?

257
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,180
The force?

258
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:24,920
The force?

259
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,060
Whatever's pulling.

260
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,740
You're talking about a couple of science heads here.

261
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,480
The cylindrical force.

262
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,080
We've been like, yes, you know what I'm talking about.

263
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,200
It's a cylindrical force.

264
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:41,320
Believe the equation for that is, it was awful.

265
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:46,220
Yeah, and you just like, it shoots you up to the ceiling and bang your head all the time.

266
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,660
Yeah, no, I could see how that would happen.

267
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,060
Yeah.

268
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:48,660
I don't know.

269
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,440
I probably was very, I probably moved very conservatively in there.

270
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,440
So I just, I remember kind of just being pressed against the wall and kind of just trying to turn

271
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,800
upside down and not trying to like.

272
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,360
You're also really tall.

273
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:00,940
Yeah.

274
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,440
So that probably, you didn't have as much of a distance to travel.

275
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,960
If I hit my head on the metal, it wasn't with like five feet of distance.

276
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,160
Exactly.

277
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:10,920
It was one foot.

278
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,360
Yeah.

279
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,120
Yeah, that could play into it.

280
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,420
I think my parents described that ride to me and I was already freaked out and they're like,

281
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,520
yeah, it's called a hell hole.

282
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,420
Oh, God.

283
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,660
Later on, I would see the signs that said Gravitron, but they're like, yeah,

284
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,900
and it throws up against wall.

285
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,440
There's no seat belts or anything.

286
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,440
Sometimes a floor drops out.

287
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,080
Sometimes floor lovers can't stand.

288
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:33,880
Oh my God.

289
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,040
I don't want to do that.

290
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,700
I don't want to go to the hell hole.

291
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,320
Get on, try it, son.

292
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,920
I didn't know it was called a hell hole.

293
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,780
I've never heard of that either.

294
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,840
I've seen Devil's Hole too.

295
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:43,860
Oh.

296
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,040
That's way worse.

297
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,240
You're really bad in your life on Earth.

298
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,940
You have to go live in the Devil's Hole.

299
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,180
When you're a nervous child and you are told you're thrown against the wall,

300
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:00,580
the floor drops out, and it's called a hell hole, I was just like, well, I'll never go on that.

301
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,800
Yeah, good.

302
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,380
Smart.

303
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,800
Ashley, were you into more thrill rides or more like robots rides?

304
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,300
Oh, definitely thrill rides.

305
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:10,600
OK.

306
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,080
Yeah.

307
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,040
I feel like I love roller coasters.

308
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,220
I love drops.

309
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,580
I love swings.

310
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,300
Big swings, I assume.

311
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,120
Yes, yes.

312
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,260
Although regular swings are good.

313
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,220
Like the ones that swing, yeah.

314
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,060
I don't like feeling dizzy though.

315
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,280
So the Gravitron one I didn't like.

316
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:38,420
I'm fine if it's like the regular swings that you, it's like, oh, this is whimsical and I can see

317
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,140
everything, but I don't like fast spinning.

318
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:48,180
Like, have you ever been on that ride at Epcot that is called?

319
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,920
Mission Space.

320
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:58,300
Which is, that's a round and around so fast that you get zero Gs and you get,

321
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,860
it's close to actual NASA flight training.

322
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:07,480
Yeah, that's a similar energy, I guess, the cylindrical pool.

323
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,920
Yeah, we didn't like that.

324
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,300
We were very mean to it when we did an episode about it.

325
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,400
It was a, it's a ride.

326
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,200
They had to tone it down really quickly because it killed a couple people right out of the gate.

327
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,540
I know.

328
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:19,740
All right.

329
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,360
That's all crazy.

330
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,260
And it's still awful.

331
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,180
I don't even walk over to it.

332
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,880
I don't want to look at it when I'm there.

333
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,120
No, you got to save yourself some walking at some point.

334
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,520
I don't need to go near that building.

335
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:38,880
I liked it when I was younger, like a teenager, and my body was like, could just be punished

336
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,420
constantly.

337
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:45,560
But I remember, I'm just recalling when we did that episode, I was in isolation with COVID.

338
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:51,160
So I was like, oh yeah, I feel like I just rode mission space.

339
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,420
I feel like garbage.

340
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,600
Did you, Jason, I don't know if we talked about this, did you have fun doing it when

341
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,320
you were a teenager?

342
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,120
Did like the forces, like the G force feel good?

343
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,680
I think I liked it, but when I rode it in my mid or late twenties, I walk off,

344
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,460
really nauseous and dizzy.

345
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,340
And I'm like, I don't want to do that.

346
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,000
I just can't imagine that feeling fun.

347
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,700
Because I can sometimes, if I get a little dizzy on something, I can imagine the, like

348
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,320
I go, okay, I could see how if I was maybe like, like more sleep or something, that would

349
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:23,880
have been fun.

350
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,340
Right.

351
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:29,320
But I can't imagine the feeling, the pressure I felt in my skull, that that would ever just

352
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,400
be a fun feeling.

353
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:30,940
Right.

354
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,280
And then on top of that, like the claustrophobia.

355
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:34,560
Yeah.

356
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,020
Part of it was stressful as well.

357
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,520
And there's nothing fun to look at.

358
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,840
It's just a little screen of like graphics from 2001.

359
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,720
It's claustrophobic when you walk in already.

360
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,360
So like, all right, I will be feeling claustrophobic.

361
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:54,380
Then they start it and then a whole panel comes towards you.

362
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:54,560
Yeah.

363
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,960
Like, oh wait, it is twice as claustrophobic as I thought.

364
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,300
Exactly.

365
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,940
It's like an inch away from your face.

366
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,320
Yeah.

367
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,200
Right.

368
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,040
There's not a single fun part of it.

369
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:11,220
Which is unfortunate because I would like to go to space one day.

370
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,580
But how would I get there?

371
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,360
Right.

372
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,340
You can't do that, you mean?

373
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,080
At some point you got to do it.

374
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,000
I bet it's worse.

375
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,440
I bet mission space is worse than going to space.

376
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:23,940
OK.

377
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,980
Because like William Shatner went into space on Blue Origin on the Amazon on Jeff Bezos'

378
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,760
rocket and he was fine.

379
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,840
He did it a year or two ago already.

380
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,120
He's 92 years old.

381
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:33,860
Oh my gosh.

382
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,020
But he might have gotten dizzy.

383
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,580
We don't know that.

384
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,320
I understand that.

385
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,380
But I'm just saying like you put 92 year old William Shatner in mission space, he's croaking.

386
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,200
Right, right, right.

387
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,840
And I shouldn't say that on this show on broadcast, right?

388
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,300
Because this happens all the time.

389
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,620
But I just mean like how much training could he have gotten to go on Blue Origin?

390
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,260
But is it, do you feel that sensation when you're lifting off and then you end up in

391
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,540
zero gravity and it's pleasant?

392
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:01,660
Maybe.

393
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,460
That's what I hope.

394
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:08,040
Because when you do it in Florida, you are in a simulation of a lift off and then you

395
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,080
walk into Florida humidity.

396
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,280
Or pouring rain.

397
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,280
So you're saying at least there's a pay, maybe that's just the payoff is the reason

398
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,840
that you put up with the horrible skull pain.

399
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:19,840
Maybe.

400
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,760
And that's kind of like life, you know?

401
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,980
OK, I have a real question for all of you.

402
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,500
Yeah, go ahead.

403
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:27,900
Sure.

404
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,680
Would you go to space?

405
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:31,760
That's a good question.

406
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,620
In like the sort of touristy way that it's like a brief, like you're in zero G for like

407
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,720
20 minutes and then you go down?

408
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,600
Yeah, if like we got to a point where it's regular, normal, everybody can go.

409
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,320
But you do have to, you know, get there.

410
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,860
Which, you know, whatever all that entails.

411
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,780
So it's like, OK, I'm going to ask, flesh out this question more.

412
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,100
Sorry.

413
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,640
So it's like cheap as an airline ticket, perhaps multiple companies have been doing

414
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,400
it for a long time, multiple years.

415
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,720
And it seems like very few explosions.

416
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,340
Right.

417
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,660
Check those yellow reviews.

418
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,540
And the one stars are done on behalf of they're written by the widows of the people who passed

419
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:13,920
away.

420
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,520
Yeah.

421
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:16,840
Get over it.

422
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,160
It's not like super elitist anymore.

423
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:19,520
Yeah.

424
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,380
It's not like.

425
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,640
But there is like a spirit airlines of space travel, too.

426
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,020
But if you do these, this one's better.

427
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,080
Yeah.

428
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,000
Yeah, I'm kind of interested.

429
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,860
Right now I'm hesitating because I'm a little afraid of blowing up.

430
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,420
OK.

431
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,140
But if it is like multiple years.

432
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,260
Geez, Mike has these crazy fears.

433
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,280
Of blowing up in space.

434
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,480
I've written some pretty janky roller coasters and some pretty janky cross country flights.

435
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,580
So I like fly though.

436
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,480
How much worse can space be?

437
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,920
Turbulence and all that.

438
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,800
Could be like a lot worse.

439
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,260
It could be a lot worse.

440
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,600
But like maybe I don't know.

441
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,200
I've rode in some bad Southwest flights.

442
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,880
He's a pro.

443
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,200
He's basically sign him up.

444
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,060
Jason, go tomorrow.

445
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,340
You don't even get to pick your seat.

446
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,020
You're fighting for seats when you get on.

447
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,520
It made me check my bag.

448
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,580
I had to put my bag.

449
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,220
I wanted I needed here though.

450
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:19,880
I'm trying to get trail mix out of there.

451
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,920
Actually, that's a perk.

452
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,700
They still have the two bags free.

453
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,860
Like not a lot of places have that.

454
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:25,540
OK.

455
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:25,900
OK.

456
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,420
I could do like an hour of turbulence without losing my mind.

457
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,320
Then after we get into that hour on the plane, like second hour of turbulence,

458
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,120
I start to go, oh, here comes the Joker.

459
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,040
All the dark spots.

460
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,660
I'm turning to the Joker.

461
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,280
So I think it's a shorter trip just to get to the like the atmosphere,

462
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,880
like whatever the part of the atmosphere where you are weightless.

463
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,660
So I think I could handle that.

464
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,320
I think so.

465
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:46,980
OK.

466
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:47,540
So yeah.

467
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:53,200
So like if we're talking like going to space and then like kind of live in a hotel on Mars

468
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,180
or something, maybe I am a little more intrigued because you get the fun of zero

469
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:02,040
gravity, but then also you're like living on a planet or moon or something.

470
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:04,980
I would.

471
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:05,340
Yeah.

472
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:05,660
Yeah.

473
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,740
Yeah, I would.

474
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:16,020
I think it would be cool to, you know, traverse the terrain of a planet.

475
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,060
Yeah.

476
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,920
You're getting out.

477
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,680
You're getting out of this.

478
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,080
Yeah.

479
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,360
Going to wherever you're going.

480
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,820
That's that sounds more because like I was when I was a kid, I loved Star Trek The Next

481
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:30,020
Generation and I would in the same way, I think they like when I was a kid, you loved it.

482
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,780
Well, I only had it then.

483
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,500
No, no, I only had a qualifier to say what I was about to say next, because obviously

484
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,700
I talk about how much I love it all the time on this show.

485
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:43,220
But I just only say that in the same way that like kids would read a Harry Potter or read

486
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:48,940
X-Men and like fantasize about going to a place, I would like dream of like living in a little

487
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,320
room on the ship and like going from planet to planet.

488
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,120
Uh huh.

489
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,080
You wanted a cabin is what you wanted.

490
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,040
I wanted a cabin on the Enterprise, yes.

491
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,080
Because you had, there was a replicator on it that could make you any food item you wanted.

492
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,020
And you'd have like, it was like, I mean, it's a one bedroom apartment.

493
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,140
I wanted a bachelor pad as an 11 year old.

494
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,160
There wouldn't be room for a second person to sleep.

495
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,740
I didn't even worry about having a girl.

496
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,500
No, I didn't want to.

497
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,320
Where would they go?

498
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,480
When I was 10 or 11, I was like, I would just love to have like

499
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,020
a big room with everything in it and a fridge and all my stuff.

500
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,800
And like, eventually I realized like, oh, I'm describing a studio apartment.

501
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,380
Did you ever get one?

502
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:34,840
No.

503
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,960
Oh, dang.

504
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,860
Still time.

505
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,740
There's still time.

506
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:38,940
Yeah.

507
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,580
Still time.

508
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,780
Some sad changes in my life.

509
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,940
I can still make it happen.

510
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,080
Yeah.

511
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,360
So, so yeah, space.

512
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,660
It will be, unless the planet blows up, I feel like it will be easier to do.

513
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:53,980
Yeah.

514
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,760
In a decade or so.

515
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,200
Whoa, which is crazy.

516
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,980
I don't think I weighed in.

517
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,100
I feel like I got to be honest with myself.

518
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,780
It sounds fine to me, but I'm not going to count a bumpy flight as

519
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,740
people know I have problems with coasters.

520
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,680
I'm just like, I'm being honest with myself.

521
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,880
I would just need to like hear some information.

522
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,960
What is this going to do to my body and stomach?

523
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:23,200
How long are you going to be like blasting off or, you know?

524
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,180
Give me some kind of thrill meter.

525
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:25,660
Right.

526
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,320
Let's put, you know, rock and roller coaster.

527
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,040
Where's rock?

528
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:36,300
How many, how many numbers, how many rocket ships is, or novas is rock and roller coaster on the

529
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,700
meter and then what's actual space?

530
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,260
Okay.

531
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,840
Because I fear that, well, rock and roller coaster is a 0.

532
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,820
00025 and space is 100.

533
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,720
So, but I don't know, but Shatner does.

534
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,440
I see what you're saying.

535
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,280
Shatner gives me hope.

536
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,000
So yeah.

537
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,600
And he came back very depressed too.

538
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:53,980
Oh, no.

539
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,720
Oh, fun.

540
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,420
Oh my God.

541
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,720
Oh my gosh.

542
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,260
And he just was having like a freak out moment.

543
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,880
It does not sound so fun.

544
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,300
Maybe I don't need to fantasize it so much because yeah, it does feel like,

545
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:15,560
it feels like space and the galaxy, you know, planets is like some cool thing.

546
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:22,720
Like humans made up in their minds, you know, like the biggest like concept we can imagine,

547
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,380
but it really exists, you know?

548
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,080
So why wouldn't we want to go and explore it?

549
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:28,620
Yes.

550
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,800
Because it might make rumblies in my tumbleys.

551
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,600
That's fine.

552
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,320
Jason, do you say you would go?

553
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,860
I think I would go.

554
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,240
Look, I would also go to Federal Way, Washington.

555
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,900
Oh, is that a hell of a segue?

556
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,140
he can also handle the twists and turns of space.

557
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:03,360
I would go to space, but every time we do like a regional or a smaller neighborhood theme park,

558
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,520
I'm like, I could go to Iowa.

559
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,340
Go to Seattle area.

560
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,440
You could go to Iowa.

561
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,660
But like, I'm not like, I'd like to see this, you know?

562
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,140
I would.

563
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,860
It did feel to go in the direction you're going.

564
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:25,820
It felt like I was going very, traveling very far away because it's like I'm from,

565
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,620
well, so technically I'm from Bellevue, which is like 10 minutes outside of Seattle.

566
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,860
So like getting to go to Wild Waves was like this, oh my gosh, we're going, you know,

567
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,620
it was like maybe 25 minutes away, 30 minute drive.

568
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,680
Which feels long when you're a little kid.

569
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,200
Especially on a bus, like you're taking a cheese bus there.

570
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,660
It's like, oh my gosh, we're going.

571
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,740
A cheese bus?

572
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,560
Far, yeah.

573
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,060
Like a school bus.

574
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,840
Oh, you call it cheese buses?

575
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,260
Yeah.

576
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,120
Because of the yellow?

577
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:54,640
Yes.

578
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,600
Oh, that's nice.

579
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,540
That's cool.

580
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,680
Yeah, take a cheese bus there.

581
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,040
Oh wow.

582
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,400
So you would do like school trips also to Wild Waves.

583
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,520
Yeah, so.

584
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,520
This is in the, okay, it's in the Sea-Tac area.

585
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:09,900
Correct.

586
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,520
And it's kind of between sea and tac.

587
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,140
Correct.

588
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,640
It's sort of equidistant.

589
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,040
Yes, Seattle, Tacoma.

590
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:23,380
And it is a, it's kind of half theme park and half water park, is that accurate?

591
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:23,700
Yeah.

592
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:29,700
Because it was like both, like it was in the past called, like Wild Waves is the water park part,

593
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,480
but the theme park had been called Enchanted Village at some point.

594
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:33,780
Correct.

595
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,020
Now it's just kind of all one thing.

596
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:41,340
Pretty recently they've combined it, and so it's just called Wild Waves theme and water park.

597
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,680
Oh, I didn't know that.

598
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,180
Yeah.

599
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:43,360
Okay.

600
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,420
They used to be clunkier with like, no, it's two things.

601
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:46,860
Yes.

602
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,800
Remember two names.

603
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:54,040
And I'll tell you what happened probably, is that no one liked Enchanted Village.

604
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:59,540
Like as kids we all hated Enchanted Village because the rides were boring and dumb and

605
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:03,140
for little kiddies, and no one ever wanted to go to Enchanted Village.

606
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:08,080
Everyone was always like thrilled and excited to go see, to go to Wild Waves,

607
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:14,280
because that's where the fun rides were like the freaking wave pool that like drowned people,

608
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,100
and then all the cool slides and stuff like that.

609
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:22,600
So yeah, we all were like, forget Enchanted Village is the boring part.

610
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,320
What age are we talking?

611
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,540
When's the first like trip or two?

612
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,420
How old are you?

613
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:32,080
So I was thinking about this on the way here, and like my earliest memories

614
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,100
were elementary school.

615
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:41,720
And I don't remember, so I know for a fact that the math Olympiad team got to go for

616
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,900
their end of the year.

617
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,180
Oh cool.

618
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,320
But then I was thinking, I was like, was I on math Olympiad?

619
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,380
Which seems very far off.

620
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,160
Seems like that would be unbelievable.

621
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,460
But I do, you know what I know it was.

622
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,600
I went with my patrol team.

623
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,460
I got to go.

624
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,600
I was on patrol in elementary school.

625
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,520
What's patrol?

626
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,960
Patrol is like the kids who wear the yellow vest, and you get to like

627
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:14,500
guide kids, students in between classes, you know, to like go that way, go this way.

628
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,780
I don't think I know that.

629
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,560
Was the school complicated enough?

630
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,360
You needed that?

631
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,360
I don't know.

632
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:19,560
I guess.

633
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,860
It's just something to do.

634
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,480
Like we need kids need jobs.

635
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,340
This is going to be one.

636
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,040
Put them to work.

637
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:35,200
Then we got to like leave class a little bit early to go and like be at your station.

638
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:42,460
Our school, which was Sunset Elementary, Puesta del Sol, is Spanish immersion and English.

639
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:50,660
It was like outside, you know, like so like the classrooms were separate.

640
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,720
And like to go to each classroom you go outside outdoors.

641
00:27:53,720 --> 00:28:00,860
And so it was kind of like amazing that way because all of the pathways connected

642
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,800
to each outdoor, to each like building.

643
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,220
If that makes sense.

644
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,080
You didn't need to.

645
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,080
And it was like older kids usually, right?

646
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,340
It wasn't like you wouldn't put like first graders in it.

647
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,700
You had to be like fourth or fifth grade, I remember.

648
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,320
But there would be like a kid or two in my class that would have to leave like

649
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,020
10 minutes early to suit up in uniform.

650
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,760
To go direct traffic.

651
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:21,600
Right, right, right.

652
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,560
Why didn't I have this?

653
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,920
They deputized the child.

654
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,140
Was it just kind of…

655
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,440
Fairly self-explanatory, I guess.

656
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,680
Did you have hall monitors?

657
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,420
Like that's what…

658
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,300
Yeah, that's basically sort of what it is.

659
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,360
I'm not sure that I did have hall monitors.

660
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,660
I don't know.

661
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,940
That always felt like a TV invention to me.

662
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,900
I know they're real, but I didn't, I never had like…

663
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,420
That's sort of what this is.

664
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,640
Yeah, basically.

665
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:48,800
But yeah, it would just be like to get, yeah, one kid to feel like superior to the other kids.

666
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,460
To get to go and tell the other kids what to do.

667
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,860
Friggin' wild waves at the end of the day.

668
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,000
You were superior because you made it to wild waves.

669
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,760
Yeah, that is actually a real victory.

670
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:05,560
So you're being sold the idea that Enchanted Village is supposed to be for you, but it's lame.

671
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,480
So this is what I'm confused about because there are coasters and stuff.

672
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,120
Was that part of Enchanted Village, or is Enchanted Village purely…

673
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,700
There were some rides for kids because it sounds very kid-oriented.

674
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,120
Yeah, I don't remember any big roller coasters being there.

675
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:37,840
I remember a train ride situation, maybe a carousel thing, or some boring outdoor gymnasium thing.

676
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,380
I remember that.

677
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,820
And then there was some boring theme of the Enchanted Village that nobody cared about,

678
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:49,260
about bears and bear fairy tale land, whatever.

679
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,320
And they had characters, I remember.

680
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,060
And it was all just so kiddy-like.

681
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,820
No one cared about going to Enchanted Village.

682
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,900
It just made me think how upset I'm going to be when my son doesn't…

683
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,780
I have a three-year-old, and when he starts thinking rides are boring,

684
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,260
what am I going to do?

685
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,480
The entire way we pass the time is go on various trains that show you nothing.

686
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:15,360
Oh, when the word boring enters his lexicon, I'm so screwed.

687
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,460
They don't want to go on.

688
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:21,680
There are a few roller coasters at Wild Waves now.

689
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,200
Oh, great.

690
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,360
They've added stuff in the last decade or so.

691
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,540
They've changed owners and stuff.

692
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,300
They haven't added a lot recently.

693
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,280
No, they have not.

694
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,380
But there is the…

695
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,500
What is the coaster called?

696
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,040
Are you talking about Timber Axe?

697
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,080
Yeah, Timber Axe in 2018.

698
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,980
They added something called Timber Axe.

699
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,780
Oh my God.

700
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,060
No, is that the spinner that looks like a big axe?

701
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:44,940
Oh, you're right.

702
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,980
Yeah, that's not a roller coaster.

703
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:46,520
Excuse me.

704
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,660
That is a big axe that spins around.

705
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,400
Oh, no.

706
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,200
Watch out.

707
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,560
Boring, we'll show you.

708
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,940
The most violent ride possible.

709
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,120
Timber Hawk is the wooden coaster that kind of goes through the woods a little.

710
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,700
Oh, that sounds fun.

711
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,360
So, and those are always fun.

712
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,420
It's like a good old clunk.

713
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:08,800
That's a 2003…

714
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,840
Timber Hawk, Ride of Prey.

715
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,040
Ride of Prey.

716
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,320
Prey doesn't mean anything.

717
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,360
Yeah, sure.

718
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,280
Yeah, watch a ride through whatever.

719
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,480
That'd be the boringest thing.

720
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,400
Sometimes we'll play clips of rides and shows.

721
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,360
Oh, that's fun.

722
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,300
All right, now here, let's just listen to Ride of Prey.

723
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:30,720
Listen to it.

724
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,240
Let me just hear glug glug glug glug.

725
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,340
All right, well, I think we got a sense of it.

726
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,400
It's interesting.

727
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:42,980
This park, because it does feel like a smaller neighborhood park to the point that in the

728
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:49,600
aerial photograph you can see online, you can see on Wikipedia, there are houses up in the

729
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,240
corner by the parking lot.

730
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,140
But then there are a couple of larger coasters.

731
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,060
Okay, let me see.

732
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,400
Yeah, this seems decent.

733
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,020
Like, you know, just the good old clunky wooden…

734
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,700
This is the…

735
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,960
Timber Hawk is the tallest roller coaster in Washington.

736
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,560
And that is not…

737
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,980
It sounds more impressive than it is because that's a technicality,

738
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,340
because Washington, as you probably know, does not have a lot of roller coasters.

739
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:21,660
I think that's our only park, like our only theme park to Washington.

740
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,840
Other than the State Fair, which has rides.

741
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,360
Puyallup Fair, we have, I think.

742
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,780
Well, at least that's the one I grew up going to.

743
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:34,360
When Puyallup, Washington smells terrible.

744
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,380
Getting weird with these names.

745
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,420
That's in that Keogh Cook family.

746
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,480
I knew someone from Puyallup.

747
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:45,640
And then a friend from high school went to Evergreen College, designed his own major,

748
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,240
sort of like…

749
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,340
I feel like a lot of cartoon…

750
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,460
Matt Groening?

751
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,280
Was he involved in Evergreen at some point or went to school there for a little while?

752
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,780
Was Matt Groening involved in it?

753
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,760
No, I couldn't remember if he taught there or if he was a student there or something.

754
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,780
I don't know.

755
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:02,480
I don't know.

756
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,000
I'm not sure.

757
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:08,760
But when Mike said you wanted to do this one, I was like, oh yeah, I don't know a lot about

758
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,280
the Pacific Northwest parks.

759
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:14,260
There's another park a little further away.

760
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:23,040
And then there's Enchanted Forest in Oregon, which is not related to Enchanted Village.

761
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,920
Kind of has the bush gardens.

762
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,440
Like, all right, there's the little town.

763
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,480
There's the little old West Street.

764
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,180
There's a little variety.

765
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,140
I like that one.

766
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,680
People tell us to do that one.

767
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:37,800
Enchanted Forest?

768
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:38,280
Yeah.

769
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,280
You know what?

770
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:44,180
When this came up during this episode with you, Ashley, I thought, well, that's interesting.

771
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,620
I've never heard of that one.

772
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,340
And yet it felt familiar to me.

773
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:52,640
Then I realized, oh, I have heard of this because several years ago,

774
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,720
I did.

775
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,960
And I'm going to enter a differing opinion.

776
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:57,520
I don't know.

777
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,700
Totally some of your feelings about this place.

778
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,100
But here's what I did.

779
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:06,640
I did a call a couple of years ago on Twitter for some topics you might want us to do on

780
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,320
the main feed or on our Patreon.

781
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,720
And there was one that stuck with me so much.

782
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,740
I took a screenshot.

783
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,120
It was on my desktop for the longest time.

784
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,560
I think the user was Diddy Thump.

785
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,660
And the-

786
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,400
Diddy Thump.

787
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,620
Shout out, Diddy Thump.

788
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,480
Who seems to not have been expelled from Twitter or something.

789
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,620
I hope it was not a bad situation.

790
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:32,000
But Diddy Thump said, just this very blunt, here's-

791
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,280
All right.

792
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,840
What should we do on the show next year?

793
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,460
Wild Waves in Washington.

794
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,360
Suck shit.

795
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,020
It's funny.

796
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,040
It's funny?

797
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,020
Suck shit.

798
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,440
It's funny.

799
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,600
That was the full review.

800
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,440
And it really called to me.

801
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,800
I thought about pulling the trigger on this with you guys a long time ago.

802
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,400
I'm glad I didn't so we could do it with you, who's actually been.

803
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:55,680
But now that I've thrown out kind of the like negative opinion, and I don't know.

804
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,080
I was just so like entranced by the-

805
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,860
The way that was.

806
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,860
Of the spray show.

807
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,740
Oh, for sure.

808
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:05,380
All right.

809
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:10,860
Diddy Thump is right and I hope they're out there listening today because wow.

810
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:11,920
Suck shit.

811
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,080
This one's for you, Diddy Thump.

812
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,260
What calls- what jumps out when you hear that someone thinks that it sucks shit?

813
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,160
What might that be for?

814
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:24,640
Well, literally, well, I'm again, I know they're probably referencing the Enchanted

815
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,980
Village part is like such a waste of a park on the side.

816
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:34,600
The Wild Waves Parkside was so fun, but it was also just so like you have to know about what

817
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:44,140
and I don't want to rag on my own hometown, but where it's located is like Tacoma is always gets,

818
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,240
you know, chitted on because

819
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,260
um and no offense to Tacoma people, but it does it like smells bad.

820
00:35:53,400 --> 00:36:00,220
The city like actually smells bad because of like the uh there's like uh

821
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,440
Some sort of plant or something?

822
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,300
Yes, it's a plant.

823
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,920
I was gonna say an oil plant, but I don't know if it's oil.

824
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:13,540
It's like old refinery plant that's there and the smell is like sulfur that they use to crush.

825
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:17,300
Ashley, there is a Wikipedia referring to this syndrome.

826
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:24,060
This is extremely sourced and the Wikipedia title is Aroma of Tacoma.

827
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,060
There you go, yes.

828
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,400
It is a- yes.

829
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,220
Yeah, they did Tacoma.

830
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,620
A putrid and unpleasant odor that is sulfury.

831
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,020
Why is it?

832
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,540
Is a rendering plant, a pulp and paper mill.

833
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,580
Pulp and paper mill.

834
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,640
An oil refinery.

835
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,660
It's a lot of stuff.

836
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:42,720
I think it's better now maybe than when you were growing up, but it's still bad.

837
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,160
Mike's listening.

838
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,540
Oh yeah.

839
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:52,160
During a concert stop at the Tacoma Dome in the mid 80s,

840
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:57,920
Bruce Springsteen reported that the odor was so overwhelming he was forced to leave the town early.

841
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,140
Oh, what is that?

842
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,800
I thought it was gonna be the show.

843
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:01,980
Oh no.

844
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,080
Bruce wouldn't have to leave the show early.

845
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:04,940
I agree.

846
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,240
I'm taking- I'm just gonna chill out for a week in Tacoma.

847
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:08,920
Oh my gosh.

848
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,140
Just real hardworking American like nope never mind out.

849
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,660
This afternoon, give me a plate.

850
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,800
Just find me a Marriott in Seattle.

851
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:18,840
Bruce would not.

852
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,580
He'd still do a four hour show, but he put like the clothespin on it.

853
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,100
Their lives are so hard with this aroma.

854
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,100
He should have written a song about the smell.

855
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:29,840
Yeah.

856
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,900
You know who did?

857
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,620
Wait, sorry Jason.

858
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,180
Oh, please.

859
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:32,700
You know who did?

860
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,540
Frank Zappa.

861
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:39,640
The 1979 Frank Zappa song, Jewish Princess, mentions a garlic aroma that could level Tacoma.

862
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,080
Oh my gosh.

863
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,000
You guys know all of this history.

864
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:44,480
Me neither.

865
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,920
This is your hearing it real time.

866
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:46,840
I'm glad you brought this.

867
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,740
I have no idea that Tacoma smells.

868
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,380
Apologies to everyone in Tacoma.

869
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,860
Would there be a bigger theme park presence in Tacoma?

870
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:54,420
Possibly.

871
00:37:54,860 --> 00:38:00,900
The pros like cheap land, cheap real estate, a large population, cunts, stinky.

872
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,920
Smells like eggs.

873
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,360
And that's what it literally smells like eggs.

874
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,500
Like soon you'll be driving in your car.

875
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,260
You'll be normal, listening to music, having a good time.

876
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:15,400
And then bam, suddenly eggs in your nose, in your throat.

877
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,160
And you're like, oh god.

878
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,500
And then you like immediately want to turn around.

879
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,160
Nothing good's happening in this city.

880
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,020
Gary, Indiana is like that too.

881
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,840
There's a smell?

882
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,240
Yeah.

883
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:25,780
Oh boy.

884
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,620
Just because of the different like whatever like plants again, like whatever.

885
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,660
This is also there's Google results on this.

886
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,460
This must have fooled the Jackson family too.

887
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:37,940
Aren't they from there?

888
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,660
We gotta get out.

889
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:47,840
I grew up outside of Philadelphia and all along the Delaware River there were refineries and

890
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,120
chemical plants and stuff.

891
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,140
So occasionally get a bad smell.

892
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:56,580
And then once or twice in childhood, I lived pretty far away from it.

893
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:02,020
But like the people who lived close, so it's like, okay, we're doing indoor recess today.

894
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,360
Do not spend extended periods of time outside.

895
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,280
There was a leak.

896
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,280
Oh gosh.

897
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,520
The Tesco plants.

898
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:15,280
Everything is under control, but you may smell a pungent odor and do not be outside for too long.

899
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,620
And it's like, oh, okay.

900
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,880
What does Tesco do?

901
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,680
Why are they stinking up your town?

902
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,580
I don't know.

903
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,200
There were so many.

904
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:30,080
Boeing and what's the, not Lockheed Martin.

905
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:35,320
DuPont had a lot of plants in Pennsylvania and Delaware, different facilities and stuff.

906
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:42,360
But yeah, reading about this park was interesting.

907
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,440
It's had a lot of owners over the years.

908
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,420
Foster child kicked around.

909
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,280
Kicked around.

910
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:55,360
A lot of the reviews are either four or five stars, like really fun going with manager

911
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,680
expectations or one star review.

912
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,840
They are plagued by staffing issues and half the park is closed.

913
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:03,880
Yep.

914
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:08,480
A lot of reviews of like go to drive a little further, go to Silverwood.

915
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,120
That was the other.

916
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,060
Silverwood.

917
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,960
Is Silverdale?

918
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,500
Maybe Silverwood.

919
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:13,980
I don't know.

920
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,480
Silverwood in Boulder Beach.

921
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,100
I don't even know where that is.

922
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,280
That one.

923
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:20,620
Yeah.

924
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,280
It's farther away.

925
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,700
I have to check that out.

926
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,660
So morale's a little low because it's getting at least a half of that Tacoma stink.

927
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,100
Yes.

928
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,460
The water park's fine, but.

929
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:31,940
Yeah.

930
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,560
Water park was fine.

931
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:38,240
And then I feel like there was like teens working.

932
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,120
Of course.

933
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,760
No adult presence really.

934
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:50,360
So you got grimy teens working these rides and monitoring safety.

935
00:40:52,660 --> 00:41:00,280
And yeah, the people that the park attracted, they're from all over.

936
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:05,860
I feel like no one ever really felt safe there.

937
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,940
So everyone's looking around, making sure their kids are there,

938
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,460
belongings are there, all that stuff.

939
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,900
You got to go there, yeah, manage your expectations basically.

940
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:25,740
But my favorite ride on Wild Waves, well, I shouldn't even say ride,

941
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,380
but it was the wave pool.

942
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,040
Kids went for the wave pool.

943
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:35,700
That was the big draw to Wild Waves, was the insane wave pool that like,

944
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,460
there's probably deaths listed for that too.

945
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:39,740
There is.

946
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:40,660
Okay, yep.

947
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,320
Yes.

948
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:45,480
Yeah, I drowned a couple times, not fully drowned, but like.

949
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,980
You needed help?

950
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,100
Yes, I needed.

951
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:52,020
Well, first of all, I'm 4'11 for the listeners out there.

952
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,040
And then I can't swim also.

953
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:00,380
Well, and I should say I can swim over water or underwater.

954
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,700
But when you put the between.

955
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,060
But the between water is not safe for me to.

956
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,820
It's also hard to swim when you're getting pummeled by waves.

957
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,460
That too.

958
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,020
Yes, I'm right there with you.

959
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,820
I'm 5'1.

960
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,340
I've got my ass kicked by some wave pools.

961
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,760
It's so scary.

962
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:24,020
Where the actual Atlantic Ocean has not beat me up as much as like artificial wave.

963
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,900
Yes, yeah, same.

964
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:30,520
I have so many memories of like, I remember we got in trouble once

965
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,800
because I was further out than I should have been.

966
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:39,640
And our or whatever the lifeguard person was like, had to dive in and.

967
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,160
Oh, they did?

968
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:40,620
Yeah.

969
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,700
Get me out.

970
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,040
Was that like a situation where you could not breathe as well?

971
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,000
Like, is it that scary?

972
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:50,820
Just like, you know, clamoring in the water and like, catch a breath,

973
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:55,140
that kind of situation where they see you physically struggling and know that,

974
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,760
hey, this girl doesn't know how to swim.

975
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,140
She should not be this far out.

976
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:02,920
But it's hard to not be that far out because the waves are pulling in, you know?

977
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,600
So it's tricky.

978
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,420
It's a very tricky thing to navigate.

979
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,300
This was one of my mother's big fears.

980
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:17,200
And I was not allowed to do this for many, many years in any sort of way.

981
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,100
Wisconsin Dells was yours, correct?

982
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:19,400
Yes.

983
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,060
We haven't talked a lot about wave pools, I guess.

984
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:22,840
Yeah.

985
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,620
Oh my gosh.

986
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:23,800
Wow.

987
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:31,380
The regularity, I guess, of like the machine driven, constant, giant big wave is a little bit.

988
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,960
James Bond villain torture device.

989
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,720
Just like throw Mr.

990
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,460
Bond in the pool and we'll pummel him with waves.

991
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,640
And see how when he like his like muscles give out.

992
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,160
Yeah.

993
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,020
And then he just goes sinks and that's it.

994
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,600
It's so bizarre.

995
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:53,120
I mean, that's so bizarre, but like it is you think you're safe one moment.

996
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,940
And then once the way, and I think there was like a sound or an alarm that would go off

997
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,020
whenever the waves, we knew the waves were coming.

998
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:04,380
So kids would like rush out as far as they could and wait.

999
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:04,700
Yeah.

1000
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:05,580
And just wait for them.

1001
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,760
The big wave could go farther out.

1002
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,340
And then they're gradual.

1003
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:12,000
So like the waves would start small and then everyone, all the kids are like,

1004
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,420
and then they get more and more and then suddenly it's like

1005
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,760
the biggest wave of life.

1006
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:22,320
And you're like, like dying immediately sucked under water.

1007
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,500
That would alarm me.

1008
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,040
Like you were saying, a partial drowning.

1009
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:27,480
Yeah.

1010
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,280
They believe they say the panicking.

1011
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:30,640
Right.

1012
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:31,920
Is a big part of it.

1013
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:32,300
Yes.

1014
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:38,300
As a kid, those alarms that big waves are coming would stress me out so much.

1015
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:43,980
Sure.

1016
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:48,180
But like every now and then the alarm would sound.

1017
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,200
I'm like, I don't like that.

1018
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,640
Like, yeah, it's thrilling, but also terrifying.

1019
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,040
Yeah.

1020
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:57,900
It's kind of fun when you're at the beach and it's like, oh, big wave suddenly.

1021
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:58,420
Right.

1022
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,560
A little surprise.

1023
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,600
That's kind of like, oh, here's a big one.

1024
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,380
Now a smaller one.

1025
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:09,560
As opposed to the just drilling of I have the sire.

1026
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:12,660
I feel like I must have been somewhere with a siren, but is this like an error rate?

1027
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:16,480
Yeah, it sounds usually like it's like a nuclear bomb is coming.

1028
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,500
Get under your desk.

1029
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:19,160
Yeah.

1030
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,540
Backing up from Mike, does anyone want to try it?

1031
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:26,560
And is anyone haunted enough by one of the air raids where you feel like you know what it sounds?

1032
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:29,580
Is it like Godzilla style?

1033
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,100
It's like, maaa.

1034
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:32,900
Yeah.

1035
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,080
That was horrible.

1036
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,760
That's good, yeah.

1037
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,120
I feel like he really is nailed that.

1038
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,400
All the moan of that.

1039
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,980
That's really, these are all terrible for different reasons.

1040
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,980
That is what you would hear too in the Midwest, like, because we were, we lived right by my school

1041
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,060
and they would, there was the tornado alarm.

1042
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:51,580
Yes.

1043
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,720
It would blare through the town.

1044
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,540
Yeah, that's so scary.

1045
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,820
And it was like that because it would go.

1046
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,860
And it would just last for a half hour.

1047
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,360
And that's what, yeah, you would hear in the wave pool.

1048
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:06,740
That's the story you own.

1049
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:07,640
In the fun place.

1050
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:12,640
Everybody was afraid of you on your trips and you where you live, afraid of tornado sirens.

1051
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,740
And then for fun, you'd go to places with fun sirens.

1052
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:16,020
Yeah.

1053
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,080
Which sound identical to the scary sirens.

1054
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:21,020
Yes.

1055
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:21,480
Okay.

1056
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,900
Than the tornadoes necessarily.

1057
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,000
Yeah, scary.

1058
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:28,220
I don't like, okay, I don't want to like delve into this, into the death though.

1059
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:32,320
We try to avoid those, but there's just an aspect of the death that happened here that is like,

1060
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,340
well, that's what happens when teens are in charge.

1061
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:34,820
Oh no.

1062
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,860
Where it's.

1063
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,820
life grid said, I don't believe you.

1064
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,620
I know kids are pranking me.

1065
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,320
And not to meditate on it, but isn't that bonkers?

1066
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,560
It is, but it's also like.

1067
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,000
And then the 31st kid was like, somebody's drowning and he's like, yeah, right.

1068
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,800
I fell for it 30 times and then I would have a little more sympathy.

1069
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,520
Squidward is not in the pool.

1070
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:11,940
I know that for a fact.

1071
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,960
Your dad does not work for Nintendo.

1072
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,220
I went on a computer and I looked it up, play the secret games that the other kids don't get to play.

1073
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:25,860
That's not a real thing.

1074
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,720
I've been lying to you by kids all day.

1075
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:33,240
I see another and I watched some videos of rides at the park and stuff.

1076
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:41,620
And a lot of parks, even at the six flags level, will do like for 20 extra bucks or something,

1077
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:47,400
you do the sky coaster or whatever, or a zip line or like, sky coast is the thing where they like

1078
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:53,960
raise you up in like a vinyl tarp and like drop you.

1079
00:47:54,580 --> 00:48:01,180
So I, someone had a GoPro clearly like strapped to them and was being lifted up.

1080
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:07,340
And that the way that there's like a mix of the way they get people down is like,

1081
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:11,340
there's kind of a cherry picker, like a thing that rises up to meet it.

1082
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:15,240
But then they also just kind of like hook you with a long pole.

1083
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:21,120
The workers that were walking out to do the hooking part, one of them was just looking at

1084
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:27,500
the whole time while they were like lifting the person up and they didn't have anything to do.

1085
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:34,740
But I'm like, if I was being lifted that many stories in the air, I would prefer the employees

1086
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:39,260
to be alert and not playing Tetris.

1087
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,540
The theme park should be like the set of a Christopher Nolan movie.

1088
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:50,020
No phones, no sitting down, always alert and making sure that kids are okay or people are okay.

1089
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:50,600
Yeah.

1090
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:59,400
I love the stories of sets like that because it's like, okay, that is a director who is not also

1091
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,140
an actor because most of the job is sitting around.

1092
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:03,260
That's true.

1093
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:03,500
Yes.

1094
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,900
Let's make it very clear.

1095
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,080
Jason Sheridan refuses to be in a Christopher Nolan film.

1096
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,840
If you were thinking if anyone was filling out an email to try,

1097
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,500
are you curious for a self-tape for Jason?

1098
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:15,820
He's out.

1099
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,000
I'm bringing like a Coleman chair.

1100
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,560
I'm bringing a folding camping chair, Chris.

1101
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,040
Jason was set to play Alfred in the Batman movie.

1102
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,480
And he turned it down.

1103
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,540
And he turned it down and they went with Michael Caine instead.

1104
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:34,940
I can put my little phone in the trailer, but I need like at least a tiny little chair.

1105
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,700
I need a little stool or something.

1106
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:41,960
So you will accept the role of the elevator attendant.

1107
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,060
Yeah, elevator attendant.

1108
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,780
I will demand rows where I am sitting.

1109
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,460
I'll be a Bonville.

1110
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:52,720
I would be Blofeld if I can spin around in a chair.

1111
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:56,900
Asha, do you remember specific slides at all?

1112
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:01,140
Were they memorable enough where you were like, oh, I'm going on this and you knew the name of it?

1113
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,560
I don't remember the name of it, but there was one.

1114
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,260
It was closest to the freeway.

1115
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:11,160
I remember because you would be at the top of the slide and you could look to your left and the

1116
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,620
I-5 was next to you.

1117
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,340
Oh, yeah.

1118
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,420
I saw something about the I-5 in one of the Wikipedia.

1119
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:21,960
It's just this park is literally just off of the I-5.

1120
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,240
Like it's right there.

1121
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,180
Oh, one of the thrill rides is called I-5 Skydive.

1122
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,320
Oh, is that the sky coaster?

1123
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:30,380
Yeah, that's new.

1124
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,140
Is that one new?

1125
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:31,920
That's 2017.

1126
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:32,780
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1127
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,920
So they're just naming it now because it's so close.

1128
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:36,700
Yeah.

1129
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,280
So there was a slide that was right there.

1130
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,400
And it was a water slide.

1131
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,800
And I remember there being like two.

1132
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,840
So one was like really higher, like higher and steeper.

1133
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,580
And then there was one like they ran right next to each other.

1134
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:58,580
And then the shorter one was like for the wusses.

1135
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,300
And yeah, that was like one of the other big attractions.

1136
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:08,500
So like, yeah, there's like Congo slides, they say on the like, I'm just looking at the website.

1137
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:12,620
And then there's Pacific Plunge, which has like a couple of different slides.

1138
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:13,760
Oh, I remember that thing.

1139
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,320
And Zuma Falls.

1140
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,440
Maybe that's it.

1141
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:19,120
And that was when you were in a big tube.

1142
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,180
Oh, no, that's not it.

1143
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:22,020
So it's a family.

1144
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:22,840
It's a family.

1145
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,420
I mean, it's there's something.

1146
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,260
Warming tubs, they say.

1147
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:29,020
Well, Scott, I have questions about the warming tubs.

1148
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:29,360
Warming tubs.

1149
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:30,400
What is a warming?

1150
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,780
That phrase kind of hurt my head.

1151
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,320
Is that a hot, just like a gentle hot tub?

1152
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,240
It looks like a hot tub.

1153
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:35,820
It's bigger.

1154
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,380
On the website, they call it warming tubs and it says thrill level mild.

1155
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:48,580
It could not jump to moderate or severe if you get stuck in the jet.

1156
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,360
So Scott can go in the warming tub.

1157
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,920
Has anyone seen Scott?

1158
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,440
Oh, he's posted up in the warming tub.

1159
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,360
He's probably getting some mild thrills somewhere.

1160
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:02,540
Now, here's my question is that it says on the Wikipedia,

1161
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:06,260
former rides warming tubs closed 2020.

1162
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:11,560
So it's unclear if they've reopened the warming tubs

1163
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:15,520
and just haven't updated the Wikipedia, which I guess is more likely.

1164
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,240
They close it because of COVID.

1165
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,320
People are getting COVID in the warming tubs.

1166
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,340
You can't have that.

1167
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:23,480
So they close it, but maybe they just haven't put it back on the

1168
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,840
operating rides on the Wikipedia.

1169
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,400
Somebody get on there.

1170
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,580
We got to let the world know that the warming tubs are available.

1171
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,420
Assuming when does this place open?

1172
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:32,440
I don't know.

1173
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,460
In the morning?

1174
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,720
Oh, I see what you're saying.

1175
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,820
May through October.

1176
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:40,620
May through October.

1177
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:45,500
That's kind of like some times only on the weekends.

1178
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,900
I think October a lot.

1179
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,100
They also do a fright fest.

1180
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,320
I don't think you could trademark the phrase fright fest.

1181
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:53,900
No.

1182
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,120
But I'm sure started…

1183
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:57,820
I was little…

1184
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:03,060
I've not been able to quite suss out because I kept seeing conflicting things.

1185
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:06,620
Because Six Flags at least had partial ownership.

1186
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:12,440
But some reviews I read or watched or read about this park was like,

1187
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:16,420
well, it never got official Six Flags branding.

1188
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,220
Okay.

1189
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:22,280
A former owner sold their shares to Six Flags.

1190
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,100
Seven years of Six Flags.

1191
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:26,620
And then Six Flags, like, no, they were good.

1192
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:27,980
They're on wild waves.

1193
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:33,400
I think they got out of Six Flags probably at good timing because it was during…

1194
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:37,400
When Dan Snyder, who used to own the…

1195
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,700
Is it the Washington Commanders now?

1196
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:42,080
Formerly the Washington football team.

1197
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,740
Formerly a much more unpleasant name.

1198
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:48,900
He kind of ran Six Flags into the ground for a while.

1199
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:54,160
And so they like just missed like that.

1200
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,260
No, I think he did.

1201
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,840
I think he was the owner then.

1202
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:03,640
And this was part of like getting rid of their massive debt was selling off a bunch at that time.

1203
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:06,080
Because they owned a bunch of odd like…

1204
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:07,720
This is one.

1205
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:11,540
Frontier City in Oklahoma City.

1206
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,640
Elitch Gardens in Denver, which is a place I was thinking about going to.

1207
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,240
Can I do a quick little mini rant here?

1208
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,660
Because there's that.

1209
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:33,440
And then there is the main attraction to me, the newly reopened Casa Bonita.

1210
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,040
Do you know about Casa Bonita?

1211
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:38,400
It was in a South Park episode.

1212
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:41,800
It's this crazy giant Mexican restaurant that's kind of a theme park too.

1213
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:46,300
That has cliff divers and little human beings that jump into the cliff diving site.

1214
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,840
And it was so specific in the South Park episode 20 years ago

1215
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,620
that everyone was like, but did they make that up?

1216
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:00,100
What is it?

1217
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:00,880
Yeah, it is real.

1218
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:01,500
It's real.

1219
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:02,800
It's this big Denver fix.

1220
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,760
And I'm like, oh, if we could go.

1221
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:10,760
And maybe I even do my anniversary, my 10 year wedding anniversary at Casa Bonita.

1222
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:11,260
Yes.

1223
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:15,020
It was purchased by the way by Matt and Trey from South Park.

1224
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:15,620
Okay.

1225
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:16,520
They bought it and renovated it.

1226
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,520
I love that.

1227
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,540
Yeah, they bought the restaurant.

1228
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,720
They saved the restaurant.

1229
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:20,740
Yeah, because it was going to close.

1230
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,100
Good.

1231
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:22,360
Then I started that.

1232
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,900
So I even bought plane tickets.

1233
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,000
I'm going Denver.

1234
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:27,600
We're going to Elitch Gardens and we're going to let's go baby.

1235
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:28,300
Yeah.

1236
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:34,460
But then I realized then I saw somebody, a friend of mine, Joe say, all right,

1237
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:40,060
at last my year long wait in the Casa Bonita lottery has finished.

1238
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:40,520
Oh my word.

1239
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:44,120
Now just to scramble and get plane tickets so I can be in the city.

1240
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,780
And I checked with a couple people about this.

1241
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,280
Doug Jones, you went to Casa Bonita.

1242
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:49,660
Right.

1243
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:50,840
Now I've gotten the answer.

1244
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,600
It is an insane lottery that takes a year to play out.

1245
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,920
There's no way to know when they'll tell you you're up.

1246
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,040
Oh.

1247
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,740
And then you might never hear anything again.

1248
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:06,140
Really?

1249
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,980
I almost went to the city and then just walked up to the door.

1250
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,980
Hello, I'm ready to be here now.

1251
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,820
You have a year of waiting to do.

1252
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,580
This might be, I complain about Disney booking and reservations and all this.

1253
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:18,020
Yeah.

1254
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:21,920
Casa Bonita might be the most difficult place to get into in the world.

1255
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:22,640
That's cool.

1256
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:23,500
In the world.

1257
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,240
More than Club 33.

1258
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:26,180
All of it.

1259
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:32,660
I hate to burst your bubble even more, but LH Gardens days might be numbered as well.

1260
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:33,820
It's one that's changed.

1261
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:35,080
They're open this summer.

1262
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:35,520
Changed.

1263
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,760
They are open this summer.

1264
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:48,420
of course, like apartments and mixed-use shopping and all that.

1265
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:49,560
Silver plants.

1266
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:56,100
I think it's kind of falling apart, but it does have, do you know about Beowulf, Ashley?

1267
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,740
It's kind of like a theme parky art group.

1268
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:06,220
They have installations in, I think, Texas and Vegas.

1269
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:14,320
We went to the Omega Martin Vegas and they were given like free rain.

1270
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:19,580
They and a ride company redid a ride at LH Gardens.

1271
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:27,780
So there's like an oddball psychedelic ride in the middle of a theme park that is kind of seen better date.

1272
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,160
I know.

1273
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,000
That's the other thing.

1274
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:31,540
I'm looking at this website like this doesn't seem that good.

1275
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:35,720
And if I can't even go to the greatest restaurant on earth, then what am I doing?

1276
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,560
So I'm curious if any of-

1277
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:42,040
Do you think there's like a underground, you know, market situation?

1278
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:42,900
I don't know.

1279
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,040
Maybe an email.

1280
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:50,700
Saying, you know, I'm a influencer in the theme park podcast space.

1281
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:51,860
I love that idea.

1282
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:52,900
I don't think it'd help me one bit.

1283
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,600
I sent the cockiest email, like happy to tell you more about our listenership, how many people.

1284
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,740
I don't think anything's happening here.

1285
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:03,320
Listeners and people have asked, like do a Casabonita episode.

1286
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,340
I'm like, if only it were that simple.

1287
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,760
This is a whole process.

1288
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:07,280
I'm sorry.

1289
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,340
I didn't know that.

1290
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:09,920
No, that's cool.

1291
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:13,000
I'm going to have to go leave and mope for about 15 minutes.

1292
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:16,700
I want to see these cliff divers so bad.

1293
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:17,620
Yeah.

1294
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:17,860
Yeah.

1295
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:18,360
Anyway.

1296
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,300
That's a bummer to hear.

1297
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:19,660
It sucks.

1298
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:20,280
Apologies.

1299
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,780
I saw the word Elitch Gardens and things.

1300
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:22,640
And you were sad you were triggered.

1301
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,840
I had to complain about this.

1302
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,800
And your anniversary is this year.

1303
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:26,220
Yeah.

1304
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:26,620
Dang it.

1305
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,500
Get another 10 year anniversary.

1306
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:31,320
I have to spend it at an annoying restaurant for children.

1307
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:32,300
I hear you.

1308
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,740
What am I doing if I don't do that?

1309
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:34,880
You got to do 15.

1310
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:36,620
It's going to have to wait for 15.

1311
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:38,320
Tell your partner we got it.

1312
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,720
10 year doesn't matter.

1313
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:40,440
15's a new.

1314
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:49,560
Ashley, so when you were there, do you remember, was there a teacher present when you would take

1315
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,380
a field trip?

1316
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:56,440
What were the ways in which you were allowed to explore?

1317
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,980
They just said go have fun.

1318
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:01,780
Would kids break off into little groups as well?

1319
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:02,360
Yes.

1320
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,660
I remember it would always be we'd go with our groups.

1321
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:11,120
We'd have our adult in charge, our chaperone or whatever.

1322
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:17,620
And then we'd get there and then we'd immediately have to go put our belongings in a locker.

1323
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:22,780
And then I remember we were free to roam the park.

1324
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:26,440
And then we'd have to come back by whatever time for lunch.

1325
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:29,160
And then we'd get to roam the park again.

1326
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:36,040
And when we were roaming though, I remember breaking off into our subgroups,

1327
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:42,320
little friend groups, which was always kind of nerve wracking because you want to,

1328
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:50,880
well, I don't know, for me, I was always like, am I going to be in the cool kids friend group?

1329
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:54,840
Because they seem like they're having the most fun at the park.

1330
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,700
Well, there's politics to it.

1331
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:58,380
For sure.

1332
00:59:58,540 --> 00:59:59,160
When you're a kid.

1333
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:03,340
And then it's also like maybe you're friends with a couple people,

1334
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:05,540
but they're not in the same friend group either.

1335
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:08,780
And then you're like, kids want status.

1336
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:11,960
You're like, I'd rather go with my friend who's in the cooler group.

1337
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:15,080
But then you might be letting another person down.

1338
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,560
You're absolutely right.

1339
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:20,640
So it's stressful in that way because that would always, you would run into that.

1340
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:21,140
Yeah.

1341
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:28,040
I remember that exact situation numerous times because I was pretty, you know, fun kid.

1342
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:32,400
I had lots of different friends, all different kinds of friends.

1343
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,900
But there were the cool kids, quote unquote, which were usually like the rich kids.

1344
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:39,800
That's what makes you cool.

1345
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:40,380
Money makes you cool.

1346
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:43,560
But were they really that cool, you know, now that I think about it?

1347
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,200
They're actually pretty boring.

1348
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:55,480
But we would like, you know, once I had my like set group of friends, we like weren't worried.

1349
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,420
But I did have one friend who was like liked by the cool kids.

1350
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:02,180
So she would get pulled off into the cool kids group.

1351
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:08,240
And then like she'd be leaving our like BFF group, our subgroup, you know.

1352
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,980
And splitting the time.

1353
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:12,960
Then we'd get like lost and separated.

1354
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:18,420
And then it was always, yeah, it was weird like passing your friend at the park who you're like,

1355
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:21,720
hey, are you not with us?

1356
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,500
Isn't that cool?

1357
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,260
We're not going to the warming tubs.

1358
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:30,680
Just all go to the warming tubs.

1359
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:31,640
Yeah.

1360
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:35,520
But yeah, I had my set, my BFFs.

1361
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:39,300
Like I've had the same friends since sixth grade.

1362
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:39,660
Oh, yeah.

1363
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:41,140
Like my, yeah.

1364
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,660
So that's interesting.

1365
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:45,220
Well, sort of.

1366
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,620
Well, I won't get into that.

1367
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:54,340
Anyway, I had the same friends for about 25 years, over 25 years, the same like group of friends.

1368
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:56,000
That's cool.

1369
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,640
So that was very long.

1370
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,260
But yeah, we would.

1371
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:05,340
Yeah, it was like there was a there was a social component to it.

1372
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,820
Yeah, it is makes me cringe sometimes when I think about it.

1373
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:11,000
Yeah, like I think I was like upset people.

1374
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:16,460
Like, because I don't know that I ever acted honorably in those situations.

1375
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,900
I don't know if I ever was like, hey, we can all just hang out together.

1376
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:21,700
I was more like, I want to go with the Pritz and Kula.

1377
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:24,640
I always chose the worst option.

1378
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,620
I think I always just gave in to whatever.

1379
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:34,200
Well, yeah, on some level, I guess, betrayed, but always like, feel like I probably was a coward

1380
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,560
and didn't try to.

1381
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:42,540
It's hard to speak up and do that at that age.

1382
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:44,300
It's like everything's on the line.

1383
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:47,780
Yeah, I remember I have really weird stuff will hit me at five.

1384
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:48,820
I wake up at five a.

1385
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:48,920
m.

1386
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:52,700
And I'll just be like, remember when you accidentally called a kid's name

1387
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:55,880
and you thought you wanted to hang out in like the playground?

1388
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,640
And then he like you told him, no, you met these other kids.

1389
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,260
And he looks so sad.

1390
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:03,160
And he was a kid who walked around alone at recess.

1391
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,120
Oh, my gosh.

1392
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,700
Why didn't you just say like, hey, we can play.

1393
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:06,640
Don't worry about it.

1394
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,240
Like, let's have a good like that.

1395
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:10,080
Like stuff like that will haunt me once in a while.

1396
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:11,080
Sure, sure, sure.

1397
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,920
And I'll be like, oh, God, like it's always five a.

1398
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:14,040
m.

1399
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:14,600
too.

1400
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,060
You're mixing things up.

1401
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,040
That happened with us.

1402
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:20,120
No, I met the other Jason.

1403
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:22,560
No, I met Jason Aldean.

1404
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:26,440
What I would sell you off for Jason Aldean in two seconds.

1405
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,280
Son of a bitch.

1406
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:27,900
I knew it.

1407
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:28,800
It's just reality, man.

1408
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:32,240
He's the coolest singer, country singer.

1409
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:33,860
I know it goes rock.

1410
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:38,920
I'm never going to Nashville with you now.

1411
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:42,560
I would give up this podcast to hang out with Springsteen.

1412
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,580
I'm sorry.

1413
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,800
He already has a podcast partner.

1414
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:50,120
I know former president Barack Obama.

1415
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:50,800
I know.

1416
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:54,660
But if they would add me to that podcast, I will.

1417
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:55,740
Three renegades.

1418
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,920
The three renegades, Barack, Bruce and Michael.

1419
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,940
Did I ever tell you my Bruce story?

1420
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:01,820
No, no, I wouldn't do this.

1421
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,060
So off topic.

1422
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,100
No, please.

1423
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:04,700
So off topic.

1424
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:05,500
Ron is on the topic.

1425
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,500
I'm so sorry to give it.

1426
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:13,400
So my ex-boyfriend went on stage with Bruce Springsteen.

1427
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:16,540
He's like a huge Springsteen fan.

1428
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:21,000
He has been to countless, like every concert he tries to make.

1429
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:29,360
And so when he was here, this had to have been, I guess, 2017,

1430
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,540
right, or 18 or something.

1431
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:37,280
And he had three concerts right before the LA dome closed.

1432
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,300
He was like the last person to perform.

1433
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:40,060
The sports arena.

1434
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:40,700
Yes, yes.

1435
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:41,820
I was at two of those.

1436
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:42,440
Yes.

1437
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:44,380
Might have seen this dancing.

1438
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:44,940
Maybe I did.

1439
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,360
You probably did.

1440
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:50,040
So we went for our anniversary, and then he went again the next night.

1441
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:55,080
So the night that I went, I touched Bruce Springsteen and held his hand

1442
01:04:55,080 --> 01:05:01,680
because he came out around and my ex-boyfriend lifted me up to reach and grab his hand.

1443
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,160
And I touched and we held hands for a little bit.

1444
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,940
And he sang to me.

1445
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,500
Looked you in the eyes?

1446
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:08,620
Looked me in the eyes.

1447
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,220
Sweaty face and all.

1448
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:15,860
And then he went back the next night and brought a sign that said,

1449
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:20,060
dancing is a man's man's job or something like that.

1450
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:20,720
Okay.

1451
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:24,260
It had his face in the center.

1452
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,060
A man's man's job.

1453
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:26,640
Oh, maybe it's dancing is a…

1454
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:33,000
Well, because during that song, dancing in the dark, he usually brings up a lady on stage.

1455
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:34,260
Like the Courtney Cox video.

1456
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:36,200
Courtney Cox video, yeah.

1457
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:40,680
And so he was saying that he could be also somewhat different.

1458
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:40,860
Right.

1459
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:41,960
Doesn't need to just be a girl.

1460
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:42,880
I'll dance with you, Bruce.

1461
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,060
I'll think I can be Courtney.

1462
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:44,780
I love that.

1463
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:45,580
Exactly.

1464
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:46,960
And he went to the front.

1465
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:52,880
And so this is where I learned all about the how to get to the pool, the front section,

1466
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:53,200
all that stuff.

1467
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,080
You have to be in the lottery.

1468
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:55,160
You have to be in the lottery.

1469
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,260
And we did that.

1470
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:00,700
But so he got pulled up by Bruce Springsteen.

1471
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:05,800
And not only that, he gave him a guitar to play.

1472
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:06,840
Wow.

1473
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,820
And they played together.

1474
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:10,220
Did he play guitar?

1475
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:11,500
No.

1476
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:16,860
He doesn't play guitar, but he is a comedian and an improviser.

1477
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,000
And so he just pretended to play.

1478
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,280
And then Bruce looked at him and goes, you're good.

1479
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:25,860
And then…

1480
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:27,140
Is it on YouTube?

1481
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:28,280
If you figured that out?

1482
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,660
It has to be on YouTube.

1483
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:30,660
I'm sure it's on YouTube.

1484
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,080
I have seen this.

1485
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:35,440
And I can't remember if it was the one show I didn't go to or I saw it

1486
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,440
because it was probably just on Instagram and I saw it.

1487
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:39,080
Probably.

1488
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,620
It kind of went medium viral a little bit.

1489
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:47,880
He got interviewed by some news stations after.

1490
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:52,640
He's from New Jersey and his whole family is Big Bruce people.

1491
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:58,200
And so this was a huge, huge deal for him.

1492
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,700
He was sick for days afterwards, just on a high, so excited.

1493
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,620
This is everything to him.

1494
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:09,040
And then you kicked him to the curb.

1495
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,800
That's what ended it.

1496
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:11,560
All right.

1497
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,060
Well, just kidding.

1498
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:17,800
No, I was so happy for him, but we did break up later, but not right away.

1499
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:19,140
Way later.

1500
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:19,640
Sure.

1501
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:20,820
It wasn't that he was…

1502
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:21,640
It was with Bruce related.

1503
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:22,380
Just to be clear.

1504
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:22,940
It wasn't.

1505
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:26,020
Yeah, he only called you Bruce from then on.

1506
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:27,120
Bruce or me.

1507
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:31,680
He was sick at work the next day, I remember.

1508
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:34,600
Just so elevated.

1509
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:36,180
Didn't sleep by that.

1510
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:36,780
It was too much to…

1511
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:40,200
Like a kid getting too excited and then just throwing up out of work.

1512
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:41,020
Yeah, he threw up at work.

1513
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:46,240
I don't blame him.

1514
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:46,660
It was so great.

1515
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:50,020
Do you think that happens with the character Courtney Cox played in the music video?

1516
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,140
That's the epilogue that you don't get to see of the post-high vomit.

1517
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:56,700
Yeah, you are in withdrawal.

1518
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,280
He's got so much charisma when you get away from it.

1519
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,740
Yeah, that's what happened when Jason and I met him at the book signing.

1520
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:05,140
We threw up the next day.

1521
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:07,360
Depression, it's real.

1522
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:08,100
It was depression.

1523
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:09,440
You need to get treated for it.

1524
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:10,680
There's no shame in it.

1525
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:11,240
There's no stigma.

1526
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:15,900
It wasn't the eight hours in the chaotic, poorly managed groove.

1527
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,880
No, we've talked about that part.

1528
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:19,020
Oh, what happened there?

1529
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:19,940
No, it's a long…

1530
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:21,560
We waited for like eight hours.

1531
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,600
Say it again, you motherfucker.

1532
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:28,240
Fluctuating temp picture.

1533
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:28,420
Mine was a joke.

1534
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:29,120
This was for the book.

1535
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,120
I appreciate it because it was a joke.

1536
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,580
He wanted to retell the story.

1537
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:32,760
It's Jason's fault.

1538
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:35,780
He had a book signing at the Grove.

1539
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:37,520
Yeah, he went in his memoir.

1540
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,940
And it was sort of just a photo op.

1541
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,580
It's like a Pooh Bear.

1542
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:41,360
It was at Disneyland.

1543
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:42,960
And you just kind of walked in there.

1544
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:44,660
You walked in and took a photo with him.

1545
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:47,620
The most, maybe the most security I've ever been around.

1546
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:48,200
Wow.

1547
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:50,100
Is that true?

1548
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:54,480
In terms of like, keep moving, watch out.

1549
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:56,620
They were, yeah, his handlers, they had real handlers.

1550
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:58,480
The handlers were really intense.

1551
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:02,760
So, how long has it been actually since you went to Wild Waves?

1552
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:02,980
Oh my gosh.

1553
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:04,220
When was the last year?

1554
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,160
No, I don't even.

1555
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,560
So, I would go with school numerous times, I remember.

1556
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:14,960
And then some friends had birthday parties at Wild Waves.

1557
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:16,480
So, that was a thing too.

1558
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,360
So, I'd been for a few birthday parties there.

1559
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:22,240
Which were, those were easier, I will say.

1560
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:28,880
But yeah, I don't, I would not even remember.

1561
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:29,380
It's been a while.

1562
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,580
It's been years, years and years.

1563
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:32,240
Yeah.

1564
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,320
My question, and I don't know when this was implemented,

1565
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:38,420
but I was looking at the website and you can buy,

1566
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:41,280
I wonder if this is for birthdays or what,

1567
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:43,840
you can buy, as if it's a Las Vegas pool,

1568
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:46,900
you can buy cabanas and rent them.

1569
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:47,660
Fancy.

1570
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,060
At Wild Waves, I don't know if this is.

1571
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,400
Where are they located?

1572
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,920
I think this is common for water parks.

1573
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:53,320
Is it?

1574
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:54,200
No.

1575
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:58,320
But I don't know, I mean, I think there's probably a dozen of them.

1576
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,140
When I say common, there's a handful of parks that have that.

1577
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:02,720
Well, it looks like there are 19 according to this map.

1578
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,340
Oh my gosh, how much are they?

1579
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:04,940
How much is this?

1580
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:07,320
Well, you have to call for pricing apparently.

1581
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:08,020
Yeah, yeah.

1582
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:08,760
It's probably dynamic.

1583
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,140
They don't want to say what the bottle service costs.

1584
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:12,600
Yeah.

1585
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:17,000
But they do give you 25 or 50% off if you're a season pass holder.

1586
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:17,580
Really?

1587
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:18,300
Yes.

1588
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,800
And they're all around this wave pool.

1589
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:21,760
Oh, gosh.

1590
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:22,280
So.

1591
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:22,680
Nightmares.

1592
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:24,840
And probably you can see a little bit of I-5 too.

1593
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:27,360
Prime I-5 view.

1594
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,260
Maybe you don't want a cabana because the walls

1595
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:30,940
block the I-5 view.

1596
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:36,040
So yeah, it sounds like you were not having a birthday in the cabana.

1597
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:37,220
No, we didn't do.

1598
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:43,380
I would be interested to know how many of these are filled on any day.

1599
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:45,900
I'm curious how much a ticket is these days.

1600
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,500
Oh, well that I think you can find on here.

1601
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:56,160
That is one where it seems like by the season pass because it's the same or less than one day.

1602
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:59,800
We don't have that many days of sunshine in Seattle.

1603
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:08,520
It seems like the park alternates between really empty and understaffed or totally packed

1604
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,060
and also understaffed.

1605
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:11,400
That sounds accurate.

1606
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:21,220
There's a lot of to this sucks shit end that Diddy Thump referred to.

1607
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:25,960
Where you'll end up waiting in a food line for an hour.

1608
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:30,940
Barely moves and then you get up to the front and like one hot dog.

1609
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:32,980
Sorry, we are out of hot dogs.

1610
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,660
I don't remember the food being good at all.

1611
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:37,360
Yeah.

1612
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:38,140
Is there any.

1613
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:39,380
That's not what you're there for, I guess.

1614
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:44,780
These days or back then, do you have like a go to like of crappy theme park food,

1615
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:48,200
like a corn dog or like is there a thing you gravitate towards?

1616
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,560
I'm a I'm a plain old chicken tenders gal.

1617
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,940
I love barbecue sauce and I love french fries.

1618
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:58,800
It's my favorite food as an adult woman.

1619
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:07,580
So, you know, take me to a park and give me fries and nuggies and I am a happy camper.

1620
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,060
Very reliable, but also very sick.

1621
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:13,720
Like I don't think nuggies have ever made me sick.

1622
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:14,260
Oh, right.

1623
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:15,000
Nuggies.

1624
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:16,540
I don't think it ever fucked me up.

1625
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:18,400
This is a virus you've passed on.

1626
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,980
This is what it's going to be on the park as forever now, isn't it?

1627
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:22,120
Tendies and nuggies.

1628
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,260
Tendies and nuggies.

1629
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:23,760
Yeah.

1630
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:24,440
It's so cute though.

1631
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:28,380
Nothing.

1632
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:30,060
God, you're the weird one.

1633
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:38,720
Yeah, they're so good and you can always like if you're dizzy, like they'll it'll sit in your

1634
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:39,040
stomach.

1635
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:39,520
They will calm.

1636
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:40,360
It'll calm it.

1637
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,360
Give you a little protein.

1638
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:42,540
Comfort food.

1639
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,040
Comfort food for sure.

1640
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:49,080
They seem to have something at Wild Waves that I've never heard of before that might be like a

1641
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,740
fair thing or a theme park thing.

1642
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,740
I've just never seen it, which is elephant ears.

1643
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:54,500
Oh, yeah.

1644
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,760
I was going to ask about elephant ears.

1645
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:00,640
Is that a Pacific Northwest thing?

1646
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:01,420
I don't know.

1647
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:02,160
Is it?

1648
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:06,920
Because a lot of the things, I looked at a couple of the area theme parks and they all

1649
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:13,380
mentioned elephant ears, which is flat fry bread, usually cinnamon sugar, sometimes fruit

1650
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:15,160
topping or whipped cream or stuff.

1651
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:23,360
That was like a highlight.

1652
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:25,680
We'd be like, oh, yeah, let's get elephant ears.

1653
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:26,840
You know, that kind of thing.

1654
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:31,700
But I don't remember them being at Wild Waves, but maybe it is a Pacific Northwest thing.

1655
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:33,340
But it's they're so good.

1656
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:38,340
It's just like, yeah, like you said, fried dough with cinnamon sugar, freaking.

1657
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:43,960
It looks like it's in like the non zone, but like, but like a non funnel cake.

1658
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:44,940
It's like funnel cake.

1659
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:48,760
Yeah, I was just gonna say funnel cake, beignet territory.

1660
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,280
I'd like to try it.

1661
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:51,980
Looks like a beignet.

1662
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:54,940
Like funnel cake is often like, I can't finish.

1663
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:56,340
Like this is too much.

1664
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:00,000
But beignets or like elephant ears.

1665
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,040
Similarly, it's like this feels very manageable.

1666
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:05,120
I think I could put one or two of these down pretty easy.

1667
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:07,460
Funnel cake is the size of like a human brain.

1668
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:09,080
Yeah.

1669
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:12,060
And these seem like they're a little more like a pop tart.

1670
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:12,800
Right.

1671
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:13,700
Or are they bigger?

1672
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:16,780
I remember bigger, like at least a plate full of them.

1673
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:17,160
Okay.

1674
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:17,760
Yeah.

1675
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:21,140
I'm also finding maybe these are the same as beaver tails.

1676
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:23,200
And I feel like beaver tails has come up before.

1677
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:28,440
Perhaps what's in my head is lagoon with Stephen Ray Morris, a Utah park.

1678
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:30,300
So maybe we do different.

1679
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,280
Beaver tails is very popular in Canada.

1680
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:37,860
Used to be in Epcot, the Canada Pavilion in Epcot.

1681
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:38,320
Right.

1682
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,380
And they think occasionally come back.

1683
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:41,880
I don't know if they're back at the moment.

1684
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,420
It's like, what shape do you want your fried dough in?

1685
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:44,820
Yeah.

1686
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:48,280
Depending on what part of America you live in.

1687
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:50,880
See this picture how it takes up the whole plate.

1688
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,280
Oh, it is bigger than I thought.

1689
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:52,640
Yeah.

1690
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:52,820
Yeah.

1691
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:53,000
The candy.

1692
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,200
It's like a plate's worth of dough.

1693
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,720
You're showing us some pretty big elephant ears.

1694
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:03,900
But that might be deceptive then because if it's like three,

1695
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,980
it's more three dimensional with a funnel cake.

1696
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:09,940
And then this is almost like the size of a loose leaf sheet of paper.

1697
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:10,500
Yeah.

1698
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:11,280
But thicker.

1699
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:12,360
Right.

1700
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,460
So you might be getting a similar amount of dough.

1701
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,340
Oh, I see.

1702
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:16,900
I don't know.

1703
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:17,660
Maybe I'm wrong.

1704
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:18,000
I could.

1705
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:21,000
I guess it depends because obviously there's probably different size funnel cakes.

1706
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:24,420
You can probably depending on what machine you have,

1707
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:25,740
what funnel cake making machine.

1708
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:26,440
OK.

1709
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:27,980
I'm looking at funnel cake.

1710
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:29,480
You have recommendations.

1711
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,340
I assume you both have funnel cake machines.

1712
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:32,860
OK.

1713
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:33,980
Look at this image of funnel cake.

1714
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:37,440
Sony XR27 I think is the strongest right now.

1715
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:43,340
I was just comparing funnel cake versus elephant ear.

1716
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:43,740
OK.

1717
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:49,360
And it's basically like just a flat version of a funnel cake.

1718
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:53,900
Like funnel cake is I didn't realize or process really.

1719
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:57,180
It's a bunch of dough like squiggled around.

1720
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:59,940
Squiggly squiggled around.

1721
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:01,440
So rises a little more.

1722
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:02,440
Squirt it out.

1723
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:04,140
Like kind of.

1724
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:04,620
Yeah.

1725
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:06,160
I don't actually know how it's made.

1726
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,100
I should know that.

1727
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:11,180
But yeah, it's I guess it's just whatever.

1728
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:15,980
I don't know who invented these brilliant food inventions,

1729
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:17,780
but it is just the shape.

1730
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:21,000
Yeah.

1731
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,460
Those losers we have now.

1732
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:22,940
Yeah.

1733
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:25,600
Well, it should be a Mount Rushmore made out of funnel cake.

1734
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:28,340
Take a bite out of the founding fathers.

1735
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:32,960
The other thing I saw that Wild Waves had obviously, yeah,

1736
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,960
we were saying pizza, hot dogs, dip and dots as a present.

1737
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:39,340
They also have Korean style.

1738
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:40,100
Yeah, they do.

1739
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:42,420
It surprised me.

1740
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:44,280
Those are really fun.

1741
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:50,000
Because they put things on the outside like potato flakes or like hunks of stuff.

1742
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:53,300
The picture makes it look like it's completely plastic fake food,

1743
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:55,340
but that might just be the way they photographed it.

1744
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:59,740
But yes, I was that everything else is pretty standard theme park stuff.

1745
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:04,640
I read reviews saying that that seemed to be an outside vendor,

1746
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:08,900
and thus the superior quality to everything else.

1747
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:09,200
Okay.

1748
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,140
You could eat in the park.

1749
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:12,840
So there's a tip if you end up in Wild Waves.

1750
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:15,360
It is very funny with most theme parks.

1751
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:19,660
Outside vendor either means you're in luck, it's going to be a lot better,

1752
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:22,360
or it's like, oh, that's really shitty,

1753
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:28,320
and the park has plausible detiability because they can go outside vendor, outside vendor.

1754
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:29,980
Are they even here?

1755
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:31,140
We didn't even see them set up.

1756
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:32,120
Yeah.

1757
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:37,740
So it looks, yeah, everything else, not that these are that interesting.

1758
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:42,940
There's Carousel Cafe, there's Lumberjack Burgers, there's The Wharf, there's Disco.

1759
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:47,040
The Wharf, what specifically says hamburgers and chicken.

1760
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:49,260
It's not a fish restaurant.

1761
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,380
What do you assume?

1762
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:53,200
The Wharf says chicken tenders, burgers, and hot dogs.

1763
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:01,880
Yeah, that's easy.

1764
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:03,780
No, dad doesn't want that.

1765
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:07,200
Disco eats and cool treats.

1766
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:08,180
What?

1767
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:09,500
Disco.

1768
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:10,760
All over the place.

1769
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:15,580
The theming is not necessarily rooted in the concept.

1770
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:21,420
I think they sell, there's a place called Sharky's Bar.

1771
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:24,580
And there is a fun, I don't think I have it.

1772
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:27,620
Oh, Shakey's, nevermind.

1773
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:28,220
No, there's Sharky's.

1774
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:30,300
There is Sharky's and Shakey's.

1775
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:32,660
I think it's kind of a generic.

1776
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:37,060
And there is a fun shark on the outside, but I can't blow up the photo to show everyone.

1777
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:38,760
But trust me, he's cool.

1778
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:39,720
He's fine.

1779
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:40,480
He's fine.

1780
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:46,060
The other thing I have to, I built into a hill, right, this park.

1781
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:54,300
And so like the amusement park side is kind of there's stuff like in wooded areas.

1782
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:55,460
Yes, it's all wooded.

1783
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,820
And that's very pleasing and then very, very nice.

1784
01:18:57,860 --> 01:19:03,180
But also due to the hill part, I noticed some pictures or videos where people just like

1785
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:08,960
put their towels down on some grass strips and just like we're hanging out.

1786
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:16,740
And I'm like, I see the appeal of that, but it also just seems a little sleazy.

1787
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:24,680
Feel like there's a line between like, oh, this is pleasant using the landscaping.

1788
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:27,860
But then it's also just like, we couldn't get a chance.

1789
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:29,460
Throw the towel in the cooler.

1790
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:32,280
The cabanas are for the elites.

1791
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:33,780
They're not cost effective.

1792
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:39,120
I think man of the people, Jason Sheridan would be all for the towel on the grass.

1793
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:41,000
Well, I am.

1794
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:47,960
I think what it is, the lagoon like at the entrance doesn't have any, like the plants

1795
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,300
are very small.

1796
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:53,700
Like it looks a little like they just put it in, which is not the case.

1797
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:54,260
Yeah.

1798
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:58,300
If I can bring a little towel and put it on the grass, I will be in your movie, Mr.

1799
01:19:58,580 --> 01:19:58,680
Noe.

1800
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:00,540
Oh, Chris.

1801
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,020
Yeah, Chris, I'm bringing something.

1802
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,100
I need to crash a little.

1803
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:08,400
They have a, I don't know if they had this when we were kids.

1804
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:10,620
They have a season pass dining plan.

1805
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:16,500
Which is very similar to the thing they stopped kind of doing at Six Flags where you can pay

1806
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:18,800
$75 for the year.

1807
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:19,440
What?

1808
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:25,640
It's maybe, yeah, you know, there was a thing where Six Flags Magic Mountain offered

1809
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:28,660
something like this and there was somebody out there who was like, great, that will be

1810
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:30,800
how I have every meal from now on.

1811
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:31,540
Bro.

1812
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:35,880
And they wish, you know, if you're purely financially, you know, if you could do that

1813
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:41,440
here, if you could spend, if you had to go back and live in stinky Tacoma, I don't know

1814
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:43,080
what picture I'm painting of your life.

1815
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:44,740
You got to be in Tacoma.

1816
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:54,660
That would, oh, I feel like you would.

1817
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:54,740
This.

1818
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:56,020
What would happen to your body?

1819
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:56,440
Oh, gosh.

1820
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,180
What deposits would start forming in your.

1821
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:00,020
I read this dining plan, though.

1822
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:01,140
It's a lot of research.

1823
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:02,780
You read the fine print on the contract.

1824
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:03,460
I read the fine print.

1825
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:04,040
What is that?

1826
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:08,480
I believe it's one meal and one snack a day.

1827
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,660
And there's like, cannot be used.

1828
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:11,400
One?

1829
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:12,140
Yeah.

1830
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:14,760
So what's about the rest of the family?

1831
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,240
No, no, one per person.

1832
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:17,880
Oh, okay.

1833
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:22,080
If each person had the dining plan, they can get like one meal, one snack because they're

1834
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,440
like, they're not camping out for multiple meals.

1835
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:30,400
So you're saying one plan per person for $75 for the year.

1836
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:33,920
So I'd have to buy one for my three kids as well.

1837
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:34,600
Yes, you would.

1838
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:35,720
Yeah.

1839
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:36,680
Robbery.

1840
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:43,540
But then also like, cannot be used at Soul Corn Dogs, cannot be used here.

1841
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:44,840
You can't get Dippin' Dots with it either.

1842
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:45,880
You can't get Dippin' Dots.

1843
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:48,640
That's a vendor.

1844
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:50,000
That's an outside vendor.

1845
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:50,580
Oh.

1846
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,540
Espresso on the go coffee truck?

1847
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:52,960
No.

1848
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:53,400
No.

1849
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,480
Where are my kids going to get their needed dots?

1850
01:21:58,660 --> 01:21:59,660
My kids can't get dots.

1851
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:00,520
They can't get espresso.

1852
01:22:00,740 --> 01:22:01,660
What's going on here?

1853
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,760
This is not a good dining plan.

1854
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:07,680
I wonder if maybe I should buy this by Wild Waves.

1855
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:08,580
Buy the park?

1856
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:09,320
Yeah.

1857
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:09,800
It seems good.

1858
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:18,760
Well, not now, obviously, but in the future, invest in the amusement park.

1859
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:19,620
Industry in general?

1860
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:20,180
Yeah.

1861
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:26,760
And see, granted, most of the previous owners have sold this place after several years,

1862
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:29,060
but maybe you're the one to take it all the way.

1863
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:42,120
You can get like earlier, as we're recording this, a few days ago it was announced,

1864
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:48,860
oh, this historic theater in Westwood, 30 filmmakers banded together and are taking it over,

1865
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:52,200
which I'm not quite sure of the economics of that.

1866
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:52,720
I saw that.

1867
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:53,720
I just read that.

1868
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:57,780
Well, Quentin Tarantino has bought two theaters himself at this point,

1869
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,320
and this is 30 people buying one.

1870
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:01,800
He bought the Vista too, right?

1871
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:05,340
He bought the Vista and he bought the New Beverly here in Los Angeles.

1872
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,520
You'd think Nolan wouldn't want to buy a movie theater.

1873
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:08,880
There's so many seats in there.

1874
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:12,280
Maybe he's got a plan.

1875
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:13,900
Standing room only.

1876
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,660
You don't know how to appreciate film.

1877
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:18,960
I don't think he can apply that to film viewing.

1878
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:22,200
He's on top of his game.

1879
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:24,220
He's probably going to win best picture.

1880
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,200
He could start saying whatever he wants.

1881
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:28,120
We stand in movies from now on.

1882
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:32,660
Real quick, I want to say that there's a guy who,

1883
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:34,940
a couple of guys owned the park for a couple of years,

1884
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:39,380
Michael Moodenbaugh and Jeff Stock, and we're not going to talk too much about it

1885
01:23:39,380 --> 01:23:40,380
because I looked into it a little bit.

1886
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:44,900
They also owned a place called Boblo Island Adventure Park.

1887
01:23:45,740 --> 01:23:48,200
I just caught a little look of this story.

1888
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:51,160
Apparently, they were putting a lot of money into that park

1889
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:55,960
and they were getting bands to play and very ambitious plans for it.

1890
01:23:56,360 --> 01:24:00,960
This gentleman, Michael Moodenbaugh, got into a bad car accident and went into a coma.

1891
01:24:01,420 --> 01:24:05,060
His partner and everyone completely abandoned the plans

1892
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:08,340
and switched it while he was basically out of it.

1893
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:13,300
And then he ended up suing his partners for that

1894
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:16,240
for all the things they were doing while he was in a coma.

1895
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,500
It was a complete huge trial thing.

1896
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:22,100
These are the two guys that owned this at one point.

1897
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:26,020
He ended up having Michael sell his shares.

1898
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:31,760
It just seems like an interesting story that we'll maybe investigate at a different time.

1899
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:33,260
That's very traumatic.

1900
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,660
It's very, no, it seems very traumatic.

1901
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:37,700
But I then found a picture of Michael.

1902
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:39,400
I think he made a full recovery, luckily.

1903
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,700
Here he is in a suit on a water ride.

1904
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:44,560
The dream.

1905
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:46,180
Go Michael.

1906
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:51,400
So I was like, okay, well, that's maybe we look into the place in a Boblo Island.

1907
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:54,600
Let's make a pact with each other if one of us goes into a coma,

1908
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,460
that the others will not bail on the podcast and leave town.

1909
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:04,600
I would think business as usual until the party gets out of the coma is the respectful way to go.

1910
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:09,080
If Scott goes into a coma, we're telling the Bruce Springsteen story every episode.

1911
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:11,580
Oh, no, you can finally do the show you want to do.

1912
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:14,700
Springsteen story, Buffett Plains story.

1913
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:17,620
Randy talk, Randy Gerber talk.

1914
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:20,300
Once a month, Tendi and Nungi review.

1915
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:24,280
Scott has been holding us back from putting whys on every single word

1916
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:26,040
and little before every other word.

1917
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:30,260
I'm looking through here.

1918
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:33,760
There's a vaguely patriotic zipline.

1919
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:34,580
Did we say this?

1920
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:36,620
It's called the Soaring Eagle zipline.

1921
01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:37,060
Okay.

1922
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:40,580
And it's got the bald eagle on the top of the…

1923
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,660
Our state mascot, I believe.

1924
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:44,620
Oh, the bald eagle is.

1925
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:44,940
This ties into…

1926
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:45,760
All right.

1927
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:48,980
I believe so.

1928
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:49,560
Okay.

1929
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:53,820
I believe that zipline goes from the one side of the park to the other side of the park,

1930
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:55,380
so you get a cool view.

1931
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:57,440
So that is positive.

1932
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:01,340
It's an add-on, but you get to see the water park and the amusement park.

1933
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:02,900
Scott, you'll love this.

1934
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:07,740
A number of videos I watch refer to the water park and the dry park.

1935
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:09,440
Now that's nice.

1936
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,300
So that's, I guess, more of a…

1937
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,300
And a jerk is fine.

1938
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:12,940
It's play.

1939
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:13,800
A term.

1940
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:15,040
We've discovered a word…

1941
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:17,880
There's water playgrounds in theme parks,

1942
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:21,900
and that has led to us finding the words wet play and dry play.

1943
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:22,920
Thank you.

1944
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:23,980
The correct response.

1945
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,900
Wet play.

1946
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,180
This is for parents.

1947
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:29,860
If you're bringing a family, just say,

1948
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:31,460
okay, there's wet play and there's dry play.

1949
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:32,380
No, families should…

1950
01:26:32,940 --> 01:26:35,580
Now we're pulling families into these disgusting jerks?

1951
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:35,840
No.

1952
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:37,640
Imagine asking your child…

1953
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:40,060
I want it less than ever.

1954
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:40,900
You're a wet player.

1955
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:41,400
You're a dry player.

1956
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:42,140
Hey, little boy.

1957
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,620
You're into wet play, dry play.

1958
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:44,420
Why don't you come with me?

1959
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:45,620
I'll take you over to the wet player.

1960
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:46,320
Okay.

1961
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:47,600
We have to leave the park.

1962
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:48,900
That's going off to jail.

1963
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:53,120
Everybody wants wet play.

1964
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:54,560
Surprise, surprise.

1965
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:58,220
Can't you just a weirdo that's into dry play?

1966
01:26:58,320 --> 01:26:59,380
I don't know why it's their thing.

1967
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:02,500
But I had in her dry park before.

1968
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:04,060
Dry park is fine.

1969
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:05,880
I'm fine with park.

1970
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:06,600
Wet park.

1971
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,700
Yeah, there's something that's not the same as…

1972
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:13,200
It should be wet park, but not even when that's still uncomfortable.

1973
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:13,920
Yeah, right?

1974
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,040
That is just like, yeah.

1975
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:16,320
No, it's a water park.

1976
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:17,980
We have the phrase already.

1977
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:20,900
We don't need to reinvent the wheel.

1978
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:24,320
And I guess dry park, if it's…

1979
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:27,660
Doherty Park, two great parks, one great price.

1980
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:29,740
Doherty Park and Wild Water Kingdom.

1981
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:31,580
Wet park, dry park.

1982
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:34,780
Did they give you money to do an ad in the middle of the show?

1983
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:39,400
No, it's unfortunately glued in my subconsciousness

1984
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:41,620
from watching the commercial too many times

1985
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:44,420
when there was only cable television, no computer.

1986
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:47,640
Child Jason Sheridan, though, on the way to a park

1987
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:48,900
that he's never been would be like,

1988
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:49,740
excuse me, mother of…

1989
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:54,400
Is it mostly primarily dry play today or wet play?

1990
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:59,720
Well, this is child Jason Sheridan got to hang out

1991
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:02,440
with some good friends at Hershey Park

1992
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:07,340
when the chorus of band went to do a competition

1993
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:08,440
or something there.

1994
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:12,760
And the first year discovered that his close friend

1995
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:15,100
was very scared of big rides.

1996
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:18,900
So childhood Jason was pretty pissed by that.

1997
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:23,420
So the second year, I said, see ya, and did a lot by myself,

1998
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:26,160
which you were not supposed to go off on your own.

1999
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:28,020
But enough kids were…

2000
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:33,660
If I saw a teacher, I would just look for other students

2001
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:35,940
and say, hey guys, what's going on?

2002
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:36,680
We're all in the group.

2003
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:37,880
And then the teacher would walk away.

2004
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:38,820
I was like, all right, see ya.

2005
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:42,000
You briefly pretend to have friends as cover.

2006
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:44,460
I was a pretty social guy.

2007
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:45,900
I had a lot of friends.

2008
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:47,460
I had a lot of places and friends.

2009
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:49,320
But in these days, you don't want to…

2010
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:51,580
Like friends only slow you down from getting them.

2011
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:53,580
No, I wouldn't ride a big wooden roller coaster

2012
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:54,780
and eat a chili dog.

2013
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,800
I was like Sonic the Hedgehog in that way, I suppose.

2014
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:01,240
I wanted to go fast.

2015
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:04,620
Well, I wanted to go fast.

2016
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:05,860
You wanted to go fast, but you weren't.

2017
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:07,100
Just be a roller coaster.

2018
01:29:07,420 --> 01:29:12,580
I was like a chubby Sonic the Hedgehog at 12.

2019
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:13,700
Cute.

2020
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:15,380
That is cute.

2021
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:15,800
That is cute.

2022
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:16,740
Yeah, I was cute.

2023
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:20,960
I didn't know the power I had of being cute at the time.

2024
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:22,580
Chubby, isn't it?

2025
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,480
I should have been telling my peers,

2026
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:26,820
I'm actually a little cutie.

2027
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:29,260
It's kind of adorable.

2028
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
With other kids your age,

2029
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:34,840
make fun of me if you want,

2030
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,180
but I'm actually a little cutie.

2031
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:37,200
Do you realize that?

2032
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:37,520
I'm a little cutie.

2033
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:40,480
Let's try to beat me up now.

2034
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:42,240
But it'd be all you'd like.

2035
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:45,960
I'm a big chubby and these glasses are from Sears.

2036
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:50,100
But I think when I get older, this will be pretty endearing.

2037
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:51,360
I love this, Jason.

2038
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:53,740
Little cutie.

2039
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:54,720
He's a little cutie.

2040
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:58,140
So I guess as we sort of wind down,

2041
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:59,960
Ashley, do you have any big stories,

2042
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:01,720
big memories of any of this stuff?

2043
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:03,300
You don't have to have a big story.

2044
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,080
Or do you want to go make some new ones

2045
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:06,120
now that you've revived it?

2046
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:09,120
Yeah, I kind of do want to go back now,

2047
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:13,780
but I'm like, wow, wait, what if, okay, the wet park idea,

2048
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:17,340
what if they made an amusement park for only adults?

2049
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:19,580
Sure.

2050
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:21,820
Only adults and it's all wet stuff.

2051
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:23,220
Sure.

2052
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:25,960
Yeah, you into it?

2053
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:29,140
I just want to know what definition wet is.

2054
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:34,340
It's just called wet park and it's for you specifically only.

2055
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,120
I'm uncomfortable on the surface.

2056
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:43,360
This is getting more and more popular in the dry play.

2057
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:50,580
In Vegas, I think Luxor has an adult playground with bars inside.

2058
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:52,420
You consider that dry play?

2059
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:56,520
An adult bar in a casino you would refer to as dry play.

2060
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:58,700
I agree.

2061
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:01,280
If there's a pool within 100 feet.

2062
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:03,400
The day clubs and the pools are wet play.

2063
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:07,420
But there's an adult playground with bars

2064
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:10,760
and then Manloy Bay I think is building a very elaborate

2065
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,520
miniature golf with bars.

2066
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:13,320
A miniature golf.

2067
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:15,040
It's too boring.

2068
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:17,460
These are the loosest definitions.

2069
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:22,160
Right now we're doing a dry podcast because we're not

2070
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:23,500
being liquid while we're doing it.

2071
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:24,800
So this is very popular now.

2072
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:25,820
It's dry podcast.

2073
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:27,120
Okay, okay.

2074
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:28,600
Well, yeah, wet play.

2075
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:31,860
Wet podcast is dangerous due to electrocution.

2076
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:35,380
You got to do those with satellite microphones

2077
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:36,560
that are outside of the pool,

2078
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:38,520
pointed into the pool to record that sound.

2079
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:39,340
But that's not what we're doing.

2080
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:42,160
To be clear, listeners, this is a dry podcast.

2081
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:44,940
We're not drunk currently yet.

2082
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:46,400
I have water.

2083
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:47,620
Yes, just water.

2084
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:49,460
But I don't know.

2085
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:52,020
Are you dissuaded by anything that we've told you about?

2086
01:31:53,220 --> 01:31:54,760
Are there people's opinions about this?

2087
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,260
Or if you end up up there,

2088
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:59,360
what are the odds you ever go back to Wild Waves?

2089
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,580
Well, I go back home like probably three, four times a year.

2090
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:08,040
But yeah, I'm curious to go back now

2091
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:09,580
and just see all of the updates.

2092
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:11,680
Everything that's changed.

2093
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:14,720
See if I could put my bid in to purchase the park.

2094
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:18,860
And yeah, I'll be Mrs.

2095
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:19,640
Waves.

2096
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:21,360
Oh, you'll change your name.

2097
01:32:21,420 --> 01:32:24,560
Yeah, I'll change my name to Ashley Waves.

2098
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:27,580
I think you could use that

2099
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:29,840
because we've said there's not a clear cohesive theme.

2100
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:31,120
That's what I'm saying.

2101
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:31,980
They need a theme.

2102
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:34,700
They need someone to come in and really tie things together.

2103
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:37,260
Give it a nice concept.

2104
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:39,640
It could be the face of it.

2105
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:42,880
The way you hear Dollywood, Dolly Parton's name,

2106
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:44,040
the person you think of Dolly.

2107
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:44,600
That's what I'm saying.

2108
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,240
Can you be the Dolly for this?

2109
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:47,240
I'd be Mrs.

2110
01:32:47,660 --> 01:32:47,820
Waves.

2111
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:48,300
Yeah.

2112
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:54,140
Are you just on signs or the restaurant's named after?

2113
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:56,100
It's Mrs.

2114
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:58,240
Waves, fine fried nuggies.

2115
01:32:58,320 --> 01:32:58,900
Yeah, Mrs.

2116
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:01,020
Waves, cabana, house.

2117
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:02,560
Just everything's named after you now.

2118
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:06,000
That does make it more appealing for you especially.

2119
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,320
Yeah, it's my face.

2120
01:33:07,580 --> 01:33:11,200
And then you can Google it and you'll find fun facts

2121
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:12,860
that I didn't even know how to swim

2122
01:33:12,860 --> 01:33:19,640
and I still conquered purchasing a bottle, a wet play pot.

2123
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:24,500
You'd think Mrs.

2124
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:26,940
Waves could never, from those starts,

2125
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:29,860
you'd think she'd never become the queen of wet play.

2126
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:30,920
Exactly.

2127
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:32,320
Mrs.

2128
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:34,420
Waves, the queen of wet play.

2129
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:38,140
That's what it says on the sign outside.

2130
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:38,560
Oh, yes.

2131
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:41,340
It says, come wet play with me.

2132
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:43,400
That's my slogan.

2133
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:48,980
You've got a comfort with the term, I feel like.

2134
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:52,520
I feel like you've got a plan for this place too.

2135
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:55,460
I think maybe this is what it takes to move it,

2136
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:59,180
to pass it forward to the next generation of sea tackers.

2137
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:03,300
Which, so I mean, with that, I believe,

2138
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:05,980
Ashley Crystal Hairston, you survived podcast The Ride.

2139
01:34:05,980 --> 01:34:10,700
Thank you so much for taking us to this bizarre neck of the woods

2140
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:14,080
and to space and to the Bruce show and everywhere.

2141
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:18,580
Let's exit through the gift shop because I believe there's some stuff to plug.

2142
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:22,880
Yes, what's going on in your world?

2143
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:28,920
Hey, well, you can watch Tiny Toons Luniversity.

2144
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:31,880
It's out on Macs right now.

2145
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:36,960
And keep an eye out for Fairly Odd Parents.

2146
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:37,520
Yeah.

2147
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:38,680
The reboot.

2148
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:39,920
This is just announced.

2149
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:44,020
It happens to be the morning that you're recording this with us.

2150
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:44,940
Yeah, my phone's blowing up.

2151
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:48,320
You ran this show and you're the main voice in the show.

2152
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:49,060
All right.

2153
01:34:49,140 --> 01:34:52,200
Well, there's four of us that created it.

2154
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:58,920
And I was fortunate to be a writer on it and also lend some voice acting to

2155
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,440
the new God kid.

2156
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:03,960
So very exciting.

2157
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:04,620
That's great.

2158
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:06,260
Also involved in the show.

2159
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:06,920
My love.

2160
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:10,920
I thought you said my mom.

2161
01:35:12,820 --> 01:35:15,420
Ever since we had a daughter, I haven't called like a Mike Pence style.

2162
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:16,180
I call her mother.

2163
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,740
Mother is also involved in the show.

2164
01:35:19,740 --> 01:35:20,700
Yes, yes.

2165
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:22,120
Lindsay Kata, yes.

2166
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:25,640
We're both Geminis.

2167
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:30,060
So you can imagine how wacky this this little kid will be.

2168
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,340
That's very exciting.

2169
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:35,400
You've been working on this for I don't know.

2170
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:36,420
Are you allowed to say a while?

2171
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:37,500
A long time.

2172
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:39,680
I posted that it's been two years.

2173
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:41,580
So it just takes forever.

2174
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:42,240
Yeah.

2175
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:44,640
And today this will be out fairly soon.

2176
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,340
A few weeks.

2177
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:47,640
So yeah, very exciting.

2178
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:48,440
Fairly soon.

2179
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:49,520
Fairly soon.

2180
01:35:50,380 --> 01:35:53,660
You're also Babs Bunny on Tiny Toons, I want to say.

2181
01:35:53,740 --> 01:35:54,480
I know.

2182
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:57,040
And our former guest Eric Bauza is Buster.

2183
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:57,460
Oh great.

2184
01:35:57,860 --> 01:35:58,700
Oh, were you on it?

2185
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,140
I mean, was he on it?

2186
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:01,220
Yeah, he's on here, yeah.

2187
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:02,000
Oh cool.

2188
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:03,960
Wow, we've had Buster and Babs.

2189
01:36:03,980 --> 01:36:05,360
You've had Buster and Babs.

2190
01:36:05,380 --> 01:36:05,920
Pretty cool.

2191
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:10,280
Maybe the most starstruck when I realize you two were Buster and Babs.

2192
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:11,140
That's crazy.

2193
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:12,560
My friends from childhood?

2194
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:18,560
Yeah, from our mod days.

2195
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:18,960
Yeah.

2196
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:23,580
For the listeners, Jason and I were on a mod team together at UCB Theater.

2197
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:26,280
She had a sketch knife for a number of years.

2198
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,320
Now we're on this podcast.

2199
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:29,300
Yeah.

2200
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:31,440
Pretty good.

2201
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,120
Come a long way.

2202
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:36,880
I was expelled from university due to plagiarism.

2203
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,020
Oh no.

2204
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:39,580
Oh dang.

2205
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:43,160
The dean, Taz, beat the shit out of me.

2206
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:45,620
He just spun me around.

2207
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:47,440
So you had no clothes at the end?

2208
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:48,080
You know what?

2209
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:49,140
I deserved it.

2210
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:52,080
They didn't know you were a little cutie.

2211
01:36:52,620 --> 01:36:54,460
I was trying to tell him.

2212
01:36:56,920 --> 01:36:58,000
I'm a little cutie.

2213
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:59,240
I don't think you realize that.

2214
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:02,260
You try to plead your case and they just respond with.

2215
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:05,100
It's me and Devils.

2216
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:06,040
You can't reason with them.

2217
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,000
Ashley, such a pleasure.

2218
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:08,860
So fun talking to you.

2219
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:13,040
I can't imagine cartoons that come from your mind and have your voice.

01:37:13,180 --> 01:37:13,960
I'm excited to check it out.

So my notes are all the usual plugs that I say.

01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:59,840
And then right under that is a review I didn't read from the park that says it's one star.

2240
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:01,780
This place gave my dad a concussion.
