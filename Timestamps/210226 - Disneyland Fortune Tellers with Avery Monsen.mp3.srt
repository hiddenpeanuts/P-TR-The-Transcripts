1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,880
Warning, the following podcast will give you stunningly accurate life predictions.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,040
For instance, you will feel shame when a friend or coworker overhears you listening to a podcast

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,380
discussing obscure robots housed in boxes that are located around Disneyland.

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:23,520
It's Disneyland Fortune Tellers with guest Avery Monson on today's podcast, The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,360
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the only theme park podcast that will reveal to you whether

8
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,880
you are about to take a great journey or meet the love of your life.

9
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,480
But we have to warn you, it's not both.

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,880
So choose very wisely which one you want.

11
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,240
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by Mike Carlson.

12
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,080
Wait, did you say you get to choose which one?

13
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,840
But you're also going to find out?

14
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,440
Just be careful.

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,440
Your decisions.

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,440
Wait, so you were saying to be careful.

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,120
You weren't actually saying.

18
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,840
I'm saying one of those two will happen, but they both can't happen.

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,360
Right, but didn't you say you get to choose?

20
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,600
Like the listener gets to choose?

21
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,880
The listener maybe come to a crossroads.

22
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,600
Look, I was having real trouble coming up with this and I think I did an OK job doing

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,600
it in like 10 seconds.

24
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,720
I'm just trying to clarify what you were saying.

25
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
That's all.

26
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,720
Maybe I'm just heard.

27
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,400
I could be the asshole here.

28
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,280
Choose wisely, listener.

29
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,840
Something a great thing awaits you, but not both things.

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,360
Scott Garner, how did you interpret the future?

31
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,600
I kind of got distracted above with the actual meaning because what I got caught on is that

32
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,800
it was like it was already like a pretty long thing and then it and then you ended

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,680
like so be careful which one you want.

34
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:08,680
Like it still had a little addendum, a little under its breath.

35
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,560
I really liked it.

36
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,880
It could have gone on twice as long.

37
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,600
You could have added a few more things like pick a pick a number also.

38
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,560
Which number will it be?

39
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,000
That will correspond to what your fortune shall be.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,760
And then it could have been more things.

41
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:33,360
One of the Sears we're about to talk about today, I did see one of their fortunes.

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,400
They read said one of your lucky numbers is two.

43
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,760
There's a bunch of them, but here's one of them.

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,440
A lot of the cards that they give you are extremely long winded.

45
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,440
Like some of these fortunes do certainly go on and on and on.

46
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:59,160
We'll read every card that we could find that all of the we found everyone in the whatever

47
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,280
65 year history of the park and we're gonna read all of them.

48
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,560
Do we have anyone in the audience that could make us a Jason fortune teller box with an

49
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,960
animatronic in it?

50
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,640
And then we could just have Jason riff on a bunch of these things and put them in there

51
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,840
as a recorded audio.

52
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,600
We must have somebody in the audience.

53
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,280
Obviously, there's a fortune teller maker.

54
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,720
There has to be any random pool of people you're going to find a fortune teller maker.

55
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,720
Yeah, for sure.

56
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,040
Okay, he's not my guy, but I found a guy and then that all but before we get into that.

57
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,880
You do know a guy?

58
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,960
He's not your guy.

59
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,040
Not personally, I saw a video about a guy.

60
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,040
We'll get to that.

61
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,040
Sure.

62
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,040
All right.

63
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Oh, yeah.

64
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
I'm excited.

65
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,800
Let's bring in our guest.

66
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:55,720
You know him from HBO's High Maintenance and he's the bestselling author of the book All

67
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,800
My Friends Are Dead and the upcoming book I Am the Longest Dog.

68
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,080
Avery Monson is here.

69
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
Hi, Avery.

70
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,080
Guys, what a pleasure to be here.

71
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,280
Jason, I thought the joke was great.

72
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,320
I thought it was great as a fortune and I feel like it really applied to me specifically.

73
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,320
I'm really I'm happy with that as a fortune.

74
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
OK, good.

75
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,840
I appreciate that.

76
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,960
I and so you are married, so hopefully that you've already met the love of your life.

77
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,360
So I guess you're you're taking a long journey.

78
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,920
Maybe I guess that's right.

79
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
Yeah.

80
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,600
Every day is a chance to discover new depths of love, though.

81
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
You know what I mean?

82
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,360
That is true.

83
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,040
You could fall.

84
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,800
May said like, yeah, the love of your life is maybe just a nice piece of furniture.

85
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,960
Like it could be anything.

86
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,600
It doesn't have to be a human.

87
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,480
It doesn't have to.

88
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,840
Yeah, it could be anything, really.

89
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,960
Or like woodworking woodworking now is your first love.

90
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,480
I don't know. You you decide you decide.

91
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,400
Yeah, like we've got time for lots of hobbies to be the love of our lives.

92
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,080
Right.

93
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,880
So lockdown is done.

94
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,880
Yeah. So so yeah, anything is possible.

95
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,680
I think we should just keep giving each other fortune.

96
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,400
Like we should each tell each other's fortune as this episode goes on, maybe.

97
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,880
So if you want to call, anyone can call on any other person in this Zoom

98
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,000
to give you a fortune, I think.

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,800
Let's just have that rule on the table.

100
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,080
That's always that's always there as a possibility.

101
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,160
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

102
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,720
So, yeah, any time, any time doesn't matter how many times or how few times.

103
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,440
Yeah, I mean, I think that's fine.

104
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,320
Meddling with things, you know, powers beyond our control.

105
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,040
That usually works out right.

106
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,240
It's like our fortune tellers.

107
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,880
Are they I guess they're tapped into some sort of dark arts.

108
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,720
Yeah, for sure.

109
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,360
It counts as the dark arts, for sure.

110
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,560
OK, well, let's let's test it.

111
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,760
Let's test playing with the dark arts today

112
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,960
because we have done that very far too little on this podcast, I think.

113
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,200
We discussed it.

114
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,760
But yeah, actually doing it is a whole other.

115
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,040
Let's open the gates to hell right now and here.

116
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,280
I would like, yes, like Mark opposite Marin, of course,

117
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,560
open the gates of hell.

118
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,080
And which dark spirits are your guys, would you say?

119
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,960
Oh, um.

120
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,320
So Cerberus, Cerberus.

121
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,720
Yeah, Bielsa Bub.

122
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,960
Bielsa Bub. Oh, oh, Bono's alter ego, Mr.

123
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,560
McPhisto from the Zootv tour.

124
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,120
Two Mr. McPhisto's for the year so far.

125
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,200
How many will fit into 2021?

126
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,160
We'll keep a running tally.

127
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,640
He's he's sort of over my shoulder in this episode,

128
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,160
guiding my dark, my dark thoughts.

129
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,800
So, yeah, if you want to, you want to get a fortune directly from him,

130
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,320
ask me during this episode.

131
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,160
Yeah. And that is our topic.

132
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,800
We're talking about the Disneyland fortune telling machines, which, Avery,

133
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,800
this is this is one you mentioned kind of in passing as like,

134
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,760
oh, if we have time, we, you know, we would talk about fortune read.

135
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,000
And I was like, can you tell me more about fortune?

136
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,920
Because this is one that I I have missed.

137
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,200
I mean, I've done one of these fortune tellers, but like the

138
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,320
the two fortune telling machines that like tie in with the Disney

139
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,360
play app was like a news story at the end of 2018.

140
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,400
And I just missed it entirely.

141
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,640
Yeah. Do any of you guys regularly go to the fortune telling machines?

142
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,880
Never. No, never once.

143
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,400
And I'm not sure that I've

144
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,120
there's certainly one of them where we're talking about three.

145
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,960
There are three fortune telling machines.

146
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,240
There's three and sort of a fourth.

147
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,680
Oh, the the Aladdin's Aladdin's other lamp.

148
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,080
Do you know about Aladdin's other lamp?

149
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,200
I knew about that.

150
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,480
Wow. You're presenting things we don't know at all.

151
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,640
Or at least I know. Yeah, this is good.

152
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,640
I didn't I didn't intend that to be like a gotcha journalism.

153
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,280
I didn't I didn't want to

154
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,520
watch your asses, guys.

155
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,880
I'm going to bring up stuff you don't know about.

156
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,280
Well, I should have scrambled and gone like, well, yes,

157
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,400
in fact, I've got my notes right here.

158
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,960
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

159
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,160
Yeah. Aladdin's other lamp is is in a corner of

160
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,400
I think it's in a corner of one of the stores in Adventureland.

161
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,360
It's it's just like a little lamp that's back in the

162
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,560
in the back of one of the gift shop stores.

163
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,840
And you can put in 50 cents or whatever and smoke will come out of it

164
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,120
and it'll talk to you.

165
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,280
It's not really an animatronic like the other ones,

166
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,280
but it'll it'll like give you a fortune.

167
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,240
We talk to you in this now.

168
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,040
In what in a voice from the movie or who does it?

169
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,920
Is it a genie or what is it?

170
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,960
It is a genie doing some sort of a Middle Eastern sounding

171
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,080
accent that that probably isn't good.

172
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,840
So I go to these things.

173
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,120
I didn't pay for them ever when I used to go.

174
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,560
But now that it now that this Disney parks at what's the app called?

175
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,680
The Play Disney parks app.

176
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,400
Yeah. Yes.

177
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,240
They they have made a function on the app where if you open up

178
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,000
the Fortune Red or the Esmeralda

179
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,480
section of the app, you can get a fortune for free.

180
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,440
And not only is it a fortune, but it will it will give you

181
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,080
one piece of a story that other people don't get to have.

182
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,200
If you just put in money on the street without the app,

183
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,040
you can't get these stories, I don't think.

184
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,520
And they're like long, they're long stories.

185
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,600
I have the cards here.

186
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
No one else.

187
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,920
No one else is doing as far as I know.

188
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,400
I've looked up, you know, like pretty much anything at the Disney parks.

189
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,080
If you if you Google it, someone else has done it.

190
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,240
You know what I mean?

191
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,440
I I Googled the text of these and no one else.

192
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,760
No one is doing this.

193
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,520
This seems to be a lot of effort that someone has put into these

194
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,000
that no one is taking up except for me as far as I can find.

195
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,560
Yeah, that's interesting.

196
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,800
I have not seen I haven't searched for it, but I haven't seen anyone do this.

197
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,160
I haven't seen fresh baked Disney doing this.

198
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,360
I haven't seen any of the vloggers.

199
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,360
That's interesting. You're the only you should be vlogging about it, honestly.

200
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,760
I should start. Yeah, yeah, you should.

201
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,280
You should. Yeah. Show us the journey here.

202
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,360
Can I this is fascinating.

203
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,440
Can I back you way up?

204
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,960
Because also when this all started getting talked about as a topic,

205
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,440
that there is app interactivity in your phone with the fortune telling machines.

206
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,560
I guess I knew that there were a few of those in the park.

207
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,200
I definitely knew about Esmeralda, who's in the Penny Arcade on Main Street.

208
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,720
But when an email about you coming on came in,

209
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,640
this is the first that I had ever seen the phrase Fortune Red.

210
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,120
I was that's how backwards I am on all this.

211
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,120
I don't I didn't know Fortune Red at all.

212
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,720
I do. I'm Mike Jason.

213
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,160
Am I crazy to not know about Fortune Red?

214
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,680
Where does that fall in obscurity?

215
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,520
You didn't know either. No. OK.

216
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,040
Well, again, you really found an area here.

217
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,960
I remember walking by him.

218
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,960
I I think maybe let's start with

219
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,160
the the one who is not tied into the app,

220
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,480
because this one I do know and I have done before.

221
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,680
And I'm talking about shrunken dead.

222
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,760
Shrunk in the shrunken head in a machine, a fortune telling machine

223
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,760
in Adventureland, it used to be in the Bazaar shop at Adventureland,

224
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,360
and now it's kind of moved over to the extended seating for the.

225
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,480
Oh, Mike, what is it called?

226
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,920
The kebab place, the bank, the bank. Oh, yeah, yeah.

227
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:33,560
Yeah. So it's in there and it it spits out cards that like have him on it.

228
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,280
It's he he is like a British.

229
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,160
Sorry, I have his full name here, Colonel Nedley Lostmore.

230
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,240
He is a British explorer who

231
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,480
at some point along the lines got his got became a shrunken head.

232
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,240
And he he's very sassy. Yes.

233
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,000
And he talks to you.

234
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,680
He talks and spits out.

235
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,200
He's sassy to you with his voice.

236
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,600
The other two don't talk really. Right.

237
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,240
Yeah. You may be in the best show with this one.

238
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,360
I would think of the three shrunken.

239
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,720
Yes. In my opinion is the best of the three.

240
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,880
If if you can look past the sort of like

241
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,880
colonialist, I mean, this is like a this is a British man

242
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,760
whose head has been cut off by somebody

243
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,080
that makes makes you feel not not great about it, maybe. Right.

244
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,160
Yeah, I was I was going to bring that out of like, how do we think

245
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,280
Disneyland shrunken heads are long for this world?

246
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,920
I mean, this one appears to be a colonizer who got some comeuppance.

247
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,440
So you might be OK. Yeah.

248
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,360
OK. So so that yeah, I guess we can feel OK about that.

249
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,880
But he is he's by far the funniest out of all of them.

250
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,320
He's got he's got like fortunes.

251
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,800
One of the fortunes that I saw is just

252
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,760
it's like a prescription and the card is totally unintelligible.

253
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,840
It's like in in handwriting and you can't read any of it

254
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,440
because it's like a doctor's prescription.

255
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,240
You know, yeah, that's like a pretty good joke for a for a fortune telling.

256
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,440
Little booth, right? Yeah, yeah, sure.

257
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,160
I think they're all very OK.

258
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,720
I was going to say he's like very like Adventurers Club ask. Yeah.

259
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,360
He's got that vibe, that era of Disney.

260
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,600
I do. Do we have a date actually when he was put in?

261
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,800
Couldn't find it.

262
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,960
I don't know exactly when he was put in, but there is a Disney

263
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,680
Parks blog post from 2014 where they made a little video showing people like,

264
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,360
you know, getting their fortune,

265
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,800
him talking to them and reading the cards and that sort of thing.

266
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,520
So they were plugging it up to a few years ago.

267
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,000
I think he maybe came in.

268
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,840
Yeah, I think the earliest he was was the the 90s

269
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,920
Indiana Jones of vacation of Adventureland,

270
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,840
like when it all sort of got a more coherently 1930s

271
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,640
theme and he's kind of a 30s guy.

272
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,960
So that's the old.

273
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,840
Yeah, he this is not some Walt era remnant.

274
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,520
And he is in fact voiced by an imagineer of the era Eddie Soto.

275
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,080
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

276
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,160
Paris, Disneyland, Paris.

277
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,320
OK, yeah, yeah.

278
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,880
There's a lot of interesting interviews with him on season pass.

279
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,120
I feel I think, yeah, season pass and other places.

280
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,800
He's got a lot of like Baxter era stories and

281
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,800
I think was, yeah, worked under Tony a lot.

282
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,840
Right. Yeah, that's fine.

283
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,960
It's a fun voice. It's sort of in that like

284
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,840
I mean, it's I was going to say like Peter O'Toole.

285
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,120
It's not exactly that, but sort of that's like

286
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,960
a toy to a toy.

287
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,640
Yes, it's that generally.

288
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,600
Oh, Rumpfi, my boy.

289
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,240
Good show. He says patronize you.

290
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,680
Thank you for patronizing.

291
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,920
And he is what's his little like catchphrase that he's the the jungle's

292
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,200
only self-service witch doctor.

293
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,920
It's all it's all like fun little world building.

294
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,760
It's like a good example of like I like all this stuff

295
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,160
they're doing to make adventure land a world

296
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,000
that keeps extending beyond the Jungle Cruise, where Jungle Cruise is kind of the base.

297
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,480
But then there's you Trader Sam's extends it and this extends it.

298
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,160
And it all ties into the sea, the society of explorers and adventurers.

299
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,320
And I don't know this whole whatever they're doing, this like

300
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,760
continual adventure land expansion is, I think, real neat.

301
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,200
I think they're all doing a good job with it.

302
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,000
Yeah, yeah. I mean, it seems fun.

303
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,240
Like it seems like a fun, creative thing to like add to it.

304
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,640
Well, it seems like they're going to I mean, when they redo the Jungle Cruise

305
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,080
that they've announced, I think I think it's, you know, time to take out

306
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,080
some of those weird, you know, data.

307
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,120
The anachronism is like and you can still keep it interesting and and, you know.

308
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,440
Yeah, yeah.

309
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,720
Luckily, I don't think there's been a ton of like people

310
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,720
like so mad about the Jungle Cruise changes.

311
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,600
I mean, I think all the changes they've made like make a lot of sense in general.

312
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,360
But this one, especially, I feel like most people are like, yeah, yeah, of course.

313
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,720
Make the changes.

314
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,440
I think it's too obscure to be mad about.

315
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,720
Like, like there's something like there was something

316
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,880
that and forgive the pun, but there's something splashy about Splash Mountain,

317
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,000
but the Splash Mountain is people know that name and everybody

318
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,560
like geared up that day to go like, you're going to take my thing out and change it.

319
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,040
But the like this story ultimately is like they are going to add

320
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,760
probably cool new scenes that take out problematic elements of a ride.

321
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,560
Like it's all like somebody's got to like really read the fine prints

322
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,080
to know what they're supposed to be mad about the story.

323
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,520
Yeah. Yeah.

324
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,520
I don't. It's just like I don't.

325
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,200
Effort. It's to be mad, maybe.

326
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,880
Where you're like, all right, I got to figure out that there's bad

327
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,320
native representation and there's one scene here and it's being replaced by skippers.

328
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,320
And too much. Yeah.

329
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,360
Go back to something else.

330
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,120
I can't. I usually I would say I would love to meet blank.

331
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,560
I do not want to meet the person who's like, you got to leave the porters

332
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,400
being menaced by the tiger.

333
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,680
You got to leave those porters there.

334
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,240
Yeah. I mean, for you to for you to raise this, think about that.

335
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,520
You have to be openly racist, I think. Right.

336
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,000
I think so.

337
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,840
Also a big theme park fan like Bully, you have to have like encyclopedic

338
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,280
theme park knowledge, which is good and racism, which is bad.

339
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,120
Yeah, there's a Vanda.

340
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,560
I mean, there's a Venn diagram for sure there.

341
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,760
Yeah. Yeah.

342
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,320
Yeah. Go to Etsy.

343
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,120
Search thin blue line, Mickey.

344
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,440
You'll find it.

345
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,520
You'll find it in mere seconds.

346
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,640
You will find that immediately.

347
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,760
Shrunk in Ned, since we're talking about world building,

348
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,040
Shung and Ned has other appearances.

349
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,040
He is the namesake of the

350
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,880
the the jungle, the little boats you drive around

351
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,360
at the Magic Kingdom by the jungle cruise.

352
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,000
I don't know if they're still there.

353
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,160
These little motorboats are called Shunk and Ned's Junior Junior Jungle boats.

354
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,840
And do they have another version of the of the Shrunk and Ned

355
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,360
fortune teller in Magic Kingdom or or is it is it just lending the name over there?

356
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,760
I think it's just lending the name.

357
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,440
There's a small nod to Shunk and Ned at the skipper canteen

358
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,720
and at the Trader Sam's Grog grotto at the Polynesian.

359
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,800
The weirdest thing I found out about him and I didn't know these.

360
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,440
There's books called Tales from Adventureland.

361
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,720
Yeah, I got into this.

362
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,440
I went down a little rabbit hole with this one, too.

363
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,720
But tell us about it, Jason.

364
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:53,080
So a tale of adventureland is about Ned's grandson,

365
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,880
I believe.

366
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,720
And so this character that you the listener

367
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,760
might be finding out about for the first time right now,

368
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,880
there is all extended universe mythology about his grandson.

369
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,520
What's so it's modern day, then?

370
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,080
I think it's in the kind of.

371
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,200
Oh, wait. Yeah, you're right.

372
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,000
He was old enough in the 30s to have a.

373
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,040
You're right. You're right.

374
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,800
It's about the grandson being old now today, but it doesn't sound like it is.

375
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,520
Right now. Yeah.

376
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,680
And so here's the here that like the last names.

377
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,240
This is not perfect one to one, because in in the books,

378
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:38,040
Ned is in a group called the Jungle Explorers Society, which is very like

379
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,480
they didn't have the sea thing, I think, worked out or they didn't agree

380
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,560
to put it in the book.

381
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,840
And so he is also it.

382
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,760
This part, I don't know, is a little sus.

383
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,080
He was ambushed by a witch doctor slash assassin named Bungalow Bob.

384
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,480
Yeah, I see that doesn't make you feel too good.

385
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,400
Yeah, that what it feels.

386
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,080
It's kind of a little rip off.

387
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,120
Also, that's that's another issue with it.

388
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,400
Yeah, really? That's a bill.

389
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,680
Yeah, the Venn diagram of Beatles fans who are racist

390
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,000
and also care about deep cuts in the in the Disney parks.

391
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,160
That that exists, adding more and more circles.

392
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,440
Just adding more and more.

393
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,280
They know they're there.

394
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,520
OK, so the grandstand and least Andy Stanley at some point has to

395
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,800
go retrieve a hidden key from the Enchanted Tiki room.

396
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,920
Oh, of course. Yeah, the hidden key.

397
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,760
Sure. They talk about keys in the Tiki room or is that just that's something else?

398
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,840
They added that.

399
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,760
That is well, the first book is called The Key Masters Quest in this series.

400
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,960
The the the big notable thing in this book is that there is a robot

401
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,160
butler named Bolton House, and it is clearly a nod to the robot

402
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,040
butler from Horizons.

403
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,200
And then at some point in the book series,

404
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:08,040
shrunken dead starts using the robot butler body as a mechanical like as a

405
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,480
robot body.

406
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,680
I like that. Great. That's fine.

407
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,200
Yeah, I like that a lot, honestly.

408
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,440
How many of these books exist?

409
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,080
I I am not sure.

410
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,960
Avery, you said you looked into it.

411
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,280
I didn't I didn't see how many I didn't see how many books there were.

412
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,120
I went down a little rabbit hole looking up the the author of of this book,

413
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,680
who apparently has like a collective of some other guys

414
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,240
that all make steampunk guns together.

415
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,440
OK, makes I feel like that makes sense, right?

416
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,800
Little like little blasters and things.

417
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,320
Mm hmm. Yeah, yeah.

418
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,640
They like sell them on an Etsy site or something.

419
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,280
OK, they have to be expensive, right?

420
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,200
Yeah, I think I think they're pretty expensive.

421
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,920
Yeah, more expensive than if you were to go to an Etsy store

422
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,360
with about four thin blue line Mickey stuff, which I did

423
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,920
since Jason brought it up.

424
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,320
Can be relative. I've been staring at it and staring at me.

425
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,040
Yeah, it's only eight fifty for a

426
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,160
wristband or something that you wear that on one side

427
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,440
is a lot of Mickey's with police helmets and then minis with a bow

428
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,560
and then an American flag pattern with the thin blue line.

429
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,320
And then on the other side, it says, watch out, boys.

430
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,880
My daddy is a police officer.

431
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,960
She's Louise.

432
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,560
That's intense.

433
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,760
Even if you have to.

434
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,320
And then you rotate it a little bit more.

435
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,280
And it's the and it's the lyrics to Lovely Rita Beaner made

436
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,880
more. You got to get those Beetle fans more unlicensed

437
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,640
Beetle stuff. Yeah.

438
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,880
That's the Venn diagram.

439
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,960
The Venn diagram is a Mickey head.

440
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,240
He's three circles.

441
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,040
And oh, yeah.

442
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:54,320
Um, they should make I mean, they should make these books into movies, right?

443
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,200
People, the public would want to see these adventures

444
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,400
to take place around the Disneyland's, right? Right.

445
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,560
The extended universe of the machines.

446
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,600
Yeah. So there's three.

447
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,360
OK, there's three of these books.

448
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,480
There's three of these books.

449
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,840
I don't know how many books are in the king.

450
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,160
I feel like there's a lot more Kingdom Keeper books,

451
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,800
which I have not read, and I feel like I have to.

452
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,840
So I think I think I found the rabbit hole that I had gone down.

453
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,160
I looked up the author Jason Lethko of this novel.

454
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,880
And in his bio on Penguin, Penguin Random House,

455
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,720
he just as like a throwaway line.

456
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,920
He says he is a part of a mysterious society of adventures

457
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,480
called the Brotherhood of Thaumaturgic Cartographers.

458
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,360
And then I Google that and that's that's how I found all the steampunk stuff.

459
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,760
Thaumaturgic, is that the word you said?

460
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,240
Thaumaturgic. Yeah.

461
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,400
T-H-A-U-M-A-T-U-R-G-I-C.

462
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,080
Wow. I've never heard that word.

463
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,600
Is that a real word or did they make it up?

464
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,840
It's possible they made it up.

465
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:04,320
I'm looking it up now as Thaumaturgic,

466
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,160
having brought about or relating to supernatural powers or magic.

467
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,520
Huh? Well, I got to use that a lot more.

468
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,760
Dropping on the conversation. Yes.

469
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,400
Everyone will be impressed.

470
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,960
Oh, go ahead.

471
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,680
Can I ask for a fortune from Scott real quick?

472
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,400
Oh, God.

473
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,320
How do these how do these work?

474
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,400
What is a all right?

475
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:38,840
A an old friend will seek

476
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,920
your companionship, but beware

477
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,800
of his non virtuous intentions.

478
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,200
And he's got a knife. Look out.

479
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,480
Oh, wow. And it's getting.

480
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,080
I feel really got you with that.

481
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,800
Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

482
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,680
He really got. Yeah.

483
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,720
A friend of mine is going to try to kill me with a knife.

484
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,600
Yeah. Yeah.

485
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,080
But you think he's just seeking.

486
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,840
I already don't remember the beginning of it, but you think he's just seeking.

487
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,320
Well, you were channeling.

488
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,200
You don't even it wasn't even really a conscious thing.

489
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,320
You were channeling the dark, the dark spirit.

490
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,320
No, that's what happens any time you.

491
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,680
That's why I delayed for a second and seemed upset to have to say a fortune.

492
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,320
I was propelling my brain into the spiritual realm.

493
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,880
You were being very thumb.

494
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,800
The third year.

495
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,480
It was a pretty thumb. It's a virgical moment. Yes.

496
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,200
So, yeah. Hey, feel free any time, obviously.

497
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,280
Many times you want to hit me up for fortunes.

498
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,720
Yeah, no, we all should be doing this more.

499
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,400
Yeah. For reminding us of this gun that can go off in this episode.

500
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,720
Yes. Much like a steam powered revolver.

501
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,880
This could go off at any moment.

502
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,880
And that is both a good and bad thing.

503
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,920
Can I say Steampunk Blaster?

504
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,120
Yeah.

505
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,080
Well, there's this question in general, as we're talking about the fortune

506
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,120
tellers available at Disneyland.

507
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,280
If any every any of your fascination with this,

508
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,320
did it come from this hearing about this odd thing about the

509
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,600
about the app interactivity or is this is this a an outgrowth of like

510
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,800
you are detail oriented at the parks and want to find like

511
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,400
the odd little off the beaten path experiences there.

512
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,880
Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, I was thinking about this.

513
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,600
I was trying to like put my finger on exactly what drew me to these things.

514
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,000
I think it's a couple of things.

515
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I think that.

516
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,520
Part of it maybe was seeing the movie big a bunch as a kid,

517
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,400
where the the fortune teller, the Zoltar machine played a pretty big role, right?

518
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,320
I think part of it was Jason,

519
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,560
have you ever been to the the Musee Mécanique in San Francisco?

520
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,440
I have I have that written down.

521
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,080
I have been to the Musee Mécanique.

522
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,680
OK, so so I grew up in the Bay Area and before

523
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,880
the Musee Mécanique, which is which is for people that don't know,

524
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,320
it's this it's this sort of warehouse full of these old

525
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,920
old fortune tellers and and little

526
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,440
like dioramas, moving dioramas and things like that.

527
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,640
Jason, how would you describe that place?

528
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,800
Yeah, it's like it's like the Penny Arcade at Disneyland, but much larger.

529
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,840
And you know, with one guy's like everything's kind of kind of right.

530
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,240
Yeah, but a lot of it, you're shocked that it's like, oh, I put a quarter in

531
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,600
and it works like it does work.

532
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,200
I mean, I feel like I see the Musee Mécanique

533
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,560
mentioned a lot with is it laughing Sal?

534
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,320
I forget. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

535
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,360
It's like an eight foot tall woman, just a terrifying woman.

536
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,360
Just a terrifying half puppet, half animatronic thing.

537
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,840
And you just pay it and it laughs and it's scary.

538
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,400
Like it scares children.

539
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,240
The dogs like laughing.

540
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,720
What you get, that's the point of it.

541
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,040
That's what you get. Yeah.

542
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,000
It's like the equivalent of like the movie with the train coming right at you.

543
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,480
Or like, oh, yeah.

544
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,200
Do you not know what laughing Sal looks like? No.

545
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,800
Oh, yeah, Scott.

546
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,160
This actually might be this might be right up your alley.

547
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,920
This might be your new thing.

548
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,280
Well, laughing Sal, yeah, this this might be a version of what this is.

549
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,280
I've maybe talked about this before,

550
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,960
but I think there was one of these up on the top of the entrance to this ride

551
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,280
that I'm very fond of, the scary dark ride, which was in in Newport

552
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,960
in the fun zone or on Balboa Island in Orange County.

553
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,160
There used to be one of these like teetering up and down.

554
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,880
It looks like maybe on the Santa Cruz.

555
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,440
Yes, and walk at some point.

556
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,960
So, yeah, I know this face now.

557
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,960
Yeah, I dealt with my fear of this face already in my childhood,

558
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,080
so I'm not having to experience it new right now.

559
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,080
Oh, OK. So you're used to laughing, Sal, and you're not scared of her

560
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,360
like you are maybe Chucko or the other clown I'm blanking on its name.

561
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:07,120
Yeah, the one from the cereal boxes that we found that was replaced by that.

562
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,720
That bear Golden Crisp.

563
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,560
How I said it was similar is a chunk of Chris Bo wasn't Chris Bo.

564
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,440
There's so many.

565
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,360
I mean, there is there is definitely a clown named Chris Bo somewhere, though.

566
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,640
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

567
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,800
That's that's pretty much waiting to be a clown name.

568
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,360
Yes. Yeah, it's I see a picture of him here.

569
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,040
Yeah, I pulled up sugar's Max clown

570
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,800
12 forgotten cereal.

571
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,040
People are yelling at us right now.

572
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,480
I was close, though, I think it's it's close.

573
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,160
A lot of clowns are yelling at you right now.

574
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,920
No, no, no.

575
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,840
Don't say that. We apologize.

576
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,080
Anyway, talk amongst yourselves while I try to.

577
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,400
So so when I so when I was in high school, I went to the Museum

578
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,680
Mechanique a couple of times, and it actually the place that it's in right now,

579
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,080
which is on Fisherman's Wharf, before it was there, it was in this old place

580
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,760
called the Cliff House, which is like way far out.

581
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,560
It like on the end of San Francisco, on the on the beach

582
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,200
in this old building that was kind of falling apart.

583
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,880
And so it made it like way creepier, way, way more like

584
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,680
like kind of grimy and fucked up, which to like to me was way better.

585
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,560
And so and eventually, like sometime in my high school, the building

586
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,520
needed like structural maintenance or they or they like lost their lease

587
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,400
or something, and then they had to find a better place for it.

588
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,440
But so that that sort of like old timey

589
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,720
like turn of the century, like nickel machines

590
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,720
thing sort of occupied a weird space in my brain.

591
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,080
Also, a lot of them are like like a little diorama where you'll

592
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,160
you'll put in a nickel and you'll see like an opium den.

593
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,200
Do you know what I mean? It's like it or I've seen the opium den.

594
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

595
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,720
Or like you'll see like a man get hanged.

596
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,720
And and it's like it's like the the drunkard's revenge or so.

597
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,720
Do you know what I mean? It's like it's like some weird little morality tale.

598
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,720
Like bizarrely harsh and like like a real not just a remnant of the time

599
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,720
and that you're like looking at a thing that was made closer to the turn of the century,

600
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,720
but also remnant of the time and that it's like dark and clearly

601
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,720
from a time where people like just kill each other and cold blood

602
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,720
and it was just like a grime here era.

603
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,720
Like this is what you do for fun is think about opium dens and and what

604
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,720
hanging someone for being drunk.

605
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,720
What's what I wonder what's the issue in that one?

606
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,720
It's like the old timey like cartoon all stars to the rescue.

607
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,720
That's the only way they could scare you about things is like

608
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,720
you have to go up to a box and pay money to be scared into not doing something wrong.

609
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,720
Because high schoolers could not resist the siren call of opium.

610
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,720
So you got to take them to the scary box to scare them straight.

611
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,720
Right. Yeah. Cliffy, Cliffy, Cliffy, Cliffy.

612
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
Oh, it was pretty close, I think.

613
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,720
It was close. Cliffy the clown. Anyway.

614
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,720
So that that was like in my head.

615
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,720
And the other thing that I think was that I like as a kid, I was super into magic.

616
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:24,720
And there's like a pretty big overlap in the history of magic

617
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,720
with like robots and automatons and things like that.

618
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:37,720
Like back in the guy's name is Jean Jean Jean Eugene Robert Houdin.

619
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:43,720
The guy that Houdini got his name from basically was was like a watchmaker

620
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,720
and a tinker and a big part of his magic was these like robots and things.

621
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,720
Right. So around the turn of the century, they had these these robots were

622
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,720
sort of a big part of of magic.

623
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,720
And I was super into it as a kid.

624
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:03,720
So they had this there was one that was like a Turk that would play chess with people.

625
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:09,720
Have you seen this? It's like a it's like a big box with a with a robot Turk on top.

626
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,720
And he would play chess. And then eventually they found out that actually it wasn't a robot.

627
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,720
It was a guy inside the box operating the thing as a puppet.

628
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,720
But they like lied to everybody and said that it was a it was a robot.

629
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,720
But there's a ton of stuff like that.

630
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,720
That's that's the real that's the real secrets of magic.

631
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,720
They either made an insane contraption.

632
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,720
There is a guy inside it or it's a twin.

633
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,720
Those are the usual explanation or a mirror that that's.

634
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,720
Yeah. On magician secrets revealed on all those specials.

635
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,720
It's always just those three answers.

636
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,720
The answer is, yeah, this one's a twin thing.

637
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,720
Well, it's got a commercial early because it's twins.

638
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,720
Avery, are you Magic Castle?

639
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,720
Like have you been to Magic Castle multiple times?

640
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
I have been to the Magic Castle a couple of times.

641
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,720
I also there was this TV special that I watched a bunch as a kid.

642
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,720
That was Mark Summers magical mystery tour that took place in the in the Magic Castle.

643
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:14,720
That was Mark Summers from from Double Dare having some hijinks in the Magic Castle after hours.

644
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,720
Yeah. And I saw that a bunch of times before I ever moved to L.A.

645
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,720
And never got to see it.

646
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:27,720
It's like when I finally got to the Magic Castle, I like knew my way around because of just seeing this special a bunch as a kid.

647
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,720
Oh, it like shows you the geography and all the like special details.

648
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,720
I mean, I just would recognize rooms.

649
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,720
Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Wow. It's a cool special.

650
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,720
It is like a really like genuinely creepy.

651
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,720
And I feel like an like a cool use of his power at the time.

652
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,720
Like Nickelodeon owed him.

653
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,720
So he did a cool thing about the magic place that he loves.

654
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:54,720
Like I feel like he'd be like that's a cool vanity projects to have done on Mark Summers part.

655
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,720
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

656
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,720
We haven't talked. I mean, we haven't talked a lot.

657
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,720
We've talked a little about Magic Castle.

658
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,720
I mean, it feels like we probably owe it more discussion down the road.

659
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,720
But I know they're going through some troubles of their own.

660
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,720
They're going through some tough times.

661
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,720
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

662
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,720
But also, you can vote there. They helped get the vote out.

663
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,720
So that's true. You can vote there. Yeah.

664
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:27,720
And I did I did audio and visual for Bing Crosby's wife's musical performance in the basement at the musical.

665
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,720
Oh, yeah. That's where that was.

666
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,720
Yep. That's where it was.

667
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,720
This is the first podcast mention of your time working for.

668
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,720
I don't think I even knew the relation until now.

669
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,720
It was Bing Crosby's wife.

670
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,720
Yes, I think this is odd that this hasn't come up on the show.

671
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,720
And I will talk about this at length a different time.

672
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:54,720
Yes, I worked for Bing Crosby's wife, Catherine, in some capacity doing like PowerPoint while she would sing songs and wait PowerPoints, though.

673
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:04,720
Yeah, I would like was like showing like the bullets of what she's singing about trees, birds, lovely days, just swooping in, spiraling in.

674
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,720
Yes, there would be pictures of the two of them.

675
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,720
There would be pictures of the children, perhaps.

676
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,720
And then there would be video.

677
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:21,720
She would play a video of her as a young lady singing with Bing from an old show, and I would be responsible for hitting space bar.

678
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,720
But that's a whole cabaret act.

679
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,720
It's a cabaret show.

680
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,720
If Mrs. Crosby tries to get back into your life, watch out for a knife, man.

681
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,720
Oh, yeah.

682
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,720
Whoa, you're right.

683
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,720
Yep.

684
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,720
If three days from now you get a call, you need somebody to press the space bar again.

685
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,720
That would be the craziest way I could die.

686
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,720
Your first job comes back to haunt you.

687
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,720
Well, when we do more Magic Castle, I'll tell more about that story.

688
00:36:53,720 --> 00:37:03,720
I will recommend I don't know how many tickets are left, but the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles has been doing a run of different shows called the Geffen Stayhouse.

689
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:17,720
And I saw a magic show from the comfort of, you know, home on my laptop called the future.

690
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:25,720
This this sleight of hand close up magic guy, Helder Guimaris, I believe is how you say the name.

691
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,720
And it was awesome.

692
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,720
They send you a tube out of time.

693
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,720
They send you a mysterious box you were not allowed to open.

694
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,720
Whoa.

695
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:41,720
And you participate in the tricks like there was a thing that I did that I couldn't I have no idea how he did.

696
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,720
I there was one or two where I was like, I think I see it's very good.

697
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,720
It's a little pricey, but it's very good.

698
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:54,720
And directed by Mr. Frank Marshall, the producer of Jurassic Park.

699
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,720
Right.

700
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,720
Friends with Jimmy Buffett.

701
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,720
Yeah, there you go.

702
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,720
Jimmy Buffett's best friend.

703
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,720
Yeah, best friend.

704
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,720
Yeah.

705
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,720
So that's the reason to support it.

706
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,720
Jason, bad news.

707
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,720
I got a fortune for you.

708
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:11,720
A seemingly innocuous tube in your home may be soon soon involved in your demise.

709
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,720
Oh, OK.

710
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,720
Well, I'm not allowed to talk about what was in the tube or what I was supposed to do with the tube, but I do recommend it to people.

711
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,720
It's a little pricey, but you get a tube that will apparently kill me.

712
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,720
Only Jason.

713
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,720
Everybody else is fine.

714
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,720
If anybody else wants to find.

715
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,720
OK.

716
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,720
So far, so scary.

717
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,720
Yeah.

718
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,720
So far, two for two on the fortunes ending in death.

719
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,720
They're all.

720
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,720
That's how they work.

721
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,720
Great.

722
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,720
Hey, could you give Jason a fortune real quick?

723
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:49,720
Jay, Jay, the the the spirits, the spirits are reaching out to to tell you don't go outside.

724
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,720
Wow.

725
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,720
Another OK.

726
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
Great.

727
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,720
That is not because difficult.

728
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:03,720
More because of because of an old friend is approaching also with a knife.

729
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,720
What?

730
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,720
OK.

731
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,720
Well, now hold on a sec.

732
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,720
This seems like I'm going to run into Mike and we're just going to both go for each other because of these warnings.

733
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,720
Yeah, it's driving you both mad.

734
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,720
Yeah, yeah.

735
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,720
You're assuming it's the other.

736
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,720
Well, so maybe Jason, maybe there's a knife in that tube.

737
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:25,720
Scott was talking about Jason's going to go for it and it'll slip out of his hands and he'll stab himself.

738
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:30,720
Yeah, it's kind of the gift of the Magi, but with two friends stabbing each other.

739
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,720
I should not have called for fortunes.

740
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,720
Now, you know, they all think the big mistake on my part.

741
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,720
That's where they could tell the Disney 9 ones don't.

742
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:50,720
The Disney 9 ones are pleasant, mostly, although Strunk and Ned refers to, you know, diseases that don't exist and cures that wouldn't fix them.

743
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,720
Right.

744
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,720
So they have to be positive.

745
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,720
Do we know like it is any?

746
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:00,720
I mean, I'm sure this is not well documented, but it would be interesting because I would imagine when does when is the oldest one?

747
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,720
When is the first? Is that there from day one?

748
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,720
The Esmeralda.

749
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,720
The Esmeralda.

750
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,720
Some version of that was there in day one.

751
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,720
Like those probably she at that point, she probably gave out warnings about knives.

752
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,720
Like that then they didn't care as much.

753
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,720
Probably found an old Esmeralda.

754
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,720
It's not terribly.

755
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,720
This is from the 60s.

756
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,720
There's well, let's see.

757
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,720
Worry over danger for a loved one has been your lot.

758
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,720
This will pass.

759
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,720
OK, so that's actually a nice thing.

760
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:39,720
I think the reason I pulled it was saying you may have some marital trouble, but a true friend will help straighten it out.

761
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:44,720
Sounds like someone is going to die.

762
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,720
Or get big beat up.

763
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,720
I don't know.

764
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,720
Straighten it out.

765
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,720
Yes, sir.

766
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:56,720
That doesn't necessarily mean that the marital trouble is over and the marriage continues that mean that could mean, well, the marriage is not your problem anymore.

767
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,720
Right.

768
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:02,720
Your friend is going to throw your wife off a cliff or something like crazy.

769
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,720
Like, who knows what that's getting at.

770
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:12,720
A lot of them imply there is like marital stuff in a lot of these cards from what I could tell.

771
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,720
And I did see some story.

772
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,720
Was this also an Esmeralda?

773
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,720
The maybe it was a net.

774
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,720
I don't know.

775
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:26,720
I think I remember when I was in the

776
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:36,720
scenes told a couple said something about you like that you will find a new love like you're you've experienced marital trouble, but you'll find a new love.

777
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,720
This is given to a husband and wife or like, no, thanks.

778
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
We're good.

779
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,720
That is a perfect illustration of what I was saying.

780
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,720
We're like, that's not flying in a Disney park in this day and age.

781
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,720
Don't quote me on that.

782
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,720
I don't remember the source.

783
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,720
That's funny.

784
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,720
That's funny as hell.

785
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,720
I think that's great.

786
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,720
That is great.

787
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:58,720
That's like not something Bob Chick comes across Bob JPEG desk.

788
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,720
Really.

789
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,720
That's what that is then.

790
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,720
Because it's like that was presented to the higher ups like, you know what cards were giving out?

791
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,720
They would definitely be like, oh, that's no, it's just got to be.

792
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,720
They have to be turned into ads for our new movies.

793
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,720
Like that's what it would be going forward.

794
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,720
That's just probably snuck by because it's such a low.

795
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:23,720
These are such low key things that people like you may you may experience a fun and

796
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:30,720
enlivening time when you stream soul on Disney Plus this weekend.

797
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,720
The Mighty Ducks are back.

798
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,720
An old friend may return.

799
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:40,720
The initials are GV Gordon Bombay perhaps.

800
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,720
Yeah.

801
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,720
We really think this out there because it's going to happen.

802
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:59,720
I think what appeals one of the appeals to me about these things is like, especially when I first started going to Disneyland, I realized like how much off the beaten track stuff there was like stuff not on the map or stuff that everyone doesn't tell you that.

803
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:11,720
So finding like a fortune telling machine where you get it spits out the card that you get to keep or finding like a little room where you can queue off in a factor something.

804
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:18,720
You know, what's always one of these is the there's that is anybody ever done in it's in a Frontierland shop.

805
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:25,720
It's kind of on the other side of where Shrunken Ned would be there like way in the back of the store.

806
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:34,720
This some weird like kind of glockenspiely machine you put a core into and then it does a big like clangy one man band kind of song.

807
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,720
I would never.

808
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:45,720
I don't know the actual name of the instrument, but does this sound familiar at all the weird like Frontierland old timey flap traction that plays your song?

809
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,720
100% I've done that.

810
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,720
Yeah, I think I've done that.

811
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,720
That's neat.

812
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:53,720
I want I want way more of this kind of thing in the park.

813
00:43:53,720 --> 00:44:01,720
It's like like there is do you guys know about the the the singing lesson on Main Street?

814
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,720
No, no.

815
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:11,720
So if you go down Main Street and go off one of the one of the little sort of side roads that doesn't doesn't go very far.

816
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:40,720
If you go one of the windows says singing lessons and if you go to it and listen you can hear they have a speaker playing the whole time like somebody giving a singing lesson in in in inside the little singing lesson store and I feel like that cut like they should have stuff like that going all the time like what is stopping them from putting a little speaker in different places and having little like things that you can stop by and listen to you know what I mean?

817
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,720
Yeah, they have I'm trying to think of other versions.

818
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,720
They have like the phone at the market house of Starbucks.

819
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,720
Yeah.

820
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,720
Oh, yeah.

821
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,720
And there's like is there a telegraph running in there too like a telegraph machine?

822
00:44:51,720 --> 00:45:09,720
Yeah, I mean this stuff is all so fun and also is so for annual pass holders who just want to wander and it's like just give us more stuff to I guess I guess it's like anything when you get way into something and you want like

823
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:27,720
we want like little things only we know about right is it is that kind of isn't if I'm psychologically analyzing us that you're saying you can take a new person and then show like you know not just not everybody might know this one and either they think that's cool or that you're a major Jweeb.

824
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:49,720
Yeah, I mean I guess it really obviously it fills it out it fills it out in such a fun rich way and I also think like you even if you don't notice it you notice like you with details wise you even if you don't notice it you notice it if you're hanging out in an area and they have a bunch of like kind of soundscape II kind of things that is actually making it better and you might not even be aware of why.

825
00:45:49,720 --> 00:46:18,720
Well let me say that you know for a new thing in the park for a big ambitious new thing I galaxy's edge is full of this kind of thing little like soundscape designs here's this little show I haven't done a ton of the app interactivity and if people were disappointed by that maybe on the whole but there there still is a lot to do in that regard like for you think that they would like and then there's you know obviously like a lot of things they cut with the axis edge but like that kind of thing.

826
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:27,720
I don't know I do like that they they didn't ignore that and it's something being built from the ground up in twenty nineteen was so detail oriented.

827
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,720
The radio station in the bathroom.

828
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,720
Is really neat.

829
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:36,720
I mean there's so much stuff in there like there's so much on that loop I feel like that I haven't even heard.

830
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:57,720
Yeah the the experiences were like I I know especially if you go to galaxy's edge with little kids where like if you find Ray where she's wandering around like convinces people to slakes you have follow me sneak sneak through things and trick storm troopers like those those little things fill stuff that stuff.

831
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:11,720
That's the best I mean that's the best stuff in there I mean I don't know that sounds like a land designer anything else down but that's yeah that stuff is little secret things like did you know if you like bring your child Ray will hang out with them and go on a mission with them.

832
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:21,720
Yeah that's they don't put that on the I mean they say look out for Ray I'm sure on the app but they don't say like Ray will crouch and pretend you're hiding from Kylo Ren which is awesome.

833
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,720
I think I got mad dogged by Chewie like Chewie mad dogged me.

834
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:31,720
Well then I was like I'm sorry Chewie and then like going.

835
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:45,720
The greatest thing to were you with me Jason were we together when I was getting a Ronto rap at like the end of the night Chewie runs up to the counter smacks his like paws on the desk and then a guy goes hey Chewie can I have a picture and he goes and he runs away.

836
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:55,720
I was like that is awesome Chewie just told this adult no for a photo like you may have just run into a cast member who was having a bad day.

837
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,720
Hey we have the Chewie suit on and it worked for me.

838
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,720
He they used it method.

839
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,720
Yeah.

840
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,720
Yeah.

841
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,720
Little stuff.

842
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:08,720
Yeah yeah yeah have you guys like activated the ships and stuff in.

843
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,720
Galaxy's Edge.

844
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,720
Galaxy's Edge.

845
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,720
Yes.

846
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:20,720
Yeah through the through the app if you do like little puzzles and stuff you can you can make the ships turn on which I guess is actually really cool.

847
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:39,720
Yeah and then there's also like I'm trying to think I was in that like opening day crush a couple times last year you know where like they hold you at the line and you wait and there's those like transmitters on the poles to you can like turn on and like make them like short out.

848
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,720
Oh.

849
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:58,720
And that's all very fun and especially if I was a I was a kid because that's all as a kid you would have you wouldn't have an app but like there would be interactivity on things and I feel like they would kind of fall short but if I was a kid and I could hit the button and like a big thing would like light up I would blow my mind.

850
00:48:58,720 --> 00:48:59,720
Yeah.

851
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,720
I think my greatestism was.

852
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:07,720
Oh sorry I tried to do this stuff at Galaxy's Edge.

853
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:15,720
And I tried to download the play Disney parks app when I was in park on the Wi Fi and it was oh it's over 600 megabytes.

854
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,720
This is not this is not happening on Disney Wi Fi.

855
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:31,720
So I think I think people have complained like it local storage and then like a data usage with the app it it where it was crashing a lot when they first launched it.

856
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,720
So yeah it was definitely a thing like on my phone.

857
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:41,720
It was definitely a thing like on my mental to do list of like oh fiddle around with this more at the park.

858
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:49,720
The complaint I think the only complaints people were having was the way they hyped it up beforehand and then the stuff that was cut.

859
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:59,720
It made it sound like it was going to be just full immersive everywhere every clerk spoke but to or whatever the language is.

860
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,720
Yes.

861
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:09,720
And like and you know of course you would be people would be constantly coming up to you talking about your Millennium Falcon performance and it's like that didn't really they didn't really do that.

862
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,720
Yeah.

863
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:15,720
And I think that's but the way I mean the but if you didn't have that expectation and you just played with the stuff on the app you go that's cool.

864
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,720
That's very cool.

865
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:34,720
So you want how would you feel if you were in the in Ogas Cantina and you walked in and then Rex cut the music and told everybody to be quiet and pointed you out like this guy is the guy who crashed the dang Falcon.

866
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,720
Yeah, that would be awesome.

867
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,720
That would be so good.

868
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:56,720
Yeah, if he and anything and anything like you bought a milk or something like you bought a milk in your app register I mean this is all scary because your app is just tracking you but it's also awesome because a robot could call you out for what you just bought or something like anything like that.

869
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,720
We want the robots to roast us.

870
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,720
That's not that's the height of all this.

871
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,720
Well potato head does a version of it a Toy Story Midway mania.

872
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:11,720
But we asked more robots roasting like like Rex.

873
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:18,720
Yeah, Rex could just list like the last four digits of your credit card numbers you come into.

874
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:31,720
0941 I know security code security code vehicle identification number 34X1.

875
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,720
Like all of that we want as much of that as possible.

876
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:39,720
Yeah, she just came up to me and told me I had bad credit.

877
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:46,720
She did hug me once like the crowd part it and she was there and he reached out and gave me a big hug so that was nice.

878
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,720
Yeah, that's great addition to his threatening mad dogging.

879
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,720
Yeah, please.

880
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,720
Hard to get.

881
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:59,720
Yeah, I was gonna ask Gary that you know like some of us talking about this, this, the, the first time machines is the, the, the app interactivity.

882
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:11,720
Yeah, are you interested in this in general or have you like it was that you're in for this stuff that we're talking about or have you done other other other things on this app that that we may not be aware of.

883
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,720
I mean I have spent.

884
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:20,720
I at one point spent an entire day just in galaxies edge just messing around with the app.

885
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:26,720
And it's not the app is not great but it is kind of fun to collect those little badges and things.

886
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:33,720
I think maybe part of this is that I as a child was not allowed to play video games I never had any video games.

887
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:36,720
And even now I don't, I don't really do it.

888
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:47,720
And so even the just the hint of something that's kind of a video game, it gets it gets that gets the dopamine or whatever it is firing right.

889
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:48,720
Yeah, yeah.

890
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,720
It's fun to collect those little badges.

891
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:58,720
Yes, you are a tinker naturally though you've done a lot. You've made a lot of videos with like practical effects stuff.

892
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:10,720
Yeah, I like I like messing around with stuff. I mean, I think here's the thing. I think that Disneyland is this is this cool constructed world right it's like this constructed fantasy world.

893
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,720
And when you're a kid and you go there.

894
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:23,720
It's like every there's like a there's magic and and new things to find around every corner right and I think with a lot of this.

895
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:38,720
I'm, I want to capture some of that back like I want to I want that that feeling of maybe if I maybe if I like I'm walking around here something is hidden, you know, and I sometimes with the app at its best.

896
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:48,720
And then you can get when the Wi Fi is good enough, you can get a little bit of that right because like like fortune read is you would not be able to find it.

897
00:53:48,720 --> 00:54:03,720
But like most people it's hidden down an alleyway you it's actually in a in a very inopportune place you you have to sort of like it's it's down an alley where people are often getting doing a meet and greet with Jack Skellington.

898
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:20,720
And so there's like you kind of have to like stand there and cut kids in line to go it looks like you're cutting off kids who are going to go talk to just counting but then you just go and do this little fortune teller but I guess I just want more more little things like that you know.

899
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:39,720
Yeah, yeah, I mean the discovery. I think that's, I'm sure probably we all have that that this is the annual pet luckily. I think people have heard this news, supposedly when the park opens back up there will be some kind of annual pass program again so sure we won't have to pay $150 each time we go.

900
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:56,720
But I think this is yeah what you're saying is like having the privilege of living out here and having an annual pass is what you're talking about because it's like you start to go, you start to figure out all the little hidden stuff and it makes it feels makes the place feel so much cooler.

901
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:11,720
And then you're kind of almost on a hunt for it. It's like when I didn't even go to the steakhouse 55 bar until I was out here for like six or seven years and you get to that little but you're like this is a nice little hotel bar and it's like that's not as cool as like a fortune teller machine.

902
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,720
But there is like I don't know I might argue with you there.

903
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:18,720
All right, fair enough.

904
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:26,720
But even like weird stuff yeah the Disneyland Hotel they have the utopia car in there and that's like stuff out of the way.

905
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:33,720
Like you go like makes it does feel like you're exploring this like thing that almost feels like it's in has unlimited hidden thing.

906
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:39,720
Yeah, well, and I think the nice thing it's because it's so big.

907
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:46,720
If you if you pack a lot of these hidden things like let's say you have family visiting for a weekend or something you're only there for a day maybe two.

908
00:55:46,720 --> 00:56:02,720
But if there's enough hidden things, and they stumble across one or two things like that produces delight like that's I think the big thing that we're always like trying to get back to is is in these parks is like finding little moments of delight, especially if you.

909
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:22,720
I try not to be cynical about these places and I do enjoy these places but like every now and then they fall short of expectations but like little things like this where you you are reminded of the attention to detail really make them sing part of what I think is so interesting about these parks is that they operate.

910
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:37,720
It's it's like two very different things it's on one hand it's like this disgusting commercialism right it's like very clearly just trying to make your money and take your money away from you know and then on the other hand it's it's like.

911
00:56:37,720 --> 00:57:00,720
Art and idealism and and like hope and trying to find whimsy and magic in places where you wouldn't expect it right because if they if they're like hidden things down alleys in Disneyland maybe there are hidden things down alleys in the rest of the world right and I think that's that's kind of what you're trying to capture.

912
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:19,720
Yeah yeah like a magic magic is everywhere it is interesting you're saying that because yeah obviously everything is just money as much money as possible it is funny because I think if almost if Disney if this thing like Walt Disney didn't start theme parks but Disney existed and they started them right now.

913
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:47,720
They wouldn't have magic in them they might have very cool expensive rides and it might be very fun to go but I feel like because of the precedent that was set early on of like detail now all the imagineers who were raised on all of this detail push for it and we still get like an extra little like fortune teller machine here and there are narratives and I think if it was just created in the last 10 years it would just be.

914
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:58,720
Big movie rides and I wouldn't look like a six flags but it wouldn't be nearly as like it wouldn't have nearly as many hidden things and like as much detail and stuff.

915
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:17,720
Yeah I think I think like I think that's right and I think the little things I mean sometimes you can with these fortune telling machines for example you can dig back in the past and like oh well you don't see these every maybe still see these.

916
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:46,720
These sorts of machines are still you know common at boardwalks and fairs and carnivals and that sort of thing but like they still produce the light there's still plenty of videos on YouTube of people going to these machines and doing them and reading the cards and all I think the first the first one I could find was like back in the 1900s but there is a video on YouTube.

917
00:58:47,720 --> 00:59:01,720
Of a channel called great big story and they interview all off Stan the head of characters unlimited that and they build every Zoltar machine by hand in Boulder City Nevada.

918
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:02,720
Wow.

919
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:16,720
Like so you can still order these things and they make them by hand and one thing they pointed out is Olaf cast his own teeth for the Zoltar that is the owner's teeth.

920
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,720
On each feature.

921
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,720
Yeah Zoltar has Olaf's teeth.

922
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:29,720
Each Zoltar. Yes, I don't know if Zoltar is copyrighted though because I found another company selling Zoltar machines.

923
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:34,720
Was it an interview with him? Did his voice sound like this or anything?

924
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:52,720
It doesn't sound like that he's just a guy like he's just like a nice normal guy and they write they did they make the cards they make the fortune telling cards too he was like boxing up like tons of packs of cards.

925
00:59:52,720 --> 01:00:11,720
It's like really the fortune teller machine for me it's like it's everything we like about a themed entertainment it's a robot there's an interactive element to it it's there's an intimacy with it the fortune teller doesn't say they're proud of me but it's like it's something it's something in the way where they're addressing me.

926
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,720
Intimacy is weird.

927
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,720
You fall into these turns of phrase.

928
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:17,720
I know what he means.

929
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,720
Every other episode.

930
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:24,720
Intimacy. I want to have intimacy with Zoltar and with Fortune Red.

931
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,720
I said that Olaf seduces me on the Frozen ride.

932
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:34,720
Olaf seduces me and I want to have intimacy with him and with Olaf whether it's Olaf the snowman or Olaf with the teeth.

933
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:45,720
Look I am not I am not say after Europe I stopped being sexual in any way again so I'm just using intimacy and sexual and seductive non sexually.

934
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:49,720
This is an intimate art form podcasting is an art form.

935
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:53,720
Why do you need to say that though.

936
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,720
You are intimate.

937
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:59,720
You're a purveyor of intimate goods Scott Garrett.

938
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:04,720
We are purveying intimate goods Scott deal with it.

939
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:05,720
All right.

940
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:10,720
Just like well now you'll do it but I was going to say just leave the word boy out of there.

941
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,720
Don't say I'm an intimate good purveyor boy.

942
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,720
That weird shit people do.

943
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:20,720
I'm a little intimate purveyor boy.

944
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:21,720
Hey you said it not us.

945
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:22,720
Ah damn it.

946
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,720
I said the clean phrase.

947
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,720
We tricked you with dark arts into saying it.

948
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,720
All right let's bring it back.

949
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,720
Let's bring back on topic.

950
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:35,720
You're a little fortune collecting boy.

951
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:36,720
Do that to our guests.

952
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:37,720
That's very rude.

953
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:41,720
No I've always considered myself sort of an intimate little boy.

954
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:45,720
Oh yeah.

955
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,720
You know break.

956
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:55,720
No I think you know there is something about that when you go on rides you see animatronics that are in their own world.

957
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:59,720
But these are animatronics that are like in your world.

958
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:00,720
Do you know what I mean.

959
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:05,720
And there's something there's something that's that feels intimate about it.

960
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,720
Yes it's there right there.

961
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:12,720
It exists on a boardwalk which is not themed lights a little theme but it's not themed like Disney.

962
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,720
You're in your is you're saying real world.

963
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,720
It's kind of like especially when you're a kid.

964
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:18,720
Is this thing real.

965
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:19,720
Is it.

966
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:20,720
It's kind of real.

967
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:24,720
And now it's going to like tell me something bad about my life.

968
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:25,720
That's intimate.

969
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,720
Somebody says something bad about your life.

970
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,720
Like now there's an intimacy there.

971
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:31,720
Yeah.

972
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:32,720
Nonsexual.

973
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,720
Nonsexual.

974
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:34,720
OK.

975
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:35,720
All right.

976
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:38,720
As long as you put that next to intimacy.

977
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,720
Let's talk about one of these other machines.

978
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:41,720
Do it.

979
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:42,720
Do we have an order we want to go in.

980
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,720
We got two to go.

981
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,720
As morelda.

982
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,720
Yeah I.

983
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,720
As morelda is.

984
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:55,720
You know this is kind of another sort of like yeah I don't know.

985
01:02:55,720 --> 01:03:03,720
This is a weird line because it's like in the 50s and 60s it's like well we need some mysticism.

986
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,720
I guess let's put a Romani in there.

987
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,720
Like let's just get that in there.

988
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,720
Yeah that'll solve this.

989
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,720
Sure.

990
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:12,720
That's.

991
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:19,720
I'm actually I'm actually surprised they haven't changed the name because it's the same name as hunchback of Notre Dame character.

992
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:20,720
Mm hmm.

993
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:21,720
Hmm.

994
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:22,720
That's a good point.

995
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,720
Using feels like they would not.

996
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:25,720
Yeah I.

997
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:26,720
I.

998
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,720
I googled as morelda fortune teller and there's like a lot of different.

999
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:37,720
Companies that are all making different as morelda fortune teller so I wonder if that was at some point a character.

1000
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,720
In some sort of media.

1001
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,720
Like is it is it all reference.

1002
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,720
This media.

1003
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:51,720
I mean do you think that other people are referencing the Disney one or do you think that the Disney one and other ones are also referencing something else that we don't know about.

1004
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,720
The name all referencing maybe it was.

1005
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:55,720
Oh maybe.

1006
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:56,720
Like yeah.

1007
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:04,720
We're like a generic you know missed it's kind of like in in.

1008
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:15,720
In there that there's that story in the devil white devil in the white city book about like we need a song for someone to dance to and like the pianist like.

1009
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:19,720
Is just covered in flop sweat and just kind of plunked out like that.

1010
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:23,720
That that that that that that that that like and that's where that came from.

1011
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:28,720
Like did they just like as morelda something.

1012
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,720
In.

1013
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:38,720
Yeah an old dime store book or in just like the first generations of these storytelling machines of like oh that's a name that sounds.

1014
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:41,720
Foreign enough to Americans they'll think it's mystical.

1015
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:53,720
Yeah I probably I mean somebody probably knows the exact history and we're sounding like idiots but it probably seems like well it's a like a Romanian name and they they know fortunes.

1016
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:58,720
I assume it comes from some sort of like very lazy lazy.

1017
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:05,720
Seems like we all hate as morel that's what the seems like a lot of despising going on.

1018
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:07,720
What from us you mean.

1019
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:08,720
Yeah.

1020
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:09,720
Yeah.

1021
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:10,720
Oh I already.

1022
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:11,720
Ate this machine.

1023
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:17,720
No I don't hate her at all I'm just saying it's possibly comes from some sort of like lazy white people that's all I'm saying.

1024
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:24,720
Yeah yeah I also think that she's like the least she's maybe the least original at least specific to Disneyland.

1025
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:25,720
Mm hmm.

1026
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:26,720
Do you know what I mean like like the.

1027
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,720
Well sure sure.

1028
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,720
Sure sure.

1029
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:35,720
One is outside parts of the Caribbean Fort fortune or shrunken Ned is in Adventureland.

1030
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:38,720
This is kind of you've seen this before you know.

1031
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:47,720
What's like throwback in probably is something young Walt saw or something you know like it's because it's in the biz we're talking about the thing in the penny arcade and on Main Street.

1032
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:48,720
Right.

1033
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:57,720
Yeah so it's along with you know like I mean there's a couple there's a little family of weird mannequins and stuff on Main Street.

1034
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:03,720
I guess it's a throwback to mannequins that he either liked or creeped him out as a kid.

1035
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:17,720
There's a lot yeah there's still a lot of like little stuff that feel doesn't feel like it's so Disney like in the penny arcade there is the Pinocchio machine where you put like a quarter and he dances like so that's they have more like new Disney stuff in there.

1036
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:26,720
But there are still some pieces on Main Street like this that are a little more generic just like old turn of the century maybe.

1037
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:37,720
Yeah I found one of these that because I was like well this doesn't count as one of the fortune tellers but it's you know it's a it's adjacent I would say and I don't think I've ever seen this guy.

1038
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:58,720
He's an uncle Sam and he has a big I think you you well no you don't step on him it's a it's a some sort of like strength tester it's got like a dial in his chest and the thing that his chest dial says is a little unsettling to me hello hello strong man squeeze my hand.

1039
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:04,720
I can't.

1040
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:17,720
Where is this that's in the penny arcade apparently and he's just in his hand out and it's a little it's I think it's a little like low you can see where he's plugged in it doesn't feel super Disney ish does it but it's there apparently.

1041
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:30,720
Saying like his hand is like a crotch level that's not to say yeah yeah if you walked up to this yeah you would be shaking you in the groin so uncle uncle Sam will jerk you off for a quarter.

1042
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:40,720
That's what you're saying still looking for magic in Disneyland yes now that is intimacy that is a sexual intimacy there now this is the alpha I'm comfortable labeling in.

1043
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:58,720
Hello strong man squeeze my hand or put something else in there I don't know put something in my hand for and put the quarter in is there a quarter is there even a component to a quarter yeah there has to be he does it for free he just whoa he does yeah yeah Sam's just.

1044
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:11,720
I guess he's finally embraced the welfare state yeah that was that's another I mean this is all pre Disneyland so this is goes back to carnivals and yeah penny arcades.

1045
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:26,720
Mechanical Turk like this is all the stuff that robots giving you a hand jobs yeah that's old before that's all yeah tunnel that's what all of steampunk is heading for like that's what the more gears we put on stuff and hand jobs.

1046
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:32,720
Like eventually will end up with a steam powered robot.

1047
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:41,720
Well back in the turn of the century you you thought that it was a robot giving you a hand job but then you open up the box and there's actually a man and inside the box.

1048
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:50,720
Pulling little ropes and things and he's that magicians twin.

1049
01:08:51,720 --> 01:09:00,720
The way to picking your pocket.

1050
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,720
So yeah.

1051
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:16,720
Is there all the you know gives you cards or she has a she has a deck of cards and they change those out and put differently Disney designs on them I'm looking at a deck with you know tinkerbell and a small world.

1052
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:27,720
Hawaiian girl in the abominable snowman from a matter horn and that's a that's all detail I never noticed and you know again the cards are.

1053
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:40,720
Interesting and odd and specific I'm looking at one with that warns you about the wear of a man who has dark hair and wears a good deal of jewelry is a false friend.

1054
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:50,720
Is anyone does anyone have anyone in their lives or is there someone prominent in the world who fits that description dark hair and wears a good deal of jewelry.

1055
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:55,720
Good deal of jewelry that's a good question I mean ringo.

1056
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:58,720
Oh no.

1057
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:05,720
Well they had the darkness of his hair is false we know that that's true I think he still wears some rings.

1058
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:08,720
Yeah, possibly Mr. T.

1059
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:12,720
Yeah, a lot of jewelry yeah that's true.

1060
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:15,720
Good question I would have to think about this more.

1061
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:32,720
That does seem like I don't know what that does seem like a warning like an old person would give you and go like I don't you can't say that anymore I'm not quite sure what you are implying but I'm sure it's not great.

1062
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:37,720
I see I get what I get where you're going with it.

1063
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:55,720
Still, and it's just like I know that you're mad at an entity that country has not existed for 200 years I we don't have to worry grandpa, what do you grandma's morel the story.

1064
01:10:55,720 --> 01:11:13,720
Yeah, actually as you bring me this is a good point time to bring up because I got curious if as morel the exists in other parks, and what was my answer I think it may I think it was in the Magic Kingdom and Disney World and is not anymore, and I couldn't find an equivalent in Disneyland Paris.

1065
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:35,720
But there is a in Tokyo there continues to be a different fortune telling machine and you talk about non Disney this is this is very odd like why that why is this in Tokyo Disneyland grandmother's predictions.

1066
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:44,720
There's an old lady and kind of a broach and it says what does grandma say your answer is here.

1067
01:11:44,720 --> 01:12:02,720
I mean one thought is just like so there's something about I mean as morel is in a box too but why is a grandma box that that's unsettling to me I don't want and there's something like personal about intimate you might say about saying grandma is like your grandma why is my grandma in a box.

1068
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:12,720
And then I got curious so you see an uncle Sam back there to stick his hand out.

1069
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:27,720
And I was like well what yeah what does grandma say what is grandma's answer and one of the cards that grandma gives you is that a devil might come and poke you with an arrow in the night is a little cartoon of a of a devil.

1070
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:47,720
Poking a very like heavily flop sweating sleeping man who's extremely distraught you talk about bizarre details I had no idea you could go to Tokyo Disneyland and get this weird devil card the devil and his pitchfork are getting about the devil will get you if you don't watch out.

1071
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:58,720
It's like really point in there this is temptations in your way be strong be firm and you won't stray I mean what is he talking about having an affair.

1072
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:13,720
Or she's talking about a lot of these are about affairs seemingly so yeah maybe or I guess yes stray is the one that may leads me to think this is about an affair I mean that could you apply like going down a bad path with drugs for straying I guess.

1073
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:30,720
This is what your straight life Mike Pence went to Tokyo Disneyland years ago and got this card and that's why he won't be in an elevator with a woman yeah yeah I can't handle it because he remembers that the devil will poke him in the middle of the night it's placing temptation in my way.

1074
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:38,720
Is your Mike a Pence impression the same as your Aladar impression from dinosaur stand together.

1075
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:50,720
I can't be in the same room with a lady dinosaur but it's also a little further than it's Don Pardo with grandma.

1076
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:55,720
The devil and your host the devil.

1077
01:13:55,720 --> 01:14:01,720
With a guest a man with lots of jewelry.

1078
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:11,720
This is my fortune teller cards book that one episode of SNL.

1079
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:19,720
This fortune you can't get anywhere else you know you can't get it in the other souvenir shops in Tokyo Disney it's exclusive to the machine.

1080
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:27,720
Yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm feeling bad that I hadn't I hadn't seen grandma I missed I mean Scott was there and you missed grandma too.

1081
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:37,720
No I didn't I didn't see grandma and you know I do feel sad about that so it'd be nice to get more grandma.

1082
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:43,720
Style in our lives Mike could you give a grandma style prediction.

1083
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:48,720
I will say a fortune for Jason let's say.

1084
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:58,720
Okay for Jason I will say watch out for the devil lurks in the fridge.

1085
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:09,720
Well that one I already knew about because you know if you if you if you dance with the devil in the fridge too much devil ends up right on your hips you know.

1086
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:29,720
Hey can I can I say something real quick so what Jason and I used to be on a sketch team together at UCB and I think that when you guys first started the podcast we were we were on the team together show and I like yeah shortly thereafter yeah.

1087
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:39,720
I remember at the time I remember that you wrote a like at least a couple sketches about either theme parks or snacks.

1088
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:58,720
No you don't say I don't believe it and then hearing the podcast like it it it it came together to really form a picture of a man do you know what I mean like I started to get I started to get hints of it at the time and then through listening to this podcast I really got the full picture.

1089
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:27,720
Yeah and it's funny that you bring that up because the one time I have been to the museum at Kignac you Avery and I were at SF sketch fest with that sketch group and I had some sort of snack that gave me food poisoning so I spent much of one of the few days I was in San Francisco wandering fishermen's wharf just trying to get some fresh air and one of the ways I tried to cheer myself up was in the museum.

1090
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:35,720
So was there a banana banana hurt your tum tum too early in the morning.

1091
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:38,720
Oh yeah was it a banana in the morning without anything else.

1092
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:49,720
I I think it was eating fried rice with crispy crispy pig skin at one in the morning.

1093
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:54,720
It is probably the thing right.

1094
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,720
So I have I have an addendum to that fortune.

1095
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:59,720
There's also a knife in one of the.

1096
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:09,720
Okay yeah cuz it well if you cut a pie if you have a pie you've been cutting up slight sometimes you just put the pie with the knife back in the knife accidentally into the pie.

1097
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:12,720
Well that's if you have a friend you need to help out of a jam you know.

1098
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:18,720
Yeah like when Ma Beagle sends a knife to her sons to beagle boys in prison.

1099
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,720
Yeah.

1100
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:21,720
Okay.

1101
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,720
What Esmeralda who's should we go to the next.

1102
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:39,720
Yeah so I guess ultimately like Esmeralda is is not my favorite of the of the fortune tellers but I am glad that she's there on Main Street because it's like Main Street otherwise is kind of just a lot of shops you know it's nice.

1103
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:42,720
It's nice yeah there is something there that is not just a shop.

1104
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:49,720
Even the penny arcade now is I think is mostly not a penny arcade besides the weird Uncle Sam.

1105
01:17:49,720 --> 01:18:03,720
So yeah it's it's kind of the main way it's representing that and those like well like movies that you watch for a nickel which we will obviously cover individually one by one each old timey movie.

1106
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:07,720
Right brothers are something.

1107
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:16,720
But fortune read the pirate I mean that's what really jumped out and that seems like the biggest like element of the interactivity and everything.

1108
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:20,720
Yeah what do we know about this guy.

1109
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:33,720
Well I it's this is this is little corner over in New Orleans Square that I don't they've sort of expanded I think a little bit in the last so many years but I was a place I feel like I realized existed.

1110
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:36,720
I don't know like three years ago.

1111
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:46,720
Like there's a haunted mansion gift shop located here and then there's pirates kind of gift shop and they're both not in the traditional place of like immediately after coming off of those rides.

1112
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:56,720
They're just sort of tucked away in this little corner of New Orleans Square and this is similar this is in a similar spot and it feels like a little hidden spot to me.

1113
01:18:56,720 --> 01:19:09,720
Yeah I think they keep you know cutting off pieces of it this is this is right back near where you used to go to the court of angels which was just like a very nice pleasant themed courtyard that they eventually.

1114
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:18,720
Read did and made it still exists it's like the entry courtyard to club 33 now.

1115
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:45,720
And that there was an outcry about that the time people are not happy about that because I think a lot of people are taking pictures back there or be it engagement pictures or pictures of families over the years and I think people that was another secret little thing like these fortune tellers which is like oh you go back go to the end of this alleyway and there is a charming little like New Orleans courtyard it's got some quiet music playing that sort of thing.

1116
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:50,720
Let's take it back let's storm it storm in the court of angels.

1117
01:19:50,720 --> 01:20:01,720
There were a lot of good people going there that were just protesting not everybody there storming that courtyard weapons to storm it yeah I just want to go in and take a picture.

1118
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:06,720
I mean let's get on telegram and organize.

1119
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:08,720
Go from there.

1120
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,720
We do have to set up our presences on all of the weird.

1121
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:19,720
Yeah we were just ready to Jason had just finished our parlor account and then they took it off the man.

1122
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:34,720
Yeah so we'll try if it goes back up we'll be there was finally a place to say what we really think yeah finally your your parlor account is the third gate right.

1123
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:51,720
Yes well like Disney MGM studios we heard another theme park account was doing a third gate and we real quickly scrambled and found out the basics of what they were going to do and we're like we'll do a movie studio part two we'll do a parlor account too.

1124
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:55,720
So it's demolished on that.

1125
01:20:55,720 --> 01:21:07,720
But they added me I guess what I'm saying the court of angels gone we got to go experience it once a club 33 which was obviously very cool but not something I expect us to do a ton in our lifetime.

1126
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:19,720
But I feel like they've made little magic moment places here in the way they've they've set this stuff up and added this little piece of fun fortune teller fun.

1127
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:28,720
Well what's this what do you do with the app what what what does the fortune read do for you is to have the play Disney app fired up.

1128
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:55,720
Yeah so so if you I mean if it's working sometimes it doesn't work but if it's working you can go to a little like section in the app that says fortune read and you you say like I'm here and then the thing lights up and does its little like back and forth animatronic thing and then spits out one piece of a story and and apparently there's like oh yeah there you go.

1129
01:21:55,720 --> 01:22:07,720
And there's like 10 cards in each story I think and there's three stories and as far as I can tell like the stories aren't particularly interesting.

1130
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:17,720
That's not what I'm into do you know what I mean like I am a complete but I but I don't particularly care about what I'm getting from it.

1131
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:24,720
I just want them I want to have them you know yeah yeah yeah yeah I believe nothing has been too rewarding for you.

1132
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:31,720
Having like you have them in front of you and you're not looking at some like pearl of wisdom or quote that's changed your life.

1133
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:32,720
Right.

1134
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:38,720
You like you guys can can relate to the feeling of like just wanting to possess things.

1135
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,720
What every what are you talking about.

1136
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:44,720
Yeah.

1137
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:50,720
Yeah I mean I've got some I've got some oh wow some little animation final nations here too.

1138
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:56,720
Yes those are the Mickey shaped ones I have the Park stars which are not in the Mickey shape.

1139
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:58,720
The Park stars are better.

1140
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:03,720
The Park stars yes I always liked better because of that they've stopped making both I believe.

1141
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,720
Yeah I think that's true.

1142
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:09,720
Are any of these fortune tellers a Park star.

1143
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:13,720
Oh I think that they did I think that there's at least an Esmeralda.

1144
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:14,720
Is there?

1145
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:16,720
I think so.

1146
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:17,720
Let me look.

1147
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,720
See if you can pull that up.

1148
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:23,720
But is it the Esmeralda from hunchback.

1149
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:26,720
Oh maybe because I know they did movie versions.

1150
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:30,720
I don't see a Park star for the fortune teller.

1151
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:33,720
I see I see hunchback.

1152
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:34,720
Yeah.

1153
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:35,720
Final nations.

1154
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:36,720
I don't know.

1155
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:47,720
It is Avery like you said you might be one of the very few people committed to this sort of thing because when I looked at the YouTube videos about and typed in like Esmeralda

1156
01:23:47,720 --> 01:24:00,720
Main Street Disneyland Fortune read Disneyland there were certainly videos of people going and getting the fortunes but there was no like usually there's a 20 minute explainer where people like walk you through the story.

1157
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:01,720
It's like OK here's how you do this.

1158
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:08,720
Here's how you and and most of the blogs that cover this stuff did have like in 2018.

1159
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:14,720
Hey go to Esmeralda or Fortune read with the parks the play Disney parks app.

1160
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,720
And this is what you can do.

1161
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:21,720
But there has not been a lot of like follow up about it or like accounting of it.

1162
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:25,720
Yeah I think that this there's they've tried the different.

1163
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:28,720
What was the interactive thing they were doing in Frontierland.

1164
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:29,720
You know what I'm talking about.

1165
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:30,720
Oh yes.

1166
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:31,720
The game.

1167
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:43,720
You're like you know tried this stuff and it hasn't maybe taken off in a way but it's cool in concept and I'm a little upset with myself for not knowing more about it.

1168
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:50,720
I'm a little upset with myself for not knowing more about this and not experimenting more with the with fortune read in the app.

1169
01:24:50,720 --> 01:25:00,720
So I don't know if it just needs to get out there maybe this podcast is doing some sort of a service because I said definitely when I go next I'm going to do a little of this.

1170
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:03,720
I'm definitely going to scope that out.

1171
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:07,720
So really upset how upset at yourself are you.

1172
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:08,720
Let's see.

1173
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:13,720
I'm going to go with one ten ten being the most upset.

1174
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:14,720
Two.

1175
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:15,720
Two.

1176
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:16,720
Okay.

1177
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:17,720
All right.

1178
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:18,720
If it was more than two I would have been like I think you got it.

1179
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,720
You got to cut yourself a break.

1180
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:20,720
Okay.

1181
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:21,720
Fair enough.

1182
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:22,720
You know what I am too hard on myself.

1183
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:23,720
You're right.

1184
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:24,720
Yeah.

1185
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:25,720
I appreciate that.

1186
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:29,720
But thank you for sharing intimate details of your thought process.

1187
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:31,720
I am.

1188
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:35,720
I am the most intimate member of the podcast the ride trio.

1189
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:36,720
Okay.

1190
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:37,720
Well.

1191
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:38,720
Yes.

1192
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:39,720
Non sexually.

1193
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:43,720
Scott has left the zoom.

1194
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:54,720
You know that that reminded me of a of a of a story from like the first time that I went to Disney World as as a little kid.

1195
01:25:54,720 --> 01:26:04,720
We went to the the Morocco restaurant at Epcot and there is a there's a belly dancer there.

1196
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:17,720
And I remember being like so freaked out by any kind of display of sexuality that I hid under the table and cried.

1197
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:25,720
And then my family made fun of me for 30 years.

1198
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:27,720
They just never let it go.

1199
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:31,720
I hear that I can relate to that.

1200
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,720
I was a good little boy.

1201
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:34,720
Yeah.

1202
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:35,720
Yeah. Of course.

1203
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:36,720
And it's stories like that.

1204
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:40,720
I knew you would be a perfect guest for this podcast.

1205
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:48,720
And and we should I should mention to every you are notable in podcast right history as you are first iTunes review.

1206
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:49,720
Oh is that true.

1207
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:50,720
So thank you for that.

1208
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:51,720
Happy to do it.

1209
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,720
Yeah.

1210
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:57,720
Beware dark fates awaits those who listen to this podcast.

1211
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:59,720
Now that was the review.

1212
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:01,720
I didn't say anything about the contents of it.

1213
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:04,720
Like a hex he was doing.

1214
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,720
Let me praise.

1215
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:08,720
Let me praise Fortune Red real quick.

1216
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:13,720
They made Fortune Red look like an old jacked up animatronic pirate.

1217
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:19,720
They didn't make sometimes my criticism is they make some of the new animatronics look a little too nice and new.

1218
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:24,720
I think Red looks fine but she maybe doesn't look like jacked up like some of the other.

1219
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:28,720
And I know that she's not as well like weathered as the other characters.

1220
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:34,720
But I'm glad that he looks like they pulled a 60s animatronic out and shoved him in a machine.

1221
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:35,720
I think that's cool.

1222
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:36,720
Yeah.

1223
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:37,720
Yeah.

1224
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:39,720
Fortune Red looks like his face is about to fall apart.

1225
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:40,720
Yes.

1226
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:41,720
That's the and that's what I like about it.

1227
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:45,720
It looks like it's made of like dirt and it's going to fall apart.

1228
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:46,720
Yes.

1229
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:56,720
And what he does is his he's got a pointed finger and he just points back and forth between a map and a skull and yo ho.

1230
01:27:56,720 --> 01:28:00,720
Like a jaunty version of yo ho plays.

1231
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:02,720
Yo ho Pirates Life for me plays.

1232
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:07,720
And then he points as if to say death is lies upon this map.

1233
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:16,720
And then he spits you out of Fortune which are kind of indecipherable because they're so written in pirate and like seafaring slang.

1234
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:20,720
So yeah I appreciate that.

1235
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:21,720
I don't know.

1236
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:23,720
I actually don't know is it maybe they just grabbed an old pirate.

1237
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:26,720
They have all these old pirates lying around in Imagineering.

1238
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:28,720
They just shoved an old one in here.

1239
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:32,720
Also you just alluded to some this is confusing also.

1240
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:33,720
We should click.

1241
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:36,720
Fortune Red is not Red the Pirate.

1242
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:40,720
Fortune Red is not Red the Pirate.

1243
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:42,720
Red is two D's correct.

1244
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:43,720
Red the Pirate.

1245
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:44,720
Oh is it?

1246
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:45,720
I don't know.

1247
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:48,720
Which is not Red Rocket from Red Rocket's Pizza Port.

1248
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:53,720
The old name of the not good restaurant I'll declare.

1249
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:54,720
Yeah.

1250
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:59,720
Red is two D's for the new pirate Red on Pirates of the Caribbean.

1251
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:01,720
The female character that is two.

1252
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:02,720
I don't think I knew that.

1253
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:06,720
Like Chris Red a relative of SNL cast member Chris Red.

1254
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:09,720
Red the Pirate is not Chris Red and is not.

1255
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,720
Not Fortune Red.

1256
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:12,720
Fortune Red.

1257
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:15,720
And has nothing to do with Red Rocket Pizza.

1258
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:18,720
Nothing to do with Simply Red the 80's band.

1259
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,720
Nothing to do with Simply Red.

1260
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:22,720
Not the wrestler Amazing Red.

1261
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:25,720
Has nothing to do with Amazing Red.

1262
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:28,720
These are all different things.

1263
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:34,720
Yeah I'm looking at Red and Red my only criticism is that Red looks too nice.

1264
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:36,720
The pirate Red the new animation.

1265
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:37,720
Oh the pirate.

1266
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:40,720
Well I think I liked the addition of Red.

1267
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:42,720
It is very smooth.

1268
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:45,720
It's very clearly a newer generation of animatronic.

1269
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:53,720
But I think the issue with Red and Rosita is the audio needs to be worse.

1270
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,720
It's too fidelity.

1271
01:29:55,720 --> 01:30:04,720
It needs to be a little hissier and the dialogue needs to be a little more anachronistic.

1272
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:07,720
Not in content but in like stilted delivery.

1273
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:11,720
Well there's a lot of enunciation which is why you want people to hear it.

1274
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:14,720
But that wasn't the case in the old days of recording these voices.

1275
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:16,720
Where it's like ah.

1276
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:18,720
Like you can barely understand what these pirates are saying.

1277
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,720
And there's some charm to that.

1278
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:25,720
So yeah when you see a new animatronic especially one in the context of an old ride with old audio recordings.

1279
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:26,720
It really sticks out.

1280
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:29,720
She's like we want the rum.

1281
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:31,720
And then everyone else is like ah.

1282
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:35,720
It's just so much different.

1283
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:40,720
You should have gotten an old character actress who's drunk.

1284
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,720
To do the lines.

1285
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:44,720
And then like yeah mess up the audit.

1286
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:48,720
Then use it just like an old 60s reel to reel recorder and use that tape.

1287
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:49,720
Yes.

1288
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:50,720
To make it fully match.

1289
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:56,720
Because you can't throw like a lacy hard drive down the stairs to like add like you know.

1290
01:30:56,720 --> 01:31:05,720
You add stuff to the audio track in the way that like you could physically beat up analog media to get a certain effect.

1291
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:06,720
Yeah.

1292
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:07,720
Yeah.

1293
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:09,720
So yeah they.

1294
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:12,720
Fortune read again.

1295
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:13,720
Janky.

1296
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:15,720
Janky like you want it to be.

1297
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:19,720
You don't want anything too good is the truth right.

1298
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:23,720
You want everything to be a little bit bad.

1299
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:26,720
You want it to work consistently.

1300
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:28,720
Mostly consistently.

1301
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:31,720
I'm trying to think yeah I guess you know in Tomorrowland.

1302
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:33,720
I think you would maybe want.

1303
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:39,720
I think depending on the yeah what the land is you would want the animatronics to be like new pristine feeling.

1304
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:44,720
But every other land where it feels like it's a long time ago including Galaxy's Edge.

1305
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:50,720
You would want all the robots to be a little janky at least just from looks not maybe their movement necessarily.

1306
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:56,720
But you would want them to all feel haunted like there was a person that got trapped in the robot.

1307
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:01,720
And they were melting and that was their fate for the rest of time.

1308
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:04,720
So yeah fortune read is stuck throughout the rest of time.

1309
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,720
He was a human man.

1310
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:07,720
Yeah.

1311
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:08,720
And now he has to live in this box.

1312
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:10,720
Grandma really is in that box.

1313
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:11,720
Yes.

1314
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:12,720
Grandma can't get out of the box.

1315
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:13,720
That's a question.

1316
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:16,720
She was she was bad in her real life.

1317
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:21,720
And then she was cursed by the devil to live in a box in Tokyo Disneyland.

1318
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:27,720
They were all the fortune tellers or were recipients of bad fortunes that laid out the curse.

1319
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:31,720
They were all will be your eternal home and they thought it was a coffin.

1320
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:33,720
But right.

1321
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:34,720
They didn't read it right.

1322
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:36,720
They didn't understand.

1323
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:40,720
She looks a little like the grandmother and carousel of progress which someone pointed out.

1324
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:45,720
It's like the same grandmother animatronic that is in the haunted mansion somewhere.

1325
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:47,720
Yeah. It's a ghost in a rocking chair.

1326
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:48,720
Yeah.

1327
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:49,720
Yeah.

1328
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:50,720
Yeah.

1329
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:52,720
That's a fun creepy detail.

1330
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:53,720
So every you.

1331
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:54,720
So there's all right.

1332
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:55,720
So you've done this experience.

1333
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:59,720
You've kind of you've collected them all at least for one of the stories.

1334
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:08,720
And do you feel like would you recommend this to other people or is this just like well it satisfied my specific fascinations.

1335
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:12,720
I I think everybody should.

1336
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:16,720
I think it's a fun thing that you can show people when you bring them to the park.

1337
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:19,720
I think it's a cool thing that not everybody knows about.

1338
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:22,720
And you get a little keepsake at the end of it.

1339
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:28,720
And I mean the fact that they made it so it's free is so great.

1340
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:29,720
Yeah.

1341
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:30,720
That's you know what.

1342
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:32,720
We got a change shortage now.

1343
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:34,720
It's tough to find.

1344
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:36,720
I haven't used change anywhere in a while.

1345
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:39,720
So yeah we're all going to be lacking in quarters I think.

1346
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:42,720
And maybe you need them for laundry or something.

1347
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:49,720
So now they figure out a way where for just the probably now more expensive price of going to Disneyland.

1348
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:54,720
And download and just download the app and now you don't go to sling that change around.

1349
01:33:54,720 --> 01:34:02,720
Here's I think what I really want because because the stories are like fun but it doesn't it doesn't mean anything particularly.

1350
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:13,720
What I want is for I go to one of the fortune tellers and it spits out a card that tells me to go somewhere else in the park and find something else.

1351
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:14,720
Right.

1352
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:19,720
And I and I have to like go up to the top of the Tarzan tree house or whatever the hell you know.

1353
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:22,720
And then that sends me somewhere else.

1354
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:28,720
I want I want a fortune like a hunt throughout the park.

1355
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:30,720
And I don't think that's unreasonable.

1356
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:32,720
No I don't know.

1357
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:35,720
I wanted to cater to exactly what I want.

1358
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:42,720
No that's I think that's what they were trying with that game in Frontierland for a little while where there was sort of more of a hunt.

1359
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:44,720
But it was still it felt like very official.

1360
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:49,720
Well you needed to be somewhere at a certain time to give things out and then people would go off.

1361
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:57,720
But you're but I think yeah maybe your idea your plus up here is good in the sense that it's a less formal version of that.

1362
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:02,720
And you can find I mean they do little hunts like around Easter they go find all the eggs and mark them down.

1363
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:11,720
That's not quite as cool as this but maybe there are multiple choose your adventure or choose your own adventure type things with fortune telling machines and other other interactions.

1364
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:14,720
Or interactive elements that could be like that.

1365
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:20,720
I mean I think it's never it will never be able to last if they need park employees to to do it.

1366
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:24,720
If someone's job is to interact with someone and give them a clue all day.

1367
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:26,720
I don't think that will happen right.

1368
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:40,720
But if they had what happened they had this card game in Florida that you would go around and play like almost like a magic like a simplified Magic the Gathering kind of like game where you would cast spells and have character cards.

1369
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:57,720
And this sort of thing and it was free to study you got a starter pack for free and then you could buy stuff or they would give stuff with different cards to annual pass holders and they had been doing it for years and just recently like shelled it for the moment because I don't know that the demand was there.

1370
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:02,720
And yeah it requires I think some cast member interaction.

1371
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:09,720
So yeah so so yes as you were saying every like no because that that'll always get cut it always get cut.

1372
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:12,720
It'll always get cut when a human is having to do it.

1373
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:13,720
As it is to be a job.

1374
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:20,720
So figure out ways with these machines or other things to like send you on a little mission.

1375
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:33,720
Yeah and I don't and I feel like sometimes people to like discount the app because they don't want people that like they don't like the idea of somebody walking around the park just staring at their phone all the time.

1376
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:36,720
And I agree that's like a legitimate concern right.

1377
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:49,720
But I feel like if there's ways that like with with these fortune tellers what what's cool about it is that the app lets you interact physically with the landscape of the park.

1378
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:59,720
Do you know what I mean you're you're like using the app but it's not keeping you in the app it's like getting you out into into interesting things in the space.

1379
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:03,720
So if they could make you do more of that it would be awesome.

1380
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:10,720
Yeah there because they did there was a space mountain I mean I guess it exists still there's space mountain like game you could play.

1381
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:22,720
I guess we were playing it in line and it was awful because we were having to like just play it for 25 minutes this game with putting pieces together we're competing against other people online.

1382
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:32,720
And I was just like this is so stressful like I feel like that's maybe not as good of an application as what you're saying where it's just like you interact with this because you're close to it.

1383
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:43,720
It goes hey there's a secret little corridor you may not have known about go over there and then put your phone down you experience life you go over there and then you put your phone up for a second and then yeah you go somewhere else.

1384
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:53,720
Yeah that yeah that that feels a lot better with the application than having to play a stressful game against 30 people in space mountain line.

1385
01:37:53,720 --> 01:38:04,720
And there's already that game you put on your forehead I mean that's already like dominating Disney's not going to cut into the forehead card game which I can't summon the name of right now.

1386
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:07,720
Yeah I what is the name of it.

1387
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:10,720
I don't know my board card heads up.

1388
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:13,720
Yeah there you go yeah yeah yeah right.

1389
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:26,720
This is we're a great podcast for not knowing specific names I think every episode there is a search for a name which doesn't guaranteed have an ending it's the correct answer at the end.

1390
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:28,720
Sometimes we leave the audience hanging.

1391
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:32,720
We did figure out the clowns name which was.

1392
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:34,720
Cliffy cliffy.

1393
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:35,720
Cliffy the clown.

1394
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:39,720
And we did figure out that podcasting is what kind of medium.

1395
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:43,720
In in two minutes an intimate.

1396
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:46,720
And that's why he's the best that's why he's a pro.

1397
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:49,720
The most intimate on the show.

1398
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:55,720
Yes I think I believe every month you survive podcast the ride.

1399
01:38:55,720 --> 01:39:00,720
Thank you for joining us for this this trip through this intimate medium.

1400
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:04,720
Thanks for getting intimate with us.

1401
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:07,720
Let's exit through the gift shop is there anything you'd like to put.

1402
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:17,720
Yeah I mean you can you can follow me on on Twitter Instagram at Avery Monson it's AVERY M-O-N-S-E-N or if you have if you have kids.

1403
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:27,720
I just wrote a children's book called I am the longest dog that's published by Disney.

1404
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:28,720
Wow.

1405
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:34,720
Which doesn't it doesn't mean anything unfortunate doesn't it's a totally separate separate thing.

1406
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:41,720

1407
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:49,720
Oh great yeah I would like to check it out because I call our dog Edwin the very long dog often.

1408
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:51,720
That's true I'm not joking.

1409
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:52,720

Jason you're the only one who didn't do a fortune you do it do a fortune for Avery to close this out.

1417
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:31,720
Oh OK.

1418
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:40,720
While the path may seem treacherous and curving.

1419
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:46,720
Straight cut through is often the best choice.

1420
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:54,720
Is there anything else though maybe in that fortune Jason.

1421
01:40:54,720 --> 01:41:00,720
And when you encounter an old friend on the pathway you know he's got a knife.

1422
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:03,720
First.

1423
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:04,720
Okay.

1424
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:05,720
Okay.

1425
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:06,720
No.

1426
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:08,720
You feel okay about that.

1427
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:09,720
You think you can handle it.

1428
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:12,720
Yeah I guess I just got to stab everyone I know.

1429
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:17,720
Sounds like a plan.

1430
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:18,720
You took that right.

1431
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,720
Start stabbing guys.

1432
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:21,720
Yeah.

1433
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:22,720
You better get to it.

1434
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:39,720
When you encounter someone you know on that street in San Francisco that curves one way and the other and all the way down and you know it's just and you are walking right down the center of it like cars honking at you and then you run into an old college roommate.

1435
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:41,720
You know what to do.

1436
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:43,720
You know what to do.

1437
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:44,720
Stab stab stab.

1438
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:46,720

1439
01:41:50,720 --> 01:42:01,720
