1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,920
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,180
We don't have to have anything, you know?

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,600
We haven't set the bar there.

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:33,320
We don't have to say something clever for this episode on podcast The Ride the Second Gate featuring the Stargate.

5
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,020
Oh, we're in it, now we're in it.

6
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,040
Yeah, now we're in it.

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,380
It's the Maren, it's kind of the Maren start.

8
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,800
It's the Maren, yeah.

9
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,000
That's sort of a new thing we're doing now is doing the Maren start, sort of just like, you know, we're just bullshitting.

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,820
We're just shooting the shit, as they say.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,800
I think that's a cool move to incorporate in 2021.

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:48,600
Yeah.

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:56,040
Almost a, I think a decade into the Mark Maren discography, podcography, I don't know what the word is.

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,940
Podcography?

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,540
That's a horrible word, I kid, can't be that.

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,520
I don't know.

17
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,260
It's maybe up to us to decide.

18
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,860
Yeah, we'll figure that.

19
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,140
I mean, like, it took years to figure out that our listeners were called Cliffords.

20
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:14,240
So it'll take years to figure out that what our catalog is called, what our back catalog is called.

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,820
So long to perfect it.

22
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,140
Yeah.

23
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,460
To get the right, the perfect name that everyone agrees on.

24
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,160
Everyone agrees on it, they love it.

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,680
Today we are talking about a popular topic, I feel.

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,160
Much requested.

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,920
This is a much requested topic.

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,720
I think it's a lot to do with the name.

29
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,600
It's all about the name.

30
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,540
The name is really good and really perfect.

31
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,420
And it looks so good, neon.

32
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,400
It is just awesome to stare at that word.

33
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,080
Yes.

34
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,940
Because this, well, this is, I think, an especially good arcade.

35
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:53,320
I think, like, if you liked arcades and this, then you walked into this thing, you'd be psyched.

36
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,200
But ultimately it is an arcade.

37
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,200
It is in no way thematically really Starcade.

38
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,680
Right.

39
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,480
But the word does so much of the work.

40
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,640
It's one of the coolest words maybe ever invented, maybe ever created.

41
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,100
It is, and I believe not, maybe not copyrighted by Disney because I found some other Starcades.

42
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,400
And I think CBS had a children's cartoon block called Starcade for a brief while.

43
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,200
There's a 1981 game show.

44
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:37,880
And the reason I happened upon it, and I happened upon the website that has archived a number of these, is because I wondered, there is a famous WCW and then before that NWA, National Wrestling Alliance, pay-per-view called Starcade, which was sort of before WrestleMania.

45
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,460
Oh, yeah.

46
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,560
WrestleMania, which was like a super card where they would have different companies having, you know, big marquee matches.

47
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:49,300
And I texted my friend Justin and I said, who made up Starcade?

48
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,360
Kind of knowing the answer.

49
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:50,900
Dusty?

50
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,500
Oh, Dusty did.

51
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,160
Yeah, okay.

52
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:52,500
Dusty did.

53
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,640
Dusty Rhodes.

54
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,080
Father-in-law to past podcast, or I guess Brandy Rhodes.

55
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:58,760
Oh, right.

56
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,160
Oh, maybe I didn't know that.

57
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:00,400
Okay.

58
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,900
The American Dream.

59
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,720
And Dusty is a, was a legend.

60
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,940
He came up with a lot of gimmicks, came up with a war games cage match.

61
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,460
He also would take a lot of ideas from TV and movies he just watched.

62
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,240
So there's a Reddit post, and I don't know if this is completely accurate.

63
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,100
We could probably get a fact check on it, but somebody's like, how did the name Starcade come up?

64
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,880
Because there's nothing in Starcade that you would think about.

65
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,220
Like, WrestleMania makes sense.

66
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,140
It's crazy.

67
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,820
We're wrestling.

68
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,820
It's a mania.

69
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,000
It's, it's, of course.

70
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,200
What does Starcade mean?

71
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,300
Why would that be the name?

72
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,100
There are stars in it, wrestling stars, but arcade, I couldn't really.

73
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,480
Yeah.

74
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,680
And somebody's like, I believe he just saw the game show that started in 1981.

75
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,600
And he was just like, that's a cool name.

76
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,580
And then Starcade was born.

77
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,600
And now of course that's IP owned by WWE.

78
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,680
So is it spelled with two Rs though?

79
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes.

80
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,940
To get away from the copyright.

81
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,120
Wow.

82
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:56,800
Yeah.

83
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,200
Insert an R and then you're good.

84
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,480
But also superfluous.

85
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:00,740
Yes.

86
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,420
Makes you think of Ringo Starr, but it has even less to do with Ringo Starr than it has to do with Starcades.

87
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,060
Yes.

88
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,420
And Disneyland Starcade 77, right?

89
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,260
Yes.

90
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,780
I had an opening day, May 4th, 1977.

91
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,500
Same day as Space Mountain.

92
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:17,800
Yes.

93
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,080
Very exciting.

94
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,300
Because it's part of the Space Mountain complex.

95
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:32,860
This is maybe, I think if you are a more of a Disney world centric person or another part, if you're a Carowind centric person, you don't know you've never been to Disneyland.

96
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:39,700
It is, yeah, it's basically like part of the same building essentially as Space Mountain.

97
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:49,480
It went in along with the part of the same structure essentially as now it's the Captain EO enclosed theater or whatever, the Magic Guy theater.

98
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:56,100
But it was the outdoor stage that was built for cool bands like Halix to play.

99
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,820
And then the people mover goes through it.

100
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:07,520
It's one of those great interconnected, you know, Tomorrowland, everything working in harmony.

101
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,060
It's hard to imagine a Disneyland without the Space Mountain complex.

102
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,260
I just never seen anybody call it that before.

103
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,520
So that's somewhere in the research.

104
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,540
I'm like, cool, complex view that was coming.

105
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,140
The Space Mountain complex.

106
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,340
Yeah, I have a space.

107
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,080
I have a Space Mountain complex.

108
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:22,440
Right.

109
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,440
I think about it all the time.

110
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,740
We all sort of have saw a Space Mountain complex.

111
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,160
I think it's.

112
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,540
Yeah.

113
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:35,940
It's not been diagnosed by like a psychiatrist maybe, but it would prove to be our most our biggest hurdle in our lives.

114
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,640
For sure.

115
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:50,940
Yeah, I feel like if you were a teenager when like all of this was open and like really, really brand new and everything like this is, you know, into the 1980s when, you know, Disneyland before like,

116
00:05:50,940 --> 00:06:01,900
unfortunately, the Eisner group, the Eisner executives who were like, we're leaving money on the table by not charging triple the amount of for admittance to theme parks.

117
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:11,800
When there was like an outdoor stage and a brand new roller coaster with an arcade next to it, like seems like a cool hangout spot.

118
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,520
Like that's what you want as a teen.

119
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,680
And that's how it comes out of the gate.

120
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:28,820
But then you add that like, you know, like in the subsequent years that we put in a 3D movie with a relevant pop star and then we put in a simulator ride with a relevant movie.

121
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,560
This all at the end, there's so much neon around.

122
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,860
I think this all makes this is when Tomorrowland was cool.

123
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,140
They have it pretty current.

124
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,900
You could see why this would appeal to teenagers above the, you know, the fairy tale rides several steps.

125
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,280
Yeah.

126
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:56,060
And another important component of like mall like common spaces, a massive restaurant, the space place restaurant also opens around the same time as the space stage and space now.

127
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,120
What I believe now is Alien Pizza Planet or Alien Pizza Port.

128
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,860
You know, it just favorite.

129
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,320
It rolls off the tongue.

130
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,320
You know, yeah, this also suggested me.

131
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,700
I don't I don't want to get off on a rant here, but this also.

132
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,060
Oh yeah, you're talking about this complex and you're talking about arcade and you're talking about hanging out.

133
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:22,120
This is a different time of more romanticized time when they wanted teens and young people to come and hang.

134
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:36,200
Bob Chapek's on a call a couple days ago saying, you know what, there's going to be like a reward loyalty program that will replace the pass holder program because the pass holders were not spending enough to justify the program.

135
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,500
We were losing money.

136
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,220
And I don't like any of this shit.

137
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,620
I don't like the sound of this.

138
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,960
This sounds like, oh, we'll get like an extra day if we go five days a year.

139
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,640
Like it sounds it doesn't sound like this.

140
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,560
Like, hey, come on.

141
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,340
It's a fun hangout for locals anymore.

142
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:58,040
It's like it's a Starbucks rewards tricks where it's like, I spent eighty dollars and I got a single beverage value.

143
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:58,840
Yes.

144
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,380
So I don't.

145
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,980
So hearing this, yes, I get I get wistful for a bygone era.

146
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,180
Yeah, I got a little distracted during all that.

147
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,700
Because what, Jason, what you said about space place, I was like, OK, I think that's right.

148
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,620
Where it was.

149
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,020
I don't know anything about this restaurant.

150
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,140
I never thought about it before.

151
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,920
But wasn't that mission to Mars thing open like too late?

152
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:26,000
Like, wasn't that still open in the 80s, which is where the pizza port restaurant is now?

153
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:36,180
And I think while you're telling me what you think, but I just found this picture, which is I believe what we're looking at is the end of the Space Mountain Corridor,

154
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,800
where now it's where they give out the fast passes.

155
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,220
And I think at the end of that corridor was once a counter.

156
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,520
Oh, like you walk up to the counter restaurant, which like right near where you waited for.

157
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,160
You know what?

158
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,080
You're probably right.

159
00:08:53,160 --> 00:09:01,300
I have, you know, two thousands are a Disney bias because you used to get up to Space Mountain with giant outdoor escalator.

160
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,440
I'm forgetting about the speed ramps.

161
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:03,680
Yes.

162
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,560
I love the excuse me.

163
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,660
I know I didn't know you are correct.

164
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,600
You know, I'm saying excuse me to listeners.

165
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,100
I yeah, yeah, I am.

166
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,730
Please learn places.

167
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,380
No, I didn't know I do.

168
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:26,320
There was a restaurant all the way in the back and with those those whatever you call them, those like steel bars that feel very 70s, 80s airports that kind of like cascade up at an angle.

169
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,720
I mean, we're talking about this little alcove that I love so much.

170
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,460
Maybe one of the best parts of the Space Mountain complex.

171
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,820
Love that area where you waited for EO or Honey, I Shrunk the Audience.

172
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,160
No idea.

173
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,080
There's a restaurant back there.

174
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,760
Yeah, I don't think I did either.

175
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:48,800
Yeah, I mean, they've definitely, you know, it definitely seemed like a design sensibility for like the Golden Age of malls.

176
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,960
And now it is kind of a little bit like the current age of malls where it's like, well, the pennies are still open, huh?

177
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,020
The pennies are still open.

178
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:05,660
And that Space Mountain, you know, where you pass by lots of stuff that was something once with the Starcade being one of those things.

179
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,280
Yes, it's not really.

180
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,980
It's certainly a shell of its of its former.

181
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,440
Yes.

182
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:23,480
And in fact, the most recent Starcade news is a video I found on YouTube as of 2017 where the YouTube account for Disney meetings and events are encouraging you to have your event in the Starcade.

183
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:34,520
And we'll set up folding tables and pour you cocktails, strong cocktails or weak cocktail, probably depending on, you know, who's buying a cash bar, open bar.

184
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,680
How good is this company to its employees?

185
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,880
Yeah, for sure.

186
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,540
It's that saying you could host a party in the Starcade though now where there's no arcade like what?

187
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,280
That's such a barcade.

188
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,540
Yeah, no, Cade.

189
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,180
Yeah.

190
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,480
I mean, I guess is the name of the room now, but that's.

191
00:10:52,480 --> 00:11:11,320
I mean, my experience with it was like in the mid 2000s, you know, there was a handful of arcade games, a lot of merchandise, and then it got a second life in 2012 when Wreck-It Ralph opened and they filled it with vintage games and a bunch of free fix it Felix games.

192
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:21,760
And whatever they just put on a truck and moved over from the short limited time magic Flynn's arcade from California Adventure from Electronica.

193
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,900
The Tron Arcade.

194
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:23,140
Yes.

195
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:23,380
Yeah.

196
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,220
Switch rules.

197
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:24,960
Love that.

198
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,380
Yes.

199
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:25,600
Yeah.

200
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,380
Is that what they did?

201
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:34,620
So anything that was there in that temporary Tron Arcade just became part of they quickly put games back into the Starcade.

202
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,860
That was my guess.

203
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,080
And then I found like a retro gaming message board where someone's like, hey, it looks like this happened.

204
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,280
So it's a lot of the same stuff.

205
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:43,740
Yeah.

206
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,520
I mean, I think there were still some games in there.

207
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:57,920
It seems like 2015 is about when they were winding it down because then they ran limited time stuff for Big Hero 6 and the Tomorrowland movie in there.

208
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,800
I think we got pictures with Baymax in there maybe once.

209
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,540
Probably.

210
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:03,260
Yeah.

211
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,100
Yeah, I remember that.

212
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,100
That was fun.

213
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:14,120
But yeah, I get the Flynn's Arcade was the highlight arcade of my Disneyland going days.

214
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,540
Like that was like I had much more atmosphere and like experience like was character.

215
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,240
Yeah.

216
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:36,960
I think it had the illuminated like the weenie in a way of the Tron game where it's kind of off on its lonesome and calling to you down a big hallway like as it is in the movie before Jeff Bridges gets sucked in.

217
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,280
I thought they did a good job of recreating that like this like the Tron machine is special.

218
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,080
This is epic.

219
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:51,180
Yeah, one other thing like AP Lounge during they were running something called AP Days a few years ago.

220
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,560
Maybe you guys went to record it.

221
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:04,500
Like you could get stickers or magnets maybe and there were some phone charges and I think furniture like IKEA kind of furniture.

222
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,540
They were so good to us.

223
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,280
I miss being an AP so hard.

224
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,540
Chepik said that they're not going to have any furniture anymore.

225
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,000
He said it's over with furniture.

226
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,440
No more IKEA furniture in the AP Lounge.

227
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,520
And he's too comfortable.

228
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,940
It makes him sleepy and they don't want to spend money.

229
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:31,300
Yeah, it'll be the loyalty rewards lounge from now on and it'll be no furniture and it will just be like a punch card.

230
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,420
You'll get a punch card and then like your 20th Disneyland trip will be free.

231
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,740
Like that's it'll be a spot like a sub.

232
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,080
It'll be like a buy 20 subs get one free card.

233
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,960
You have to take a loyalty test to get in.

234
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,560
You have to answer like did you see the three men and a baby reboot?

235
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,540
Yes.

236
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,680
Did you enjoy it?

237
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,240
Yes.

238
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:56,120
Was Zac Efron did Zac Efron bring the franchise back to life with style and charm?

239
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:56,940
Yes, he did.

240
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:57,640
All right.

241
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,940
You may sit on this couch briefly.

242
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,560
Is this the first place you learned about what a triad or polycule is?

243
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,180
Please respond yes or no.

244
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,860
Do you wish Gordon Bombay to find love?

245
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:18,060
Do you hope he can get himself out of the dumps and find love with Lauren Graham?

246
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:23,300
Do you think adding Lauren Graham to the Mighty Ducks averse is in a word epic?

247
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,740
So let me ask what was your guys relationship with arcades growing up?

248
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,940
Are you big arcade guys?

249
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,360
Oh yes.

250
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,540
The arcade this is such a and I'm it's funny because it starts in the 70s.

251
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:52,040
I obviously this starts starts physically 70s but arcade like mania where arcade seemed like the most cool thing to possibly go to existed up until when I'm interested to talk to like a young person.

252
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,520
No.

253
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,500
Oh, are you kidding?

254
00:14:53,620 --> 00:15:01,880
There's still big business at the Jersey Shore because the kids want to go off and do their own thing from their parents for a little while and they're still making like new cabinets.

255
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,440
Oh yeah.

256
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,600
I know there makes I look I've been to a Dave and Busters in the last few years.

257
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,660
I know what's going on there.

258
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,240
Yeah, there's busters.

259
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:20,180
But I think last summer was the first summer I didn't text you like hey look there's a giant Batmobile now or like look there's a Ghostbuster where you have a proton pack sort of arcade discovery.

260
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,160
I've seen I've seen that Batmobile.

261
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:30,800
Is the Batmobile like the Batman Returns scene where Penguin is like having sex and then they're like shooting it from underneath and it's really really sexual?

262
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,900
No, it's the other direction where it's like you pick which Batmobile there's like 20 different Batmobiles.

263
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,220
Oh wait maybe I have series.

264
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,620
Batman movies like yeah.

265
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,200
So you're saying the youth of today are as excited about arcades as we were.

266
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:52,520
I don't know about as excited because I mean everyone's got you know games on their phones now.

267
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,700
Well that's yeah that's where I'm going where it's like the technology at home now is so crazy good.

268
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,980
That was always a big part of the draw because I loved video games as a kid.

269
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,380
But the arcades were way better than like Nintendo or Super Nintendo.

270
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:11,940
And now it's kind of lapped it like the technology goes faster I think on your home devices than arcade cabinets.

271
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,560
Yes.

272
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,340
Yeah, that's what I wonder.

273
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,220
I mean I had.

274
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:31,640
Yeah, we talked a little bit on Mortal Kombat episode like there was like such a an obsessiveness I would have I would like imagine playing the game for I remember going to the bowling alley and being like yeah yeah bowling's fine but the Ninja Turtle arcade cabinet is going to be there.

275
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,100
Yes.

276
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,040
And I hope that the older cooler kids aren't hogging it because they always did.

277
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,920
And then I could sneak in and play as one of the turtles.

278
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,740
And then I'd probably like die because I'd only get like a dollar worth of quarters.

279
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,980
Yeah, for sure.

280
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,600
I mean by yeah by the time we were hitting arcades.

281
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:59,380
It's like the golden age of our kid they're well-oiled machines licensing is kicked in so it's like Ninja Turtles Simpsons X-Men Ninja Turtles and Simpsons are the two I remember from being the young like Chuck E.

282
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:07,160
Cheese had that Simpsons one which is so funny in hindsight that it's just the Simpsons have to like punch and kick.

283
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,680
Smash people in the face with the vacuum cleaner.

284
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,100
Yeah, specifically the life is hell rabbits.

285
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,720
They're fighting the life is hell man grading.

286
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:16,560
Yeah.

287
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,520
Kill my old IP.

288
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,160
Yeah.

289
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:27,300
Bart is just like wailing on the life is hell rabbits with a skateboard and then like Smithers is bad and you have to beat up like a crusty balloon in the first level.

290
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:27,820
Yes.

291
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,380
Yeah.

292
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,260
It's just yeah.

293
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,660
Smithers is bad.

294
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,960
Smithers is a bad guy.

295
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,560
I never meditated on that.

296
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,080
There's the villain of the show.

297
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,880
There's I'm sure there's 10.

298
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,780
Times more funny things about it if I think about it.

299
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,040
Yeah.

300
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,420
Those two are loom large and then X-Men as well.

301
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:55,200
X-Men off the pilot the X-Men pride of the X-Men pilot that did not become a full series unlike the massive 92 different great costume designs.

302
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,640
Yeah, yeah.

303
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:57,620
The animated series.

304
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,180
We all know.

305
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:12,880
I think I've said my I have major arcade memories at Disney World and one of them includes that X-Men which I think was at was it at like an ice cream parlor in Grand Floridian maybe that's possible.

306
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,440
I mean mostly arcade the hotels had pretty big arcades.

307
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,660
There's a big arcade by Space Mountain.

308
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,500
Yeah.

309
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,080
Also in Florida.

310
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,760
I beat the X-Men.

311
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,920
I beat the X-Men game with a bunch of kids.

312
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,020
Yeah.

313
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,020
Yeah.

314
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,020
The X-Men.

315
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,020
Yeah.

316
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,020
I beat the X-Men game with a bunch of kids.

317
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,060
Yeah.

318
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,060
I탑t's a lot of people.

319
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,060
Yeah.

320
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,060
I'm not a big fan of X-Men.

321
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,060
I'm not a big fan of X-Men.

322
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,060
I'm not a big fan of X-Men.

323
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,060
I'm not a big fan of X-Men.

324
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,060
I'm not a big fan of X-Men.

325
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,060
I'm not a big fan of X-Men.

326
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,060
I'm not a big fan of X-Men.

327
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,180
I

328
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:25,980
Yeah.

329
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,760
That's a lot of fun.

330
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,060
You need the full team.

331
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:28,680
That's like a thrill.

332
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,320
Cheering you watching.

333
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,420
Well there was a four.

334
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,640
It was much like The Simpsons like a four player game.

335
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,920
So for like I feel like it might have been broken.

336
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,780
That was always the best when you find an arcade that was broken.

337
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,180
You could just keep hitting start.

338
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:41,920
Yes.

339
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,120
And I think that's how we beat it because there was never ever a chance.

340
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:52,060
I think that my mom would give me enough quarters for it for to make it through the whole game.

341
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:52,660
No.

342
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,600
I had an experience.

343
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,940
I had a couple of experiences where it was like kid in a candy store.

344
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,780
One every now and then down in Ocean City.

345
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:10,020
We would go to this one arcade that was off the boardwalk with my dad and brother and he'd give us each a roll of quarters and then we'd go to get ice cream afterwards.

346
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,780
And it's like I can't imagine like a like a pig and shit.

347
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,800
You know it was just the best thing.

348
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,420
If Monday were here he would have taken that roll of quarters and thrown it at some kid.

349
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,220
Yeah.

350
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:21,600
Yeah.

351
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,560
Well you wrap your fist.

352
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,900
You wrap your fist around.

353
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:31,400
It's been on a bicycle just like hitting kids with his quarters fist or you put it in a tube sock swing above your head.

354
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,140
Yeah.

355
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,400
You would have done a lot of different things with those quarters.

356
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,280
Bad man.

357
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,240
He's a bad man.

358
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:47,240
Also I played a Ghostbusters arcade in the contemporary arcade which was I never saw the game again.

359
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,860
It was not at the and we've talked about the little this fabled Little Caesars I talk about.

360
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,140
It's only barely documented online and was the only one of its kind.

361
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,880
That was the proof of concept for like a Little Caesar's Chuck E.

362
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,160
Cheese.

363
00:19:59,420 --> 00:19:59,620
Yes.

364
00:19:59,620 --> 00:19:59,840
Yeah.

365
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,980
And they had a Bucky O'Hare arcade there that I didn't see.

366
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,760
Very rare.

367
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,720
Very rare.

368
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,380
In my experience.

369
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:12,760
And I would remember like these would be very big deals on a trip to Disney World which is so funny in hindsight.

370
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:13,560
Yeah.

371
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,100
Right.

372
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,300
I like this.

373
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,720
The contemporary one is talked up.

374
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,060
Yeah.

375
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,220
And it's still there.

376
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:20,700
OK.

377
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,200
OK.

378
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:25,920
It's maybe had its like super height in 70s 80s.

379
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,340
Yes.

380
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,300
As did the contemporary maybe in general.

381
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:29,700
Yeah.

382
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,880
Not to say it's not cool now but just that's when like the style was right.

383
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,060
Right.

384
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,460
Very contemporary.

385
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,060
Yes.

386
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,560
Yes.

387
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:43,480
Now the contemporary is getting very contemporary by theming itself after a movie from 2001.

388
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,500
The Incredibles.

389
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,180
Does it have a general Incredibles.

390
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,640
Well they're redoing the rooms to add like more incredible stuff.

391
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:58,660
It's kind of like more concept already or credit is kind of like timeless you know evergreen sort of.

392
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,460
Hmm.

393
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,180
Design.

394
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,740
But it is very funny where it's like classic nature to.

395
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,460
Yeah.

396
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,220
Incredibles.

397
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:10,740
There's um yeah that's not quite as good as it was but that's not bad.

398
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:10,980
Yeah.

399
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,340
Something.

400
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,580
It's a way to some direction to take it in.

401
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:14,380
Yeah.

402
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:14,940
I know.

403
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,980
Disney World.

404
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,040
I never had time.

405
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,820
I'm like trying to jam it all in.

406
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,500
I like maybe I don't know.

407
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:27,180
I guess I recall little ones like it like it night maybe you're back from the park so I not run over.

408
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,440
I mean like I.

409
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:41,040
I talked before when the StarKid came up before about how when I did a school trip to Disneyland and everybody agreed the whole class agreed to spend lots of time at the StarKid and I lost my mind.

410
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:41,360
Right.

411
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:41,600
Yeah.

412
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,340
What are you talking about.

413
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,100
These are games that are elsewhere.

414
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,820
Why would you not take advantage.

415
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:51,960
And I think that I may have broken off from the group in a way I was not supposed to.

416
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,480
I think I'm like I got to get on that people mover.

417
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,200
I'm getting on a ride.

418
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:54,580
Yeah.

419
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,060
Yeah.

420
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,980
I'm not crazy.

421
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,440
We both did that.

422
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,420
We both went to the.

423
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,440
I was a chorus group.

424
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,580
We were to Hershey Park.

425
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:06,820
My one friend just wanted to do bumper cars and do the arcade because he was too scared of anything bigger.

426
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,880
And we weren't supposed to go off on our own.

427
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,340
But I'm like I am.

428
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,620
And then like and I did a bunch.

429
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,920
I did roller coasters.

430
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,960
I had a hot dog.

431
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:25,400
And then when a teacher almost saw me some other kids I knew were walking by and I was like hey just act natural like just pretend I've been with you.

432
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,480
And they're like what.

433
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,620
I like just keep walking.

434
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,400
Don't worry about it.

435
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,420
Kids you knew or not.

436
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:29,940
Kids I knew.

437
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,380
OK.

438
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:30,660
OK.

439
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,660
Wasn't a stranger.

440
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,980
I wish I had had been precocious enough to address strangers like hey act natural.

441
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,500
You're fake laugh fake laugh.

442
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,100
Yeah.

443
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,260
Give you some tokens after.

444
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,040
Yeah I don't know.

445
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,060
I would never by the way those that stresses me out both those stories.

446
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,060
Well I think clearly both Jason and I too but like it would just you had to do it.

447
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,380
Yeah.

448
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:52,940
No I know.

449
00:22:52,940 --> 00:23:00,080
I went twice and he fucked me the first year this guy because he's like he didn't want to do any of the big stuff.

450
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,660
And I'm like you son of a bitch.

451
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,620
And like we had all like group.

452
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,860
I think they it's like all right.

453
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,160
Who's everyone going to be around with.

454
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,220
So we have a general idea where everyone is.

455
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,620
And I was like I'm not making that same mistake again.

456
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:22,880
Oh and then the third time we went on a course trip a third time and my dad was kind so kind because the school the formal dance was that night.

457
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:33,220
And that like ninth grader 10th grade formal and they refused to let us arrive late even though we were going to be back in time to catch the last 90 minutes of the dance.

458
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:38,600
So my dad drove up to get us after we had a few hours in the park and drove us back.

459
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,300
I mean it's probably 90 minutes to Hershey Pennsylvania from where I grew up.

460
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,200
But still that was very kind of him because I know that's right.

461
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,660
Doing that drive immediately round trip sucks.

462
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,380
And also I was an idiot.

463
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,800
Why did I get formal sucked dances suck shit.

464
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,720
Don't go.

465
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,380
If you're at a theme park don't leave it.

466
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,460
Stay there teens stay there.

467
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,040
Stay at the theme park.

468
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,360
It will just make you anxious.

469
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,140
School dances.

470
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:07,900
Wow.

471
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,800
School dances.

472
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:14,580
I took your advice well into the past when I did not go to any prom or homecoming.

473
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,400
I went to two proms.

474
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,840
There's nothing that's that's correct.

475
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:20,360
Yeah.

476
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,500
Also if you have fun.

477
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:26,860
I would say I know what you're saying but that's stupid to not go and I recognize what was stupid about it.

478
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:35,740
Yeah I remember one school dance I stayed home eating Chinese food watching a blockbuster rental of memento and I was like this is the best night of my fucking life.

479
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:44,600
You know I do I I don't I hate to revert back to how I felt when I was 16 17 but that sounds great.

480
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:58,220
I remember my senior prom that instead of my weird friend and I blew up a fake building like a like he got little fireworks and there was he made a little model building for some movie video that we never ended up finishing.

481
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,140
But like we blew up a little building instead of being a pro.

482
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,360
I don't regret that either.

483
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,220
I mean that's cool.

484
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,180
I think that's beautiful and I think that's really sweet.

485
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,280
I did go to two proms and they were nothing but stress.

486
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,680
I was definitely stressed but I had a good time.

487
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:28,900
Would it surprise you to learn to learn that one time I went to a dance with a girl and then her like I didn't know her so well and I didn't know her group of friends so well.

488
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,120
But I am one friend who went alone.

489
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:38,420
We all went back to my house and I forced them to watch TLC wrestling matches on our TV for a couple hours.

490
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,580
That's all right.

491
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,280
Hours.

492
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,660
I don't mean medical blunders.

493
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:48,160
Maybe at least maybe a couple hours after junior prom we went back to someone's house and I brought I like had a bag of DVDs.

494
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:53,780
I was like what does everyone want to watch and we're like I guess Jay and Silent Bob strike back and I'm like great.

495
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,380
Of course.

496
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:54,760
Yeah.

497
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,400
Like I think I like TV.

498
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,920
So it's like all of them were Kevin Smith ones.

499
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,580
So you're probably statistically you're probably going to end up on that.

500
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,780
I mean I had fun at school dance.

501
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:11,920
I'm just saying like oh I was well you know but the other.

502
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:17,560
Oh I had an arcade memory a very arcade specific that I have a feeling you guys did not experience.

503
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:32,060
Anytime I went to an arcade thankfully I didn't have to worry about it for too many years but for a number of years as I walked in the arcade I was like I hope to God there's milk cartons because I had to stand.

504
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,080
I had to stand on milk cartons when I was younger to get to the control.

505
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,600
I was too short to get.

506
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,760
I thought you needed like a school lunch milk carton.

507
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,600
Oh no no no no need a hit.

508
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:51,500
I know cartons or some had like you know wooden crates or like glorified apple box or whatever.

509
00:26:51,880 --> 00:27:00,460
But yeah that that was I mean I could suffer but like I always played the games better if I was you know the correct.

510
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,620
Proportion to play them.

511
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,160
Yeah that sucks I'm sorry.

512
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:09,780
I wish though you wanted every arcade to have like a 2% milk that you could sip out of.

513
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:17,680
I don't think I was necessarily the most clumsy child but I would have been smelling milk left and right if I was trying to manage a milk carton and an arcade game.

514
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:25,460
As as a kid and I always thought wouldn't it be great to have an arcade cabinet at home.

515
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,880
I remember going we would go this is just a thing I guess you did in the Midwest and other places.

516
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,680
We would just go look at model homes sometimes.

517
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,360
Yeah yeah I did some of that.

518
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:34,880
Oh yeah.

519
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,560
Those are themed environments sometimes.

520
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,020
Yeah.

521
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,180
That's a good reason to do that.

522
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,740
And I remember we went very it was very close to our house.

523
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,800
I mean you know grandma would come over and we'd just go tour some new houses.

524
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,640
Which is funny.

525
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,300
Yeah that's still my parents thing for sure.

526
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,560
Everyone looked at the house it was nice.

527
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:58,480
Yeah and I remember one of the display they had in the basement for this one house they had an arcade in it and I was like oh my god.

528
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,060
This is this is must be the richest person who ever lived if they had this.

529
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:11,360
And now recently they've been putting out smaller scale versions of arcade cabinets you can buy.

530
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,480
So you can buy the Ninja Turtles arcade.

531
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:19,140
It's not as big as a normal cabinet but for like 300 bucks you can get a smaller version.

532
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:31,100
But I think I would play it once or twice and it would sit there because it's sort of not convenient to stand always and play.

533
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:31,620
Yeah.

534
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,400
An arcade.

535
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,860
Yeah it becomes like it's a thing that you think that you want around.

536
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:41,640
There may be listeners who have arcade cabinets and could tell us it's the greatest thing ever to have it.

537
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,780
I think you've got it there's got to be like a lot of traffic in your house to make it worth it.

538
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,100
To get like the wow right out of it.

539
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,000
There's got to be like a lot of kids coming over or a lot of people your age friends who want to play it.

540
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:58,340
I remember you guys are going to parties at the birthday boys house when they all live together.

541
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:58,980
Oh yeah.

542
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,440
Sure.

543
00:28:59,480 --> 00:28:59,640
Yeah.

544
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,160
Because they had a Ninja Turtle.

545
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,240
I mean that's and they were they like that was a real a time.

546
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,800
So that was that like they aced it perfect made it like oh I got to go back there.

547
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,140
That was a real one to a real arcade.

548
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:12,500
Yeah.

549
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,900
Very air brushy.

550
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:20,700
Like that specific way that they looked only on that cabinet and no in no other media you know what I mean.

551
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,440
Yes the suit.

552
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:32,140
Well what's really fun is the I've mentioned many times NECA toys makes all these Ninja Turtle things including arcade toys and they have that art on the boxes and stuff.

553
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:32,980
Yeah.

554
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,340
Weird suit looking things that like you never saw again.

555
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,080
April looks really funny.

556
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,100
The whole thing and Michelangelo's bandana is yellow.

557
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,100
Yes.

558
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,280
That always is weird.

559
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,320
Why is it yellow.

560
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:51,560
And then it just became a color that doesn't exist in nature because it would immediately get a sun or fluorescent light down.

561
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:52,380
Yes.

562
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:52,940
Oh right.

563
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,080
They all look like shit.

564
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,980
It would fade.

565
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,160
Yeah.

566
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,860
So that makes sense.

567
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,260
If you have a party house which yes that would that's a good call.

568
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:07,160
One of the you know one or two of them were heroes in that they sacrificed.

569
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,780
They they sacrificed to have a party house because one or two of them did not have a door.

570
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,060
Oh yeah.

571
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:22,560
One or two of them were sleeping in the downstairs open area and I think had the curtains set up which I know is kind of a common like cost saving divide a one bedroom apartment.

572
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,080
Yeah.

573
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:34,560
If people don't know what we're talking about birthday boys are a sketch group that Mike Mitchell Mitch from doughboys was part of and there were seven guys and five of them lived in a big house and there would be big parties there.

574
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,200
Yes.

575
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:41,520
And like you know like ecology like packed the house is packed type party.

576
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,080
Yeah.

577
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,640
And then they and then they moved out of that and then no party house replaced it.

578
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,040
No no parties.

579
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,360
There were two I mean there's we'll do an episode on a party houses that we party that later.

580
00:30:53,500 --> 00:31:00,120
I'm sure there were there was another party house off a sunset called Camp Hollywood.

581
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,740
That was also I don't know if you get invited to Camp Hollywood.

582
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,140
OK.

583
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,600
Well we'll talk about that off air.

584
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:11,340
But that was a tell me a give drop every name every fellow podcaster now.

585
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,060
I think every one of them was a good guy.

586
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:16,960
Every person at every one of those parties back then has a podcast today.

587
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:22,460
I think to you saw a snapshot of a 2011 kind of way all do you see me in funny or die.

588
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,320
I think every single person is a good chance.

589
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,180
Yeah.

590
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,160
Yeah.

591
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:35,240
And look these were stressed that they weren't as stressful as school dances but reasonably stressful and the awkwardness.

592
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:44,960
I think the awkwardness levels probably as high if not higher but managed by weed and cigarettes and beer.

593
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,480
So you know you don't have that in high school.

594
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,220
You can't really you got to sneak in.

595
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:57,980
I don't want to.

596
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,440
Yeah I don't want God to be mad.

597
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,300
No I had the complete Kevin Smith filmography.

598
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,400
I did not have.

599
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,540
I wonder what that stuff is.

600
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,180
They keep talking about and do.

601
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,740
Well Kevin wasn't getting high back then.

602
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,280
So you were just.

603
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,500
No I was following his lead.

604
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:17,860
It was saying Kevin didn't get high until after Zack and Mary and as the legend goes.

605
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,140
Yeah that's true.

606
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,520
More reasons to not.

607
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,080
OK.

608
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,800
Let's talk about the with of about our kids.

609
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,660
Let's talk about StarCat.

610
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,360
Let's talk about this specific place and what's what sets it apart.

611
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:39,820
One big thing that unfortunately not in a very long time but when it came out of the gate two stories this is a two story.

612
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,240
Yeah.

613
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:46,020
And even though there may be one story arcades that had more games and bigger space doesn't matter.

614
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,760
Two story really cool.

615
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,940
Also would you also call that a speed ramp.

616
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,260
I guess you would.

617
00:32:51,260 --> 00:33:02,860
Not an escalator but just but like airport airport style ramp you know that you and if you run up that thing and it's moving on its own.

618
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,580
Yeah.

619
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:04,680
What.

620
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,060
It's incredible.

621
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,480
It's better than sex.

622
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:14,180
Running up a ramp that is also moving on its own moving whatever faster.

623
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,380
This whatever sex is like that's better than it.

624
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,200
That's what I yeah I think you're right.

625
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:39,120
And this upstairs area now one of the actually accessible parts of StarCade because it's the extended outdoor queue for Space Mountain.

626
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:55,420
I was going for yes long and the windows you could do like it's like slightly dark and slightly tended but not really windows so you could always see into that StarCade second floor and see that nothing was going on up there.

627
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:55,820
Yeah.

628
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,640
Why not.

629
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:01,240
So it was exciting that they started using the room even if it is just for more line.

630
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:01,940
Yeah.

631
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:15,280
It is much better than cooking out in the sun like cooking out in the outdoor switchbacks and just staring at like why is there a sniper's crosshair painted two stories tall on the ground.

632
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,700
Oh I love that though.

633
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:24,180
I like that was that was my dream is like is there some way to get married in that spot on that very that X.

634
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:24,860
There is.

635
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,460
I do like it.

636
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,360
But it would cause.

637
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:27,980
Yeah yeah.

638
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:28,320
Yeah.

639
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:37,360
I carry Nick Cannon got married on that I think is probably people who've gotten married there you've heard you know their names.

640
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:37,940
Yeah.

641
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:38,440
Yeah.

642
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,800
Very famous people.

643
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,920
I did however.

644
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:49,760
So this is this is this like wonderful dream experience which is that and I might have talked about this in the show a long time ago.

645
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:58,860
I was I got to be part of a film shoot or video shoot I guess in Space Mountain.

646
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:12,080
And this this experience caused me to be just the crew and the actors of this thing hanging out in Space Mountain from Disneyland closing till like five in the morning.

647
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,820
Yeah this was one of the best things I ever got to do so surreal.

648
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,280
And here's here's the great part about it.

649
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,460
I didn't really have a job on the shoot.

650
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:29,460
The people were nice enough to just say hey you're a dork you're going to want to just hang out in Space Mountain for a while you want to go.

651
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,900
Yes please yes.

652
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:36,840
So they pretended that I had a job or was like taking notes for the head or something and I did not whatsoever.

653
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,240
So it was just this insane dream like I'm just going to hang out.

654
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,060
I just like kind of like lounged on the floor.

655
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,100
I took a lot of pictures.

656
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,760
I walked the queue entirely by myself.

657
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:59,180
And when after I did that like I walked through the queue and then realize and then I was up on Space Mountain patio and I realized like like oh I'm in Disneyland alone right now.

658
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:03,840
This is like an out of a dream where I'm looking out and there are no other people.

659
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:11,380
And I like what can I do what can I do within reason I can't exactly you know run around and like kiss robots or something.

660
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,900
Obviously my deep seated dream.

661
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,800
But what can I do.

662
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:21,060
So I ran I'm like into Marlin by myself and knowing that probably is only going to last a minute.

663
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:32,000
Like somebody's going to tell me to get out of here and I was down at the well to that one I walked into the Magic Eye Theater which I think had not been running for a little while I just opened a door and was just in there.

664
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,040
Whoa whoa whoa closes door got scared really quickly.

665
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:53,420
And then I'm looking at the starcade and the starcade doors are open and there was no barricade on the speed ramp and for now like at least a decade it's that the second floor has been closed and I'm like oh my god this is your chance you can go to the second floor of the starcade go go go.

666
00:36:54,200 --> 00:37:02,580
Sprinted up that ramp not speeding not moving on its own so not better than sex for that reason is a regular still right.

667
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,360
The same really the same as sex.

668
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:20,080
That's exactly as good as sex is and then as as satisfying of a finish as sex can have because then I got up to the top to see an empty room and a fading mural and you know like a box.

669
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:39,140
And truly that was like oh my god wow a box really like being in that I don't know like you build up a space like that like why would they block it off it's so special and cool up there and how I get to do it and truly it was nothing but like I but still such a great like loopy.

670
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:39,620
Yeah.

671
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,380
Yeah.

672
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:53,380
Thankful for you can see into that there's video on YouTube because the people mover you used to be able to see into the second floor starcade and you used to be able to see in Mickey star traders.

673
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,180
Yeah.

674
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:04,100
And it seems like there were some recollections of starcade online too and you can see in the video that it's a lot of air hockey tables up there.

675
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:11,740
And there are some arcade cabinets to think pinball was mainly on the second floor.

676
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,400
Yes.

677
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:17,500
For a while it seemed like a lot of pinball or exclusively pinball pin.

678
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,000
I was not a pinball kid.

679
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,200
I liked pinball for a change of pace every now and then.

680
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,060
Sure sure.

681
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:39,220
It was more of a pinball man still more of a pinball person in a way maybe because like yeah video game you can play at home not all video games some you know arcade specific but being that it is such a physical tactile experience love that Adams family.

682
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,060
Sure.

683
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,280
One yeah up fester.

684
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,220
There's currently a monster pinball.

685
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,160
Yes.

686
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,100
So good.

687
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:46,820
I played this.

688
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:50,020
It's at the Burbank mall not far from here.

689
00:38:50,320 --> 00:39:00,260
Just a rad so many effects and odds and ends and if you're rolling you get so many videos you get so much grandpa Al really fantastic.

690
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:16,460
I got so I was like I got to look up the company NECA style that does this and I don't remember it anymore but I think they do really good Star Wars pinball machines whatever it's like a very current 2021 my own the pinball game.

691
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:21,560
Yeah, there, there was a ghost there's a newer Ghostbusters pinball I think I've played that's really fun.

692
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,600
I feel like pinball.

693
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,320
Maybe.

694
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,400
Yeah, I think so.

695
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:32,260
There's a rolling stone pinball game at the park MGM that I enjoyed playing at the off the record lounge.

696
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,360
Oh yeah, I know what you're talking about.

697
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,660
Yeah, I think I saw it.

698
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,260
Yeah.

699
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:37,820
Okay.

700
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,300
All right.

701
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,620
I think there's a soprano pinball game that's pretty fun.

702
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:57,840
And there, we were at Comic Con like the last Comic Con at one of the hotels they had a bunch of gaming like vendors set up and they, I think they were selling shrunken down pinball cabinets that you could put in your home with geo at that point.

703
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,440
Yeah, yeah.

704
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:58,720
Yeah.

705
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,480
And they looked pretty good.

706
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:00,960
I don't know.

707
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:05,780
Yeah, I feel like pinball still has a mystique that maybe video games like don't.

708
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,180
Yeah, video games are just so common.

709
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:18,180
That's the thing you won't have now like there's that's probably more valuable because yeah, yeah, if I have a PS five now and it's like that's actually more powerful than most Dave and Buster games, like the hardware in there.

710
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,820
Yeah, but like a pinball date and change it.

711
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,500
It's not.

712
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:28,300
Yeah, time that it was built and like VR like at home VR is already a thing and will only get better.

713
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,340
Yeah, next in the near future.

714
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:30,900
Yeah.

715
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,540
There was some VR in Starcade.

716
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,860
Did you guys catch this?

717
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,660
That there was a.

718
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:57,180
This was an Epcot thing we might have talked about this in I think this was at Innoventions that there was an Aladdin magic carpet VR experience that I associate with Disney World and I don't remember it being at the Starcade but people online mentioned that it was at the

719
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,220
Big clunky helmet.

720
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,940
You're flying a carpet around, you know, the Sultan's Disney Quest.

721
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,620
Was it different than the Disney Quest one or was it the same?

722
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,500
Oh, was it?

723
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,480
Yeah, was it a Disney Quest?

724
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,020
Not.

725
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:17,860
I feel like I'm remembering some other because there was like an Imagineer test lab at Innoventions that might have been like a cousin of this.

726
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,340
Okay.

727
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,780
But was this it?

728
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,320
Yeah, maybe it was.

729
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:25,600
There was an Aladdin VR Disney Quest and I'm sure I mentioned it on the our Disney Quest episode.

730
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:35,040
That's the one that I was the most excited to do was ride the carpet going to Cave of Wonders and I did it and I immediately wanted to throw up and felt sick almost the rest of the day.

731
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,980
It ruined the rest of the Disney Quest day.

732
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,680
I felt sick as we boarded the plane that night.

733
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:43,740
We had to de-board the plane for some mechanical reason which was scary.

734
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,680
Oh, jeez.

735
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:56,620
And then I remember they gave us a voucher for a sandwich in the airport and I ate a sandwich, you know, seven or eight and then I was like, I feel a little better and I had been sick all day just because of the Aladdin VR.

736
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,780
Geez, threw you the whole day.

737
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,380
Oh my god.

738
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,420
Yeah, it ruined the rest of Disney Quest which again I was so excited to do.

739
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,600
Like when we were that was like my number one going down there.

740
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:12,160
Lured you in and then like the Cave of Wonders lured you in and then only peril awaited you.

741
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:12,660
That's right.

742
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,380
Inside.

743
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:24,180
Yeah, I don't know much about what this was like at that Starcade or what the whole experience was but I did see it in looking for validation like yeah, was that Aladdin thing there?

744
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:31,600
I saw on Twitter a couple people mentioned it and somebody said that they got to go and said there was a huge influence on them and got them thinking about VR.

745
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,980
And then I look at that person's bio and is one of the founders of the void.

746
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,180
Whoa, really?

747
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:36,620
Yeah.

748
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,420
So they're there as a kid or a teen going VR thing huh?

749
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:43,320
And then they went on to nail it so much better.

750
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,180
So I hope they're okay that company.

751
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:46,100
He didn't.

752
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,620
Well, something's weird.

753
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,400
Yeah, what's going on?

754
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,160
I don't know that Taylor Swift lawsuit's gonna go well.

755
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,680
I haven't seen an update on that.

756
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:58,960
But yeah, it sounds like at least he didn't get violently ill or anything.

757
00:42:59,060 --> 00:42:59,840
I guess not.

758
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,060
Which is good.

759
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,740
Yeah, could have been there would have been no void I suppose.

760
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,960
Yeah, a lot of we were talking before like there's not a tie.

761
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,000
I was trying to find like is there like a massive database that says all the games they had at the Starcade and there is not.

762
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,920
No, Yesterland has some good pictures from the 90s, some good neon neon stuff.

763
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,160
That's my dad.

764
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:23,720
Those two like glass cases with like kind of loose squiggly neon side.

765
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,380
So cool.

766
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,000
I don't remember this mid 90 mid to late 90s.

767
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,860
Also a good time for arcade.

768
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,380
They've got the tiny first time crisis.

769
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,500
Of course, time crisis too is the preferable one.

770
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:38,400
It's got there's an area 51 next to it gauntlet legends.

771
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,920
That was another good one.

772
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,040
Good to play with people.

773
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:44,120
They have the Aerosmith game where you shot records at like aliens.

774
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,740
I wouldn't be surprised that there's a revolution X.

775
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:46,900
Is that what you're talking about?

776
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,200
Yeah, I, I, oh man, we got to maybe we should do it.

777
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,220
That was a revolution.

778
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,180
Well, we got to the Simpsons arcade.

779
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,640
Yeah, there are a lot of fake guns.

780
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,740
It's crazy to see.

781
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,940
I mean, there's still plenty of fake gun games in arcades, but it's crazy to think like, oh, this is the middle of Disneyland.

782
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,920
Oh, yeah, there's a with area 51 shooter rifle.

783
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,620
Oh yeah, that's true.

784
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:10,900
There is still a shooting gallery.

785
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,440
Yeah.

786
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,280
So some of them wouldn't start this now.

787
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:14,840
They wouldn't.

788
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,140
Well, yes, that's grandfathered in.

789
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,360
Yeah, at least for now.

790
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:18,820
I mean, who knows?

791
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,240
Maybe the best was different.

792
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,060
They needed them then.

793
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:28,200
Yeah, they had this dispose of their bottles and cans in some fashion and they only knew one solution for most of their problems.

794
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,040
Shoot it off.

795
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,500
Get a can off the fence.

796
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:31,200
Yeah.

797
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:44,120
Somebody on Reddit said their memory of of the starcade was sitting like standing around and watching kids play Mortal Kombat, which is very funny because people are like Mortal Kombat in Disneyland.

798
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,940
That is strange, which I believe the arcade cabinet.

799
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
You could turn the blood off.

800
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,000
Yeah.

801
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:51,280
Right.

802
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:51,640
Yeah.

803
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:51,900
Yeah.

804
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,460
But I think you could you would still be, you know, you're beating the shit out of somebody and then you could kill them.

805
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,540
It just wouldn't be bloody.

806
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:03,940
I guess nobody was like really maybe the starcade was kind of out of sight, out of mind.

807
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:04,520
Yeah.

808
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,340
Getting those getting those quarters.

809
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:09,080
Well, I think that that's come up a lot about that.

810
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,900
Like the 80s and 90s about the theme parks.

811
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:21,200
Like, yeah, corporate used to watch the theme parks a little less obsessively unless they were spending too much money or not earning enough money.

812
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:25,880
But like you would have odd little things or like stuff that would sneak through.

813
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,180
Yeah, this is like the thing I think I've said before.

814
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:43,000
I was watching an interview with Bob Newhart and he talked he talked about how it was better in Vegas when the mob ran everything because he's like before corporations came in, the mob was like, OK, these parts of the business could be doing less well, but we like it.

815
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:58,180
And like as long as we're bringing in money from one area, like we don't need to like have this obsessive need to maximize a profit, which is maybe ties back to what Bob Chapek is talking about, where it's like he's approaching all of it is just purely we need to make sure we're sucking everything in.

816
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:02,480
We need to make sure that every single person in the park dry for as much money as we can.

817
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:07,320
And we can't let a bunch of freeloading annual pass holders come in anymore.

818
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:08,980
I mean, that is a philosophy.

819
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,120
There's I'm not saying you're wrong.

820
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,880
I feel like there is so much shape back hatred on this.

821
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,040
I just don't I'm not I just haven't thought about it enough.

822
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,740
I have no strong feelings either way.

823
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:23,780
This is this is your like your blood is boiling.

824
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:27,060
What shape this a couple of days ago, there was a whole thing that came out.

825
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,240
There was an earnings call.

826
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,260
There was an earnings call.

827
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,480
And he said all of this stuff, which really underlined.

828
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:33,500
And we'll see.

829
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,540
Maybe that maybe the reward program will be fine.

830
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:40,380
The rewards Disneyland program.

831
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,800
I think when we've taught, it seems like we were in agreement of like, well, I know passes will be back.

832
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:51,940
My personal theory is they will be back and that will cost three to four hundred dollars more than they used to at any level.

833
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:52,660
Theory.

834
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,500
Always a good theory.

835
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:54,680
Really good theory with anything.

836
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:55,520
Yeah.

837
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:56,500
Yeah.

838
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,800
Or any item in some cases.

839
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:01,900
But yeah, I don't know.

840
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,060
Yeah, I got to look into this loyalty thing more.

841
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:13,040
I think if you read the interview or whatever the recap, I think you'll go, I don't like the sound of this at all, because it's very the mobs all about loyalty.

842
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:17,700
And if things worked so well under mob rule, then this maybe this would be great.

843
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:22,120
I mean, I'm not saying I like the mob, but if the mob ran Disneyland, would it be better?

844
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:26,260
Maybe it might be great movie ride would come back.

845
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:26,760
Right.

846
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,340
These crime stoppers would go in.

847
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,320
Yeah, that's true.

848
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:32,360
There'd be a lot more mob related rides and attractions.

849
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,120
Yeah.

850
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:33,960
Yeah.

851
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,600
Bugsy could get a job.

852
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,320
All right.

853
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:38,500
Back, baby.

854
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,280
Yeah.

855
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,440
Well, what have we not said about?

856
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,180
Oh, you know what?

857
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:51,020
I know I don't remember in this 4am haze of getting to run up the ramp and see the mostly empty room.

858
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:56,380
I don't remember if this big facet of the Starcade was up there or not.

859
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:05,760
The X-wing, the huge X-wing up on the floor ceiling, which is a very frustrating part of seeing the next to the space on line.

860
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:11,060
You're looking in this room and like, and there's a X-wing up there and like there's a cool, like 70s looking mural.

861
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,780
I want to see better what that is.

862
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:17,880
And an X-wing that just no one gets to see except through tinted glass.

863
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:25,340
Well, some life insurance agents who are celebrating a very, very successful Q4 are going to get to see it.

864
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:31,960
If someone important is retiring, he can point up and say, what the hell is that thing?

865
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:36,860
The chancellor of like the Cal State system is retired.

866
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:37,580
Chancellor?

867
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:42,140
That is a term used in higher education.

868
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,540
I think that is a title.

869
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:45,220
That's funny.

870
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,160
That seems right.

871
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:46,840
Yeah.

872
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,600
But yeah, that was cool as hell that X-wing.

873
00:48:50,720 --> 00:49:05,860
And I have to say this, this I've said this before maybe that, you know, like I'm not saying that the X-wings that have gone into Galaxy's Edge or the Quinjet are not cool, but they're built up so much.

874
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,280
The planes here.

875
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,520
Have you seen the plane?

876
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,320
There's a whole video just that's just shots of the plane.

877
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:17,380
And I'm still kind of like that there was an X-wing years ago with the Starcade that nobody.

878
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,060
Yeah.

879
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:25,260
Nobody got to see for a long time, but it was cool as hell in like 87 or 92 hung up there.

880
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,740
It is like, yeah, they took that.

881
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,480
Yeah, because there were there were a lot of like rumors flying around.

882
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:36,600
And I think they were legitimate that they like in Galaxy's Edge that we're going to have like ships coming like drones landing.

883
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,840
There was some like, you know, blue sky of that.

884
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:44,020
But in the ships aren't bad at that, like on the top of the buildings.

885
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:45,300
But they're great.

886
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,220
It's all this way hanging, I would say.

887
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:55,940
And I would say maybe even like the 80 80 outside of Star Tours in Florida is like even as cooler, cooler.

888
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:56,880
Well, yeah.

889
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:00,040
And the fake, yeah, the forest of Endor like outdoor queue.

890
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:04,840
So a lot of the various Star Tours queues have had X-wings also.

891
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:10,820
What I am not trying to take away from the X-wings that have recently gone in or the other planes have gone in.

892
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,520
They're very cool.

893
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,700
I just remember hearing a lot of buildup of like a menu around the corner.

894
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,380
There is an X-wing.

895
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:16,840
Right.

896
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,500
Well, yeah, those have been in the.

897
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:19,000
Yeah.

898
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:22,660
That's why that of like and there is really impressive.

899
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,880
Like, of course, Millennium Falcon is jaw dropping.

900
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:25,560
Yeah.

901
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,020
But I don't know.

902
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,020
No, hey, no, no.

903
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,340
Hey, I love.

904
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,520
No, but I know what you mean.

905
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:37,600
Like the bottle soda that looks like detonator look like grenades.

906
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:40,380
Like the that is something we haven't seen before.

907
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,240
Yeah, that's that's something new.

908
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,000
It's something different.

909
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:48,240
We are cocktails and weird bulbous glasses with weird fizzy ingredients.

910
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:54,040
That's a that's more of the surprise and delight angle where it's like, oh, yeah, I got this.

911
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,380
But I already know that.

912
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,040
Yeah, no, no.

913
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,500
I I hope there's bathrooms.

914
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,600
It's what needs to be there.

915
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,120
There's good.

916
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,820
I'm glad they put planes in.

917
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:02,860
Yeah, you have to.

918
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:03,520
Yeah.

919
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,780
Is it is it Poe's X-wing?

920
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,860
It is Poe's X-wing.

921
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:08,340
It's the black touches.

922
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,560
Poe's X-wing.

923
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,960
Well, I mean, love Poe, obviously.

924
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,980
The I love all three of them.

925
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,320
That's right.

926
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,620
Three different movies, three different pose.

927
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,260
Yeah, I guess made him woody.

928
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:30,680
Who would have thought millionaire spending years backstabbing each other would result in that?

929
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:35,080
Uh oh, those grapes are going to fill up again.

930
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:35,400
Oh, no.

931
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,180
Come on.

932
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,340
I had a nice time.

933
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,680
I saw them all opening weekend with my family.

934
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:40,800
We all had a nice time.

935
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:41,400
What more?

936
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,640
They got my money.

937
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,160
Some case I think I saw Force Awakens twice.

938
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,160
Yeah.

939
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,680
I was before.

940
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:49,800
That's a better joke.

941
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,760
I was just gonna say something about Poe knows.

942
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,300
No, no, no, no, no.

943
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:58,480
Anyway, anyway, I had to say it.

944
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:00,280
I had to get it like the itch scratch in my brain.

945
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:00,720
I'm sorry.

946
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:02,980
Poe knows quips.

947
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:03,740
Poe knows quips.

948
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,340
He knows X-wings.

949
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,000
Hey, it was BB8.

950
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,260
Yeah, this literally.

951
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:11,460
Well, David Stalers, certainly that's one thing we do know about his character.

952
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,380
He knows BB8.

953
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:13,320
He does.

954
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,360
Well, he is.

955
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,040
He is.

956
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,720
BB8 is his droid.

957
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:17,440
That's right.

958
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,580
We have to think.

959
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:19,960
Everybody likes BB8.

960
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:20,880
Regardless of how you feel.

961
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,120
The BB8 like kind of has his own like adventures.

962
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,340
He doesn't want to be by Poe a lot.

963
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,900
I feel like I feel like he's always getting away from Poe.

964
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:28,960
It seems contentious.

965
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,180
Yeah, like they're growing apart.

966
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:31,920
They're changing.

967
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,480
You know, they're still friends, but you know.

968
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,180
I don't associate them really.

969
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:36,760
Yeah, it is.

970
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,780
I'm thinking about it now and I had to like double check my brain to make sure.

971
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,620
Yeah, that is his droid.

972
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,880
But it seems in some of it, it seems more like Raze.

973
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,900
But then he's friends with Finn too.

974
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:51,260
I put them together and you see them together at the end.

975
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:52,960
Right.

976
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:58,100
But then but then BB8 is with Finn and Rose in Last Jedi.

977
00:52:59,140 --> 00:52:59,360
Yeah.

978
00:52:59,360 --> 00:52:59,960
And not Poe.

979
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:03,680
But then BB8's on stage with Mark Hamill at the Oscars.

980
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,740
Making everybody laugh with beeps and poops.

981
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,000
Who's pet is BB8?

982
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:12,980
Is BB8, I guess, is with him in Nine.

983
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,680
Is he with them when they meet Babu Frick?

984
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,380
The only way I know is to watch all of them again.

985
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,120
Oh, I will.

986
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,900
I'll watch them all tomorrow.

987
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:28,780
Lindsay, Alice, Tabinon and Lindsay will come down and go like, why are you watching whatever, whether it's Attack of the Clones or whether it's like Rize the Skywalker.

988
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,320
She goes, why are you watching this again?

989
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:31,600
You just watch it.

990
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:35,180
I go, yes, I just I try to act like it was on.

991
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,040
She goes, yeah, but it's obviously Disney Plus.

992
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,020
It's not TBS.

993
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:44,220
You know, I do that with Diners, Drivers and Dives.

994
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:50,600
What's the House Hitters, House Hitters International where everyone's really insane.

995
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,440
I thought you said House Hinters and I was like that.

996
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:53,940
No, I can't remember the name.

997
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:57,400
I do that with the Late Shift.

998
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:02,200
That's the biggest one that Erin like, come on.

999
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,160
Lindsay hates that.

1000
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:04,600
I don't know.

1001
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:08,020
She's like, why do I don't want to watch the Late Shift again?

1002
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:16,480
That's exactly where, boy, when the girls are away, the boys, Leno and Letterman, come to play.

1003
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:21,780
You would think like we're watching some like some like swimsuit tape or something.

1004
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:25,460
Some like 90s like, yeah, this is what we want to watch.

1005
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,520
This is what guys like.

1006
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,920
It's really the Late Shift.

1007
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,100
Some anonymous actor, Brandon Tartakov.

1008
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:38,860
He's in his manly watching made for TV movies again.

1009
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:49,020
I'm sure they'd come around if they sat and watched the whole thing and to see that it's a movie about male late night hosts who are torn apart by a very mean woman.

1010
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:57,040
That would make our wives enjoy the portrayal of this woman is like so horrible and unredeemable.

1011
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:58,540
That's true.

1012
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,800
Jay's manager, Helen Kushnick.

1013
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,920
Helen Kushnick, of course we all know her name.

1014
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:04,940
We all know the story.

1015
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,680
Played by Kathy Bates, fantastically.

1016
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:07,660
Great performance.

1017
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,800
So first, they're across from the commissary.

1018
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:14,260
We should have Betty Thomas.

1019
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:16,000
We should ask to see if we can get Betty Thomas on.

1020
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,360
I think we should just do a full break because Betty Thomas directed it.

1021
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,580
I'd have to give some time to Brady Bunch movie too.

1022
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,800
Oh man, Brady Bunch movie is so great.

1023
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,340
She did High Spy, I think.

1024
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,100
Owen Wilson, Eddie Murphy.

1025
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,380
High Spy as well.

1026
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,900
She has a very interesting career.

1027
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,640
Second City, Betty Thomas.

1028
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:47,180
They were talking about, you know, they were going to put Galaxy's Edge in the Paris Disney,

1029
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,560
probably I believe the Studios Park because it always needs help.

1030
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:57,620
And they because of COVID closures, they stopped construction.

1031
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:06,180
And now Jim Hill seems to be alluding that like, well, the Mandalorian was such a big, you know, hit.

1032
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:09,680
And people are so excited to see Boba Fett back in the mix.

1033
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:14,160
And it's like maybe their Star Wars might be a little more like fluid there.

1034
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,980
Like they might not do just a full faithful bit too.

1035
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,700
They might have like a little of everything.

1036
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:21,560
Like make it different.

1037
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:26,360
It is bizarre that Disneyland and Disney World are the same thing.

1038
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,300
Maybe like breeze through it in Disney World.

1039
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:29,700
It's like, all right, I don't need to see.

1040
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:30,660
I know what this is.

1041
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:34,120
I think, yeah, we've talked about this enough times, I'm sure.

1042
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:42,800
But yeah, like you want to have like, let's say Rey meeting Dexter Jettster somewhere.

1043
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,500
Like, yeah, maybe that doesn't make sense in the timeline.

1044
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,040
But yeah, come on.

1045
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,200
That would be amazing.

1046
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:54,160
Well, because they're doing that with the Marvel stuff, like each little Marvel pocket at all the parks.

1047
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,340
Well, yeah, we've talked about that.

1048
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:02,800
They're treating it like kind of like C because there's a Marvel cinematic universe and a Marvel theme park universe.

1049
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:08,880
And all the different Marvel lands around the parks are like different home bases for the heroes.

1050
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:13,560
Which is a better, it makes, you now need kind of a collect them all.

1051
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:14,280
Yeah.

1052
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,120
As opposed to the two identical.

1053
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:16,780
Right.

1054
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:18,680
So, yes.

1055
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:22,300
So Dexter Jettster will only be in Anaheim.

1056
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:25,460
And then, you know, you can have Babu Frick in Orlando.

1057
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:35,240
The Pugas are a drinking game if there is one, like, if you were doing it with this episode, you'd be taking a lot of shots.

1058
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:39,460
Because Dexter Jettster, we've got some Aerosmith in there, got some Late Shift in there.

1059
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:41,040
Yeah.

1060
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:42,260
A lot of greatest bits.

1061
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,280
A little bit.

1062
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,920
Grumblings about the new Disney.

1063
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,460
Child, child, childhood eccentricities.

1064
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,880
Well, that's the whole freaking show point.

1065
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,720
Yeah, yeah.

1066
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,540
You can't call that part of the drinking game or you'll drink for two straight hours.

1067
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:58,520
Yeah.

1068
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,000
Sometimes twice a week.

1069
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:06,640
Look, folks, you know, it's nice to see people in person again outside of your individual households.

1070
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,200
And we're a little excited.

1071
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:08,740
Okay.

1072
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:09,620
You know.

1073
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:10,220
We don't know.

1074
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,400
I don't have to apologize for my Aerosmith references.

1075
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:16,040
All right.

1076
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,860
I'll talk about Jaded.

1077
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,940
I was just listening to it.

1078
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,280
A mere hour ago.

1079
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,800
You can't not.

1080
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:27,300
If Jaded enters your brain, Jaded has to be said out loud.

1081
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:31,400
The song Jaded is so good and it remains so good.

1082
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,000
This is, I think, our dynamic in general.

1083
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,200
We collected on Jaded.

1084
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:36,440
Yeah, Jaded was pretty good.

1085
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:37,780
I kind of stay there.

1086
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,300
You go to one of the top 10 songs of all time.

1087
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:42,600
It's like up there.

1088
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:49,100
So your history is just Jaded and mine's just like Surrey with the fringe on top or Shabooby.

1089
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,200
It's from the Music Man in Oklahoma.

1090
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,420
The podcast, the ride, mixtape.

1091
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,440
We got zero cents.

1092
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:58,440
Oh, it'll be.

1093
00:58:58,740 --> 00:58:58,820
Yeah.

1094
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:01,680
Could you do all of You Got Trouble for us right now?

1095
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:04,340
No, that's so speaks.

1096
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:04,840
Speaks.

1097
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:05,200
I know.

1098
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,360
But how much do you do?

1099
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,020
I don't know if I could do a lot of that.

1100
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,600
That is so dialogue heavy.

1101
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,120
Okay.

1102
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:16,660
Do you think maybe for another Patreon tier, you'd be willing to learn the whole thing?

1103
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:17,660
You could perform it.

1104
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,720
Seems worth fitting for like a live show.

1105
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,780
There's suddenly a musical number.

1106
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:23,360
Oh wow.

1107
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,660
What a dynamic.

1108
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:31,360
We've talked internally about a very musical type live show, perhaps.

1109
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,920
So maybe that is the spot for it.

1110
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:39,620
Get a bunch of guests to come back and do the full like 10 minute tableau from the end of 42nd Street.

1111
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,160
Okay, that's possible too, but you're going to be doing…

1112
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:47,540
We're going to make busy friends of ours stand around in a free musical.

1113
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:53,200
And do some Panama because it's pretty much wordless, except like Ruby Keeler tap dances, you know.

1114
00:59:53,220 --> 01:00:00,260
So you don't have any lines, but when you step back and see the full effect, it is going to be quite the spectacle.

1115
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:05,540
There should be an all encore for you where you do You Got Trouble and then Ladies Who Lunch.

1116
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:06,680
Oh yeah.

1117
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:09,840
And then into Shaboopi.

1118
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,200
Well, that's the exit song.

1119
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:13,320
Yeah, yeah.

1120
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,440
Because they'll be like, all right, was this done yet?

1121
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:19,120
And then Scott does 20 Beach Boys songs.

1122
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:20,560
Solo.

1123
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:25,280
The famous one part harmonies of the Beach Boys.

1124
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:25,940
If you could find…

1125
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:26,740
yeah, that's good.

1126
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:32,500
If you could find one Beach Boy to back you up, even if they're not currently in the band and bring them on stage.

1127
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,300
Oh yeah, well there's like 50 of those floating around.

1128
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:36,380
So you could find somebody.

1129
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:37,720
The Beach Boys are dime, dime's a dozen.

1130
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:41,100
Somebody who Mike Love fired in 1995 or something.

1131
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:46,400
He was playing like third percussion or whatever so he could back you up.

1132
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,820
No, no, you missed that chime.

1133
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,620
All right, Starrcade.

1134
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:54,480
Starrcade.

1135
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:57,020
There's not a lot on the internet folks.

1136
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,000
What do you want from us?

1137
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:07,320
People excited to hear this evidently, but then yeah, like people did a bad job of photographing this place.

1138
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,240
At its height.

1139
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,660
The Yesterland article is very good.

1140
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:14,280
However, those photos are from like the 2000s.

1141
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,420
I want to see this thing in 77.

1142
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:18,920
I want to see how it's different from 83.

1143
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:23,800
Hey, listener, if you have photos, please post them in response to our post about this.

1144
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:27,560
I'd really love to see Starrcade at its height because it's boy, it's not really out there.

1145
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:33,000
And the Tokyo one, because this was in Tokyo too, opened in 83 along with the park.

1146
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:35,000
That thing must have looked fantastic.

1147
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,500
And yet there is no right photograph other than the outside.

1148
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:40,680
So what are we to do?

1149
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,340
So much neon we're missing out on.

1150
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,400
I believe the Tokyo one lasted till like 2007.

1151
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,020
Like that lasted for a long time too.

1152
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,420
So why wouldn't there be a picture of it?

1153
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:49,480
Yeah, I didn't know.

1154
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:52,280
Well, you just got to remember to take pictures of everything.

1155
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:56,200
Yeah, because what doesn't seem special now could be gone someday.

1156
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,740
I've gained a lot of perspective in this code area.

1157
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:05,680
And I've I thought of deep thoughts like that one, like remember things before they pass pretty deep.

1158
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:11,980
So you thought of the song Don't Know What You Got Till It's Gone independently.

1159
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,260
I'm not familiar with his work.

1160
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:18,000
I came to a completely on my own.

1161
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:21,360
It sounds like you don't want to miss a thing, quite frankly.

1162
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,220
And I agree with that sentiment for sure.

1163
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:29,580
And I guess you could just say I'm just a little too cynical.

1164
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,060
I don't know what that's.

1165
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:33,760
Instead of Jay did it's like a swerve.

1166
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:34,400
It was a swerve.

1167
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,380
Oh man, Jason.

1168
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:43,020
I have forgotten how to do comedy outside of podcasting.

1169
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:44,200
I was like, here he comes.

1170
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:45,100
He's going to top me.

1171
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:48,580
Any favorites for like vintage, like old, old video games?

1172
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,820
Did you guys have any favorites on the way out?

1173
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:51,360
Arcade?

1174
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:52,520
Like Frogger?

1175
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:53,400
I was a big donkey.

1176
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,660
If I saw Donkey Kong cabinet, I would always play.

1177
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:57,400
Yeah, Popeye, obviously.

1178
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:58,380
Oh yeah.

1179
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:01,020
Popeye was similar to Donkey Kong where you'd go get spinach.

1180
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,460
And I remember being so because you say obviously I don't know this.

1181
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:05,140
Really, Jason?

1182
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:05,720
Have you ever played?

1183
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:07,900
I have once or twice.

1184
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,880
It was basically very similar to a Donkey Kong structure of a game.

1185
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:14,180
Like it was like you didn't side scroll or anything.

1186
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:18,220
It was just the map and you try to like climb and defeat Bluto.

1187
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:26,640
And there would be like spinach, spinach, like I feel like mid like on the corners of the screen or and then you would get that.

1188
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:32,840
Then you would be like in the same way that maybe I'm completely wrong, but in Pac-Man you would get the big ball.

1189
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,400
And then you would be like indestructible essentially for 10 seconds.

1190
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:38,020
So it'd be the same as that.

1191
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:40,160
And I really enjoyed that.

1192
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,540
Yeah, the bucky-o-hair thing.

1193
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:43,220
Great.

1194
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,540
Centipede with the with the or with the thing that you spin spinning the ball.

1195
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:49,620
Is it just a cool?

1196
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,460
Oh, yeah, that's yeah, that was fun.

1197
01:03:51,700 --> 01:04:01,600
I guess I liked anything where the controls are are different, whether it's a weird cool gun or a weird cool like you're in a cockpit or I didn't play this growing up.

1198
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:08,180
But what's the game with the beer where you've got the tap and you're you're filling up beer quickly as it's coming down.

1199
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:09,660
That's oh, yeah, root beer.

1200
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,560
Yeah, is that called?

1201
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:14,400
Is it root beer oriented to get away from alcohol?

1202
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:18,900
Because there was one where you made burgers to I burger time.

1203
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:20,160
Tapper Tapper.

1204
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:20,980
Root beer Tapper.

1205
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:23,240
I don't think I've ever played root beer Tapper.

1206
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:30,300
Is that the like that cool barcade in sort of like Silver Lake that I think is closed because of COVID has a lot of these things.

1207
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:31,920
What a button mash.

1208
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:32,840
Button mash.

1209
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:33,800
Yeah, I think that's gone.

1210
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:36,040
I hope I don't know if I'm wrong.

1211
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:39,280
I that boy tough industry after all this.

1212
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:47,120
I really hope I bark it would be a lot of fun to go to at this point and to that end talk about plus ups and stuff.

1213
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:49,920
We're starting to get alcohol finally into Disneyland.

1214
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,460
Starcade became a barcade.

1215
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:53,120
Oh, yeah.

1216
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:54,220
Drink and then play.

1217
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,880
Just get the most basic old game.

1218
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,280
Buy them out of hipsters garages.

1219
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,540
Yeah, personal collection.

1220
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:01,760
Yeah, the basics.

1221
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:02,840
You don't have to go nuts.

1222
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:06,000
Now I'd be I would spend time in there today.

1223
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,140
The teenagers you you dipped.

1224
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:10,960
You got their money in the 70s and 80s.

1225
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:11,440
Guess what?

1226
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,500
They're older now and they have more disposable income.

1227
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,120
Double dip.

1228
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:14,940
Get it again.

1229
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:16,740
Put the same arcade games in.

1230
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:25,740
But have a few Golden Road brews and those cut water spirits can cocktails and you can pick their pocket a second time.

1231
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:28,600
You know, yeah, hey, I'll willingly have my pocket picked.

1232
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:32,160
Yes, I you know, if they do a full I've been thinking about this more.

1233
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:37,500
We talked about wanting to do an episode where we we fix Tomorrowland, which I think we should do.

1234
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,300
Yeah, soon.

1235
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:50,180
But yeah, if it's going to be a whole overhaul, yeah, get rid of the second level queue because again, we like being elevated and drinking and looking at the park.

1236
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:53,320
That's better because you have the view of the right tomorrow.

1237
01:05:53,420 --> 01:06:00,600
And yes, so something like that where you have like, you know, a space cocktail and then a couple of beers or whatever like different as far as variety.

1238
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,920
And then, yes, literally all you need is like 10 arcade machines.

1239
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:05,300
It don't it doesn't have to be nuts.

1240
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:06,080
Doesn't have to be.

1241
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:12,780
Yeah, it's really more for ambiance than it is for actual like getting kids in or adults into play video games.

1242
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:13,040
Yeah.

1243
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:16,580
And if you have if it's a reservation thing like like it's like, yeah, fine.

1244
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:19,840
That that actually seems to be working pretty well at this point.

1245
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:20,100
Sure.

1246
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,140
Like, yeah, yeah, I think so.

1247
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:23,000
Would that be cool?

1248
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:29,080
Yeah, we got to keep this little gap to know it's what people want more little bar in the park.

1249
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:29,620
Yes.

1250
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,700
So they're going to because what were we up to now?

1251
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:36,980
We're up to blue Bayou serving and that's it for right now.

1252
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:38,180
Items soon.

1253
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,360
And it was so OK.

1254
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,260
So they're slowly they have to, you know, phases here.

1255
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,300
They can't do it all at once or else people would lose their mind, I guess.

1256
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:57,640
I've been told by a Club 33 member that if you were on the exclusive Club 33 Facebook group, people are as mad as they are about anything on Facebook about

1257
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:02,440
drinking in Disneyland, especially in the Blue Bayou, devaluing our membership.

1258
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:05,340
We pay for that right that we get to drink.

1259
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,880
And now they just give it away to the plebeians.

1260
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,120
I mean, bully for them.

1261
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:12,700
I'm so sorry.

1262
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:14,640
You're 50 dollars.

1263
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:17,840
That is just unbelievable.

1264
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:19,540
Cry the Bohemian Grove.

1265
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:21,060
Tell to someone who cares.

1266
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,680
That is truly.

1267
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:25,660
All the things to be mad about now.

1268
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:26,560
Yeah.

1269
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:26,820
What?

1270
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:31,180
Oh, I'll tell you what it kind of made me mad thinking about Starcade, though.

1271
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,180
And this will be my final thought.

1272
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:39,800
And if anyone else has other ones, if you are taking if you are going on a family vacation, I know they're expensive.

1273
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:47,220
But if the kids just want to play on the playground or go to the arcade, do not like Hemin Hall about it.

1274
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:50,960
Like, do not go like I spent all this money and they're going to be in their arcade the whole time.

1275
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,520
Like, I hate that.

1276
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:56,580
I hate when I hear people do that because to me it seems like that.

1277
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:03,820
Well, that's the kids equivalent of like sitting on the beach and smoking a cigar or like having a drink like that.

1278
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:04,880
It's the same thing.

1279
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:10,300
It's the same thing to kids like, you know, it's like you're going to have your cigar on your trip.

1280
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:12,180
So let the kids.

1281
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:14,120
But it's like I hate like it.

1282
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:15,580
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1283
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:20,860
This is saying where people like we spent all this money on this trip and you're just going to hang out at the hotel or it's like, well,

1284
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:24,260
that aligns maybe how I felt like why we were here.

1285
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:24,980
Why would we not?

1286
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:32,840
We won the we read the books in order to get the pizzas that got us to the final Disneyland goal.

1287
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:34,180
Why should we should be going on the right?

1288
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:36,260
But I yeah, I mean, I'm sure.

1289
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:40,940
Yeah, I would whenever I am doing vacations of this nature with my son.

1290
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,700
Yeah, I will take that about.

1291
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:43,140
You're right.

1292
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:46,680
Because like it is Disney World and you got to do this, you got to do that and you got to do that.

1293
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:48,860
But like it's a vacation too.

1294
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:59,020
So if there's boy, let's take this stretch to, you know, just hang out at this restaurant or to do the little boats as you guys did in Disney World or or play video game.

1295
01:08:59,100 --> 01:08:59,320
Yeah.

1296
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:03,220
Anything vacation should be on the table and a strict itinerary.

1297
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:03,900
Yeah.

1298
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:04,600
Yeah.

1299
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:05,980
You got to have give and take.

1300
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:10,240
If it's family vacation, everyone in the family should have their their say.

1301
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:10,800
Yeah.

1302
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:11,380
Yeah.

1303
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:12,800
I think vacationing.

1304
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:18,420
I think I think I'm a better vacationer because I'm a longtime annual pass holder.

1305
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:25,580
I think being an annual pass holder made me an overall better vacationer in general because we've said this many times before.

1306
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:29,520
If you talk to somebody who doesn't go to these places a lot and you go, yeah, I go to this.

1307
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,540
I got to pass Disneyland.

1308
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:33,120
Some people will look at you like you're out of your mind.

1309
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:40,800
And it's because they went their parents found it unpleasant because they were probably running and gunning, trying to do everything.

1310
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,380
And it was very stressful.

1311
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,640
And now they're imagining as an adult, this is going to be a nightmare.

1312
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,560
Why would I want to do that if I didn't have kids, especially if I didn't have kids?

1313
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:56,080
So I think that the leisurely because I we've converted people, Jason and I, at least people that are skeptics.

1314
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,600
And I said, you know what you got to do?

1315
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,600
You come down, you party with Jason and I and you're going to turn it around.

1316
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:05,140
This is very mobish of you come to what you're going to do.

1317
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:07,640
What you can do with us.

1318
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,720
First off, you got to agree to a merita.

1319
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:12,380
It's got the code of sight.

1320
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:14,480
No, you can tell anyone about this.

1321
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:17,800
What would your mob name be?

1322
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:20,160
Like what was the root beer game called?

1323
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,340
Root beer tapper?

1324
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,920
Yeah, that's not good.

1325
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:25,020
Root beer tapper.

1326
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,340
Root beer Jason, maybe.

1327
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:28,660
What would Jason's mob name be?

1328
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:29,800
He's the root beer tapper.

1329
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:30,720
Yeah, that's true.

1330
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:33,060
Milk carton.

1331
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:35,020
Probably just like.

1332
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:35,760
Milk carton Mickey.

1333
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:41,420
Yeah, you come down to Disney with milk carton Mickey and I.

1334
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,320
We'll show you a good time.

1335
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:45,540
We'll show you a good time.

1336
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,860
You just want to play arcade games, don't go on the rights?

1337
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,100
They got arcade games right here.

1338
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:50,980
We're not going to break your balls about that.

1339
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:52,960
Go to the arcade, I don't care.

1340
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,080
Will you make the day your own?

1341
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:58,200
You can just jump right ahead of the line.

1342
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,220
What's the deal with it?

1343
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,260
You got to know me to know about it.

1344
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:05,580
Milk carton Mickey and his tall friend.

1345
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:11,980
Oh, it's so fun to see the milk carton Mickey's walking around in their denim cuts back in the day.

1346
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,940
They can't be happy about this alcohol thing.

1347
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,000
Well, that's true.

1348
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:16,860
They're pissed.

1349
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:23,240
My closing thought is that the floor is like orange tiles.

1350
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:30,260
That like orange brick kind of vibe that like all the best malls still have and they disappear more.

1351
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,300
We're losing the orange bricks more and more by the year, folks.

1352
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:34,580
And you hate to see it.

1353
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,520
They're taking the orange bricks out and we got to keep it.

1354
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:38,740
We got to keep the orange bricks.

1355
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,520
I don't know why I went into that tone.

1356
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:40,900
I know.

1357
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:43,300
Organically.

1358
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,700
I'd like to not be reminded.

1359
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:47,840
What you were saying is right, but.

1360
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,580
You're hearing it more and more.

1361
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:52,300
And they're doing it and we're not loving it.

1362
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:53,140
We don't like it.

1363
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:55,260
And that's why we have to stop it.

1364
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,780
That's insane to equate these things.

1365
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,100
Preserving our orange bricks is important.

1366
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:04,560
More important than having that statue garden that apparently Biden stopped.

1367
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:05,460
Do you remember that?

1368
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:06,460
I did hear about that.

1369
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:13,520
We're never as mad about monuments coming down and Trump's like fine, how about a thing with 300 monuments?

1370
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,380
That's one of the best Biden moves so far.

1371
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:16,960
Like what?

1372
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:17,940
No.

1373
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:18,940
Why?

1374
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:23,020
You think we're not going to get to see the statue of Lawrence Welk next to the American sniper?

1375
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:23,880
What the hell?

1376
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:25,360
What the hell?

1377
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:30,220
You'll take that Lawrence Welk statue though.

1378
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:31,380
I will take that.

1379
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:32,380
If that's on eBay.

1380
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,740
I want to see how they can cast bubbles in copper.

1381
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:39,500
My closing thought.

1382
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:44,020
You know what, that eBay real quick, I do want to mention this about the experience.

1383
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:45,160
The tokens.

1384
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:47,700
Because.

1385
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:56,940
Because tokens were always, you know, tokens, you know, in the age of Bitcoin converting money and stuff, the original Bitcoin were tokens at different places.

1386
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,120
Like that was a different way to convert your money.

1387
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:06,240
That's, you know, they have things called stable coins now where our digital currency that are that stay, they don't appreciate or depreciate in value.

1388
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:11,260
But tokens were, I believe the stable coins, you could think of them that way.

1389
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:12,120
And Chuck E.

1390
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,320
G's would have their own token.

1391
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,420
And the Starcade would have its own token as well.

1392
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:20,520
And you can buy them on eBay and they look cool as hell.

1393
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,820
That does look very cool.

1394
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:22,640
Cool font.

1395
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:23,900
Good logo.

1396
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:24,440
That's it.

1397
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:25,720
We haven't said that enough.

1398
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:27,760
Because yeah, awesome logo.

1399
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:39,180
And you know, it's a thing to say that that sign, even though the Starcade has gone in and out of like sometimes there's photo ops there, sometimes they just becomes merch and they haphazardly toss two games in.

1400
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:40,760
Maybe they aren't even good, they don't care.

1401
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:43,140
They've stopped really curating an arcade there.

1402
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:45,320
And yet the sign remains.

1403
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:50,520
Yes, I wasn't even sure in 2021 post pandemic if the sign was still there.

1404
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:53,420
I asked my friends, Tyler and Kia, that neon sign still there.

1405
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:56,280
They said, yes, shine and bright and beautiful as ever.

1406
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,040
We love to see it.

1407
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:00,080
No, we can't edit all that out.

1408
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:01,540
I'm going to edit that part out of the show.

1409
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:10,260
And that and that is one of the predictions Tomorrowland inadvertently made about the future, the modern world we live in.

1410
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:16,040
Like Tomorrowland is filled with remnants of closed detractions or defunct technology.

1411
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:22,120
We all live in homes filled with like useless crap.

1412
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:26,420
Like phones or old gadgets or old DVD players.

1413
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:29,220
It's like, well, inadvertently, Tomorrowland was right.

1414
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:35,840
We will be surrounded by the remnants of like digital camera, like technology that was the height of technology.

1415
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,540
Swimming up to your ears in old broken phones and cameras.

1416
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:45,120
I have a box or two of like, do I need a micro cassette recorder anymore?

1417
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,000
Like, why do I have these?

1418
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:48,860
No, you can get rid of them.

1419
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:49,820
It's not impossible.

1420
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:50,480
I know.

1421
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:52,620
Got milk cartons full of.

1422
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:53,940
I don't think I'm wrong.

1423
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:55,840
You meant milk crates too, right?

1424
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,260
You meant milk crates, not cartons, right?

1425
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:02,680
Whatever the plastic things that like quarts of milk come in.

1426
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:03,200
Crates, I think.

1427
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:04,380
I guess crates are right.

1428
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:09,620
Wouldn't be the box because the carton is the bottle, which you would just step on and just collapse.

1429
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:11,960
Yeah.

1430
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:12,260
Okay.

1431
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:17,540
Crates, milk crates, milk, crate, Mickey, milk, crate, crate, crate, crate, Mickey.

1432
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:18,180
Yeah.

1433
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,800
Milk carton, Mickey's a different guy.

1434
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:20,840
Come over here, buddy.

1435
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,080
Bring that milk crate so I can look in the eye.

1436
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:24,880
See milk carton.

1437
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,980
Mickey is two feet tall.

1438
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:28,720
He's small.

1439
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,040
Well, I think we did it.

1440
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:34,900
I think we survived podcast the second gate.

1441
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:35,400
We did.

1442
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:40,660
Thanks to Mike and to milk crate Mickey for as always for all the laughs.

1443
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:45,680
Stay tuned here to podcast the second gate for three bonus episodes every month.

1444
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,420
And we didn't acknowledge it really.

1445
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:56,460
This is the first time in what 14, 15 months that we recorded in our usual place in Mike's apartment.

1446
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:59,860
We just sort of dove in and we weren't even sure we were going to do it here.

1447
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:02,760
Like, I think I thought about that a lot during the time.

1448
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:05,460
Like, what's it going to be like to be back?

1449
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:08,440
And that means that for me, the first sighting of Edwin.

1450
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:08,860
Oh, yeah.

1451
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:10,000
We're back with Edwin.

1452
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:17,560
The core components of Sleeping Edwin are finally back on the show.

1453
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:19,460
So, yeah, we are in.

1454
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:20,920
We are inside right now.

1455
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:22,000
Again, we're going to switch now.

1456
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:22,740
We're very mobile.

1457
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:23,500
We'll be outside.

1458
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:24,600
Make sure you have a read.

1459
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:25,800
Yeah, I don't even know.

1460
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:26,800
Yeah.

1461
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:28,640
Yeah, exactly.

1462
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:29,020
Oh, my God.

1463
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:32,800
Maybe we'll record an episode while we walk around City Walk.

1464
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:33,840
I don't know.

1465
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:35,120
Go to the park.

1466
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:38,760
Maybe we'll go to Galaxy's Edge and record in Galaxy's Edge.

1467
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:40,940
Wait, we've done that before.

1468
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:42,220
We haven't done that.

1469
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:46,400
No, no, this is a new, it is a great, innovative way.

1470
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:47,420
We're going to sit down.

1471
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:49,340
Now, I'm sure a lot of people are going to want that a lot.

1472
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:50,800
All right.

1473
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:51,500
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1474
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:52,300
OK.

1475
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:57,280
The listeners are waiting for you to say the catchphrase,

1476
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,240
like everybody looking at Bart saying, I didn't do it.

1477
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:01,940
Because you were against this.

1478
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,900
That's what I was going for.

1479
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:04,340
Oh, right.

1480
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,500
I'll counterpoint you're wrong.

1481
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:06,440
I don't know.

1482
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:11,080
Now, say it like Milk Crate Mickey would say it.

1483
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,540
Counterpoint, you're wrong.

1484
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:13,940
Wow.

1485
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:14,460
Wow.

1486
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:15,680
And you're going to die.

1487
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:19,220
No, Milk Crate Mickey.

1488
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:21,500
No, don't do it to me.

1489
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:22,340
No.

1490
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:23,180
OK, bye.
