00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
["The Cemetery Gate Theme"]

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,520
Welcome to Haunt Cast the Fright, The Cemetery Gate,

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,720
where today we pay tribute to the ultimate masters

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,160
of horror, Bush Gardens.

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,200
I'm Scott Garen, you're enjoyed by Mike Carlson.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,440
The scariest place that I know of.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,520
Is it Transylvania?

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,480
No.

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,880
Is it the depths of hell?

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,880
No.

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,440
Well, and they're great filmmakers is the primary thing.

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,200
And that's really what we're,

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,560
I think that they'd be great in any genre,

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,520
but clearly they mastered horror

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,360
is what we learned with today's topic,

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,520
Jason Sheridan, I'm sure would agree.

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,520
I, you know, when you're running down the list

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,920
of big film production companies

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,440
of the late 20th century, early 21st century,

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,000
you got your A24, your Blumhouse.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,640
And of course you have a Bush Entertainment Corporation.

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,560
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,080
They're entered, they're, yeah, well,

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,040
they're content silo, which will eventually

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,800
lead to Bush Plus down the road,

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,320
but they haven't announced it yet.

27
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,840
And I'm, I already prepaid for it whenever they got it off.

28
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,040
I sent them an envelope with money

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,800
for when they have a streaming service.

30
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,640
Yeah, right.

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,280
So that's waiting, I wrote a post-it note,

32
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,320
here's what it's for.

33
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,880
Yeah, that's a good idea.

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,000
Hopefully they get it moving.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,760
And one of the first things on there

36
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,840
presumably will be today's topic,

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,680
R.L. Stein's haunted lighthouse 4D,

38
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,640
which is one of those that I think requires the explanation.

39
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,400
This is a 4D film by R.L. Stein,

40
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,080
maybe it doesn't, actually it kind of explains itself,

41
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,400
but I guess the point is that it,

42
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,880
this played in the early 2000s in 4D theaters

43
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,280
in a Bush Gardens, a couple of the Bush Gardens locations

44
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,360
and in a couple of the Sea World locations primarily.

45
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,360
So this is made for Theme Park 4D Entertainment.

46
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,520
And at this point, because I feel like maybe

47
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,300
I caused this topic, or I think we found it organically

48
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,540
in an episode last year and then I was re-listening

49
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,740
to the episode and we talked about that and I said,

50
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,260
oh, that's right, there's that,

51
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,660
maybe we should do an episode about that.

52
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,660
And this is where I wonder if I owe both of you

53
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,580
and the audience an apology.

54
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,020
Well, no, I think I share the blame too,

55
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,500
because I discovered it last year and I got so excited

56
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,900
because on paper, this is one of the most interesting

57
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,940
creative teams in a theme park ride.

58
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,460
We got, I think we got tricked the way

59
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,140
that Bush Gardens got tricked by that,

60
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,780
the sheer volume of talent involved in this production.

61
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,940
So both of you owe me an apology.

62
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,060
It's only you. I never wanted to do this.

63
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,420
I was intrigued by the idea, of course,

64
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,460
but then when I had to watch this thing,

65
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,860
you both, so both of you, if you would,

66
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,180
I'm gonna ask you now, right now,

67
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,180
to say it in unison that you're sorry.

68
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,020
I'm sorry. I have no regrets here.

69
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,900
I'm not gonna go, I don't need to put up a stink

70
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,220
in this case and you were right to never believe in it.

71
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,260
I mean, look, up until when I go, okay, what is this thing?

72
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,420
And I put it on and I went, oh no, what?

73
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,860
Like by the end of it, I was like, oh.

74
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,140
Yeah, that's what you, cause you kind of get the vibe

75
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,940
immediately, you're like, okay, this is like early 2000s.

76
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,780
Yeah. Yeah.

77
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,620
And it's not, it's not abhorrent, I don't think.

78
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,340
Like it's not the worst thing.

79
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,620
It's, it's a lot of it is technically correct,

80
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,060
you might say, but like it is, it is for the,

81
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,460
the strength of the creative team,

82
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,740
you would think like, oh.

83
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,260
Yeah, for sure, for sure.

84
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,060
But I will say this and I don't want everyone to be like,

85
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,020
oh, we got to turn this as a skippable episode.

86
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,460
It is not a skippable episode

87
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,420
because I have found something that I'm very intrigued by

88
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,660
that there's not a lot of information about on the internet

89
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,900
and maybe somebody can help me out,

90
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,500
but it has to do with the SimEx, iWorks,

91
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,540
did I say all that right?

92
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,380
Yeah.

93
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,780
Entertainment group, which is like,

94
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,580
they produce a lot of 4D entertainment.

95
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,980
They have many different theaters.

96
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,700
They do like the 4D movies that you see

97
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,580
that have chairs that move, they can do that.

98
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,580
They can make a ride version of something

99
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,140
and they have a whole expansive film library.

100
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,300
I don't know if you guys looked.

101
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,980
I ended up on the website.

102
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,820
Okay. Yes.

103
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,820
And it went on and on.

104
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,580
I didn't know where to begin.

105
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,420
Yes.

106
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,660
I just went far enough to see the many pages

107
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,140
that you had to click through to ultimately get to

108
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,340
Yes. Haunted lighthouse.

109
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,940
It seems like they're burying this film.

110
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,380
That does, it does seem like they might not be

111
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,060
I'm so proud of this thing,

112
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,980
but we were gonna go, of course we have to talk

113
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,500
about the film, but I think by the, at the end here,

114
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,380
you'll see why I got so excited.

115
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,460
Specifically one title.

116
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,460
There are a couple of things I'm intrigued by,

117
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,340
but there's one title that I love more than anything.

118
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,780
And I, yeah, if somebody knows more,

119
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,300
we'll find out after this episode.

120
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,420
I haven't flipped through the website.

121
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,500
I don't have a guess.

122
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,340
I don't know what's exciting you so,

123
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,140
but yeah, there's a lot in store.

124
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,780
I have a little game to play.

125
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,620
Oh, great.

126
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,860
I think we have a stacked of a lineup

127
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,940
as the lineup of people who made this film

128
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,100
that intrigued us so.

129
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,940
Right.

130
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,780
And because that's why we found it.

131
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,180
It might've been in the tower of terror episode.

132
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,820
That's my guess from last Halloween.

133
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,820
Oh, I actually think it was the European vacation.

134
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,660
Oh.

135
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,020
Because pirates in 3D was one of the

136
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,140
Not 4D? Is that not pirates 4D?

137
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,900
I saw a poster that said 3D.

138
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,300
It may have gotten upgraded at some point,

139
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,780
but the Eric Idle, Leslie Nielsen movie

140
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,580
that was at one of the European parks among other places.

141
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,500
It was a lot.

142
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,580
It held out there for a long time.

143
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,780
This was in a lot of American parks,

144
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,180
but was bailed on mostly in the 2000s.

145
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,100
But it was still hanging in there.

146
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,940
Yeah, you're right.

147
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,420
I think in Phantasialand.

148
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,260
Yeah.

149
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,900
And so I looked up what else like they had

150
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,860
because the Bush Entertainment Corporation,

151
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,500
the current name is now Sea World Parks and Entertainment.

152
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,660
Like, so they-

153
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,580
They wanted to be closer identified

154
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,780
with the beloved brand Sea World.

155
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,620
Yeah, who doesn't?

156
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,460
We all do.

157
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,700
Not a beer company, a company that tortures sea life.

158
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,300
Treats sea life poorly.

159
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,260
And so-

160
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,180
Even having corrected some of the things.

161
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,020
Of course, yeah.

162
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,540
That still is their primary line of work.

163
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

164
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,220
Oh, yeah, yeah.

165
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,580
So I remember hitting upon it last year.

166
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,820
We talked about maybe doing it for a haunt cast.

167
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,420
And then I think, yeah, other stuff came up.

168
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,380
And that actually turned out to be a sign from the universe

169
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,860
that we now have discovered.

170
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,420
That this thing is fine.

171
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,340
It's fine.

172
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,340
It's not bad.

173
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,540
It's not atrocious, but it's just a little dull.

174
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,780
I think because you start, you hear the title

175
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,220
and you know from the title that this comes

176
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,980
from Master of Horror, from Master of PG-13

177
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,940
or less horror R.L. Stine.

178
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,780
Of course.

179
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,700
We got accolades right in the beginning.

180
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,580
Who just turned 78 years old, I believe.

181
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,420
Oh my goodness.

182
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,500
Did everyone know he was that old?

183
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,340
No, no I didn't.

184
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,780
I'm now re-cursing him by mentioning him on the show,

185
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,700
but I just, I didn't know he was actually that old.

186
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,140
He must've been, yeah, in his 50s

187
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,940
when we were reading his 25 page books

188
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,460
when we were children.

189
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,300
Yeah.

190
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,220
Thin, paper thin books.

191
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,780
How was he so tapped into youth culture

192
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,220
despite that time being his mid 50s?

193
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,380
That's a very good question.

194
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,180
He knew, but he knew what I wanted,

195
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,660
which was a short read because I was a bad reader.

196
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,660
A comic book brained idiot

197
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,780
who could get through 25 pages in a night.

198
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,540
Honestly, that's probably the genius of it.

199
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,020
The design of the books were really good.

200
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,780
The books stood out and they were quick.

201
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,620
That's always a perfect cover.

202
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,580
Excellent covers.

203
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,420
Perfect recipe.

204
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,260
Fantastic covers.

205
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,740
Excellent covers, great branding.

206
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,620
Great, like looked good on his shelf,

207
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,900
everything like very consistent.

208
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,140
Right, so like a 55 year old dude,

209
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,780
that's how he figured it out.

210
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,460
It wasn't that he was going down

211
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,500
and hanging with kids on the boardwalk or something

212
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,060
and learning youth culture.

213
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,020
I should hope not.

214
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,620
He was dressed like Steve Buscemi in the 30 Rock meme.

215
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,460
Yeah.

216
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,380
Which somebody can make that right now please.

217
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,220
With R.L. Stine.

218
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,500
Yeah, of course.

219
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,780
Those books might've read faster

220
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,660
than a lot of the comic books of the 80s and 90s

221
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,940
because there was still a trend at the time

222
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,980
of a lot of very soap opera exposition,

223
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:40,980
like over over-dialogue, obscuring the art, I feel like.

224
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,180
Well, look, we could go off the rails.

225
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,020
We could go off the rails.

226
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,820
Yeah, there's just tons and tons of description

227
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,540
and what characters are thinking

228
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,060
and it's a little too much.

229
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,500
Now that's different than compressed storytelling,

230
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,900
which is what comics used to be more of

231
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,660
and then like a Brian Michael Bendis took it

232
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,980
and he sort of decompressed it

233
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,660
to make it look more like television

234
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,100
and then you get so much less story

235
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,340
and so much less content.

236
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,580
So that's a debate we can have on a different episode

237
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,500
about which version of that is better.

238
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,060
Scott, you going out town?

239
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,980
Yeah, I'll let you know my next vacation plans.

240
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,700
Pros and cons of comic book decompression storytelling.

241
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,700
Put a bookmark in Bendis until the next,

242
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,460
which with the baby, look, we're looking at,

243
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,460
it's gonna be like three years from now.

244
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,060
So you got a minute.

245
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,900
Okay, sure.

246
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,900
All right, well, it's gonna be quite an opus then.

247
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,060
Get ready.

248
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,100
Mr. Sheridan's opus.

249
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,700
So look at that, bam, R.L. Stine, part of this.

250
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,260
I said that maybe it came up in Twilight Zone,

251
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,660
Tower of Terror, because this is theme park entertainment

252
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,500
that shares a director with that attraction

253
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,020
because the pre-show of that,

254
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,220
I don't think I've known for terribly long,

255
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,740
the Tower of Terror pre-show was directed by Joe Dante.

256
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,220
This film is directed by Joe Dante,

257
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,340
like Gremlins and Gremlins 2 and Small Soldiers

258
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,820
and Looney Tunes back in action,

259
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,940
which was made in the same window of time as this

260
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,700
and the burbs.

261
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,020
I didn't know that he directed several police squads

262
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,420
and I'd like to say I think that's extremely cool.

263
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,500
Yeah.

264
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,740
What a neat credit, what a cool show.

265
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,620
So, you know, he lit us up.

266
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,940
We like, though, I think I'd maybe declare Gremlins 2

267
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,460
in top 10 movies for me.

268
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,300
Of all time, yeah.

269
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,380
Yeah, so, and then you've got stars

270
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,420
from what is probably, one of them has to be

271
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,860
in all of our top 10 movies, I would think.

272
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,300
Oh, of course, yes.

273
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,380
We got Back to the Future people in this.

274
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,220
Right, two of them.

275
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,820
And that must be what, yes, yes.

276
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,820
Christopher Lloyd is in this film as an old, crazy sea man.

277
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,740
Yeah, that alone, I can understand why this excited,

278
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,460
like, you go, okay, Joe Dante, theme park exclusive.

279
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,380
Christopher Lloyd is a crazy sea captain.

280
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,220
Yeah.

281
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,140
Well, this has got to, if it's bad,

282
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,980
it's gonna be so spectacularly bad,

283
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,580
we'll get content out of it for hours.

284
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,420
Mm-hmm.

285
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,260
Mm-hmm.

286
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,100
That's what you might. It's great.

287
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,180
And if it's great, then we've discovered

288
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,420
one of the great fan, we can be real snooty

289
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,540
at parties and gatherings for, like, oh, my favorite movie.

290
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,660
It might, well, there's, you might not know it.

291
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,060
It got a pretty limited run.

292
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,620
It was called Haunted Lighthouse.

293
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,700
No, no, no, no, not The Lighthouse, not that one.

294
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,220
No, no, no, I'm aware of that one.

295
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,260
It's not that.

296
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,020
It has better actors, I'd say, than Defoe.

297
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,540
Just tearing apart the Criterion closet, trying to find it.

298
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,380
You have it, right? You have it.

299
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,140
It's 25 minutes, though, but you have it.

300
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,140
The story of the ghost children, Edgar and Annabelle,

301
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,460
and the curse finally being broken.

302
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,940
Everything off the shelf on the ground.

303
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,380
Well, fuck you.

304
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,900
It's the only, it's the first Criterion closet episode

305
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,900
that ends with Storm destroying the Criterion closet.

306
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,820
Really good.

307
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,380
I'm burning this thing to the ground.

308
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,940
Haunted Lighthouse or nothing.

309
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,500
But yes, not only Christopher Lloyd,

310
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,660
but Leah Thompson is in this as well.

311
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,660
So you light up at that for some reason,

312
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,900
because then what I started thinking was like,

313
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,060
well, wait, at first you're like, oh, whoa, oh, my God.

314
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,860
So this is a theme park exclusive,

315
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,100
Back to the Future reunion.

316
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,260
And then I'm like, wait, but like, they didn't really,

317
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,300
they weren't in the movie together.

318
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,500
You're saying they two are the characters.

319
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

320
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,820
Well, you know, he's kind of, you know,

321
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,420
Lorraine comes into the garage

322
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,540
and he's kind of trying to look the other way.

323
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,460
There's a great try to not interact with her.

324
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,100
Right, but he does have a good reaction

325
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,980
off of when she's like hitting on Marty.

326
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,340
He's got a real funny.

327
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,580
Yes, that is very good.

328
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,940
Yeah, perfect reaction.

329
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,900
Is that the only scene?

330
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,740
It's possible.

331
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,460
With Christopher Lloyd and Leah Thompson.

332
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,300
It's possible.

333
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,340
He's like sneaking around.

334
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,860
He's always trying to avoid her.

335
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,700
Right, right.

336
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,180
When it's old Lorraine in part two,

337
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,300
he's like in the bathroom,

338
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,820
he's trying to get to Jennifer.

339
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,260
He's on the outskirts of the house

340
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,420
trying to break and enter.

341
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:58,180
Yeah, they never see Doc, the future family.

342
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,020
So.

343
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,620
It's probably imperative that Lorraine

344
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,660
not really know about Doc.

345
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,260
Right.

346
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,100
That's a good point.

347
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,100
Does Marty even tell her, like in the pre-time travel world,

348
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,100
does he ever say, by the way,

349
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,140
I'm going to the doctor's house.

350
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,740
I'm going to the scientist's house today.

351
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,700
Or is that info left off your mother's worry list?

352
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,300
Yeah, he probably doesn't say that.

353
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,700
Yeah, it's concerning to hear.

354
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,980
Yeah, I mean we've talked about this.

355
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,540
There's Rick and Morty's based kind of on it.

356
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,420
How weird it is.

357
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,260
But yeah, I think that's good.

358
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,260
Christopher Lloyd, who you might know

359
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,100
from the Rick and Morty promos,

360
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,740
probably his most prominent role is as Rick,

361
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,740
live action Rick.

362
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,580
That's your old act?

363
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,260
Or in this older film where he played this guy, Doc.

364
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,340
I think it goes, I go number three, Doc.

365
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,860
Number two, Rick and Morty promo.

366
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,860
Number one, Sebastian Jackal from the UPN show, Deadly Game.

367
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,660
Yes, yeah, of course.

368
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,060
Of course.

369
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,940
He's got an all white suit on it.

370
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,820
And we'll get there too.

371
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,340
Christopher Lloyd selects.

372
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,580
So, but anyway, but you hear that and then like,

373
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,820
but wait a minute, that's almost like,

374
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,580
that's like if you were getting excited about like,

375
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:17,740
how Marvin Barry is reuniting with Jennifer.

376
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,100
Well, I don't think they really cross paths.

377
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,740
But yes, Trey is back to the future people.

378
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,700
Yeah.

379
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,740
Who else is, there's other, I feel like the luminary list.

380
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,580
Michael McKeon.

381
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,420
Michael McKeon.

382
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,900
Oh my God.

383
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,660
Who kind of, it's kind of a tonal shift

384
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,380
when he shows up and gets line at the end.

385
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,740
Like they cram all the jokes in the last like two minutes.

386
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,700
Yeah, the only time there's any life to it

387
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,500
is the last like minute or two.

388
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,460
It's when they're doing some bits.

389
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,180
Yes.

390
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,020
You kind of suspect that maybe he brought

391
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,980
some of that to the table.

392
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,820
Perhaps.

393
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,340
Like he's got to keep this interesting for himself.

394
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,700
What can only be described as a perplexing cameo

395
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,140
by weird Al Yankovic.

396
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,220
That's true.

397
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,040
Yes.

398
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,380
Extremely, because he does not really fit

399
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,820
into this list that we've given.

400
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,580
Other than that, like it's, you know,

401
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,700
think about who makes cameos in Gremlins 2.

402
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,860
Like I guess Joe Dante likes oddballs.

403
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,900
Right, that's true.

404
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,420
So sure weird Al would show up for a second.

405
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,980
An interest in 3D film.

406
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,420
What with his state fair exclusive 3D movie, Al's Brain.

407
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,260
That's true.

408
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,140
So yeah, you got a weird Al.

409
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:34,140
You got Rachel Hunter from the Stacey's mom video.

410
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,700
Is that right?

411
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,620
I believe so.

412
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,420
Wait, so who's that in the Stacey's mom video?

413
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,620
She's Stacey's mom.

414
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,380
Oh, that's Stacey's mom.

415
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,700
She has it going on.

416
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,660
Mm-hmm.

417
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,660
Wait, so who is, who is she in this?

418
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,660
Oh yeah, I have it written down here.

419
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,020
Rich Widow.

420
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,140
Yeah, yeah, Jason has it.

421
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,800
Rich Widow Feeny.

422
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,020
Which I don't, when does she show up?

423
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,860
I'm not sure.

424
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,700
She's listed on the IMDB.

425
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,540
It's not coming to me.

426
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,740
She's listed on the IMDB.

427
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,060
They talk about her.

428
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,900
They talk about her.

429
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,820
It doesn't really pay off.

430
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,860
No, it doesn't pay off.

431
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,900
My guess is maybe she was cut.

432
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,740
She might have been cut.

433
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,580
Yeah, wait a sec.

434
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,420
The big name.

435
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,100
Behind the scenes, the other big name.

436
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,420
R.L. Stine has a story by credit.

437
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,380
The written by credit goes to Sam Ham,

438
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,220
who was the co-writer of the Tim Burton Batman

439
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,100
and has the story credit on Batman Returns.

440
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,940
Yeah.

441
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,020
And is currently writing the new Batman 89 comic.

442
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:33,860
Oh yeah.

443
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,620
They're continuing Batman from Batman 89.

444
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,220
In the same way that I wanna do Batman Forever Two,

445
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,940
they are now doing this for the original Batman,

446
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,580
but in comic book form.

447
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,820
So you get Billy Dee Williams Two-Face in the comic.

448
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,660
Oh, that's cool.

449
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,480
Which is cool.

450
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,320
Okay.

451
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,540
Yeah, because it's a specific world.

452
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,260
And now that we're fracturing all these things off.

453
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,420
And Burton is different than Schumacher.

454
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,260
Yes.

455
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,940
In Ferrier, obviously.

456
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,580
Of course, yeah.

457
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,900
People are like, Batman Returns is the best one.

458
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,420
Batman Forever is the best one.

459
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,700
And we all agree.

460
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:09,700
But let's not lose the idea of a Batman and Robin Two.

461
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,100
Of course.

462
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,900
Where you amp up the ice puns too.

463
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,980
There's like three per line.

464
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,940
You just go, you almost like one person draws it,

465
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,860
one person writes most of the dialogue

466
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,380
and then someone else spends a full year doing nothing

467
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,380
but thinking of ice puns for Mr. Freeze.

468
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,220
Oh yes.

469
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,180
That is not a joke at all.

470
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,580
People put that one down, but that would be so good.

471
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,620
It's gotta be a whole other level.

472
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,460
The Pattinson.

473
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,280
Or why else bring it back?

474
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,060
So moody, so moody, this Pattinson trailer.

475
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,040
I'm sure I'll like it.

476
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,420
I like everything with Batman in it.

477
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,020
But let's get some puns back in there.

478
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

479
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,680
You know?

480
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,860
Elsewhere in the Luminary,

481
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,100
I think this one might top all of them.

482
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,100
Because, so this is a, you know, we'll get into it maybe.

483
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:00,100
But it's about, basically about two modern children

484
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,060
who run into two children who have a little more

485
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:08,740
of a backstory, who are not like, who seem normal at first

486
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,740
but then there is more than meets the eye.

487
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,620
And there is a young actor in it named Bobby Edner.

488
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,500
And I looked up Bobby Edner's credits and guess what?

489
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,900
We got a little bit more music video Luminary,

490
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,860
early 2000s music video Luminary

491
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:31,300
because I'd like to show you Mr. Edner's work.

492
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,940
And I think you'll recognize what this is right away.

493
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,780
Okay.

494
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,720
Oh yeah, of course.

495
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,500
Oh yes, he's that kid.

496
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,340
Wow.

497
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,920
He's the dance, he's the Michael Jackson dancing kid

498
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,100
in Alien Ant Farm Smooth Criminal.

499
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,860
Wow, now that's huge.

500
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,740
That might be the most impressive credit

501
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,580
of any that I've just said.

502
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,740
And he certainly does some dancing in this.

503
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,580
Yeah.

504
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,140
Doesn't it connect that you're like, wait a minute,

505
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,020
why is that dancing part in there?

506
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,260
Well, I guess you got, when you got the master,

507
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,100
he was a little dancer.

508
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,300
You got the Edmeister.

509
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,260
Wow.

510
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,380
You gotta have him do it.

511
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,620
Stacey's mom and the dancing boy.

512
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,460
Stacey's mom and.

513
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,380
Even though she's not in it,

514
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,980
but Stacey's mom and the dancing boy.

515
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,820
The idea that Stacey's mom might've been in it

516
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,660
and then this kid.

517
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,480
He's disgust.

518
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,580
Stacey's mom is disgust in the movie for sure.

519
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,980
It's a plot point.

520
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,820
But it's possibly cut.

521
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,020
Back on board.

522
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,140
We should have done this last.

523
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,180
This would have fooled our spirits so much

524
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,540
during quarantine.

525
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,380
Discovering both these two facts.

526
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,380
But I don't know if it would have,

527
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,900
but it might've bummed us out because I don't,

528
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,140
it was so jarring to rewatch the alien ant farm video,

529
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,380
which I regret having not revisited for too long.

530
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,500
Nice to have you back in my life, old friend.

531
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,340
Oh yeah.

532
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,000
But seeing that the kid is dancing around in a mask.

533
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,300
Oh wow, interesting.

534
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,060
Which is I guess a Michael Jackson reference.

535
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,140
Because I guess around that in the later years,

536
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,100
he was in a mask usually.

537
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,940
That was his mask period.

538
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,180
But that went way over my head because I just,

539
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,500
now we now masks, now we're all Michael Jackson

540
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,740
is something I like to say as often as possible.

541
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,940
Well, not freedom fighters like Eric Clapton,

542
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,220
but yeah, a lot of us are.

543
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,540
That's what he's trying to avoid.

544
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,180
I don't want to be like Jekko.

545
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,700
I like Kanye's doing the new mask.

546
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,220
The Kanye's doing that real weird rubber mask.

547
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,940
The Carl Havoc mask, yeah.

548
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,780
Yeah.

549
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:25,460
Look, we talked about, he stole that from Will.i.am.

550
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,140
Will.i.am, we talked about this months ago.

551
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,540
Will.i.am's been in the rubber mask game

552
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,860
for almost as long as Batman.

553
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,300
And I laughed about it.

554
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,220
My whole thing was he's doing a mask

555
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,940
at the end of the pandemic.

556
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,820
And now it's not at the end of the pandemic.

557
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,660
And let me tell you,

558
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:45,400
Zupermask is getting as many likes on its tweets as ever.

559
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,660
That being two.

560
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,780
So there's been no dip for the Zupermask social footprint.

561
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,620
Scott, let me ask you a question.

562
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,900
Will, to prepare yourself for Ghostbusters Afterlife,

563
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,700
will you be revisiting the alien ant farm video

564
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,900
for the song Movies?

565
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,420
Where they do address the Ghostbusters.

566
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,780
This has come up before on the show, I believe.

567
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,420
We talked about Movies last year, I think, you and I.

568
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,180
And I don't think Scott maybe didn't know Movies

569
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,020
off the top of his head.

570
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,980
Maybe, yeah, do I know it because you brought it up before?

571
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,140
It was, I believe, the first single from this album,

572
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,100
which I didn't have,

573
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,760
but it was not as nearly as big of a hit

574
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,380
as Smooth Criminal, the cover.

575
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,700
Of course, yeah, yeah.

576
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,580
So they are Ghostbusters in it, huh?

577
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:30,580
Both these videos played quite a bit on MTV and VH1.

578
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,060
But the alien ant farm, Smooth Criminal,

579
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,260
I think more for sure.

580
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,100
Oh yeah.

581
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,300
VH1 countdown, I mean, we talked about the VH1 countdown

582
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,740
with Amer Halim that I used to watch.

583
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,060
Amer Balim.

584
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,900
Amer Halim.

585
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,740
Amer Halim.

586
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,340
Amer Balim is the guy, he would host it,

587
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,180
and I would watch it for a year.

588
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,780
My family would watch it for years.

589
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,020
I watched other, I was probably more up on the AJ Hammer era.

590
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,460
Okay.

591
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,460
Yeah, I just remember like, he's like,

592
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,940
and then coming in at number three,

593
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,220
Paul McCartney's Lonely Road from Driving Rain.

594
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,420
And I'm like, oh wow, it made it to three, yes.

595
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,380
So good, keep climbing, Paul.

596
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,020
I watched it the most, I think,

597
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:13,020
when Meredith Brooke's bitch was on Dethronable.

598
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,780
Yeah, she was on there for like a year straight,

599
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,620
I feel like.

600
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

601
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,220
I like that song, I'll stand by that song.

602
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,380
I like that song too.

603
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,220
Yeah.

604
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,060
Jason, what do you feel about it?

605
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,940
The song again, Bitch.

606
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,780
I'm a bitch.

607
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,860
Yeah, I do like that song.

608
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,700
Yeah.

609
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,020
Yeah, it's a little crass, but I like it.

610
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,860
I should try.

611
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,300
I should try waking up tomorrow

612
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,900
and singing that to myself in the mirror

613
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,380
and see how I feel.

614
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,700
See what pep that puts in my step for the day.

615
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,420
Oh man, can we just talk about the top 10 countdown

616
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,420
for the rest of the show?

617
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,420
Well, then we'd be back to what I,

618
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,300
that's what I'd be doing right now at Erin

619
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,100
if I wasn't recording a podcast.

620
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,180
Sure, yeah, yeah.

621
00:22:55,180 --> 00:23:00,140
I used to watch like 2001, 2002,

622
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,060
I was like a counselor at a summer theater camp

623
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,980
and like eating breakfast before I went in.

624
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,260
I would watch on VH at one,

625
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,500
would just play music videos for like two or three hours

626
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,780
in the morning with like some commercials,

627
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,460
but very little interruption.

628
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,460
Hmm, well that's what you want.

629
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,300
Yeah.

630
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,340
I don't know, I want rankings,

631
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,460
I wanna know where everybody's at.

632
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,300
I wanna know the arbitrary.

633
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,420
Oh, I like the rankings.

634
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:26,420
Made up, decided by MTV executive Van Toffler ratings

635
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,900
are based on nothing.

636
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,340
Yeah, let's just go, we'll just,

637
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,700
we'll start reviewing countdown weeks.

638
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,380
We'll go back to April 2001 and see how we feel about it.

639
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,700
If somebody, yeah, yeah.

640
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:45,100
I'm gonna say REM's imitation of life on this same countdown.

641
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,060
I mean, that's good.

642
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,900
It is good, yeah.

643
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,740
Yeah, mm-hmm.

644
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,180
There's all the detail packed into it.

645
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,420
Anyway, we're here to talk about

646
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,420
something that's slightly longer than a music video.

647
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,020
So yeah, look, that lineup of people,

648
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,820
you gotta be intrigued by that.

649
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,460
And I think like, do you guys have in your head

650
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,780
like what you pictured this was before?

651
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,100
Like, I feel like I picked,

652
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,460
I also think I thought it would work for Haunt Kiss

653
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,380
the fact that I thought it'd be scary.

654
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,860
And I guess it's not, look,

655
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,220
realizing, oh, it's a family thing.

656
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,620
I shouldn't have been surprised.

657
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,460
But I think I just maybe wanted more.

658
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,380
I thought I'd feel more Dante in there.

659
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,780
Well, there is, I do remember,

660
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,260
I think I saw this when I went to

661
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,580
Busch Gardens Williamsburg, not this one,

662
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:35,460
but there was another 4D theater attraction

663
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:40,420
that was ghosts, but it was like a kid touring a castle.

664
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,980
And then there's all of these like weird old British

665
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,260
servant ghosts.

666
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:50,060
And it was weird just by, it was a little scarier

667
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,620
just by the nature of the location

668
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:56,780
and just all these ancient British character actors in it.

669
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,540
So I did, and again, I think maybe that was another

670
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:04,780
self-produced Busch movie.

671
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:10,060
So I was expecting it more along the lines of that.

672
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:13,300
This is much more Spielberg-y.

673
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,700
Yeah, I guess so.

674
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,260
Yeah, like the wonder and discovery.

675
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:21,420
Yeah, the score is very like adjacent to all those scores.

676
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,980
And can I just say this, there is so much score.

677
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,500
There is so much, there's so many stings.

678
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,340
There's so, it just doesn't stop.

679
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,860
Little twinkles and little ah,

680
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,300
can you believe the haunted house that we're in

681
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,500
and these children are filled with mystery and wonder.

682
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,060
Like that's the whole thing.

683
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,140
And then at the end, there's a little like comment.

684
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,260
Like you're going to, you would think,

685
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,020
oh, Christopher Lloyd, Michael McKeon, Leah Thompson.

686
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,860
You think there's going to give you

687
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,420
some comedy stuff here.

688
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,260
Very little.

689
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,100
It's mostly stings, it's mostly wonder.

690
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,060
And then 3D effects.

691
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,500
I think I found what your, this has to be what you were,

692
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,820
what you saw when you went.

693
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,500
It is called Haunts of the Old Country.

694
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,260
That's it, that's it, yeah.

695
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,220
Old D, old, O-L-D-E.

696
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:12,020
A ghoulish, this is a real, this sentence fights itself.

697
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:16,540
A ghoulishly thrilling tour of Great Britain's castles.

698
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:20,820
It's a sort of, it's exciting and then a little formal.

699
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,620
Not the most accurate.

700
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,580
You know what the other thing that might have made this

701
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,740
a little grungier is this was like made in the 90s.

702
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,580
So like the 3D much rougher,

703
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,660
the Haunts of the Old Country.

704
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,900
The Haunted Lighthouse feels like it should have been made

705
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:43,220
in the 90s, but in fact, it was 2003, it opened.

706
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,460
2003, yeah.

707
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,100
I mean it has like a filmic quality, you know,

708
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,500
it's still like, I mean it is film, I'm sure.

709
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,020
But it's got that vibe of,

710
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,140
you can definitely see what they're going for.

711
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,980
Of course.

712
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,140
It's just boring as shit.

713
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,820
It's just so boring and sleepy.

714
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,660
Agreed.

715
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,900
There's just no subs, like as if you just took all the like,

716
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:08,100
like spices and the garnishes from a Spielberg

717
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,340
and then you just use that and then that's the whole movie.

718
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,140
Let's be fair to it for a second.

719
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:18,060
Is some of the issue here, what literally was removed,

720
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,180
as you're saying with spices being sucked out of the dish.

721
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,740
Keep in mind that we are watching this on YouTube

722
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:32,620
with a perma-stamp watermark of Cymix Iwerks in it.

723
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:36,980
And then also not in a 4D theater.

724
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,100
Yes, you're right.

725
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,140
Because I think maybe basically the compositions

726
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,580
and things that happen would be a little more interesting,

727
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,900
the stuff in our face.

728
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,820
And then of course the water effects

729
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:53,020
because from any literature I found about this,

730
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,140
I think it is full of splashing.

731
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,540
You're sopping at the end of this.

732
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,420
And I'm not sure there's even a lot of other effects

733
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,260
up its sleeve.

734
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,540
I think this is, and hey, it's largely at SeaWorld.

735
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:07,620
So you wanna get wet, you wanna be in your splash zones.

736
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,300
And this movie was a big splash zone.

737
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,380
But you can, if you watch it,

738
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,340
you can kind of tell where the 3D moments are.

739
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,100
Oh yeah. Kind of?

740
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,580
Kind of, yeah.

741
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,180
When the frisbee comes at the screen?

742
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,340
Excuse me, I misspoke.

743
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,660
You can really tell that.

744
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,060
But in terms of other lighting.

745
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:29,020
Frisbee floats ominously in front of a camera

746
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,780
for five full seconds.

747
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,500
Yes, there's rats.

748
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,340
I'm sure they do the rats.

749
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,660
I think there was a rat thing.

750
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

751
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,820
The chairs were wired.

752
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,500
I'm sure, look, I'm sure you're right.

753
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,540
Because when you're in the theater and it's dark

754
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,260
and that score, like it's blasting the music.

755
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,340
As we know, I like a Vegas pool party,

756
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,500
douchey Vegas pool party.

757
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,820
Any music loud is good as far as I'm concerned

758
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,140
in a situation like that.

759
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,940
So if I'm hearing that like nice imitation,

760
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,220
whatever John Williams, whatever score in there.

761
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,140
Any music, this qualifies?

762
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,260
Like the score to haunted lighthouse,

763
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,060
if loud, that you love.

764
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:07,260
If I'm at the Hard Rock rehab pool party in Las Vegas

765
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,860
and they're blasting the haunted lighthouse score,

766
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,020
you know I'm gonna get fucking riled up.

767
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,820
That's just what I'm all about.

768
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,140
You gotta go request it.

769
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,540
Yeah.

770
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,620
Go request it.

771
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,940
Like when you really got the party going

772
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,220
at hell at the moon with your request of life as a highway.

773
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,460
Tried to get the guy to play life as a highway

774
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,780
at hell at the moon, did not know it or was mad.

775
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,620
I don't know.

776
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,740
That feels like it would be a grand slam.

777
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,580
Yeah, it was.

778
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,460
I didn't do something like snooty like play

779
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,060
check my machine or something by Paul McCartney.

780
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,980
I felt like life as a highway was just a chance.

781
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,140
True, I guess.

782
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,260
It's not so crazy.

783
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,940
Like am I making, I feel like in my memory

784
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,380
I saw it get looked at and like grimaced at

785
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,780
and then crumpled up.

786
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,340
I'm happy with that memory, real or not.

787
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,180
It's funny, real or not.

788
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,660
So yeah, what you're saying is correct.

789
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,980
This would obviously be a lot more fun

790
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,380
if there was not a stamp across it

791
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,300
and we were watching it in a theater

792
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,940
it was equipped to be shown in.

793
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,700
That might be filling in.

794
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,700
That's probably what if you came out of the theater happy

795
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,140
it was probably for those reasons

796
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,380
and maybe less so the storytelling

797
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:20,060
and seeing a boat dance at the end of the movie.

798
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:25,060
Yeah, there is a copy without the watermark

799
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,380
that is clearly a handheld camera.

800
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,220
Yes.

801
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,060
In one of the theaters.

802
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,060
So pick your poison.

803
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:35,380
You either get the stamp of the distributor

804
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,140
or you got these shaky handheld camera

805
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,980
at SeaWorld or a Busch Gardens.

806
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,820
Yeah, and I get it.

807
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,060
They don't want this thing getting out there

808
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,300
because if they bring it back

809
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,020
people aren't gonna go see it in the parks

810
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,780
and that's a draw.

811
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,140
I already watch it on YouTube weekly.

812
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,340
Yeah, it's already been bootleg.

813
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,980
It's already on Pirate Bay.

814
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,700
It's been torrented like crazy.

815
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,900
I know what everybody's been doing.

816
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,740
So I get it.

817
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,740
Pirate Bay, that sounds like the spot for it.

818
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,180
Pirate Bay 4D.

819
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,820
Captain Jack would be thrilled that.

820
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,940
Captain Jack is who Christopher,

821
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,220
one of Christopher Lloyd's,

822
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:13,060
is the new Christopher Lloyd character

823
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,260
brought to fruition in this film.

824
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:20,260
Is he as beloved as Doc Brown

825
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,780
or Uncle Fester or Reverend Jim?

826
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,420
I guess it's up to you, the audience,

827
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,660
to find this watermarked YouTube video

828
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,620
and decide for yourselves.

829
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,660
Yeah, we're not gonna post it.

830
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,780
We refuse to post it.

831
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,420
I mean, I liked him.

832
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:38,620
I feel like Christopher Lloyd still gives his all.

833
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,460
Yeah.

834
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,700
On stuff like this.

835
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,500
I can't say enough about this guy.

836
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,420
This guy, I don't know why,

837
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,900
he deserves an Oscar.

838
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,940
Give him an Oscar at this point.

839
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,980
I just watched Nobody a few weeks ago.

840
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,980
He's in Nobody with the Odenkirk movie.

841
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,540
He gets some fun stuff.

842
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,340
They gave him fun stuff to do.

843
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,420
Mm-hmm.

844
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,260
He's in something else too.

845
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,740
He's in that Affleck movie.

846
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,820
He's in that Affleck movie,

847
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,620
which I am kinda like, this looks kinda nice.

848
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,420
I think I might like this.

849
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,260
Sure.

850
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,780
Well, he's, you know, it's one of those careers

851
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:12,220
where he's in all of the best,

852
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,620
all of our favorite movies from growing up,

853
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,180
and then all of a sudden he's not,

854
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,860
he's in weird stuff you've never heard of

855
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,060
and seemingly will show up for whatever,

856
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,260
not unlike who, Mike, you brought up

857
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:29,260
in the last Main Feed episode that came up, Bruce Willis.

858
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,100
Right.

859
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,860
And that leads me to the game portion.

860
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,700
Oh, good.

861
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,520
Of the episode.

862
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,820
Good, good, good.

863
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:39,660
The, we're gonna play a little round of Lloyd or Willis.

864
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,300
I'm gonna say a title.

865
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,980
And now this could be, and these are all pretty recent.

866
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,300
I believe these are all from the last decade.

867
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,460
I tried to pick the most generic titles possible.

868
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,460
So Stacked, Pamela Anderson, Stacked is not on this.

869
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,460
Stacked we would know.

870
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,300
Yes, we would know.

871
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,140
We know that that audience, you know it's Lloyd.

872
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,860
Lloyd is on the sitcom Stacked.

873
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,900
Right.

874
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:05,900
Now some of these, one of them might've been said already,

875
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,860
I might not know, or one of them might've been said

876
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,260
in the Bruce Willis thing last week.

877
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,780
We'll find out.

878
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,800
All right, Making a Killing.

879
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,500
Are we gonna buzz in or the rule, or is this just informal?

880
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,340
It's informal, I suppose.

881
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think it's more just,

882
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,980
I believe that is Lloyd.

883
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,100
I'm gonna say Lloyd too.

884
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,060
That's Lloyd, yeah.

885
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,780
Fire with Fire.

886
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,340
I think that's Willis.

887
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,900
I think it's Lloyd.

888
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,740
Willis.

889
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,560
Okay.

890
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,780
All right, if we are keeping score.

891
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,620
I'm winning, yes.

892
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,460
Yes.

893
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,420
Precious Cargo.

894
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,020
Oof, that sounds like Willis to me.

895
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,740
Yeah, I think Willis too.

896
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,620
That is Willis and is a two-hander with Mark Paul Gosselaar.

897
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,460
Hell yes.

898
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,280
Yeah, hell yes.

899
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,300
Check it out, go to your red box and find it.

900
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,180
Okay, Cold Moon.

901
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,780
Ooh, Cold Moon.

902
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,620
That's gotta be Lloyd.

903
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,700
I think almost nothing.

904
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,700
I think Lloyd.

905
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,580
That is Lloyd.

906
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,960
Nice.

907
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,300
The Cold Light of Day.

908
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,360
Willis.

909
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,500
Lloyd.

910
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,340
Willis.

911
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:08,980
Five to three.

912
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,460
Mike has a handle on this.

913
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,100
Cold Pursuit.

914
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,500
Willis?

915
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,820
I think Willis.

916
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,940
That is a trick question.

917
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:22,020
That is a Liam Neeson movie you've never heard of.

918
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,660
Oh, is that the Trucker movie?

919
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,900
Could be, who knows?

920
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,740
That's a very good, is he working for Ralphs?

921
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,580
Is he ever pulled the cold goods?

922
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,140
He's like an ice-gro trucker.

923
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,260
Oh, that kind of trucker.

924
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,380
He's an ice-gro trucker.

925
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,040
Wish you were dead.

926
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,300
That, see, that could be either a funky indie comedy.

927
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,260
That's exactly how I'm doing all of them.

928
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,340
And it's been right so far.

929
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,180
Yeah.

930
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,000
I'm gonna say Lloyd.

931
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,140
I think Lloyd as well.

932
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:48,980
That's Lloyd.

933
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,580
Yes.

934
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,320
Out of Death.

935
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,160
Willis.

936
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,000
Willis.

937
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,900
Yeah, yeah, that's kind of the pattern.

938
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,000
And then this is a tough one.

939
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,320
Deadly Games.

940
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,260
Is there a Willis Deadly Games?

941
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,460
Is it, could this one be both?

942
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,060
I don't believe there, there very well could be,

943
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,980
but as far as I know, this is Christopher Lloyd's territory

944
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,540
as he plays, where he plays the great Sebastian Jackle.

945
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,900
We've really, we've suddenly, like,

946
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,980
there'll be one of those where like,

947
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,460
we'll really, we'll pull the wool over the audience.

948
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,740
Maybe we won't, because I'm saying this,

949
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:28,100
but like, we'll eventually do Deadly Games

950
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,380
and one comment will be like, yes, finally, Deadly Games.

951
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,700
Waiting for the, maybe the episode should be called

952
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,780
Sebastian Jackle instead of.

953
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,140
That's a more exciting title, I think.

954
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:39,980
All right.

955
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,580
It's gotta be the episode with Brent Spiner

956
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,660
playing a very Joker-like character.

957
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,380
Oh, cool, okay, okay.

958
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:48,380
I was thinking about you, because I recently,

959
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:54,100
and this was like, I polled, like, well, it's my birthday,

960
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,980
I wanna watch this, and Jane had suffered through it,

961
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,900
I watched Master Disguise.

962
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,900
Oh, right, right, right.

963
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,060
And Brent Spiner is the bad guy.

964
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,900
Right, yes.

965
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,720
Yeah.

966
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,840
He has, yeah, he's got like a little,

967
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,600
it's an interesting thing, he does Independence Day,

968
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,720
he does that, and then he's the cruise director

969
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,160
on the Walter Matha Jack Lemon movie, Out to Sea.

970
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,280
He's the snooty cruise director

971
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,800
who like is the bad guy of that movie.

972
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,800
So he like pops up around that time in a lot of stuff.

973
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,000
And then he's in Independence Day Resurgence,

974
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,640
despite obviously being torn to shreds

975
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,560
by alien tentacles, clearly.

976
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,360
There's deaths that are ambiguous,

977
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,800
and then there's ripped apart by.

978
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,880
Well, he's not ripped apart, he's choked out really bad,

979
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,920
and then they shove his. He's in a coma, right?

980
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,160
And then they shove, well, they don't say,

981
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,240
they just shove his face, the last time you see him,

982
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,600
and correct me if I'm wrong,

983
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,340
they shove his face up to like the glass.

984
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,180
Yeah.

985
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,540
And he's like talking to them, and then it pulls it back,

986
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,920
and that's the last you see of him.

987
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,160
I guess maybe he's not torn to bits.

988
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,280
Yeah. I guess suppose.

989
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,160
I guess it's a rough recovery.

990
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,760
I assumed he was dead from seeing the first movie.

991
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,600
But.

992
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,680
One of the many great surprises and thrills.

993
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,200
From, yeah.

994
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,120
Man.

995
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,940
Spiner's back.

996
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,800
Weird Chinese milk product placements throughout

997
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,520
on the moon base.

998
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,360
Right, right.

999
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,600
As a Hemsworth on a moon base drinking a milk

1000
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,360
you've never seen in your life.

1001
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,840
You know, be an extreme close up.

1002
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,240
Hey, that milk paid for half the movie, Scott.

1003
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,640
It wouldn't exist without the milk.

1004
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,240
Yeah, and I gotta try this milk.

1005
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,920
This milk is like a catalyst in so many movies nowadays.

1006
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,720
I gotta try this milk.

1007
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,360
They've stopped being okay with characters

1008
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,200
just sipping it on the way to something.

1009
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,640
It has to be the plot hinges on the milk.

1010
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,480
Right.

1011
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,960
Getting, the characters get stronger.

1012
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,840
The grand milk.

1013
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,680
My bones.

1014
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,000
All right, well now we've done about everything we could do

1015
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,320
besides talk about the movie,

1016
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,680
and maybe our backs are against the wall now.

1017
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,520
God damn.

1018
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,340
Okay.

1019
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,560
Yeah, so the movie,

1020
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,680
most of the movie is just, you know,

1021
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,240
Christopher, I mean, Christopher like tells the kids

1022
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,640
a little legend, like a ghost story basically,

1023
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,000
and then they meet a ghost boy who's not a ghost boy yet.

1024
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,200
He reveals himself, I mean he is, but he reveals it later.

1025
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,040
Yeah.

1026
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,880
And then they go to.

1027
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,800
It's in modern times and we're in Cape Cod,

1028
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,480
and there's a story that Captain Jack tells,

1029
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,680
and then the people from the story show up

1030
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,840
almost instantly.

1031
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,680
Yeah.

1032
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,640
Yeah, and you gotta go ahead.

1033
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,000
Well, I was gonna say, my, a big,

1034
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,320
there's a couple things that stick in my craw about this,

1035
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,880
and I think the biggest one is,

1036
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:39,000
what are the two kids' relationship to Captain Jack,

1037
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,720
and where are their parents?

1038
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,400
Yeah, no, yeah, don't see parents.

1039
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,880
Maybe that was Stacey's mom.

1040
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,800
They're alive, they seem to be alive,

1041
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,400
because as he tells the kids at the end,

1042
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,840
tell your parents not to order the Scrod,

1043
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,800
one of the funny fish names that you can say in a comedy.

1044
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,960
Again, it is a Christopher Lloyd character

1045
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,960
who's old and creepy and being visited by children

1046
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,520
away from their parents.

1047
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:11,000
Like, the young people cannot stay away from the,

1048
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,280
like the filthy shack where old Christopher Lloyd

1049
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,320
does his business.

1050
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,320
Well, he's obviously one of the most charismatic,

1051
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,400
engaging actors of all time, so it makes sense

1052
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,040
that he's like a cartoon man in a lot of ways.

1053
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,360
You know, somebody on IMDB had a similar complaint.

1054
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,320
They said, you know, this thing isn't too terrible,

1055
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,000
but I think the main problem is it's too short.

1056
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,360
That was a review they had, and they said

1057
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,200
that they wanted other things fleshed out.

1058
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,520
They had questions.

1059
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,040
Yeah, they wanted to know more about the shack.

1060
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,640
Yeah, I don't know what they said about the shack,

1061
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,480
but you're on the same page.

1062
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,600
When he tells that kid, keep an eye on the old shack,

1063
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,880
I'm like, oh, my dream.

1064
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,960
Was it an old man's bait shack?

1065
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,800
Sounds great.

1066
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,080
That and I'd imagine like spending a bunch of time

1067
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,720
in a lighthouse would have its appeal as well.

1068
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,240
Although, you know, when the kids do do that,

1069
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,840
they do, both of them experience a thing

1070
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,680
that I was occasionally scared of as a kid,

1071
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,720
which is falling down, falling through a banister,

1072
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,560
like putting your weight on a banister.

1073
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,520
I was afraid of that too.

1074
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,840
It wasn't one of my main fears as a kid,

1075
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,480
but it definitely would come up every now and then.

1076
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,160
I feel like the banisters in my childhood home growing up

1077
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,600
were like practical, but not the sturdiest.

1078
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:30,600
So I feel like maybe I tripped on the stairs once.

1079
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,880
Do you have that weird, is it lemmings?

1080
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,480
What am I thinking of when you go in a mall

1081
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,960
and you're very high up and your brain just kind of

1082
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,080
keeps going like, throw yourself over.

1083
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,680
Like you have kind of have a thought,

1084
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,400
it's not serious thought, but it's like,

1085
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,000
or not really throw yourself over,

1086
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,600
just like, you know, you could fall.

1087
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,720
You could fall all the way down there.

1088
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,320
I have these weird thoughts like that

1089
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,280
and I used to have similar thoughts with like the banister

1090
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,880
and the railing in my house.

1091
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,080
Yeah, they say that's healthy to have like

1092
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,880
an occasional thought like that and then not acting on it.

1093
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,720
It shows a sign that you're in control.

1094
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,720
Right, I'm in control.

1095
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,600
I mean, do you ever have like when you're in a situation

1096
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,520
like if you've ever seen like a musical performance

1097
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,560
like an orchestra or something and your brain just goes,

1098
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,760
throw something at the orchestra.

1099
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,160
Yeah, it's like what I used to talk about in the past,

1100
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:17,440
like, you know, drive next to an empty store front,

1101
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,520
empty Starbucks or something.

1102
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,440
It's like, drive your car through the window.

1103
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,280
What's the harm?

1104
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,120
No one's in there.

1105
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,040
No one's gonna get hurt.

1106
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,360
Scott, what have you thought?

1107
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,200
What have you tried?

1108
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,440
What has your brain told you to do?

1109
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,800
Well, this isn't bad, but I feel like now I'm stuck on it

1110
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,360
and I have to say it.

1111
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,680
I think there was a,

1112
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,200
this has been rattling around in my head for decades

1113
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,160
and there's no way to prove whether or not it happened,

1114
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,680
but I've chosen to believe that it did.

1115
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,160
And it's akin to what you were saying.

1116
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,240
I think there was some scenario where I was on a class

1117
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,360
field trip to see some enriching performance

1118
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:54,280
from the great, much lauded, many times award winning,

1119
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,720
honored at the Emmys this year, Debbie Allen.

1120
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,560
Oh wow.

1121
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,280
Like a whole elementary school class went to see something

1122
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,960
that Debbie Allen was doing

1123
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,560
and something that I should have appreciated.

1124
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:09,960
But I was eight or nine, so I got very bored

1125
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,640
and I started looking at the program instead.

1126
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,200
And I think I might've had my feet up on the chair

1127
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,040
and it was just, but I was also within eye range

1128
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,240
of Debbie Allen.

1129
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,080
Like she, this is not a movie.

1130
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,280
She's in the room and she's there.

1131
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,560
And I believe that what may have happened is

1132
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,800
that I was nudged or elbowed by someone next to me like,

1133
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,000
hey, and I think that Debbie Allen may have stopped

1134
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,680
what she was doing to stare at me

1135
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,600
until I stopped looking down at my program.

1136
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,600
Wow, really?

1137
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:47,000
Being so disrespectful to this Debbie Allen performance.

1138
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,840
That's wild.

1139
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,400
I think that I may have, or it was all a coincidence

1140
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,640
that I've been imagining this for a long time.

1141
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,480
Wait.

1142
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,040
I would need footage to know.

1143
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,600
Well, there's no way to know.

1144
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,520
So you were just, you were standing on?

1145
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,800
I wasn't standing, no.

1146
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,680
You were just looking down at your program.

1147
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,600
I was just, yeah, I was bored.

1148
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,720
Like, I'm gonna look, I'm gonna read this.

1149
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,080
I'm gonna see what ads are in here.

1150
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,960
I always looked at the program.

1151
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,400
A Pauly Shore character at dinner,

1152
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,600
like a Pauly Shore character at like a nice dinner.

1153
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,400
Feet up, like reading something when you should be like.

1154
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:22,400
Bare feet, cleaning my feet with spit.

1155
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,480
And like polishing it with the program.

1156
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,880
Okay.

1157
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,100
Well, yeah, I mean, sure, you might look at a program

1158
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,160
during a performance, but this was an intimate,

1159
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,400
but whatever this was, whatever Debbie Allen was doing

1160
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,680
for these children in 1994,

1161
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,240
I have no idea.

1162
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,400
But I've been horrified for decades.

1163
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,240
Wow.

1164
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,080
That I angered.

1165
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,960
And anytime Debbie Allen comes up like at the Emmys,

1166
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,360
I get bummed out.

1167
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,600
I'm enjoying the Emmys,

1168
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,400
Conan's messing around, having fun.

1169
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,280
And then Debbie Allen is given an award.

1170
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,980
And I'm like, oh shit.

1171
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,440
And I get sad about what I,

1172
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,280
how I might've offended Debbie Allen as a child.

1173
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,180
No, I get that.

1174
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,020
That's a guilt.

1175
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,360
No, this is a different thing that we were talking about.

1176
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,720
This is just pure guilt from doing something

1177
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,640
where you made like an adult mad and it was like embarrassed.

1178
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,480
I know it's a different thing.

1179
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,600
Just as soon as you, that's how much it is on my,

1180
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,920
and I'm so glad that I vented it now.

1181
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,800
Because when you said something about interrupting

1182
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,040
a performance, I just got lost in,

1183
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,080
I have to bring up this Debbie Allen thing.

1184
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,320
It's haunting you still.

1185
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,740
This is what haunts me.

1186
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,480
This is a month to get your fears out

1187
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,320
of my biggest fears that I made Debbie Allen angry.

1188
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,020
During a one woman show,

1189
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,480
she was the only person on stage by the way.

1190
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,320
Yeah.

1191
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,200
So she may have stopped the performance cold

1192
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,400
to stare angrily at me.

1193
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,320
She's an executive producer credit on Craze and Anime.

1194
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,480
Did you know that?

1195
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,300
I didn't.

1196
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,720
She directs a lot of TV shows.

1197
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,540
Okay.

1198
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:50,120
So that's why I haven't gotten any callbacks.

1199
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,600
Does she have a Twitter?

1200
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,280
Can we tweet this story at her to see if she remembers?

1201
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,120
Oh no.

1202
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:55,940
Why?

1203
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:56,920
I mean, you can apologize.

1204
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,880
Well, yes, I would like to do that.

1205
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,560
And if Debbie Allen's already a subscriber

1206
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,020
to haunt cast the Fright, the Cemetery Gate,

1207
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,440
then I apologize to you profusely right now.

1208
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,880
I was but a child.

1209
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,080
Wow.

1210
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,600
I mean, look, if she hears,

1211
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,160
I mean, hopefully she would have a sense of humor about it.

1212
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,600
You were but a child,

1213
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,480
but I feel like we can make this happen.

1214
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,320
I feel like we'll find her.

1215
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,920
I was but a child, but I was also a real but,

1216
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,320
and I'd be willing to say that to her.

1217
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,160
I was a but to you.

1218
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,160
She'll appreciate that I think for sure.

1219
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:27,960
Wow.

1220
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,780
Okay.

1221
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:29,620
So that's out.

1222
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:30,840
That is out.

1223
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:35,180
Not the good boy the listeners thought he was, I guess.

1224
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:37,120
There's a lot more darkness in some,

1225
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,000
one of our hosts passed than we thought.

1226
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Unattentive on a field trip, one woman show, eh?

1227
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:45,920
Man.

1228
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,000
Relaxing.

1229
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:47,820
Hmm.

1230
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:51,540
A reason for ending my subscription?

1231
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,380
Well.

1232
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,520
Respect Ms. Allen, please.

1233
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,660
Bad behavior from one of the hosts 30 years ago.

1234
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,440
All right, you guys keep,

1235
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,640
because I might just be thinking.

1236
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,480
Yeah, yeah.

1237
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,520
We'll just, Jason, I'll keep talking.

1238
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,880
So yeah, so the kids are outside the shack

1239
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,000
and you get your first, wait,

1240
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,720
is there an earlier 3D gag than just that weird frisbee?

1241
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,720
Frisbee.

1242
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,000
It's one of the weirdest versions of this I've ever seen.

1243
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:17,840
It is.

1244
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,080
There's weird, there's a number of moments in this

1245
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,160
that go on just like a bit too long

1246
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,040
and you start to get a little antsy.

1247
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:24,880
Yeah, and then this one,

1248
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,280
like the frisbee hovers in the air and it looks,

1249
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,320
and again, we're looking on a low resolution version of this

1250
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,720
but it looks like an orange version

1251
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,240
of like the T1000 from T2 or something.

1252
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,040
It looks like this bizarre shaped object

1253
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,520
that's hovering in the air for way too long.

1254
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,480
It looks like it might be like alien or something.

1255
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,480
It's the same vibe as when that skull cartoonishly,

1256
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,760
where when Arnold's skull, metallic skull,

1257
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,720
hovers up towards the screen for a long time in T2, 3D.

1258
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,840
It's exactly that, but a beach frisbee.

1259
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,680
But a beach frisbee and then it hits the kid in the head.

1260
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,600
In the head, that's pretty funny.

1261
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,440
Pretty good, this kid gets hit in the head a couple times.

1262
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,480
What Debbie Allen should have done to me.

1263
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,160
Throwing a weird T1000 organic frisbee.

1264
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,760
A time warping frisbee at me.

1265
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,200
Organic matter frisbee, organic matter metal frisbee.

1266
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,600
Dance shoe, a morphing dance shoe.

1267
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,600
A soft shoe.

1268
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,960
I just appreciate if it was soft,

1269
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,960
but whatever she wants.

1270
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,400
I prefer not, but I might deserve more than soft.

1271
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,320
Or she would have done the next 3D trick,

1272
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,280
spit a bunch of water in your face,

1273
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,160
which is what this kid gets.

1274
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,840
I like that we know we have water effects in our theater

1275
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,400
and we know we're doing 3D.

1276
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,760
Because it's usually a splash in a body of water

1277
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,080
or something, but a man spitting at you.

1278
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,000
Yes, Christopher Lloyd spits on a child in this movie.

1279
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,840
Baaah!

1280
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:54,280
And it's real gross and it's unexpected.

1281
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,480
So yeah, that one's a weirder thing to have happen,

1282
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,680
but the effect is I think less weird than the frisbee.

1283
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:05,080
Yeah, and then he said they discuss the widow

1284
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,320
who's worth 14 million clams.

1285
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,200
Right, and he's like,

1286
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,320
Christopher Lloyd gets like old gaga over that.

1287
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,480
He gets gaga over it and then he takes two

1288
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:17,320
like giant taxidermy, like a mounted swordfish.

1289
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,160
Right.

1290
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,160
Like I gotta go see her.

1291
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,800
And it's like, what could that be?

1292
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,400
What are you doing with those?

1293
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,800
Yeah, it's unclear.

1294
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,280
Yeah.

1295
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,080
Yeah, that's when he leaves the kids at the shack.

1296
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,040
And then...

1297
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,360
What's the shack at that point?

1298
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,480
It's like where a Baywatch station,

1299
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,200
where like a lifeguard station would be,

1300
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,040
but what does he do?

1301
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,120
Why does he have that?

1302
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,960
It's bait and souvenirs and like, yeah.

1303
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,800
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1304
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,640
So he's a captain,

1305
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,400
but he's trying to make some money on the side, I assume.

1306
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,960
He's probably mostly on the beach.

1307
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,280
They establish he rents boats.

1308
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,120
Right.

1309
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,400
Because he gets on a boat at one point to chase after them

1310
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,480
because they've stolen one of his boats

1311
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,880
to go to the lighthouse.

1312
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,680
Mm-hmm, yes.

1313
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,800
This is, you paid so much closer attention than I did.

1314
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,520
I kept trying, I had to keep backing up to say,

1315
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,000
Winters really tells the old,

1316
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,400
the ghost story at the beginning.

1317
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,800
It just like did not get through.

1318
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,960
It's just, oh, there it is.

1319
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,120
Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1320
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,800
And I didn't, I just couldn't make heads or tails of it.

1321
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,320
There's a very, and I don't, again,

1322
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,120
I don't know if it's because of the conversion on YouTube,

1323
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:24,560
but there's a quality to this movie that feels like

1324
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,240
it's one of those movies where they had to dub

1325
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,240
all the dialogue again.

1326
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:33,000
I looked up behind the scenes information about the film,

1327
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,600
Joe Dante's complaints about making 3D films in that era

1328
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,320
because he then later made a movie,

1329
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,880
and I don't remember the title.

1330
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,520
I feel like a movie that was in theaters,

1331
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,880
and I'm not remembering it,

1332
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,200
but he said how much he preferred doing it

1333
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,960
in the digital age.

1334
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,680
He said, because I made this thing for a theme park

1335
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,640
on a lighthouse, and it was 70 millimeter cameras,

1336
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,840
and they were so loud.

1337
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,680
Oh, right, yes, yes.

1338
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,440
There were six people to move them anywhere,

1339
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,720
and we had to loop all of the dialogue

1340
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,280
because those cameras were whirring so loud.

1341
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,120
So you're exactly right.

1342
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,440
That is one of the stranger facts about this movie.

1343
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,040
It was shot in 70 millimeter,

1344
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,720
which is like the thing, that's what Paul Thomas Anderson,

1345
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,440
Quentin Tarantino, it's like we're gonna shoot in 70,

1346
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,520
we're gonna have some prints at the best theaters

1347
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,600
in the country.

1348
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,560
This is how we would like it shown.

1349
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,320
Because yeah, originally all that,

1350
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,800
yeah, they used that back in the old days,

1351
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,800
but then they would use that for,

1352
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,240
because the first time I saw stuff large format,

1353
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,720
was IMAX at a museum downtown.

1354
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,560
So you would see, I think we saw Everest,

1355
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,380
and it was a crazy giant screen,

1356
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,360
and they had shot on big film cameras.

1357
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,080
I would assume it might be probably the same issue

1358
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:49,260
with that, was it fake snow sounds and stuff?

1359
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,000
Were they adding all the sound?

1360
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:51,840
I don't know.

1361
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,880
Mountains space under the sea.

1362
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,720
Like those early IMAX.

1363
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,680
I think a lot of IMAX stuff, it's all sound design,

1364
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:01,800
because the places that they go to do those,

1365
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:06,160
to also mic it nicely, I feel like,

1366
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,560
I think those are heavily sound design.

1367
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,160
I don't really know.

1368
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,240
A switch I think happened at some point though,

1369
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,800
because obviously they were using large format

1370
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,680
for like scenes in the dark night.

1371
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,620
I know they have like smaller IMAX cameras now,

1372
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:22,340
which they shot like Endgame on and stuff,

1373
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:24,180
or the two Avengers movies.

1374
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:27,660
It makes me queasy in IMAX theaters,

1375
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,660
when it goes from widescreen to suddenly

1376
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,100
it's an IMAX square.

1377
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,620
Oh, you like it to be consistent.

1378
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,740
I just like a widescreen.

1379
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:37,060
I like a cinemascope, I like a widescreen.

1380
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,780
I loved it in dark night.

1381
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:39,620
Oh yeah, I was just.

1382
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,620
Suddenly, and I was like,

1383
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:41,900
how are they gonna do that transition,

1384
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,480
and then it's just a cut, it's like Soarin'.

1385
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,460
I thought it was so cool to just like,

1386
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:47,420
what's it gonna be?

1387
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,020
And I don't like those morphs in Soarin',

1388
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:51,100
as much as I like just the cuts, just cuts.

1389
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:54,980
I agree, when we saw it, City Walk,

1390
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:58,420
one of the opening, maybe the first or second day,

1391
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:01,660
and the first like shot where there's panning over the city,

1392
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,980
the audience gasped.

1393
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:03,820
Yeah.

1394
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:04,780
We were all like, whoa.

1395
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:08,220
That feels like a conscious aesthetic choice though.

1396
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:09,980
And I feel like now where so much

1397
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:12,140
is just thrown onto IMAX screens.

1398
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,280
It's less impactful.

1399
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,940
Yeah, maybe that's true.

1400
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,260
No one's gonna be more careful.

1401
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,700
Some of those are just blown up,

1402
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,940
and they weren't necessarily shot for that large.

1403
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:23,820
Nolan would be so mad that we're not.

1404
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,900
We didn't watch Haunted.

1405
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,500
You reviewed Haunted Linehouse 4D

1406
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,580
without even seeing it with the rat effect.

1407
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:32,420
When his wife.

1408
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,260
You judge this film.

1409
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,840
When his wife is playing him the podcast off her phone,

1410
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,380
because he doesn't have a phone, I've heard,

1411
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:42,140
he'll be listening to the Patreon, and he'll be so upset.

1412
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,740
Sorry, Mrs. Nolan.

1413
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,740
There's so many people who apologize too.

1414
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:52,300
So then, I mean, so yes, they meet these kids,

1415
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:55,660
and then, and who, like, you're, all right,

1416
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:56,740
it's a ghost, got it.

1417
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,900
I think you know that pretty fast.

1418
00:52:58,900 --> 00:52:59,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1419
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:02,380
You've heard about some ghost kids,

1420
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:05,380
and then you see a kid, oh, it's probably the ghost kid.

1421
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:07,440
But there's that one effect that's pretty great

1422
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,440
of that shark that's slowly getting closer behind them,

1423
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,620
and then suddenly bursts through the painter,

1424
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,580
or you think it's a painting or something.

1425
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:20,700
Yeah, and then right after, the kids are like,

1426
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:24,140
isn't clear, where the ghosts?

1427
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:27,140
Like, kind of, I feel like the ghost kids

1428
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:30,660
are supposed to be a little sinister and a little dark,

1429
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:34,060
but I don't know that they're sticking the delivery

1430
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:37,460
on some of their lines, but I like when their eyeballs

1431
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,060
pop out and their head gets real big,

1432
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:41,140
or they become fish-headed at one point.

1433
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:43,700
Yeah, so the kid, to prove to the living kids

1434
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:48,500
that he's a ghost, decides to like, maskify his head.

1435
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:52,140
He becomes the mask, but without the fun green face.

1436
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,540
And that's a still that, you know,

1437
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,460
when we will get out there,

1438
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,300
that's an image that might let you know,

1439
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,780
you're, however you feel about the boy

1440
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,580
with the stretching neck,

1441
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,300
might tell you if you wanna watch this

1442
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,420
on YouTube in full or not.

1443
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:10,540
It's a little creepy, but I guess you're,

1444
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:13,300
you're watching this and going, what did Dante respond to?

1445
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:16,500
And I think it was probably, I wanna play with the toys,

1446
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,660
I wanna pull these effects out.

1447
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:20,220
Maybe there's some like quickie version

1448
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:23,300
of silly fun gremlin-sy effects.

1449
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,740
But I think it just aesthetically doesn't,

1450
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:29,380
it's all, so much of it is in that just blue gauze.

1451
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:34,340
A really, yeah, blue like haze of a weird haunted house.

1452
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:37,460
Like they stretched that blue, like,

1453
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:40,460
sandwich wrapping over the camera lines.

1454
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1455
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,180
I'd say it's a real caked in.

1456
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,700
And that really, when you're watching on YouTube

1457
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,380
on your computer, which is what I watched,

1458
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,780
it's a sleepy, I really want some,

1459
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,340
that blue hue is just so inviting for you

1460
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:52,180
to go right to bed.

1461
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,020
Like you wanna go to sleep.

1462
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,500
I never, I didn't make it through this without a pause.

1463
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,340
Yeah.

1464
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:58,060
It'd be only being 20 minutes.

1465
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,980
I needed a, all right, quick break.

1466
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:02,540
I checked the time, like the, like,

1467
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:05,980
how much, it's not, hit up on the Roku remote

1468
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:07,820
to see where the slider was at.

1469
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:10,420
Little time check.

1470
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:14,940
So, yeah, you meet some ghost kids and you like,

1471
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,020
you know, they do scary stuff.

1472
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:18,060
They get fish heads.

1473
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:23,060
They, it suddenly gets kind of malicious seeming, right?

1474
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:24,220
Or what's the plan?

1475
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,060
What do the ghost kids want?

1476
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:26,900
Jason, help us out here.

1477
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,020
What do the ghost kids want?

1478
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:32,260
They, well, they, the parents never showed back up.

1479
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,380
The parents told them to wait at the lighthouse

1480
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:35,220
no matter what.

1481
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:39,180
And it appears that they waited so long they died.

1482
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:43,140
And at some point they get to the conclusion

1483
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,740
that they need to activate the beacon,

1484
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:48,140
reactivate the beacon in the lighthouse.

1485
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,940
To let the parents know that they're out there.

1486
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:52,180
Yeah, to let the parents know.

1487
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:55,020
I mean, they're, like I said, both kids,

1488
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:58,140
human kids fall through banisters.

1489
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:01,260
The boy, he really eats it.

1490
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,220
And then like, he's like, I'm okay.

1491
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,260
And it's like, really?

1492
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,340
Cause that seemed awful that fall.

1493
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:07,180
Yeah, yeah.

1494
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:10,180
And then the girl, it kind of, she, she,

1495
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:14,060
the sister falls and like catches, she, she,

1496
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:19,060
there's a spear gun and she like gets like, you know,

1497
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:26,540
gets to do the kid's trope of equipping and using a weapon

1498
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:28,820
that was all in all kids entertainment.

1499
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:32,380
Be prepared to get a weapon and be prepared to use it.

1500
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:34,460
And then also you might be hanging from a rope

1501
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:37,140
and have to kick off the walls at some point.

1502
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:39,420
And that, that was just go-to.

1503
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:42,860
Maybe it still is a go-to in a lot of kids entertainment.

1504
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:46,580
But they do the shot, they do like a shot of her hanging

1505
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:50,300
from the rope and it's the same angle as the stretching room.

1506
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,980
Yes, you know what I'm saying.

1507
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:52,820
Oh yeah, yes.

1508
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:54,540
You're like, it's a real dark.

1509
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,380
Yeah.

1510
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:56,220
Is that what's happening?

1511
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:58,100
When I was paying, yeah, when I was half paying attention

1512
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,580
to it, I went, is she, what?

1513
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,420
Oh, okay.

1514
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,260
Yeah.

1515
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,460
I went, that's an, oh.

1516
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,180
It was business with, cause the,

1517
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:08,020
the brother picks up the spear gun earlier and he's like,

1518
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,580
let's kill those ghosts.

1519
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:11,940
Like he was bloodthirsty.

1520
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:14,660
Dark film, isn't it?

1521
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:15,500
Yeah.

1522
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,460
And of course both the parents die and become ghosts.

1523
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:21,060
Like early on, that was another fear of mine as a kid.

1524
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:23,660
My parents would go away for like a nice weekend together

1525
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:25,100
and not come back.

1526
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:26,100
When they went to see.

1527
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,300
Well, I thought the Poconos, but sure, at sea.

1528
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,220
We'll go with that.

1529
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,900
But they, they do get them back.

1530
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:40,100
They do return on this boat and these two ghosts ominously

1531
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,540
float back to their children.

1532
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:46,140
And the parents are Michael McKeon and Leah Thompson.

1533
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:50,020
Leah Thompson chooses to play it like a woman,

1534
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:53,060
a regular woman who's slightly from the past.

1535
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:56,700
And McKeon is like, well, well, my children, I,

1536
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:00,060
he's just full like theater character.

1537
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:01,860
The sketch comedy, like past guys.

1538
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:02,700
Yes.

1539
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:03,540
Yeah.

1540
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,260
Because he makes a joke about the kids being

1541
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:06,620
a little homicidal.

1542
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:09,580
And it's like, I think I kind of see where

1543
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,660
that joke came from, but it didn't.

1544
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,420
Maybe there's supposed to be more stuff like that.

1545
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:16,700
Maybe it was more gremlin Z and then if you could,

1546
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:21,460
I would venture to guess that someone in Bush or SeaWorld

1547
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:24,580
is like, but this is for all family audiences.

1548
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:26,780
So take out anything interesting about it.

1549
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:27,820
Yeah.

1550
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:31,260
It's just, I mean, the kids, like, they definitely thought

1551
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,500
the 3D is going to do the heavy lifting,

1552
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,260
the 3D in the score, not the kids getting to like,

1553
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,140
be weird or quirky.

1554
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,420
Like they're like, don't worry.

1555
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:42,140
The 3D is the thing.

1556
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:42,980
Yeah.

1557
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:43,800
That's going to sell it.

1558
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,740
So again, we're missing that, you know, we're missing.

1559
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:46,580
Yeah.

1560
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:48,740
And for Tampa Bay and Williamsburg,

1561
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:51,420
it got people in out of the humidity.

1562
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:55,460
Yes.

1563
00:58:55,460 --> 00:59:00,100
It's the whole middle, maybe 13, 14 minutes is a blur.

1564
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:00,940
Yes.

1565
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:03,340
I remember the end and the start.

1566
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,260
That's exactly where I'm at.

1567
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,100
Yes. Yeah.

1568
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:12,540
But yeah, I think it picks up when you get Ghost McKeon

1569
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:16,980
who is very thankful that his children have been brought

1570
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:20,020
back to him in the ghostly realm and says,

1571
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:23,180
there's no way to, that I could ever repay you kids.

1572
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:27,220
Although you might want to know about the sunken galley

1573
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:30,340
and references made to a treasure.

1574
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:34,660
It's nice to hear McKeon say pirates booty.

1575
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:35,900
He's enjoying, he's like,

1576
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,780
He's doing a little fun voice there.

1577
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:40,020
He's having fun in a children's thing.

1578
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:40,860
Yeah.

1579
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:41,700
That's what you, you know,

1580
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:42,980
should expect out of an actor.

1581
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:46,340
He says great Scott man to Christopher Lloyd,

1582
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:49,020
which I'm assuming is a little nod.

1583
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:50,420
It would have to imagine.

1584
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,700
It would have to.

1585
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:54,420
To which like in like one time,

1586
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:57,260
in every screening there was one guy who was like,

1587
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,860
ha ha ha ha.

1588
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:01,180
And like nobody then looked around like,

1589
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:04,540
why aren't you all laughing triumphantly at that?

1590
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:07,100
Yeah. It's from the movie.

1591
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:11,380
They have been put to sleep by the free six ounce cups

1592
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:14,660
of bush beer available at various locations

1593
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:15,500
throughout the park.

1594
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,260
Should you get free beer there?

1595
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:20,700
That is an occasional promotion that they have done.

1596
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,620
Really? Still?

1597
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:26,900
I think they did bring it back.

1598
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:28,300
Well, at Williamsburg,

1599
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:32,700
I do remember once taking a monorail to a brewery

1600
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,460
from Bush gardens.

1601
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:36,740
Oh, that one is connected to a, I don't know.

1602
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:38,820
Yeah. And I don't know that they still do it.

1603
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:40,220
You could take a little tour

1604
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:42,460
and then there was a tasting at the end.

1605
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:45,580
And I remember thinking the brewery smelled awful.

1606
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:48,140
And then when we went to get on the monorail back,

1607
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:49,060
they're like, sorry folks,

1608
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:50,860
monorails, it's going to be a little while longer

1609
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:53,500
while we get the other car to come.

1610
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:58,220
And so we were like stuck in the cafeteria cafe

1611
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:00,780
at the brewery for like extra time,

1612
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:04,260
like burning off our, like an extra 30 minutes

1613
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:08,100
of your theme park day at a stinky brewery.

1614
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,460
Wow. What a rave review.

1615
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:13,940
Stinky brewery.

1616
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:16,900
Also, I've been to plenty of microbreweries at this point

1617
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,900
and I'm like, they don't stick,

1618
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:22,660
like what the fuck was going on at the Bush brewery?

1619
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,380
Is there a weird smell when you go by there?

1620
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:26,540
What's the one on the-

1621
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:27,460
Golden Road?

1622
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:28,420
No, no, no, the big one.

1623
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:29,940
There's a big plant.

1624
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:30,780
It's not like a brewery.

1625
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:31,620
Oh, there's a Budweiser.

1626
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:33,420
There's a few Budweiser ones in the valley.

1627
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:34,260
Yeah, like in the valley.

1628
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,260
The one on the way to, oh, the valley one.

1629
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:40,180
Cause, oh wait, well there's the one off the 405.

1630
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:41,020
That's probably what I'm thinking of.

1631
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:42,380
Like kind of north in the valley,

1632
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:44,300
which had a theme park connected.

1633
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,540
Bush Gardens, yeah, sure.

1634
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:46,380
Yeah, yeah.

1635
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:49,180
And you can still see the track when you go around,

1636
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:52,220
like where the little people mover cars went around.

1637
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:53,580
This is a total detour,

1638
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:56,460
but is there some sort of theme park proposal for the zoo

1639
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:57,660
that somebody just put up?

1640
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:58,900
Oh, I haven't really looked at that article.

1641
01:01:58,900 --> 01:01:59,780
Yeah, I've heard that.

1642
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:02,780
Yeah, the LA zoo in Burbank.

1643
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:04,460
Not far from all the things we talk about.

1644
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:06,260
Yeah, that's kind of exciting.

1645
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:07,100
I like the zoo.

1646
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,340
There's a vibe there up there.

1647
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:09,380
Don't mess up the vibe.

1648
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:10,220
Right.

1649
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:11,040
Yeah.

1650
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,260
The theme park stuff sounds fun.

1651
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:15,180
I think people might be upset about it, but not us.

1652
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:16,020
Yeah, yeah.

1653
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:17,820
You know where we're at.

1654
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:19,660
The dumber, the better.

1655
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:21,660
Which is I think why we probably all enjoyed

1656
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:24,420
the final scene more than the rest of the movie.

1657
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:25,820
Yeah, I think that's right, yeah.

1658
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:28,880
Because with all of the pirate's booty,

1659
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:32,380
I guess the kids get some probably, I hope.

1660
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:36,940
And then Captain Jack gets to shift his shack.

1661
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:38,480
It's a different kind of shack now.

1662
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,420
It's a swordfish shack.

1663
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:41,820
He opens a restaurant.

1664
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:46,860
So now, yeah, there's this line of butt.

1665
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:48,460
Scrawd, it's really hopping.

1666
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:50,180
I think it's tough to get a table.

1667
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:52,780
I believe it's partly the lighthouse.

1668
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:53,620
Oh, I see.

1669
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:54,460
He built it into the lighthouse.

1670
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:55,300
In the lighthouse, okay.

1671
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,420
Because I think that's the last little bit.

1672
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:58,260
Gotcha, okay, okay.

1673
01:02:58,260 --> 01:02:59,100
When they sit down to eat.

1674
01:02:59,100 --> 01:02:59,920
Yeah.

1675
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:00,940
Oh yeah, that's right, because oh yeah, yeah.

1676
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:04,100
Up on the lighthouse, if you look close,

1677
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,300
it says the word fancy on it.

1678
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:09,060
They've just stamped the word fancy.

1679
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:09,900
That's funny.

1680
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,420
That's how you know there's been a changeover.

1681
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,860
But it's really, yeah, it looks like a fun,

1682
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:14,660
it looks like a real Joe's Crab shack, eh?

1683
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:15,500
Yes.

1684
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:18,900
You know, this shit on the walls,

1685
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,220
and Lloyd's having a good time,

1686
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:24,260
and even the ghosts can't stay away.

1687
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:28,380
They show up, and there's this big full cast dinner,

1688
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:31,340
and you go, oh, they did get a second day

1689
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:33,700
out of Leah Thompson and Michael McKeon.

1690
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:34,780
You're kidding.

1691
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:36,260
Two days of shooting.

1692
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:38,620
Yeah, and there's, he go, and they go,

1693
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,060
Michael McKeon tells Christopher Lighty,

1694
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:41,740
can't eat because, or they can't eat,

1695
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:44,860
because they're ghosts, and it goes right through them,

1696
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:46,260
of course, and then Christopher Lloyd says,

1697
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:50,140
he knows what that is, and then they do a real long shot,

1698
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:53,660
I feel like, of Michael McKeon giving him the eye.

1699
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:55,340
Like, hmm.

1700
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:57,980
He's talking about poop, he's talking about shit.

1701
01:03:57,980 --> 01:03:59,340
Captain Jack's diarrhea.

1702
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,060
Fish-based diarrhea.

1703
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:06,340
He's thinking about Captain Jack's diarrhea, you're right.

1704
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:10,700
That's probably the comedic high point of the movie.

1705
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:13,180
Well, a catfish spits in Christopher Lloyd's face.

1706
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:14,340
That is good too, you're right.

1707
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:18,380
That's weird Al Yankovic with a perplexing stutter,

1708
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:20,700
comes out and delivers.

1709
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,300
It's like Renfield or something.

1710
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:23,900
Yeah, that's a good reference.

1711
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:25,780
Despite being in current times,

1712
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:29,300
and just a waiter at a seafood restaurant.

1713
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:30,180
Yeah. Yeah.

1714
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:34,300
He's playing a kind of a strange monster kind of guy.

1715
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,300
He's like a lackey.

1716
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:37,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1717
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:40,580
So he comes out and you go, is that fucking weird Al?

1718
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:42,260
And it is, yeah, it is.

1719
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:45,780
And you're like, is it enough to save it at the buzzer?

1720
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,060
I don't know.

1721
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:48,660
Depends on how much you like Al.

1722
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:51,180
You go, oh, okay, that's good Al.

1723
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:52,420
Yeah, and I checked, I think I did check.

1724
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:54,460
I go, oh, is there gonna be more scenes here with Al?

1725
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:55,860
No, it's over.

1726
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:58,180
He brings in a pot of catfish surprise.

1727
01:04:58,180 --> 01:04:59,300
What's the surprise?

1728
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:01,940
Take off the lid of catfish spits in Christopher Lloyd's face.

1729
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:02,780
That's pretty good.

1730
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:03,620
It's pretty good.

1731
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:05,300
It's like a hearty vomit too.

1732
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:09,260
And if you imagine getting just one more nice copious spray

1733
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:11,540
before you head out into that humidity.

1734
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:14,100
And then there's a, soon after this,

1735
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,140
there's a really funny song that plays.

1736
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:17,900
It is, I wrote it down.

1737
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,300
It's worth playing the song.

1738
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:23,340
I described it, this is what the ghost kid Edgar is doing,

1739
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:24,900
like a really intense dance to.

1740
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:27,100
I described it as the most public domain song

1741
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:27,940
I've ever heard.

1742
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:32,100
I shazammed it, like not expecting any results

1743
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:33,180
and nor did I get any.

1744
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:34,020
Okay.

1745
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:36,020
Yeah, I tried to find it.

1746
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:39,100
It's just like, it's like 20 seconds long too, right?

1747
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:41,180
Yeah, it is perfectly.

1748
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:45,700
It's like the kind of music that ends lifetime movies.

1749
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:50,500
You know, like what can we do that has lyrics

1750
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:53,580
so it seems like a real song, but is generic enough

1751
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:55,900
that clearly we paid nothing.

1752
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:59,620
Here, wait, all right, they're all laughing at this.

1753
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:01,500
["Can't Touch Me"]

1754
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,860
It's invisible but I can't see it.

1755
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:06,460
Can't touch me but I can feel it.

1756
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:08,100
And it's scary but I can't do it

1757
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:11,260
because life is impossible without it.

1758
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:13,780
Life is impossible without it.

1759
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:15,620
And the boat is dancing, you alluded to that earlier.

1760
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:17,020
And the boat is dancing.

1761
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:19,340
Life is impossible without it.

1762
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:23,180
Life is impossible without it.

1763
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:24,940
Yeah, I don't, who is that?

1764
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:27,060
What is that?

1765
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:31,540
Did they write it for, were they inspired by a sequence

1766
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:36,220
with a diarrhea joke told to a ghost

1767
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:40,420
and then a catfish spitting in a man's face?

1768
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:42,060
Yeah, what is that?

1769
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:45,900
Life is impossible without it and it is 3D effects.

1770
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:49,100
3D is 3D fun, that's what life is all about.

1771
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,900
I'd be tempted to agree.

1772
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:55,820
It lights up my life and it's been fun to think about here

1773
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:59,420
even though this film is in, well, let me read a review.

1774
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:01,060
This was on IMDB.

1775
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:03,700
This is a terrible film.

1776
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:06,420
Joe Dante should be ashamed of himself.

1777
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:09,260
The lighting is awful and the acting is bad.

1778
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:13,980
Now I don't know that I would desire to be that mean

1779
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:14,820
to the movie.

1780
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:18,420
I think it's been perfectly pleasant to talk about it.

1781
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:22,460
But I just think it was not, did not deliver.

1782
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:25,740
You are picturing with these actors and with like,

1783
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:28,060
wait, we're forgetting, there's a much better reunion

1784
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:31,300
with the clue, we got two clue people.

1785
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:32,460
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1786
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:36,500
That's great, you can't add for like, people, great,

1787
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:41,420
80s, 90s filmmakers and actors and then you get this,

1788
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:43,260
which is just kind of tepid.

1789
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:46,540
Yeah, I mean, watch the first and last scene.

1790
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:47,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think so.

1791
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:51,500
I think you could do a 30 second cut of this

1792
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,380
that's pretty solid.

1793
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:56,740
Topher Grace is working on a 30 second cut of this,

1794
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:58,420
like the way he cut all the prequels together.

1795
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:01,700
He's cutting just the first and last scene together

1796
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:02,740
to make this better.

1797
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:03,740
Topher Grace?

1798
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:04,780
Yeah, wasn't it him?

1799
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:07,100
Topher Grace did a cut, really?

1800
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:08,340
I'm pretty sure.

1801
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:12,940
Okay, no, that's fine, good for him, that's fun.

1802
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:14,940
If you want more Haunted Lighthouse in your life,

1803
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:19,500
head to eBay where you can buy this hat of the logo

1804
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,820
and even the hat is a little lackluster.

1805
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:23,660
Yeah.

1806
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:28,420
There's two of them online for sale, $20, $25, buy it now.

1807
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:30,500
Appears to be the only options.

1808
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:32,620
Too much for my blood, too rich for my blood.

1809
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:33,460
Yeah, for a bit.

1810
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:35,180
Yeah, Topher Grace, I'm correct,

1811
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:38,180
edited an 85 minute cut of the Star Wars prequels.

1812
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:39,020
Okay.

1813
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:39,860
Wow.

1814
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:40,940
Where do you see that?

1815
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:41,780
That is how it is.

1816
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:42,620
I don't know if that's, yeah,

1817
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:44,140
maybe that's not commercially available.

1818
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:47,820
That's like Soderbergh cutting a black and white Raiders.

1819
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:48,660
The Lost Ark.

1820
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:49,500
Yes.

1821
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,340
Yeah.

1822
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:51,300
So. Just as cool.

1823
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:52,140
Just as cool.

1824
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:54,460
I think, I don't know, well, I don't know.

1825
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:56,220
Maybe I'll try to do a 30 second cut

1826
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:57,700
or I'll forget or get busy.

1827
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:58,540
Yeah, okay.

1828
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:01,260
Either way, the things remain the same

1829
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:02,820
in the world ultimately.

1830
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:07,860
But as far as, so that's this movie,

1831
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:12,020
but in the realm of Cimex Iwerks.

1832
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:15,820
Some Cimex Iwerks, yes.

1833
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:17,500
So they have a lot of stuff they do.

1834
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,340
If you go on their website, they show like,

1835
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:20,340
they show some cool stuff.

1836
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:22,460
Like they do, they have like a thing you could do

1837
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:24,620
in a museum or an exhibit where you can build

1838
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:26,780
like part of a boat and they projection map,

1839
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:28,780
like the sea around the boat.

1840
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:30,540
Did you see the picture of this on the website?

1841
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:31,380
No.

1842
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:32,220
Which sounds like, seems like pretty cool.

1843
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:34,340
Like you could do that with like historical things.

1844
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:36,100
They could probably use it at the Ark encounter.

1845
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:36,940
Let's be honest.

1846
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:37,780
Mm-hmm.

1847
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:39,100
If you want to scare the kids

1848
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:41,060
into knowing what it's really like.

1849
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:45,620
They have a recent thing they've done is Thomas and Friends

1850
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:50,620
4D Bubbling Boilers, a 4D Thomas the Tank experience.

1851
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:51,700
Okay.

1852
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:53,780
Which you can see some of on YouTube and that's fun.

1853
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:56,500
But they have a lot, there's so many films

1854
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:59,140
as you saw scrolling through.

1855
01:09:59,140 --> 01:09:59,980
Yeah.

1856
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:02,660
Some, yeah, some are just like 4D experiences for movies.

1857
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:04,540
Some are original things.

1858
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:07,100
Like there's something called Mars Coaster,

1859
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:10,740
which is the most generic Martian characters.

1860
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:12,940
And then it's just, you know,

1861
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:16,300
it's just the end of the Simpsons ride in a simulator.

1862
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:17,660
Are you looking at Mars Coaster?

1863
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:18,900
I shall, I will, yeah.

1864
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:20,420
Yeah.

1865
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:22,180
And there's something called Craig T. Nelson

1866
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:24,820
presents Super Speedway the Ride.

1867
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:25,660
Whoa.

1868
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:27,420
I tried to find a video.

1869
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:28,540
I didn't try that hard on that one.

1870
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:29,500
So that might be out there,

1871
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,420
but that's like Craig T. Nelson

1872
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:34,980
intro-ing sort of a 3D like racing movie.

1873
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:37,140
This is, I like this world in general

1874
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:40,820
because I think by now, you know, we've educated our audience.

1875
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:43,300
Some of this audience has been with us for a long time.

1876
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:45,420
And you know, we know Disney, we know Universal,

1877
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:47,940
we've covered it, but like, this is what I'm interested in.

1878
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:49,940
We got to talk Sally Dark Rides,

1879
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:50,780
Yes.

1880
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:53,260
And Cimex Iwerks, the companies that are making

1881
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:56,420
weird, obscure, not as corporate,

1882
01:10:57,580 --> 01:11:00,740
not seen, not liked entertainment.

1883
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:02,700
No one has an opinion about these things.

1884
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:05,220
We'd be the first ever covered.

1885
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:06,300
Hundreds of thousands of people

1886
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,300
have seen them, experienced them.

1887
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:10,780
And there's, yeah, there's a lot there.

1888
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,700
Yeah, we will do more on all of this

1889
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:14,660
so I won't list all of them,

1890
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:18,300
but there's one that caught my eye down the list.

1891
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:21,700
And you cannot watch a preview of it,

1892
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:25,580
but there was a poster and a name and I got very excited

1893
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:27,940
and I was correct with my assumption.

1894
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:31,020
The name of this is Dragatar 3D.

1895
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:36,020
Dragatar, D-R-A-G-A-T-A-R 3D.

1896
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:42,980
When I said, okay, is Dragatar a takeoff of Avatar?

1897
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:45,620
Well, the first sentence,

1898
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:48,540
visit the mythical planet of Andorra.

1899
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:49,660
What?

1900
01:11:52,420 --> 01:11:54,900
And jump onto the back of a native dragon

1901
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:56,700
as they soar through steep canyons

1902
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:59,300
in their search for the crystal sphere.

1903
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:04,420
Avoid huge dragon eating plants, zoom through ancient tunnels

1904
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,500
and discover a hidden volcanic valley

1905
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:10,020
filled with boiling lava and a nest of ghostly snakes.

1906
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:12,860
Feel the freedom of flying through clouds and waterfalls

1907
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:15,140
as you battle the evil Dragatar.

1908
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:18,140
Oh, now I like that.

1909
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:20,660
Dragatar's the bad guy.

1910
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:23,620
You're going to be an Avatar

1911
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:24,980
and you're gonna fly in this and this one.

1912
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:27,900
No, Dragatar is your enemy, kill him.

1913
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,820
Yeah, so you're on a native dragon

1914
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:32,860
and Dragatar is the bad guy you have to defeat.

1915
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:34,180
And it says, will you defeat him?

1916
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:35,780
Strap in, come along and find out

1917
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:38,380
on this Drag-a-ful adventure.

1918
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:42,580
I guess wonderful is what they're like.

1919
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:43,420
Drag-a-ful.

1920
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:44,260
Drag-a-ful.

1921
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:45,340
Whoa.

1922
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,140
Dragatar.

1923
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:50,020
Avatar is not Dragatar.

1924
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:52,060
You hate Dragatar.

1925
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:53,260
Kill Dragatar.

1926
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:54,580
Kill Dragatar.

1927
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:55,620
Strap it in the throat.

1928
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:59,700
And Dragatar is not like a fun drag show Avatar thing.

1929
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:02,180
That was the only other thing I think it could have been.

1930
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:03,020
Yeah, yeah.

1931
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:04,860
It was a good idea but for something else.

1932
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:08,820
Right, so Dragatar 3D, there's no video preview.

1933
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:12,740
Now a lot of these things have previews

1934
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:14,100
or you can find the whole video

1935
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:17,340
and the graphics on them look like Sega Dreamcast.

1936
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,820
And it looks maybe like we're dealing with

1937
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:24,820
like PlayStation 3 level graphics on it.

1938
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:26,900
If you look up Dragatar 3D,

1939
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:29,100
you'll be able to see the page and go right to it.

1940
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:32,260
Well, I did and you're right that there isn't a video

1941
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:35,300
except there is a really brief video

1942
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:37,460
with no footage from this attraction.

1943
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:39,900
All it says is, Cymax Iwerks Entertainment,

1944
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:42,180
please contact us for a preview.

1945
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:43,580
Well, right, so.

1946
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:46,500
Exactly, we have to do, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1947
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:51,540
Yeah, we're doing it.

1948
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:53,380
I think this is one email we would be sending.

1949
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:54,940
To whom it may concern.

1950
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:56,740
And like you have, like they have the little like

1951
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:58,100
contact us thing on the bottom right,

1952
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:01,140
that little red icon right here is for contacting.

1953
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:02,100
Oh, jeez.

1954
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:03,220
So we need to get.

1955
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:04,380
We gotta do it.

1956
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:06,900
Yeah, we're gonna have to,

1957
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,980
we're gonna have to find out more about Dragatar

1958
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:11,380
because I don't even know where Dragatar is being shown.

1959
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:12,540
Maybe nowhere.

1960
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:14,020
There's like no results for it.

1961
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:15,780
Right.

1962
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:16,620
Really besides this.

1963
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:17,540
This must be, this might be fresh IP.

1964
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:19,180
Dragatar might be fresh IP.

1965
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:21,380
That we could use.

1966
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:26,380
Could we add a live show that we're dying to do

1967
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:29,740
and are hopefully gonna be doing soon and later.

1968
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:35,740
Like we premiere a real attraction that we didn't make.

1969
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:37,540
Yeah.

1970
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:41,700
We license and lose far beyond what we would have made

1971
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:43,020
to do the show.

1972
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:45,140
We're way in the, we're like,

1973
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:48,660
we have lost thousands of dollars for this.

1974
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:49,700
I'm sorry to tell you Jason.

1975
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:51,580
Let's do that when we're in town.

1976
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:54,100
Let's not make that one of the travel ones.

1977
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:56,900
Well, it depends on where there's Dragatar hunger out there.

1978
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,420
Yeah, it depends.

1979
01:14:58,420 --> 01:14:59,580
Be loud.

1980
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:01,460
Make your city the loudest.

1981
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:04,340
And we'll bring Dragatar 3D to you.

1982
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:05,180
Oh no.

1983
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:06,020
Dragatar.

1984
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:07,860
You know, I think.

1985
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:10,180
So losing thousands to go to Singapore

1986
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:12,140
because of the Dragatar fans.

1987
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:15,540
Jason, when you see the world of Andorra,

1988
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,860
you're going to understand that this is worth it.

1989
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:19,580
You know, some of the 3D stuff

1990
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:21,620
and not even 3D theme parks,

1991
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:24,420
because I understand parks have varying budgets

1992
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:27,300
and I think it's cool when any park like commits

1993
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:28,620
to like a 3D attraction.

1994
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:31,260
But even some of the 3D movies

1995
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:34,220
and especially the stuff you find on free streaming services

1996
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:36,820
always reminds me of that Tim and Eric bit with 80 miles

1997
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:38,340
and the character Grum.

1998
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:39,860
Do you remember Grum?

1999
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:41,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2000
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:44,980
Like a very unpleasant looking CG character.

2001
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:47,940
It's what should be great.

2002
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:50,340
They should partner with Tim and Eric

2003
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:51,660
and do a Grum ride too.

2004
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:55,260
But mainly, oh my God.

2005
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:58,820
I mean, the unfortunate thing about it

2006
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:02,260
is that like if we were to,

2007
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:06,420
like everybody would just have to like kind of, you know,

2008
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:10,780
like sway from side to side and duck and make it a,

2009
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:12,940
this is a ride.

2010
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:14,420
Right.

2011
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:16,660
Well, we could do, we would show Draguitar a couple times

2012
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:18,140
so everyone would get familiar with it

2013
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:21,180
so they know when to go left and when to go right.

2014
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:22,020
Yeah, yeah.

2015
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:24,140
Well, we'll give the audience a chance of like,

2016
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:25,260
hey, there's no line.

2017
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:26,820
Do you want to go on again?

2018
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:29,140
And they do it right afterwards.

2019
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:31,540
But of course everyone, you'll be checking your phones

2020
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:33,620
in little sealed bags for this.

2021
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:35,940
We don't want people bootlegging Draguitar.

2022
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:38,460
Oh yeah, well yeah, it's not online right now.

2023
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:41,460
We don't want to ruin this company's business,

2024
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:45,140
but also in case there's anything a little not too PC

2025
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:47,100
in Draguitar 3D.

2026
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:50,660
We don't want you going and canceling Cymax Iwerks

2027
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:52,780
or us on Twitter right away.

2028
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:53,780
Or Draguitar himself.

2029
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:55,220
Or Draguitar.

2030
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:57,140
Kill Draguitar, but don't cancel him.

2031
01:16:57,140 --> 01:16:57,980
Don't care.

2032
01:16:57,980 --> 01:17:02,180
And or your three modern day philosophers up on stage

2033
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:04,380
guiding you through the world of Andorra.

2034
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:05,220
That's us.

2035
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:07,740
Well, we're truth tellers.

2036
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:09,340
We're truth tellers.

2037
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:10,180
That's true.

2038
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:13,380
Oh man.

2039
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:15,500
We've always tried to be, you know,

2040
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:19,940
the theme park worlds, Lenny Bruce and Bill Hicks.

2041
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:20,860
Oh yeah, yeah.

2042
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:23,420
We've always thought the way we're so honest with our.

2043
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:24,260
Plato.

2044
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:25,580
Opinions about rocks.

2045
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:27,380
Cut through the bullshit.

2046
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:29,780
Is what I always wanted to do with this podcast.

2047
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:30,860
Yeah.

2048
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:32,540
I always say like, oh, I wanted to go to like

2049
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:33,380
free press events.

2050
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:36,860
No, I wanted to cut through the bullshit.

2051
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:38,340
That's what this was about.

2052
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:41,700
I think Dennis Leary also in our spirit

2053
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:44,380
would also make his real opinion known

2054
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:47,740
about the fish head effect that is lackluster.

2055
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:48,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2056
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:49,420
Same thing.

2057
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:51,300
Haunted lighthouse 4D.

2058
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,660
Same exact thing for sure.

2059
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:54,700
We're telling you the truth and the truth is

2060
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:58,820
Draguitar 3D exclusive debut.

2061
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:00,420
That is the best.

2062
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:01,460
We're really good.

2063
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:05,060
We have a real theme park ride.

2064
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:05,900
We could.

2065
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:07,980
Will only be seen in this show.

2066
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:11,180
Even just a sizzle, a proof of concept, something.

2067
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:12,900
You know, we should really say this off mic,

2068
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:14,940
but what we could probably do is get a link to it

2069
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,300
and then like at least just take an iPhone video off

2070
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:18,740
our phone and play it.

2071
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:19,580
Yeah.

2072
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:20,420
Live show.

2073
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:24,260
Yeah, do you have airplay in the booth?

2074
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:25,300
Can I airplay?

2075
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:26,460
Yeah, yeah.

2076
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:27,860
We should have checked this attack.

2077
01:18:27,860 --> 01:18:28,700
Sorry folks.

2078
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:30,100
Who like Draguitar?

2079
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:33,420
Hey, you want to see Draguitar?

2080
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:35,100
Or Draguitar might be on Pirates Bay.

2081
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:36,700
Who knows on the Torrent sites?

2082
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:41,900
Going to the dark web, booting up tour to find

2083
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:43,220
who like Draguitar.

2084
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:45,140
To find Draguitar, yeah.

2085
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:47,500
All right, well Mike and I will go to the Pirates Bay

2086
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:48,740
and try to find it.

2087
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:53,020
Jason, wait here and send a beacon if you need anything.

2088
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:54,940
Hopefully we'll be back and we won't get lost

2089
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:56,460
in the Pirates Bay forever.

2090
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:57,620
Yeah, don't worry, Jason.

2091
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:58,900
We're gonna come back.

2092
01:18:58,900 --> 01:18:59,900
Don't worry.

2093
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:02,500
Well, I have lost now.

2094
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:06,180
Do you think the Pirates Bay is a real nautical destination?

2095
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:07,020
Yeah, we're gonna go there.

2096
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:09,580
Are you going in the hacker's version of the internet

2097
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:12,020
where you're zooming through digital skyscrapers?

2098
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:13,220
It's like Reboot or something.

2099
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:14,060
Yeah.

2100
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:16,420
Mixed with a little nautical too.

2101
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:17,420
Cyber pirates.

2102
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:18,260
Yeah.

2103
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:20,500
Yeah, and we'll be talking to ourself

2104
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,900
with our special guest, Johnny Mnemonic himself.

2105
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:27,100
Not Keanu, the real Johnny Mnemonic.

2106
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:28,420
Well, you know who Johnny Mnemonic is.

2107
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:30,140
You survived, punk ass, that's right.

2108
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:32,780
You know who knows the internet better than anyone?

2109
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:34,180
Sebastian Jackle.

2110
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:37,220
That's for sure.

2111
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:40,140
This is a cyber show, Deadly Games.

2112
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:41,660
It's also maybe a good in,

2113
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:44,180
like how many things has Christopher Lloyd asked

2114
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:46,460
to play Doc Brown in?

2115
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:48,180
And how many times does he say yes?

2116
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:49,020
Always.

2117
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:49,860
Every time.

2118
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:50,700
The answer's every time.

2119
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:51,860
So why am I even bringing this up?

2120
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:55,420
Well, maybe he would really get a kick out of,

2121
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:57,900
we have him on the podcast in character

2122
01:19:57,900 --> 01:19:59,220
as Sebastian Jackle.

2123
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:02,100
Yeah, I think that's a great idea.

2124
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:04,700
Our guest today is a hacker who's been known

2125
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:07,300
to get involved in some Deadly Games.

2126
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:11,460
Oh yes, I'm here.

2127
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:14,140
He's here to talk about story book land canal boats.

2128
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:16,300
Please welcome Sebastian Jackle.

2129
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:19,060
We had a takedown notice from Dick Clark Productions

2130
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:21,820
or whatever unexpected TV production company

2131
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:22,820
grinded those out.

2132
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:24,140
Byron Allen's company.

2133
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:28,860
Ah, damn, why didn't we look this up?

2134
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,620
Byron Allen bought the rights to Deadly Games

2135
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:33,620
10 years ago in a big package.

2136
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:36,940
There was that profile of him a couple of years ago.

2137
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:39,820
He's low key one of the richest people in Malibu.

2138
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:40,660
Yeah, he's the smartest in the world.

2139
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:41,500
Yes.

2140
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,100
He's one of the smartest show business,

2141
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:43,940
he's like-

2142
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:44,780
He's in Deadline every day.

2143
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:46,300
He's in Deadline today.

2144
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:47,140
Oh, was he?

2145
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:47,960
Yes, always.

2146
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:49,860
They post every article about every,

2147
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:53,140
if he goes and gets breakfast, Deadline hears about it.

2148
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:54,380
We should get him on the show.

2149
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:55,420
I'd love to have Byron.

2150
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:57,460
All right, so guest dream list,

2151
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:59,900
or just priorities, Byron Allen on the show,

2152
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:02,300
Sebastian Jackal in character unless he's known

2153
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:06,220
by Byron Allen, Johnny Mnemonic,

2154
01:21:06,220 --> 01:21:11,220
and live debut of PTR licensed Draguitar 3D.

2155
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:15,060
Draguitar 3D.

2156
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:18,620
Okay, well, you survived Haunt Cast the Fright,

2157
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:21,740
The Cemetery Gate, Haunted Light Us 4D edition,

2158
01:21:21,740 --> 01:21:25,860
but the rest of the adventures clearly are just beginning.

2159
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:29,660
And what was that song again?

2160
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:32,860
You can't live, because you can't live without it.

2161
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:36,020
You know, you can't live without it.

2162
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:36,860
Is that it?

2163
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:37,680
I think so.

2164
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:38,520
Oh yeah, that's it.

2165
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:41,220
Yeah, Mike, start working on the orchestration for your-

2166
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:44,860
For the parody version of it, or the homage version.

2167
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:47,900
Yeah, just a cover, just a cover, yeah.

2168
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:48,740
Yeah, all right.

2169
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:50,100
Okay, well, thanks for listening,

2170
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:52,220
and I'm so sorry, Debbie Allen.
