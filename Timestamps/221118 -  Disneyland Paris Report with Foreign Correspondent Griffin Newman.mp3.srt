1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Attention.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:12,080
Please remove your glasses for a podcast that may include Avengers who are too busy to be

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:19,600
in your ride, scalding hot brands shaped like friendly cars, and a nearly episode derailing

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,740
relitigation of something that itself was an episode derailing relitigation.

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,500
It's an exclusive Disneyland Paris report from foreign correspondent Griffin Newman on

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:54,300
Podcast the Ride.

9
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:01,740
Ride where we're a little worried that we might get radiation poisoning from our guest

10
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,020
because he's just returned from a cultural Chernobyl.

11
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:10,740
I don't know what that gasp meant.

12
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,540
Admiring a long walk maybe.

13
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,020
It's a short walk.

14
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,020
I just didn't know where it was.

15
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,100
It's like you stepped out your front door and I didn't know if there was any ground beneath

16
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,100
you.

17
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,740
The first half is that I accuse you of having a problem of being up, halting out or something.

18
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,500
No, of course we're starting off very broad and accessible.

19
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,820
I'm talking about the late 80s reaction to the announcement of Disneyland Paris, which

20
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,620
presumably we will talk about to some extent.

21
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,620
I'm Scott Gardner.

22
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,340
Mike Carlson's a host of the show.

23
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,620
I am a host of the show.

24
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,620
I'm here.

25
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,700
Yeah, the cultural Chernobyl.

26
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:55,300
I wonder, yeah, did it turn anyone into an Incredible Hulk type character superhero when

27
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,380
Disneyland Paris opened?

28
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,100
I don't know the answer to it.

29
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,620
Certain critics maybe raged out to a Hulk level.

30
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,620
Exactly.

31
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,620
Jason Sheridan.

32
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:09,680
I had to, yeah, I had to take a second, partially because I was not 100% sure you were referring

33
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:16,420
to some of the reactions of Disneyland Paris and also I think I've just gotten so numb

34
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:22,160
to those old news articles or essays where it's just like a city walk, a walled city

35
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:30,580
on a hill whereby upon the others gaze on the hoy, hoy, polloy, you know.

36
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,780
Is there a French Hulk?

37
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,580
Was there ever a French Hulk in the comics?

38
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,580
Was there a French Hulk?

39
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,740
Yeah, was there a Hulk character that was French?

40
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,700
I feel like that's one of the things they haven't done is sort of like the international

41
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,700
league of Hulks.

42
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,180
No, yeah, this good boy in a beret wearing Hulk.

43
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,580
Yeah, it feels like the character that would be most fun to see the specific cultural parallels.

44
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,660
I agree, I agree.

45
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:59,620
And when I say that I mean like a cartoonish picture of a French person from 1960.

46
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,820
He speaks so guttural though, like to turn it.

47
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,500
Right, yeah, there you go.

48
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,420
I guess it works perfect is what we figured out.

49
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,400
Our guest today, we're excited he's here.

50
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:23,580
He has assured us that we are his only podcast appearance during his current promotional

51
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,580
tour.

52
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,580
One, and done.

53
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,540
We're honored by that.

54
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,700
There's a bunch of credits and accolades that we could give you, but there's one that is

55
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,620
the most important right now, which is that he is the voice of a talking chipmunk in a

56
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,060
Disney movie.

57
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,780
Please welcome the voice of Pip in the upcoming, I think out today, I think when we're putting

58
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,780
this out.

59
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,780
Oh wow.

60
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,780
I believe so.

61
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,780
November 18th?

62
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,780
I think so.

63
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,780
Also Mickey Mouse's birthday.

64
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,780
You're in a Disney movie.

65
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,780
Oh, I didn't even know that.

66
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,700
On the Mickey Mouse's birthday?

67
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,420
Yeah, this is, hey, I don't think they don't do accidents over there.

68
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,140
I think they're setting up a new Mickey Mouse.

69
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:10,940
His name is Pip and his voice's name is accidental PTR legend Griffin Newman.

70
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,940
Thank you for that introduction.

71
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:18,060
It does, it does feel like now I, I, there's no other way to interpret it as anything but

72
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,700
the Walt Disney corporation, Walt Disney studios saying the best gift we could give to Walt

73
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:30,180
for his birthday is disenchanted, a Disney plus original for families of all ages.

74
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,620
The best gift you could give to Walt for Mickey's birthday.

75
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,620
Correct.

76
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,100
Yes.

77
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,100
Which makes sense.

78
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,100
I mean.

79
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,100
And the best gift you could give Mickey as well.

80
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,100
Yeah, yeah.

81
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,100
A new friend.

82
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,100
I think Mickey will love it.

83
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,860
I really, I've been saying this a lot to everyone working on the movie.

84
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,060
I'm like, I think Mickey's going to really like this.

85
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,060
Oh, Amy, Patrick, Griffin, here's the baton.

86
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:57,700
Must have been difficult with scheduling because they were filming Sonic at the same time.

87
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,700
My copyright's running out.

88
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,700
You're going to have to do this from now on because I'm out of here.

89
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,700
Time is on the essence.

90
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,780
Time's on the essence.

91
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,540
Let's just say, because you guys, I told you almost immediately when I got this job.

92
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,380
Obviously I was like, relevant information.

93
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,540
Will you guys believe?

94
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,540
Great news to drop.

95
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,540
That was very exciting.

96
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,740
I'll probably get into the story a little bit.

97
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,820
But the process of getting the part was a little bit odd and surprising and sudden and

98
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,180
was kind of unexpected.

99
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,380
But I was looking through old text.

100
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,100
I got the part May 2021.

101
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,460
I've been working on this for like over 18 months.

102
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,860
And we've done multiple episodes in that time.

103
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,660
And this is the first time I can acknowledge it.

104
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,660
Oh, jeez.

105
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,660
Yeah, yeah.

106
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,140
You know, we've been sitting on this information.

107
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,660
Yeah, we all know.

108
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,540
Yes, you're coming and hanging out with us, people who talk about Disney all the time.

109
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,700
The first accidental PTR legend to end up.

110
00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:00,060
Well in contention to be a, this is the beginning of the journey of being a purposeful Disney

111
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,060
legend.

112
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,020
I'm not sure if I've ever seen any Disney movies.

113
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,020
I was.

114
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,660
I'm worried that I'm going to watch the next time I watch one that I suddenly get some

115
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,660
weird flash.

116
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,620
Randy Runyon could be in a Disney movie and we don't know yet because we haven't seen

117
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,420
we haven't maybe no one else is going to make it.

118
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,620
I'm just saying we don't know of anyone else who has made that leap yet.

119
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,620
Yeah, that's true.

120
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,620
To Disney.

121
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,620
Is Randy Runyon who played Choco?

122
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,620
Yeah.

123
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,620
OK.

124
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,620
Choco hasn't come up a ton lately.

125
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,180
I'm really I'm resting him for what I have planned.

126
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,180
I want it to be a good long time before he comes up.

127
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,180
So I'm going to edit this out, at least for the audience.

128
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,180
Now it's another 18 minutes before you can pay off this bit.

129
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,180
Yeah, I'm going to have to push it back 18 more months.

130
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,180
Yeah, 18 more.

131
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,180
He's got to find a suitable clock tower for what he's got planned.

132
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,180
High enough, enough cover.

133
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:56,180
You don't want one side of it to face just like a field or a brick wall.

134
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,180
You got to be 360.

135
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:03,140
Choco mailbox inside so he can get his word out before the coming.

136
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,140
Oh, that's a disturbingly too good of serial killer thinking.

137
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,140
I feel the shooter thinking sniper thinking.

138
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,340
There's just not enough post office boxes now.

139
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,780
There's not a mailbox.

140
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,300
It's harder than ever to go postal.

141
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,300
This is a good point.

142
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,700
Yeah, look, everyone is saying art, the clown, this art, the clown, that

143
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,700
they should be saying Choco this and they are.

144
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,220
Wait, what are they saying?

145
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,220
Art, the clown.

146
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,220
He makes people barf and poop and they're so scared.

147
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,220
I have no idea what you're talking about.

148
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,220
We talked about this on an episode.

149
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,220
I just heard you talk about this on an episode yesterday.

150
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,220
I know it was reported longer ago, but I was yesterday listening to you go.

151
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,220
It's terrifying.

152
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,220
So I did it then and I'm doing it now.

153
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,220
OK, OK.

154
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,220
I truly don't.

155
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,220
There's certain things.

156
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:54,220
There's the things that come up on the show where even where you're

157
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,620
Michael say, you don't remember this.

158
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,900
And it's because I'm it's being live erased as it's be as I'm learning it.

159
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,420
You got to clear up like disk space.

160
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,300
It's fast. Yeah, that is what it's like.

161
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:10,300
I think we've all proven we have a lot of goddamn names in our heads at all time.

162
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:15,260
If this podcast does anything, it is drop odd names of people from all eras,

163
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,260
except like history or anything that matters.

164
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,260
Important. Oh, yeah.

165
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,940
Pop culture, Arcania.

166
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,620
But what is what?

167
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,020
Why did it come out recently?

168
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,740
Recently, it was like two weeks ago or less.

169
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,580
We hear a movie called Terrified.

170
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,180
The Hotbox Ghost episode.

171
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,140
Yes. Yeah, it just came out.

172
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,060
Terrifier to yesterday.

173
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,220
Terrifier to you. It's so fresh.

174
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,100
People are puking and passing out because it's so gross.

175
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,340
Oh, I remember that.

176
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,580
Yeah, it's part of the clown is the evil clown.

177
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,060
I don't know that we named Art the Clown.

178
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,940
No. OK, maybe.

179
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,860
There we go, because I remember hearing about.

180
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,860
Well, isn't this another one of these?

181
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,780
This is a situation much like another situation that happened recently,

182
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,660
involved where you remembered it one way.

183
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,060
But then but maybe somebody was not there speaking that we cross talk here

184
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,220
was confusing as far as this was more obscured.

185
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,300
What you're speaking about is a clear misjudgment on my part.

186
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,860
I think this is acknowledged.

187
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,860
Yes, is is a little bit more obscured as far as what had happened.

188
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,780
We got to check the tape.

189
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,220
I don't I'm not confident that I've heard the name Art the Clown.

190
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,260
I think I think you may be right.

191
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,580
OK, I think Jason, thank you for catching it.

192
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,820
I think for being apologetic ever.

193
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,180
And thank you for being an arbiter here.

194
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,660
Mike has an excuse of getting like three hours of sleep at night.

195
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:39,780
I just am really still enmeshed in absorbing guys names.

196
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,860
And what's happening instead of pushing out actual memories,

197
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,860
the guys are pushing out the previous guys.

198
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,180
So every now and then a running joke will come out

199
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:53,100
and I'll go like, yeah, you know, there's an amount of space on the hard drive.

200
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,900
Yeah. And if you're adding new things, you got to delete some old files.

201
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,780
Now, I was I do feel I had some memory.

202
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,460
Yeah, you do have to buy an external hard drive.

203
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,940
How do you do that in your brain?

204
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,300
Well, I'm always working on my brain because I have all those alerts

205
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,380
and notifications, so I'm actually continually.

206
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,980
So that's the expanding.

207
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,820
Yeah, it's like that surgery you get when you're short

208
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,140
that keeps extending your legs.

209
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,220
I found out Rivers Cuomo had 20 years ago.

210
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,460
No, he did. He did.

211
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,740
And he said it didn't work and they had to do a different version of it.

212
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,540
He was like, oh, this is coming up.

213
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,540
It was like a podcast.

214
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,540
This is what I was going to say.

215
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,540
I do feel like and this is once again in Scott's defense.

216
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,340
I'm not going to take Scott's defense on everything.

217
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,140
Oh, there's a lot of things that need to be done in this episode today.

218
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,660
You might look at this title and go, that seems vague in general.

219
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,740
There's a reason why it's because there's so many different things to hit.

220
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,540
We did not want to talk about it.

221
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,740
There was an idea of a more specific episode and we threw it out

222
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,540
because there's so much odd business.

223
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,940
There's a lot of we will talk about your trip to Disneyland Paris.

224
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,940
Let's be clear about that.

225
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,340
Correspondence. Yes. A new title.

226
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,340
Another on top of that, your PIP and you're the legend.

227
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,740
We also have to service the premise that you're the foreign correspondent.

228
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,140
Right. And Mike said, is this or maybe you said, is this competing

229
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,340
with Jason's status as Cub reporter?

230
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,140
I said I would never touch that.

231
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,940
I didn't feel threatened. I would never touch that.

232
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,340
I would never touch that.

233
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,340
Cub reporter, one of my favorite sort of ongoing threads in PTR lore.

234
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,140
I'm asking for a different space far away from Cub reporter.

235
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,540
Yeah, very literally far away.

236
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,140
You went to another. Physically, I will not report on anything

237
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,340
within the continental United States. Wow. Great.

238
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,540
I will say that. OK. That's not my job here.

239
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,540
OK, OK. Geez. Well, but it leaves him to do it. Get reporting.

240
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,140
Yeah. I hit the pressure.

241
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,340
I do feel like the number of guys

242
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:47,340
has been multiplying exponentially recently.

243
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,740
I think guys are multiplying at an astonishing rate.

244
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,540
And I think Scott has been feeling this frustration of I'm being treated

245
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,340
like I should know these guys. Who are these?

246
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,540
I don't remember these guys.

247
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,740
And it's like it feels like every episode we're adding five or ten new guys.

248
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,940
Now, this having been said, I texted you guys and I said,

249
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,740
I just listened to the Frank Marshall gate episode on the second gate.

250
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,740
What was the false?

251
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,340
Your dot com podcast.

252
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,340
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

253
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,140
Now we'll have to do we have some backstory explaining to do.

254
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,940
Yes, the episode is called False Starts.

255
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,140
Frank Marshall gate. Right.

256
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,140
And I listen to this episode and I say to you guys,

257
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,340
I think this is the best episode you've ever done.

258
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,740
I think this is the best piece of PTR content that has ever been released.

259
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,540
And I want to relitigate it on the show.

260
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,940
There's still more on the main feed for the first time because this is

261
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,940
entirely a second.

262
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,540
This is the whole point.

263
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,340
Scott, you're like, maybe we do a bonus and we do is we do two records back to back

264
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,140
and we do a little Frank Marshall gate follow up because that whole narrative

265
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,940
has been entirely behind the paywall.

266
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:58,940
Yeah, I have come here today trying to force Frank Marshall gate onto main feed.

267
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,140
There is a reason I refuse to spin this off into another episode.

268
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,540
I think right now this thread has been reserved for the elites.

269
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:12,140
It's been placed on a high shelf for the PTR check marks.

270
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,940
If you absolutely Griffin walked into this garage holding a kitchen sink with a

271
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,740
shitty grin on his face.

272
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:24,540
And he's like, I think this needs to become a main thread.

273
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:24,940
Okay.

274
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,340
All right.

275
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,740
Do we need to do we need to explain any backstory before you go into anything?

276
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,740
You want to go into part of what needs to be accomplished.

277
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,140
I even I was prepared for this.

278
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,740
I have notes in case any.

279
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,740
So let's explain the whole story here.

280
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:45,740
So on a different second gate episode horror Hall of Fame with Andrew Grissom.

281
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:53,540
We discussed these these old whole horror award shows and one award was given to Frank

282
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,940
Marshall, the director of arachnophobia.

283
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,140
That's why he was there.

284
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,940
You might also know him as a producer.

285
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,140
You're getting to see it.

286
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,740
This is what he does every time.

287
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,740
You have to say the words Frank Marshall.

288
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,540
He goes off into a better place.

289
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,740
Yeah, if I could just have the show only be about Frank Marshall and not theme parks.

290
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,340
I'd be very pleased.

291
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,540
So you might know that name because he's the producer of many giant films.

292
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,540
Steven Spielberg films and also and of course hoots and the BFG.

293
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:31,740
Of course, Mary Kathleen Kennedy, the head of Star Wars at this point started out as

294
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,540
one of Peter Bogdanovich's protege's his first job is on

295
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:39,740
the last picture show and he was very instrumental in other side of the wind both in its original

296
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,140
aborted production and actually getting it finished.

297
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,540
Yeah, a legend in Hollywood.

298
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,940
Honestly, a quiet legend.

299
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,540
I think this is important to point out because I feel like sometimes I'm going to play both

300
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,340
sides of this.

301
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,540
That's even handed discussion right?

302
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:53,940
Yes.

303
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,140
Yes.

304
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,940
It needs to be discussed in full.

305
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:02,040
I feel like sometimes when you are dismissing the notion that Mike is presenting Frank

306
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,840
Marshall as an important figure in Hollywood, you understand this is a comedy show.

307
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,240
You're a very funny man.

308
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,040
I respect this.

309
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,440
You get the laugh out of me when you do this will lead with credits such as hoot in the BFG,

310
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,440
which you did again just now.

311
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:13,840
It is.

312
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,240
Yep.

313
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,640
You're right.

314
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,640
It's a move of arachnophobia and the producer of such big movies as and you're not mentioning

315
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,840
the fact that he produced the Indiana Jones.

316
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,840
Yes, of course.

317
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,040
Yes.

318
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,440
Yeah.

319
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:23,640
Yeah.

320
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,440
He's been nominated for many Academy Awards.

321
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:26,840
Yeah.

322
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,640
Now, he was being given an award for arachnophobia.

323
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,440
This is relevant.

324
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,040
That is relevant.

325
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,640
But then you're looking for the easy laugh.

326
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,040
Sure.

327
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
On BFG and who?

328
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,240
Little undercut.

329
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,040
But look, no, this is true.

330
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,240
He is a major figure and I acknowledge this, but let me shift it over here.

331
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,440
None of that is why he comes up all the fucking time.

332
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,840
He comes up because he's Jimmy Buffett's best friend.

333
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,440
He's Jimmy Buffett's best friend and he comes up all the time because I learned that he was

334
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,840
like Jimmy Buffett's best friend and it tickles me.

335
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,440
It delights me to no end.

336
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,040
And I've been thinking about this because I've been trying to prepare mentally for this

337
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,640
because I know you brought you were going to bring this up.

338
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,040
Yeah.

339
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,040
And if I even flesh it out more of why I like it, he's like always with him in the background.

340
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,640
Frank Marshall, who's this like Hollywood legend who's got, you know, you might not know

341
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,240
unless you're a nerd for these names.

342
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,640
But Frank Marshall, like he just goes and follows Jimmy on tour for like multiple days.

343
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,840
And then he comes out and he's in the background on stage playing Margaritaville on a guitar,

344
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,240
which is adorable.

345
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,440
It's so cute to me.

346
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,240
I love it.

347
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,840
It's adorable and cute.

348
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,240
Fascinating to me.

349
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,040
Don't you think it's cute that Frank Marshall is with his friend Jimmy Buffett?

350
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,440
He loves him.

351
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,240
He loves the music.

352
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,640
He has to love the music.

353
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,240
There's no way he doesn't love the music.

354
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,040
Very cute.

355
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,640
I think it's not just cute that he does it, but that Jimmy allows it.

356
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,840
Like it seems like a equal.

357
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,640
So, you know, different fields, but appreciation for what the others do.

358
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
Let me say this.

359
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,640
I do find that interesting that he shows up on stage and plays guitar that he has a whole

360
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:58,040
other career esteemed in this other category and he ends up on guitar playing Margaritaville

361
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,040
at a concert.

362
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,240
Something else to say though, you've never brought up that one.

363
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,640
That is interesting.

364
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,440
That makes me go like Frank Marshall.

365
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,440
That makes me more interested in him.

366
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,240
All I've ever heard is he's Jimmy Buffett's best friend.

367
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,640
That's the only fact that and much like the fucking briefcase story, I don't get enough

368
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,240
of like information about why.

369
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,840
Like when you give me more morsels, I'm like, okay, that is interesting.

370
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,440
I did like hearing that.

371
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:27,840
Yeah.

372
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,840
Well, I mean, I think there's other morsels.

373
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,040
I've said that I can't remember specifically what I've said in the show.

374
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,540
I don't know if it's just Jason and I are in such like agreement that of like loving

375
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,440
Frank Marshall that.

376
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,440
Texting Instagram posts to each other.

377
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,240
I think maybe we just share a common Marshall language that we maybe haven't conveyed to

378
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,640
you or the audience perhaps.

379
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,440
This is perhaps what I my true agenda.

380
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:57,940
I have come here with today is that when you relitigate to try to touch back on Frank Marshall

381
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,440
Gate, which would get to the actual incident.

382
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:00,840
Yeah, yeah.

383
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,440
I say, oh, yeah.

384
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,640
It things I would argue almost got even more testy.

385
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,440
Nothing was settled.

386
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,440
No, no, no, no.

387
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,840
I feel like there are some cleaner tunnels of communication that can be built here.

388
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,440
I think it was just built.

389
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,540
This is you gave me more context for why the Frank Marshall Jimmy Buffett connection is

390
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,040
interesting.

391
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,840
Okay, so we're we're we're figuring it out.

392
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,440
Working on this.

393
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,340
Yeah, because I don't even mind gator.

394
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,140
I come here as a group therapist.

395
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,640
Yes.

396
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
Yeah, absolutely.

397
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,540
Yes, because like, you know what I've just something I've just learned is that you guys

398
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:41,040
go off the PTR text thread to do Frank Marshall sharing is thinking that I'm not going to

399
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,540
be interested.

400
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:46,640
But now that's left me with a big gulf of knowledge that I don't have and especially

401
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,240
that the audience does not have they are not on your text thread.

402
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,840
So some of the things that are interesting to you, you've never told the audience.

403
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,040
This is a great point.

404
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:02,640
I do think that perhaps and I am similarly fascinated with Frank Marshall and being a

405
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,040
movie nerd who is very aware of him and his name.

406
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,540
Yeah, and then just hearing Mike say he is Jimmy Buffett's best friend.

407
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,140
The math was done in my head.

408
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,240
It is funny for that guy to be Jimmy Buffett's best friend.

409
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:15,540
Okay.

410
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,440
Versus if he is presented to you as Jimmy Buffett's best friend and that is your starting

411
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,940
point you go why the fuck am I hearing about him?

412
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,640
Sure.

413
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,440
I know I'm aware of the body of work.

414
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,440
I'm just not specifically like fascinated.

415
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,740
I've seen that name always.

416
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,540
I've watched enough interviews with him.

417
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,340
It's funny his temperament the vision the visual I have of him in my head.

418
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:39,240
It's like, oh if what if Brian Grazer would just like follow Eric Clapton around and get

419
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,340
on stage and jam with Clapton all the time.

420
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,340
He puts the guitar on.

421
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,440
Right, right.

422
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,840
And also probably once in a while gets COVID.

423
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,640
Yes.

424
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,640
Doing all of this.

425
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,140
Just hops up up there.

426
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,540
This has got to stop.

427
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,940
Strolling through his veins.

428
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:56,540
It's just it's an odd dynamic and I do think there's something I find funny of like Frank

429
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,540
Marshall is so powerful in Hollywood, right?

430
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,540
You compare with Kathleen Kennedy who like the last fucking five years a cottage industry

431
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,540
has developed on people writing fanfiction about what Kathleen Kennedy is doing behind

432
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,440
closed doors.

433
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,740
He is pulling out fully from whole cloth making up things that we don't know that.

434
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,040
Right.

435
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,340
Whereas he is like their reputations were tied.

436
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,140
They are married.

437
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:21,640
They were producing partners with Spielberg on like the best of the best run he had.

438
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,940
I think it's from ET on or it's Raiders on maybe.

439
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,740
Yeah, something like that.

440
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:32,740
Yeah, it's like an incredible run basically until she goes off to do Star Wars and he

441
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,940
became more Jurassic Stewart and the pet projects and whatever.

442
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,640
His movies he has directed tend to be a little goofy.

443
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,440
Congo, Ape Below, Arachnophobia.

444
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,540
They are not Spielberg level films.

445
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,640
Sure, but I don't let people like Arachnophobia.

446
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,940
I feel like fun movies.

447
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,440
Yeah, fun.

448
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:54,940
I think Congo's fun, you know, but it's like his producing work is so high caliber.

449
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,540
Did he do the recent Bee Gees documentary?

450
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,140
Did I see that?

451
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,140
Yeah, I think so.

452
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,540
Yeah, I like that was good.

453
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:07,040
I've talked about on the show even I rock he loves he's a rock guy to that's what's funny

454
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,040
about him is it's not like oh this guy's a parrot head.

455
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:16,840
It's like this guy is like the Gallagher 2 of Jimmy Buffett that you can see him put

456
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,540
on the shirt strap on the guitar get backstage and you're like, this is his second life.

457
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,040
This feels like his real joy.

458
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,240
I think his real passion and then shit were like Jimmy Buffett shows up in Jurassic World.

459
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,540
You're like he's holding.

460
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,340
It's all the little stuff like Jimmy Buffett doing don't bug me on the Arachnophobia

461
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,040
soundtrack.

462
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,540
You go.

463
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,040
There it is.

464
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,240
And then like he's on he's guesting on different things and they're like pictures of him in

465
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,740
a plane with Frank Marshall 25 years ago and you're like, wow, they've been friends

466
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,840
forever and I'm glad you set up at the beginning this episode Scott that you think this is

467
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,340
going to be a clean accessible entry point for new listeners.

468
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,340
Yeah, that's the goal of this episode not to get into Arcana.

469
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:55,440
Happy you're enjoying it so much mythology that you get to you get to go on such a treasure

470
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,440
hunt, but I think you're making a good point, which is I think that Mike and Jason have

471
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:06,640
a pre-established language and dialogue about Buffett.

472
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,240
Clearly I didn't know about this texting.

473
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,240
Yes, I've been pre podcast because I think I think we were just delighted people are

474
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,840
writing articles about I remember people are like Kathleen Kennedy is under fire for

475
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,640
whatever people are mad about Star Wars or whatever and then I think I'm sending you

476
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,940
like Instagram posts like Frank Marshall like like arms around Jimmy Buffett with a

477
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:30,140
cocktail or something like as far away from there.

478
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,040
He's just hanging out.

479
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,940
He's living the life.

480
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,140
Now.

481
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,740
This is like I'm friends with all three of you guys.

482
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:39,540
You have a group text, but also each of us has a separate text because sometimes they'll

483
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,240
be a conversation.

484
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,540
Sure.

485
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,240
I need to send this to all the other guys.

486
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,140
You and I have our specific things we talk about Mike and I have a texture.

487
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,040
We just talked about deals on action figures.

488
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,040
That's right and gossip on social media, right?

489
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,040
Yeah, very quickly after his daughter was born.

490
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,440
You were talking about deals and new avatar figure reveals.

491
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,040
They look pretty good.

492
00:22:54,040 --> 00:23:02,940
Yeah, I'm at New York Comic Con and I'm texting Mike about meeting guys who are only known

493
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,440
within the action figure world.

494
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,240
Yeah, and at some point I think I accidentally send one of those texts to our group thread

495
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,040
rather than yours and you kind of react with like this is fascinating hearing you guys

496
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,040
gawk about people I've never heard of.

497
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,740
Yeah, could not imagine putting this importance on it's an alternate dimension.

498
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,040
Like of course we do that.

499
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:28,940
We have our guys who we do that with but hearing some like arbitrary dull name to me and I

500
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,340
was knowing these things a rock star to you guys.

501
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,040
I just met Blaine are things today and Mike is like, holy shit.

502
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,240
I think you said that's bigger than if you met.

503
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,940
Oh Toby and well that was that was the Marvel Legends guys.

504
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,440
Yes, I met the three Marvel Legends guys.

505
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,640
I wasn't excited that you met Blaine are because I was very excited.

506
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:44,940
Right.

507
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,040
Yeah.

508
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,340
Yeah, and he was that's bigger than right and you were sort of enjoying the like I like

509
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:50,540
that.

510
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,640
I don't know this and I'm hearing you freak out about names that mean nothing to me.

511
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,740
Yeah, there's an opposite effect going on with the Frank Marshall thing where there's

512
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,640
a presumption that you should know and care.

513
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,040
That's right.

514
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,540
Then angers you.

515
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:08,740
I think that yes, I always the idea that I'm supposed to retain things now.

516
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:14,840
I understand where Mike is coming from to be fair here because he's like it has come

517
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,540
up a lot.

518
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:20,440
This should have made the impact but I think it was never properly established.

519
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,840
Yeah, so it's been said but it hasn't it hasn't stuck in your craw yet.

520
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:31,640
And as I said about the clown about like our day clown, I like there are certain things

521
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,640
that I am learning it and erasing it the pencil and is moving just barely in front of

522
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,440
the eraser.

523
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,640
You never had all the pieces arranged in the right order.

524
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,640
I by chance was similarly fascinated with Frank Marshall.

525
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,240
Here Mike and Jason using short hand to talk about the Buffett stuff do the math in my

526
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,640
head.

527
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,140
Yeah.

528
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:53,040
Yeah, but perhaps for the common listener and even a common co-host of this show.

529
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,840
That math was not so apparent.

530
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:01,240
Well this I apologies Aaron if you don't want to be brought into this conversation, but

531
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,940
my wife I like when I explained Frank Marshall gate to her.

532
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,240
She was like, do you talk about Frank Marshall on the show?

533
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,140
And I was like, I think we do but you are erasing it live as it's happening.

534
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,440
It is not sticking with Mike's content.

535
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,240
One of the top 10 guys I think is perhaps false.

536
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,040
Did I say oh yeah, I guess.

537
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,740
Well, this is when I caught re-listening to it that I was immediately I was like, how

538
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,840
did I not catch that one in the moment that you declare that which by the let me say this

539
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:35,140
part as we're deep into it now that the amount of build-up we're adding to this before we

540
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,840
explain to me.

541
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,640
Yeah, no, no, no.

542
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:37,840
No, no, no.

543
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,440
He's confused.

544
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:48,040
Okay, the the incident all this being said we that we were at the premiere of Jurassic

545
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,440
World Ride.

546
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:49,840
Right.

547
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,840
I'm reminded of this because of the arachnophobia clip.

548
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:58,140
The name Frank Marshall was said Mike started grinning wider than I've ever seen like the

549
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,240
Joker like a Joker Jason change seeing your daughter for the first time.

550
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,340
Yeah, no, it wasn't even close to that, but it was more maniacal when Frank Marshall comes

551
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:06,640
up.

552
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,940
There was a sweeter smile with my daughter.

553
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:13,440
This is one where I started feeling that feeling where I started to get horrified where I was

554
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,640
like, do I not remember Frank Marshall being there like, oh, yes, of course, Michael.

555
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,040
You disagree.

556
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,940
Let me let me wait.

557
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,640
Your choice of word was horrified.

558
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,640
This situation was high sticks and of it horrified was the word shares my feeling about him

559
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,640
and was actually horrified because he should remember he Jason knows he would be a good

560
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,040
boy and he should know that.

561
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,840
Well, because I called there was a bunch of people out look there's so and so there's

562
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,440
so and so in the crowd, but that said I did feel better when we realized he did not speak.

563
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,240
He did not speak.

564
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,440
And that's the story.

565
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:47,940
Okay.

566
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,240
So stories to be told.

567
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,040
The story is that it comes up.

568
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:55,140
We're at this event and you might goes out of his way.

569
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,440
The topics been changed.

570
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,440
Mike goes out of his way to say now remember that we all went to the event where we saw

571
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:06,440
Frank Marshall speak and then we all did not remember this happening and you got very

572
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,840
argumentative voice raised.

573
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,640
You don't remember Frank Marshall speaking to a friend.

574
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,540
The tone is locked in my head.

575
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,940
Now you pointed at us.

576
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:20,340
Accusations that we did not remember a speech by this Hollywood luminary and Jimmy Buffett's

577
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:20,940
best friend.

578
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,740
Jason is wondering if his memory is going.

579
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,140
It is going.

580
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,340
For you, you're saying I would have remembered.

581
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,640
Which we have many things have established Jason's memory for sure is going.

582
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:38,240
But then it turns out we had the better memory because we didn't have a memory of something

583
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,140
that didn't happen only reinforced by Scott.

584
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,840
Did you post the picture of our view?

585
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,140
This is something you brought up.

586
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,740
You said well, we might not have we might have had an obstructed view and you yourself

587
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,540
might have had an extra obstructed view.

588
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:55,240
I always have an obstructed view with these kind of standing events like concerts like

589
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,240
the exact point of view.

590
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,440
We had the group of people doing this photo op again.

591
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,140
We're ignoring Chris Pratt big movie stars.

592
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:02,840
Who cares?

593
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,740
Whatever Frank Mars.

594
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:08,240
There's a big speaker in front of Frank Marshall ironically a speaker from in front of

595
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,440
somebody who was not a speaker at this event and you caught yourself.

596
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:11,840
Yeah.

597
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,040
Frank Marshall did not speak an executive name Ron Meyer spoke.

598
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,740
So you were scolding us about not remembering a speech that did not.

599
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,540
It did not have a right.

600
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:21,840
Yes.

601
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,740
And that's the story.

602
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,340
Jason is is going.

603
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,240
What does it say about me?

604
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,140
If I don't remember this I should remember this and you Scott are responding with the

605
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:38,940
attitude of I am angry that you are implying that this should be remembered in abstract.

606
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,440
Yes, at that point the reality was that he did speak even if it did happen.

607
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:44,840
Yes.

608
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,040
And what could he possibly have done that would have made this memorable to me?

609
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:55,440
Am I doubling down on the you don't remember that ever speaking took the mic.

610
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,940
He then of course says do you remember the fireworks because there was a big blast of

611
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:05,240
fireworks soon after this and I posited of course I remember when there was a bunch of

612
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:11,740
Sky that somehow was more memorable to me than an old man speaking who I unlike you

613
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:16,540
Griffin have never seen one piece of video of I've never been sent one piece of video

614
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,040
of him.

615
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:22,740
You guys are the ones texting about I can't believe we're talking about this more and

616
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:28,940
longer so much certain listeners just delete your complaints about it.

617
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,840
We don't want to see him.

618
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,840
We have business to attend to in this garage and you know, you got to put up with bullshit

619
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,440
as a listener.

620
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,940
So that said more bullshit.

621
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,540
Would you do another direction you want to take this?

622
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:49,540
Well, I think look I you guys let me quickly just for context Frank Marshall was there.

623
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,540
He was there.

624
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:56,340
Yes, I just I caught myself on the episode about five minutes later after I came down

625
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,540
my blood pressure came down a little bit and I went oh my God, maybe I was wrong.

626
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,540
Was it a different old man that taught was there?

627
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,840
It's like didn't say that but it was there a different person that talked and I'm

628
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,740
I'm not going to be misremembering.

629
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,740
I did misremember he was on stage.

630
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,140
There's clear as day pictures.

631
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:08,640
He's there.

632
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,440
I can identify him.

633
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,040
The police can go we can go down.

634
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,740
I'm sure there's a record of it there to prove that the pictures are fine the pictures.

635
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:21,140
We do not need to involve the police in this matter saying this to the Universal City Police

636
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,140
and they have their own place.

637
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,540
They were probably there protecting him that night because he's a national treasure and

638
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,140
they'll tell us yes, he was there.

639
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,840
So I wasn't completely crazy.

640
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:35,340
And as I said on the episode, it didn't even really matter to me and this is how this is my way out.

641
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,340
This is your double down.

642
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,340
This is my double down.

643
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:40,940
Didn't even matter that he spoke just him being up on the stage elicited the same excitement

644
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,840
from me at the time and also you should have remembered that.

645
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,040
So you should remember the guy walking a guy who I also in the moment could not see because

646
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,940
there was big audio equipment stopping me from seeing him.

647
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:56,540
I needed to remember that something that I could not see or hear because he didn't do

648
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,340
anything with his mouth.

649
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:03,840
So the target moves right it moves from I can't believe you didn't remember hearing this

650
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:11,340
man speak on stage in front of fireworks to he was one of many people on a stage.

651
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,840
Seven people on a stage.

652
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
Very crowded event.

653
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,340
200 yards away.

654
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,340
300 yards away.

655
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:22,640
Many of whom most of whom are not Chris Pratt are not recognizable to the common man.

656
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,640
They're behind the scenes.

657
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,140
Even Colin Tremereau giving a very large speech about the power of storytelling.

658
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,140
Right.

659
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,140
I understand this.

660
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,140
Of course I remember that.

661
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,140
I remember everything he's ever done.

662
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,140
Yes.

663
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,140
Yeah.

664
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,140
So I understand that.

665
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,140
But yes.

666
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,140
So he was up there.

667
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,940
I caught myself luckily because I hate being I hate I hate misremembering but it's three

668
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:47,140
years ago and all I all I was remembering was the excitement of seeing him up there and

669
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:51,540
that's what the energy that was pulsing from my body when I was saying I can't believe you

670
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:55,840
don't remember was that he was on stage and I did feel the excitement was rushing back

671
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,840
to me.

672
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:03,240
I think this serves as like your explanation for why you got so animated and upset.

673
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,600
It's not I don't think you're putting on me that I needed to remember it.

674
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,840
You're just explaining why it suddenly became you don't remember.

675
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,840
Yes.

676
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,840
Yes.

677
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,840
That's why.

678
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,840
Yes.

679
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,260
That is why because I personally felt so excited.

680
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,840
That was maybe the best celebrity sighting I had that night.

681
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,840
Sure.

682
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,040
So I was remembering that.

683
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:26,240
No one here seemingly cares about Chris Pratt one of the biggest movie stars in the world.

684
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,840
It just does not you completely threw him under the bus as an interesting celebrity

685
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,840
sighting.

686
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,240
You get defensive about the idea that you think Mike is attacking you for not remembering

687
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,740
and then your retaliation is why would I remember that?

688
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,640
That's not important which makes Mike more defensive.

689
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,640
Sure.

690
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Because I belittled Frank Marshall.

691
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,640
Right.

692
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:53,040
It becomes was this even worth remembering which once we then get to it never happened.

693
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,540
It's an escalating argument about a theoretical.

694
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:00,260
I now can see you've actually you've made an argument to me of why the episode was more

695
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,220
interesting than I thought it was.

696
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,220
Yes.

697
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:09,020
Now that you lay it out in these now that you're doing the like 10 part true crime series

698
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:14,180
about the 20 minute podcast fragments that we put out because also that we started this

699
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:19,660
as the top of an episode it got so long that we bailed and started the episode over something

700
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,180
we might have to do right now.

701
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,980
I was going to say this is what we're doing again.

702
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,260
But I don't want it behind the paywall.

703
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:33,060
And I'm very happy to fulfill your you're the guest and we need to go with your wishes.

704
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,060
I agree.

705
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,060
Okay.

706
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:39,380
We might have to sell but I do I do think there's a thing and I think part of what's

707
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,380
interesting about this to me is you guys just celebrated your fifth anniversary.

708
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,380
That's right.

709
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,380
That's true.

710
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,380
Yeah.

711
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,380
It's a bit of a threshold crossed right.

712
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,380
Sure.

713
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,380
Yeah.

714
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,380
Half a decade.

715
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,180
In our world means something.

716
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,180
You made something.

717
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:58,860
Copyright on Jason Sheridan is still many years to go before it wears off and people can use

718
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,860
him in the public domain.

719
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,580
We have to start splintering him into Sub Jason arguing that there's distinct different

720
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,580
characters.

721
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:08,620
Jason has a different copyright date.

722
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:12,620
Republican senators to go like please extend the copyright date.

723
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:16,580
Somebody is doing like a twisted horror movie with Jason Sheridan in the public domain.

724
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,580
We don't want that.

725
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,500
It's not even a good movie.

726
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,940
It's just the idea that they could do a fucking Jason Sheridan movie.

727
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,340
That's years away still.

728
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:30,700
I do think there's this thing though like the Doughboys Friends of Hours.

729
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,700
Sure.

730
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,060
Great podcast.

731
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,340
The fighting has been baked into the cake on that show since the very beginning.

732
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,340
Yeah.

733
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,340
Yeah.

734
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,340
For sure.

735
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,340
I think it preceded the show.

736
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,340
I understand.

737
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,940
I think a very mean text thread for a long time.

738
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,940
Correct.

739
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:47,500
They're like the Lockhorns of podcasting.

740
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,500
I want to hear every.

741
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:54,220
Oh, Jason just looked up from his iPad.

742
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,900
We tune in to watch them fight.

743
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,500
And this is a thing that I think you cannot manufacture.

744
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,500
Right.

745
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:05,620
It is why we all look at the Doughboys with awe because we're like the dynamic is so perfect.

746
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,180
Writers could not write.

747
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,180
Created in a lab.

748
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,580
And there is the underlying truth where like these guys do like each other.

749
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,700
They are perhaps loathe to admit it.

750
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,140
But if they really hated each other, the show would have ended years ago rather than every

751
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:20,300
episode ending with them saying we should end the show.

752
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,300
Any time.

753
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,300
They could do it at any moment.

754
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,300
But they don't.

755
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,460
David and I, my blank check host, David Simms, we've had these fights as well.

756
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:30,560
Very early on in the show, we had a big fight where I started pushing forward the theory

757
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,940
that has existed for a long time in fan communities that the reason the Star Wars special editions

758
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:42,460
exist and why George Lucas does not allow the original cuts into circulation is because

759
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:46,960
his wife, his ex-wife, Marsha Lucas, was one of the editors on the original theatrical

760
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,640
cuts and by only putting the special editions in circulation, she no longer is entitled

761
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,640
to residuals.

762
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,640
Whoa.

763
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,640
Wow.

764
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,520
David, the fight we got into about why are you still talking about this was very similar

765
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,780
to Marshall Gate.

766
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:06,000
It was an early inflection point in the podcast where it's like, is there trouble in paradise?

767
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,640
Ah, oh, are you worried about us?

768
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,120
Yes, that we're headed here.

769
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:16,000
I'm saying to a certain degree, it defies logic that you guys have gone five years without

770
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,160
this big of a blow up.

771
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,160
But I think-

772
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,160
There's been, look, I mean Randy Gerber's the biggest-

773
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,160
Yeah, Transformers irritated Scott to the fucking moon.

774
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,960
But I'm saying, I think this has been building.

775
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,760
Some of these tensions have been building.

776
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,760
Sure, sure.

777
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,480
I think it's like, you three guys, you're friends to different degrees, right?

778
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,520
You come together, you go, we all have this shared interest, let's start doing this.

779
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,400
In the beginning of the podcast, it's all about the unification of we know these same

780
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,400
guys.

781
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,400
Yeah.

782
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,400
Bob Gerr.

783
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,600
This is a safe space where we can throw that name out and we all enjoy it.

784
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,600
We all know these guys.

785
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,760
It's a shared language that, yeah, we never even checked with each other about a lot of

786
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,760
things.

787
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,720
And over time, the thing expands, the mythology expands, more things get pulled in from individual

788
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:02,960
lives and there starts to become this imbalance of like, you prefer talking about this and

789
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,040
dislike this more, you know?

790
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,640
Whatever it is.

791
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:13,280
Not to like extreme, you know, sort of like fight degree, but those things start to evolve

792
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:20,800
and there started to be this thing of like Beach Boys versus Gerber versus 20s con artists.

793
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,800
I'm so upset that you would pair those.

794
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,120
How dare you?

795
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:30,880
But I think Frank Marshall Gate is actually a healthy thing to have happened.

796
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,880
Yes.

797
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,680
And to work through because I think if Podcast the Right is going to exist for another five,

798
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,680
10, 15 years, which I hope it does.

799
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,480
Yeah, I hope so too.

800
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,440
At a certain point, you guys need to learn how to coexist with when there's a zag into

801
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,440
one guy's corner.

802
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,440
Ah, yes.

803
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,440
Yeah.

804
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,440
Yeah.

805
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,440
When we're so thoroughly yanked into one guy.

806
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,440
Without feeling like I'm angry, you don't care about this as much as I do.

807
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,200
Or I'm angry, you're angry that I don't care about this as much as you do.

808
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,200
Yeah.

809
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,760
You know who could diffuse these sorts of conflicts among podcasters?

810
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,280
Hollywood super producer like Frank Marshall.

811
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,280
Oh, because he's dealing with talent.

812
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:15,360
He's got to diffuse, you know, the studio and the director and the talent.

813
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,800
Our Country Bear patron episode got very contentious.

814
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,560
He would have been perfect there to like mitigate some of that.

815
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,560
Yeah.

816
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:26,880
So Griffin, have you seen the Country Bears movie?

817
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,880
First of all, I have.

818
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,240
I'll say I only I haven't rewatched it.

819
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,600
OK, I saw it on VHS the year of its release.

820
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,520
OK, I owe it another look.

821
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,440
OK, I remembered liking some of it.

822
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,440
Sure.

823
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,440
That's essentially our opinion.

824
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,440
That's what we've gotten.

825
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,600
I said Jason hated it.

826
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,600
Most urgent matter of business, we've got to make the game time decision.

827
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:53,840
Is this the first 45 minutes of an episode or is this once again being spun off?

828
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,680
Oh, it's the third part of the Marshall Gate trilogy.

829
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,880
It could be a bonus on the main feed.

830
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,920
There are a lot of options here.

831
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,920
Yeah.

832
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,920
Yeah.

833
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,360
I just think the question is, do we now think anyone who isn't invested in this narrative

834
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:10,240
has turned off the episode angry that we are not talking about?

835
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,080
Well, the question, do you care about Disneyland Paris enough?

836
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,800
And you're like, this is why.

837
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,000
Look, it's why we bailed on a bigger topic.

838
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Yes.

839
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,200
Because like what we've essentially been teeing up is like a trip report because you went

840
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
to Disneyland Paris.

841
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:29,280
It's like something that like where we don't owe a lot of like a history of something.

842
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,280
Right.

843
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,960
Only the history of a weird thing that's been happening with us for the last.

844
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,960
You know, it's yes.

845
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,680
Let's say this is one episode.

846
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,800
I think this is the choice.

847
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,800
Yeah.

848
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,800
I'll say you feel good about it.

849
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,800
I do.

850
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,800
It's your I do.

851
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
I do.

852
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
I do.

853
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,800
Yeah.

854
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,600
And I'll say that this was sort of just explained to be a little bit how we end up on this.

855
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,600
Right.

856
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
Yeah.

857
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,920
My my brother James lives in Paris now.

858
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,640
He works for a Parisian basketball team, which exists.

859
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,960
That is a thing.

860
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,960
He is like the the Jonah Hill and Moneyball to this team.

861
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,960
Oh, wow.

862
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,560
The question I get who does the analytics and tries to pick players.

863
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,560
He's very good at this.

864
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,840
I don't understand how his brain works.

865
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,840
But you were saying you're maybe not a big sports person, but this you're fascinated.

866
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,840
But like all what your brother this way he gets to.

867
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,840
Yeah.

868
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,760
Well, look, first of all, I went to two games with him.

869
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,700
I had not visited him since he moved to Paris.

870
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,760
He started he got this job right before the pandemic.

871
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,280
And then he had to because the pandemic do the job for a year remotely.

872
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,360
And then he moved out to Paris about, I guess, a year and a half ago.

873
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,360
So you're not there since then.

874
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,720
And I've not been able to visit.

875
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,880
I've been overdue.

876
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,960
And I was like, I love Paris.

877
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,200
I would love to visit him.

878
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,920
I'd love to go see a game.

879
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,840
I have not been to Disneyland Paris since I was a very small child.

880
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,840
Yes.

881
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,280
You said you had gone a handful of times.

882
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,280
I went as a child.

883
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,040
Well, so when I was a kid and I was obsessed with theme parks and I watched that, what

884
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,640
was the show called Inside Disney World, the one that George Wormand World Inside Out.

885
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,960
You watched that on the Disney Channel.

886
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,280
I watched it all the time.

887
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,280
Oh, man.

888
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,200
I would say to my parents, why aren't you taking me to Disney World?

889
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,680
And my mother would say, I took you to Euro Disney when you were two.

890
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,680
Don't you remember?

891
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,120
He would hold up a photo.

892
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,280
I might have been younger than two.

893
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:17,120
It was before my brother was born and and my mom couldn't have been far along pregnant.

894
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,200
And there's a three year difference between us.

895
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,600
So I was two and change at the oldest.

896
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:26,200
And there was a photo she would hold up in my face to spite me of me as a toddler wearing

897
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,520
a Mickey Mouse rain slicker saying we went.

898
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,520
It rained.

899
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,520
We left early.

900
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,000
I have no memory of this.

901
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,240
And she'd be like, well, I took you.

902
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,520
You can't say I didn't take you.

903
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,520
Yeah, yeah.

904
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,960
It sounds suspiciously similar to things that have been happening in this room.

905
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,960
A little bit.

906
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,520
My mom was trying to remember going to my mom.

907
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,640
Your two year old memory didn't you remember the castle soccer blue?

908
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,240
It was the original commercial game.

909
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,240
No, I love it.

910
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,280
Oh, you just said a French thing.

911
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,800
That was what you brought to the.

912
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,800
I was.

913
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,800
I was.

914
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,800
What do I do?

915
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,800
But sure.

916
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,800
I was.

917
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,400
Baguette said you woke up and you're like,

918
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,800
Zachary, you didn't even know we were talking about.

919
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,800
That's just how you wake up from naps.

920
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,880
Zachary, Zachary.

921
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,160
A response to survival instinct is a sacrableu.

922
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,480
My my mother is French.

923
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,520
She grew up in Paris so that we would visit sometimes.

924
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:28,240
And when I was like maybe 10, if even that nine or 10,

925
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,240
my dad took my brother and I.

926
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,120
This was when my sister was a little baby.

927
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,280
So it was just the three of us and we went for like half a day maybe.

928
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,840
Is this point in time pre the second gate, the studios?

929
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,040
Correct. OK, OK.

930
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,600
Because what that opens to?

931
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,560
I believe so. Yes.

932
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,120
This was late 90s.

933
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,440
It would have been, I think, even mid 90s, perhaps.

934
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,040
That was the last time I'd gone.

935
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,640
And I've gone to visit Paris since then.

936
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,520
Every time I do the thing that I you've sort of said when you went there

937
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:00,440
on your honeymoon, even as a man who hosts a theme park podcast going,

938
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:05,480
is this silly to be spending a day here rather than spending time in Paris?

939
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,040
Well, look, that thought did not occur to me until we was too late

940
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,920
to change the plan. It is.

941
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:15,960
I was there thinking it is silly that we chose to spend so much time here.

942
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,800
I would not. I would say go for sure.

943
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,880
Yes. But be careful.

944
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,120
I was happy that I went.

945
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,000
But I think it is very much the nature of that place.

946
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,160
The second you step foot on the grounds, you go, is it silly that I'm here?

947
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,120
Say the same thing with you.

948
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,040
Yeah, yeah. And I'm happy that I went.

949
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,200
But every time I've gone to Paris, I do have that thing where I'm like,

950
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,640
dork, I like theme parks. It's right there.

951
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,240
It's a quick day trip. Sure.

952
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,240
Is it silly if I go?

953
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,920
So I haven't gone the last couple of times.

954
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,520
I plan this trip to go visit my brother.

955
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,360
I reach out to you guys.

956
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,600
I know I'm going to be in L.A. afterwards.

957
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,520
I know it disenchanted is coming out and I want to come talk about.

958
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,320
And I go, I'll go to Paris.

959
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:54,160
Let's find a thing that's like a fun, special occasion.

960
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,840
But we could talk about a Paris attraction, which don't get discussed that much.

961
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,240
Yeah, right. And the thing that was immediately thrown out was the New Avengers ride.

962
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,080
Yeah, that's a new ride that's only in Paris.

963
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,080
That's right. Yes.

964
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,880
You were maybe the yeah, this is a very new thing.

965
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,320
First, it opens to talk about event any of Avengers campus in Paris.

966
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,160
I was like, that's let's just assume that's the episode.

967
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,360
Oh, and I'll just I'll say this quick because you have to get this out of the way.

968
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,040
You know, the ride is like a reskinned rock and roller coaster.

969
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,680
Yes. So we're to keep in mind Aerosmith has been stripped from this.

970
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,640
Yes. Ride travesty. Right. Yeah.

971
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,600
I feel like you guys have talked about this principle a lot on the show.

972
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,480
Anytime Disney has tried to develop a roller coaster with a narrative,

973
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,840
they often bump against this thing of it is hard to tell a story at very high speeds.

974
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,520
You know, especially very fast.

975
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,400
Yeah. With old technology like I know Guardians in Florida,

976
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,240
supposedly is a better at it because I'm very curious to see that technology is

977
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,840
better. Yeah. I built from the ground up trying to read.

978
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,560
Yeah. Yeah. Kind of can rotate you towards important stuff.

979
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,400
But I've also heard like, yeah, a number of people are getting off this ride.

980
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,960
Very nauseous. I've heard this as well.

981
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,200
And I've heard this from people who love the ride. Yeah.

982
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,360
I do think Terrifier 2 style and fans.

983
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,880
Shitting puking. Yeah. Art the Clown.

984
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,480
Art. I got it. Now. Now I got our guardians ride.

985
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,000
He's pulling the levers. Oh, no.

986
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,800
Soccer Blur. So this is

987
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,760
that was your mother is French.

988
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,920
No, it makes sense. It makes sense.

989
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,080
Yeah. No, no, no. It was really funny and I liked it.

990
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,600
So this is this is Rock and Roller Coaster.

991
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:40,000
This ride with this infamous launch, this very quick acceleration flat

992
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,760
into super high speeds. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

993
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,600
Most of Rock and Roller Coaster, the narrative legwork is done by the opening,

994
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,120
because they know that once you're on the ride, you're not going to be able

995
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,680
to follow the story. So you're watching this whole video.

996
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,960
Yeah. Yeah. Douglas, Ken Marino.

997
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,000
Then you get on the ride.

998
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,360
And then at that point, all you have to track is the song. Yeah.

999
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,280
It's I think even less in the Paris version is my recollection that like

1000
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,640
you don't even get the the like the narrative of the road sign

1001
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,160
or you go through the Hollywood.

1002
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,760
I think it's just lights and concert.

1003
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,880
It's like stay. It looks like staging more than it does.

1004
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,480
Like you're traveling on the landmarks of Los Angeles.

1005
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,640
You're going to hear a rock song, you know, while you're on a fast,

1006
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,720
right, fast paced car ride. Right. Yeah.

1007
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,840
This a lot of the pre show stuff is in French,

1008
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,720
which I do not speak anywhere close to fluently.

1009
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,960
I am not totally getting the pre show stuff,

1010
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,440
which is there's not as much of a like pre show scene clear.

1011
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,760
There's just some screens around you.

1012
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,000
They're setting up some plot points. I understand who is in.

1013
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,040
What are you looking at?

1014
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,280
Well, so the weird thing they do in Disneyland Paris is

1015
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,360
a lot of French people are bilingual.

1016
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,560
Yeah. And you have a lot of English speaking

1017
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:57,160
European countries, adjacent countries that come and visit Disneyland Paris.

1018
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,920
So a lot of the rides, the choice they make is

1019
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,320
you have two characters and one of them speaks English and one of them speaks in French.

1020
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:09,080
Oh, which is what they do on Cars Roadtrip, correct?

1021
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,480
Which I believe you went and we'll get to that.

1022
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,240
We're like Cruz de Miro speaks in English and Sally speaks in French, I think.

1023
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,480
And they're in conversation.

1024
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,840
They're not echoing the same points, like making sure it's repeated for both audiences.

1025
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:24,720
Very strange. One will say something and the other will respond in a different language.

1026
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,400
It's CGI Iron Man and Captain Marvel.

1027
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,920
I believe it really is Brie Larson.

1028
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,600
But I'm also like single writer, so I'm like breezing through the pre show thing.

1029
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,000
Right. And I mean, you were only there once.

1030
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,520
You probably should have experienced the line.

1031
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,560
I I actually and this is the point of the story.

1032
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,360
I fucked up. I fucked up. I really did.

1033
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,280
Thank you for admitting that you might have been more presure than anything,

1034
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,400
even though it didn't seem like there was a lot of presure.

1035
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,040
I was joking and then everybody just said, yes, that's right.

1036
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:55,080
That's correct. They have all the signs that are like, don't go on this.

1037
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,160
If you're pregnant, if you have back problems, take your hats off.

1038
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,840
Loose articles, all this stuff. High speed ride. Right.

1039
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,000
And it's the only ride that on the sign says remove your glasses.

1040
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,280
Really? Oh, I feel like I don't see anywhere. Right.

1041
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,640
And you don't on things. You don't just like out of caution do it or.

1042
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,120
I never have thought to.

1043
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:19,080
I guess maybe if on a crazy upside down roller coaster, which I don't do a ton,

1044
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,720
if they're like all loose objects, but certainly for Disney, where I'm like,

1045
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,840
no one's telling me to take off my glasses.

1046
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,800
But I'm like, I'm going to fucking keep them on.

1047
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,480
No one no one before the ride vehicle goes off is like glasses need to come off.

1048
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,400
Right. That's like a six flags thing.

1049
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,960
Yes. Right. From Disney.

1050
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,360
They can't throw rides the expensive coasters.

1051
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,200
It feels like you should be able to wear whatever you want and it's not going to fly off.

1052
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,440
Right. But it is that thing where right when the thing is

1053
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,360
about to take off and I know it's going to do that insane rock and roller coaster,

1054
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,040
like zero to one hundred and fifty, whatever ramp up.

1055
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,280
I'm not one hundred and fifty. What is it?

1056
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,720
It's like sixty sixty.

1057
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,440
That's just ever made.

1058
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,880
It feels so fucked.

1059
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,800
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1060
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,120
I was like, I'm going to feel like such a fucking idiot if I lose my glasses

1061
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,720
in this flight in this ride, do I even want to take the risk?

1062
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,240
So I put my glasses in my pocket.

1063
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,840
The thing ramps up and I quickly realize this ride is just rock and roller coaster.

1064
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,280
But three times it stops at a screen for 15 seconds.

1065
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:20,200
Really? And then you're on a screen for 15 seconds with Iron Man and Captain Marvel.

1066
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,600
Every other line is in French and I didn't have my glasses on.

1067
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,640
I couldn't see what was happening.

1068
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,880
Wait, it stops on the coaster. Correct.

1069
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,280
They just talk. How does it start again?

1070
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,560
I don't know. It would just stop.

1071
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:34,080
And then there's a screen and I'm like, I can see a blurry image of CGI, Captain Marvel

1072
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,720
and Iron Man in space fighting aliens.

1073
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,800
I could not even identify which alien race it was.

1074
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,560
And I know the Marvel alien races.

1075
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,920
I assume it's Chitauri maybe from the first Avengers.

1076
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,560
I don't know, but they were flying around.

1077
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,120
I was like, are they Skrulls? Because they were like in space.

1078
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,200
Huh? Yeah, I don't know.

1079
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,520
But but it was like and I'm getting half the dialogue.

1080
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,920
It's like 10 to 15 second show scenes.

1081
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,280
It's truly just a screen.

1082
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,480
And then the thing ramps up again.

1083
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,160
And that's not even it's full stop.

1084
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,160
It's not even you're moving kind of slow.

1085
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,920
My memory is full stop.

1086
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,600
And at that point, I'm like, fuck, I need my glasses for this.

1087
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:09,320
And I'm trying with the harness down to like fish my glasses out of my pocket

1088
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,320
and put them on quickly and take them off before the ride.

1089
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,680
And I get off the ride.

1090
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,160
It's over like within, you know, a minute and a half because it's a high speed thing.

1091
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,840
And I step off it and I think I text him.

1092
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,320
I'm like, I can't talk about this ride in the podcast.

1093
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,160
I don't think it's good.

1094
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,560
I also really have no idea what I just witnessed.

1095
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,840
This is fascinating to me because felt really janky.

1096
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,280
What I'm interested in about is the stopping, because if it's stopped,

1097
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,000
like what I from what I understand, which is surprisingly very little

1098
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,120
about roller coasters are doing this show for five years.

1099
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,560
But what I understand, like when I Tony Baxter talked about trying to redo

1100
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,720
Big Thunder out here because he was disappointed in the third part of it,

1101
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,160
the third act of it, because it doesn't go as fast.

1102
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,720
There's the second part of Big Thunder where you're kind of going around.

1103
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,480
That curve is the most exciting.

1104
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,040
And but he was saying like, there's really no way because of physics

1105
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,440
to get that last chunk going faster.

1106
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,600
So they put in special effects at the end with like the TNT and stuff

1107
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,360
to make something feel like it's kind of a climax.

1108
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,280
But he said, like, you'd have to rebuild the track.

1109
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,240
There'd be no way.

1110
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,000
So I'm very confused by this.

1111
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,560
Did they add in like some sort of mechanics or mechanics that thing like

1112
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,440
you're because you're on Hagrid's when you're doing the coaster.

1113
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,280
It's many times you kind of stop and then there's these things you go through

1114
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:24,000
that kind of ramp you up like you're in Mario Kart and you hit one of those.

1115
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:24,680
You know what?

1116
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,880
Little light up spots.

1117
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:26,840
That's what it felt like.

1118
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,800
Because certainly after the first screen stop, the ride never got as fast again.

1119
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,360
Right. Because I could I couldn't.

1120
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,040
I feel like it could. Yeah, it couldn't.

1121
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,920
Because Rock and Rollercoaster, I think is a pretty simple

1122
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,640
mechanism where it's like you are launched and old.

1123
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,800
You're like shot out of a cannon.

1124
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,640
You just zoom momentum carries you the way the ride.

1125
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,880
And then you break sharply at the end.

1126
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,480
But yeah, Hagrid's or other more modern coasters.

1127
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:55,400
There's little launches along the way to account for show scene.

1128
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,160
I will say this.

1129
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,320
The show building itself looked nice.

1130
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:03,600
I think walking around the Avengers campus in Paris, it looks good to a certain degree.

1131
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:07,640
The walk around quality of it is perhaps better than Anaheim.

1132
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,080
I was impressed on that level.

1133
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,360
It's this ride.

1134
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,160
It's Spider-Man, which I did not feel the need to go on again.

1135
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,080
And then they have two different restaurants, one of which I believe

1136
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,080
is called Tony Stark's Pizza and Pasta Factory, which I found very funny.

1137
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,360
That's very funny. Yeah, very funny.

1138
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,440
It serves little pasta in a cup and there's a Hulkbuster.

1139
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,480
And then there was a there was a Pym's kitchen. OK.

1140
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,480
And they they did really good show scenes.

1141
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,920
They have a similar sort of catwalk thing.

1142
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,360
But I think the buildings look more distinct there.

1143
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,960
I think it feels less like just a military base.

1144
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,040
It feels a little more sci-fi.

1145
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,160
And the show scenes I saw were really good.

1146
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,680
Avengers was the only thing I like wait online for for a little bit.

1147
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,720
But the single writer queue was outside of the building.

1148
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,280
I think that's where I fucked up.

1149
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,040
So you did miss.

1150
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,800
I would miss something maybe.

1151
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:00,920
But they did a good I saw Black Widow, Spider-Man and Black Panther

1152
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,640
fight taskmaster.

1153
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,440
And it was fun.

1154
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,160
It was a good like 10 plus minute routine.

1155
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,680
Wow. Wow. They are similar like a show that walks kind of.

1156
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,760
The Dormelage came out.

1157
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,040
They did a sort of ceremonial like thing.

1158
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,720
All of that was good.

1159
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,360
But this Avengers ride is like the building itself looks good.

1160
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,960
The ride is kind of incomprehensible.

1161
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,200
And I will say because of the stopping and starting, it made me feel pretty nauseous.

1162
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,040
There was something very disorienting about just the like

1163
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,400
you're done. You're at a screen.

1164
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,520
You're so overstimulated that it's hard to even focus on the screen,

1165
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,600
especially if you only speak one and two languages that are being used

1166
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,760
by characters on screen and your glasses are in your pocket.

1167
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,560
They tell you to take your glasses off.

1168
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,360
Yeah. Where does that leave it when you have captions and that's.

1169
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:50,360
Oh, yeah. I always say since I was a teenager, I've carried a glasses case with.

1170
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:54,400
Now I carry two glasses case with me, one for glasses, one for sunglasses.

1171
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,280
I mean, this is my but that is a pain in the ass.

1172
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,160
Yes. Yeah.

1173
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:00,520
My advice to anyone going on this ride is either a leave your glasses on.

1174
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,600
I don't think they're going to fall off your face, OK,

1175
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,080
especially if you're like wearing a face mask like I was the second I stepped off

1176
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,320
the ride, I was like, I could have fucking looped.

1177
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,240
Oh, yeah. Your things around the glasses as extra protection.

1178
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,280
I would have been fine. Right.

1179
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,800
But otherwise, if you really want to cover your ass, get fucking like prescription

1180
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,520
sports goggles, because otherwise this ride is nothing.

1181
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,920
Which is a tall order to go on one roller coaster.

1182
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,400
But otherwise not worth going on.

1183
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,840
Wow. Yeah. Geez.

1184
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,600
Not a good by the way, decide and know the name of it even.

1185
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,440
It's called Avengers Assemble Flight Force.

1186
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,560
Yeah. Just a very six flags.

1187
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:37,200
That's right. And by the way, you only get two members from my memory.

1188
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,800
It's just Iron Man and Captain Marvel.

1189
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,440
It's the two. That's what I was going to say.

1190
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,560
I don't think they use that catchphrase when it's just like, hey,

1191
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,080
it's the day shift and the swing shift.

1192
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:49,080
So whoever's taking over at night shift, get them up to speed.

1193
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,160
You know, wait a minute.

1194
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:55,000
I'm on there's not an official Wikipedia page for this ride, which is.

1195
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,640
I'm giving people proprietary information.

1196
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,360
This is not like, yeah, yeah, we have.

1197
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,600
I have never heard any of this.

1198
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,920
There is a full episode.

1199
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,280
It's we've less to say than Frank Marshall, but it does.

1200
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,320
Well, of course, obviously. Yeah.

1201
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,320
We measure these correctly.

1202
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,640
Did you look up any like YouTube

1203
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,760
ride throughs or any like anyone strapped to go?

1204
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,880
I didn't. Are there good ones on?

1205
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,160
I looked. Yeah, there's OK ones.

1206
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,280
But it's hard to tell.

1207
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,240
The other thing is, like for most of the ride, you're just in like a dark

1208
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,280
show building and you're just moving really fast.

1209
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:28,320
And so I really illuminate like there's not a lot there other than the screens.

1210
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,200
Can I read something off of I was saying there's not a Wikipedia,

1211
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,720
but there is a Disney dot fandom dot com.

1212
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:38,440
OK, someone explains here is why in a ride called Avengers assemble.

1213
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,720
Yeah, very few Avengers assembled in the queue.

1214
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,360
Iron Man tries to

1215
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:48,240
Iron Man tries to ask Ant-Man, Rocket Raccoon, Captain America

1216
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:52,320
and Miss Marvel for help, but can't get their help as they're busy

1217
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,640
in Ant-Man and the Wasp Nano battle at Hong Kong Disneyland

1218
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,880
and Guardians of the Galaxy mission breakout at California Adventure

1219
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,160
and Avengers Avengers Quantum Encounter on board the Disney Wish.

1220
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,600
Yes, they can't.

1221
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:08,960
It's an original experience on the newest cruise ship now.

1222
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,240
They're busy. I can't. I'm busy on a cruise.

1223
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,440
Is that the one where Ant-Man is in Thanos's butt or something?

1224
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,520
He talks about that he pitched the butt thing.

1225
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:24,480
Paul Rudd in the video on the cruise ship acknowledges the fan joke about

1226
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:29,080
Ant-Man could have stopped Thanos by getting tiny going up his butt and expanding.

1227
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,640
And he starts explaining it on the cruise and Wasp says,

1228
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,600
we can't talk about this.

1229
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,800
Oh, it's a little this was like this was a running joke.

1230
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,600
And then they kind of go up to the.

1231
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,880
OK, interesting. Whoa.

1232
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,520
Is fucking exhausting.

1233
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,760
You're telling me I cannot track the narratives of your Marvel attractions

1234
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,480
unless I'm crossing multiple continents going on boats.

1235
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,880
You have to now speak French, English and Chinese.

1236
00:56:54,920 --> 00:57:00,880
Unless you're fucking putting me on a boat that goes from Paris to Shanghai

1237
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,160
and you know, people are going to see those three things in the correct order.

1238
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,000
This is actually they're pulling from the comics,

1239
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,040
because like if something is heading towards Earth and the X-Men need help,

1240
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:17,000
they will make calls and they're like, sorry, we're busy in the quantum realm.

1241
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,640
The Fantastic Four is busy.

1242
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,080
The Avengers are busy. Yeah.

1243
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:23,800
So it is interesting to see this applied because they they did

1244
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,960
introduce all the Avengers campuses as like unique.

1245
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,120
The these are happening here and these are happening.

1246
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:33,480
What Jason's saying, and I may agree with him, is that I like it.

1247
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,840
This is the rest of our text.

1248
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,480
You like that there you don't.

1249
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,280
Here's wait a minute.

1250
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,640
Here's what I don't like.

1251
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,200
OK, you go ahead. Google first.

1252
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:43,800
You're all.

1253
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,160
Reminds me, the fights are healthy.

1254
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,200
This is all healthy.

1255
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,280
Your whole goddamn thing about Rise of the Resistance.

1256
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,320
It's not all my friends.

1257
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,560
It's not the characters and where is that?

1258
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:56,080
Now there is a ride where we called the other guys.

1259
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,200
They're busy and you're like, I like it.

1260
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,760
Well, they had something to do.

1261
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:01,880
Hold on.

1262
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,880
I think Darth Vader had something to do in Rise of the Resistance.

1263
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,400
He's busy being dead.

1264
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,280
Explain.

1265
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,240
Well, we know that the dead speed.

1266
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,000
Well, you got me there.

1267
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,320
If there was a ride, though, where Darth Vader was in Hong Kong,

1268
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,720
I would at least take some solace in that.

1269
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,360
I would say, OK, that comforts me.

1270
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,920
You like that the rides are in conversation with each other.

1271
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,200
I do like the rise in conversation.

1272
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,920
Here's what I'll say also, though,

1273
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,480
there's plenty other superheroes that he should be calling.

1274
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:33,040
He has a best friend, War Machine, that could be there.

1275
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:33,960
Like he's not.

1276
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,200
Yeah, there are other heroes that are not represented on the other rides

1277
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,880
who could at least flesh out a small Avengers team.

1278
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:44,160
I don't think it needs to be like the classic cinematic Avengers team.

1279
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,960
Like, I don't think this ride is failing because it's not.

1280
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,000
You can't call it Avengers with two of them.

1281
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,840
But I think you can just pick a grab bag selection.

1282
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,840
Four. Give us four.

1283
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,160
You need I'd say five.

1284
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,360
I think five is the minimum.

1285
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:58,800
Five is fine. What about what if Happy Hogan was involved?

1286
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,760
What if Jon Favreau's Happy Hogan was there?

1287
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:01,840
Do you count him?

1288
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,040
I think he should be prominent in the pre-ride.

1289
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:08,360
I agree. On the ride itself, I want five characters with costumes

1290
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,440
and or powers. Yeah.

1291
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,920
And if you're limiting it to they're flying there in space.

1292
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,360
Fine. We can pick five of those.

1293
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,840
They exist. Yeah, I agree.

1294
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:21,000
So what the room is group thought here is that as long

1295
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,040
per Griffin's wish, we need three more heroes.

1296
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:29,040
But and with that, everybody being busy, we can't help is good.

1297
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,920
Well, Jason, do you agree with me?

1298
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,120
I kind of like the joke of some of them are busy as long as we're replacing them

1299
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,400
with anyone. Yes.

1300
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,960
Two is just not enough.

1301
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:38,760
I can agree with you.

1302
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,800
We agree with communication.

1303
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,360
We agree with that.

1304
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,720
We communicate. We're communicating.

1305
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,680
OK, to Scott's point,

1306
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,680
like in comic books, the continuity very quickly falls apart

1307
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,880
because the Dora Milaje are also in Anaheim.

1308
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,720
And Ant-Man is also walking around

1309
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,840
in a high with like, oh, look, I got a little.

1310
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:02,240
And this is the galaxy's edge problem where it's like you're

1311
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:07,160
tying yourself up in knots, trying to make this universe work.

1312
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:11,120
Rather than just doing the thing that would be the most fun at any moment.

1313
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:15,400
You should work backwards from what do we want this to be?

1314
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,320
Let's figure out logic to get you to that instead of like,

1315
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:21,400
now we've taken things off the table because of the logic.

1316
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,920
Fucking for theme park nerds in a garage right now.

1317
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:29,560
And we're saying we would prefer if you cared less about how much

1318
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,800
we're tracking the internal logic of these things.

1319
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,760
Basically, right? Yes.

1320
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,640
Absolutely. We don't really care because we like things

1321
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:39,280
where it's just everybody and you don't know why.

1322
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:43,760
It's a fun bonus if also you have those magical little connections or whatever.

1323
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:47,040
If things are shaking hands, there's there's a way to do it.

1324
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,280
Like if he calls Spider-Man, it's like,

1325
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:51,840
I'm over at the web.

1326
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:54,440
Or man, what could he what could that kid have going?

1327
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:58,760
And you just hear the chaos from the Spider-Man ride going on.

1328
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,040
He goes, you know what? Never mind.

1329
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,200
And it's right next door. That would be great.

1330
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,200
But I'm sorry, I was misremembering.

1331
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:07,600
It is that I didn't because I did.

1332
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,400
I want to bring this up, because I do think this is important.

1333
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:15,440
Disneyland Paris has a priority access thing that is expensive.

1334
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,040
It is a variable price.

1335
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,960
Sacrebleu. I know.

1336
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:24,320
But unlike all the genie and fast pass systems of the last couple of years,

1337
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,160
the thing works pretty fucking perfectly.

1338
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,280
Wow. Sure. Wow.

1339
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:33,520
Only two rides I think it didn't work for were Avengers.

1340
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,200
Where you did Single Rider.

1341
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:39,680
I did Single Rider and maybe Peter Pan were the only two.

1342
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,120
But basically you get this app.

1343
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,880
You don't have to reserve any times you add it onto your ticket.

1344
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:49,080
The price varies based on how far in advance you get it.

1345
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,840
How busy the day is and all these things. Right.

1346
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,400
But it's one set price for whatever day you book.

1347
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,360
And then you get this extra QR code on your phone.

1348
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:02,040
And if you go to the entrance of any ride, there is a priority access thing.

1349
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,040
You scan the QR code. They go right this way.

1350
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,160
You're on the right within three minutes.

1351
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,520
You don't have to schedule anything. Really? Yeah.

1352
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,960
It works like a charm.

1353
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:14,760
Yes. Similar to the Express Passage Universal Orlando.

1354
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:18,560
It's exactly it's exactly it is so simple. Unlimited rides.

1355
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,440
You can do every ride one time.

1356
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,800
OK. The only thing it does not allow you to do, which I think is fair,

1357
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,800
is priority pass twice for the same attraction.

1358
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,800
OK. But otherwise,

1359
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,760
do as many rides until your heart's content.

1360
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,760
This is interesting. It's expensive.

1361
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,960
Yeah. But it works.

1362
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,360
It does. As opposed to like. Right.

1363
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:43,080
I mean, I just to say, I don't have to be said this on the show.

1364
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,520
I've seen, I've seen tweets about it and I experienced that.

1365
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,320
Honda mentioned holiday the last time I went that you do the you

1366
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:54,000
you pay for priority and then you end up in a line

1367
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,080
that goes all the way back to the lightning lanes.

1368
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,640
There's a lot of that where it's horrible.

1369
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,320
Somebody just said that posted on social media like lightning lane.

1370
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,360
You pay like twenty dollars for the cars ride

1371
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,400
and then it stretches back to the cone, the cozy cones.

1372
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,280
And you're like, well, wait a minute.

1373
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,280
What am I paying for?

1374
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,120
Man, the only thing you need to book times for is restaurants.

1375
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:17,160
OK. Whatever the Blue Bayou equivalent is and the Remy's restaurant

1376
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,800
are like the two that are maybe harder to get a table.

1377
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:23,000
Is there a way it somehow didn't come up on the doorways?

1378
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,360
I think I think it is blue by you there.

1379
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,120
It's got a different name. OK.

1380
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,920
It does have a different name, but it's a very similar setup

1381
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,760
and looks like a fairly blue by you.

1382
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:32,680
I grew up by you.

1383
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:36,800
Yes. But Avengers was one of the only things I had to wait in line

1384
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:40,440
that having been said, their single rider line happens

1385
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,760
around the outside of the building, essentially,

1386
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,720
and is basically the equivalent of the fucking Spider-Man Q here

1387
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:50,400
in Anaheim, where you're like, nothing, nothing for me.

1388
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:54,080
Yeah. Meanwhile, I think everyone else is watching this fucking video.

1389
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,320
I was misremembering.

1390
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,800
I was like, did I not see it because I did the priority thing?

1391
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,160
No, they fucked me for being a single rider.

1392
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,640
I still waited for 40 minutes.

1393
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,400
It was the longest I waited for anything.

1394
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:06,120
It was basically the only ride I didn't walk straight on.

1395
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,200
I got to watch this good show scene because being on the outside

1396
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,440
of the building, at least I could see the catwalk.

1397
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,880
But without that, I missed this bit of all the other characters saying, I'm busy.

1398
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,760
You had to be here and find it out later. Yeah. Yeah.

1399
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,520
Yeah. I mean, this happens with stuff when they like retrofit

1400
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:27,440
attractions or retrofit buildings where it's like, are we going in the old

1401
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:31,880
fire exit or this used to be the regular out of the ride?

1402
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:36,600
It felt like we were in a line that was used as a passageway for cast members.

1403
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,720
For 40 minutes. Interesting. Yeah.

1404
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:43,400
And they get away with it with this idea that it's a campus and it's industrial

1405
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:47,440
and backstage feeling, which, by the way, is the entire park. Right.

1406
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:51,200
I don't mean to take you away from Marvel if there's more about Marvel,

1407
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,640
but that is like you have not been to this studios Paris Park,

1408
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,040
which I over the years have been very hard on. Yes.

1409
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:00,120
I like I would say justifiably so. OK. Yeah. All right.

1410
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:03,560
This is something I wanted to check with you of like, am I crazy or too harsh on

1411
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:06,240
something that I don't doesn't currently, why does it seem to agree on?

1412
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,320
I think they're making an effort. I think it's getting better.

1413
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:11,720
I think especially if they go forward with Galaxy's Edge and Arendelle,

1414
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:14,400
it's like more than they're not doing Galaxy's Edge.

1415
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:17,520
Definitely. I've heard I could be wrong as well.

1416
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,280
But is it a settled matter?

1417
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:22,200
Well, I don't think it'll ever be a settled thing. Sure.

1418
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,280
You know what I mean? Like they'll never say, no, we're not doing it.

1419
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:27,040
We're just like 20 years from now. They'll be like, it'll be obvious.

1420
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:31,360
They very much need two more things of that size and importance.

1421
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:36,160
Yeah, because I like Ratatouille, but that's not it is not a like,

1422
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,200
well, that made my day.

1423
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,520
No. And look, the area is nice.

1424
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:46,120
The Ratatouille restaurant there is really cool because as opposed to an Epcot

1425
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:48,480
where they sort of the what is it? Three chefs.

1426
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,480
The chef's to France. Yes. Yeah.

1427
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,640
Right. Because the rides right there, the new now that they've added

1428
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:59,280
the Ratatouille ride to Orlando, they've sort of made that area

1429
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,040
feel a little more like Gusteau's.

1430
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:04,040
OK, it's still just a French restaurant in Epcot.

1431
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:08,040
Yeah. As the restaurant in Disneyland, Paris next to the Remy ride

1432
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:12,480
looks like the restaurant that Remy at the end of Rattouille, if you guys remember.

1433
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:16,760
Yeah. Yes. Ratatouille, Remy himself has bought.

1434
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:20,280
He now co-owns a restaurant with Linguini and Antoni Go.

1435
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,640
The critics spoilers for Ratatouille.

1436
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:23,840
I guess fine.

1437
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:27,120
And he is able to cook the meals with a little staircase up to the pots. Right.

1438
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:31,240
You've spoiled that they the Remy was not killed and didn't have been a trap.

1439
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:34,320
Human restaurant, human restaurant being served plates.

1440
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,600
And then there's a little rat staircase.

1441
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:39,440
And you see that up in the rafters, there's a rat restaurant.

1442
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,520
And this restaurant also serves rats.

1443
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,720
He's got smaller portions. His rat family is there.

1444
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:46,000
They finally accepted his art.

1445
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,960
And they have their own facsimile of a fancy French restaurant.

1446
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:53,560
But with rat size things, the tables are made out of buttons and thimbles

1447
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:54,760
and whatever. And it's very cute.

1448
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,520
The restaurant there is like that.

1449
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:59,600
It's the rat size restaurant, which is really nice because it keeps you

1450
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,920
in the headspace of the ride where it's like you were shrunk down.

1451
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,800
You were small. Oh, is that right?

1452
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,400
I didn't go in there or eat.

1453
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,400
Did you eat there? I couldn't get a reservation.

1454
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,520
I walked through it, but I think the food is good.

1455
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,080
They got an extensive wine menu.

1456
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:14,200
They got a lot of options and it looks great.

1457
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,760
The theming is great, but it's a corner. Sure.

1458
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,560
The Toy Story land sucks ass.

1459
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,320
You weren't here for months.

1460
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:25,200
And I went out, Scott, I'm such a fucking slut for Toy Story.

1461
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,800
There is no way it disappoints me.

1462
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:29,080
And you're like, it's small. It's unimpressive.

1463
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:30,800
It's all not Disney World.

1464
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:34,640
You said I'm like all pretty much off the cart rides. Yeah.

1465
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:37,440
It's like an RC racer that goes like in a little

1466
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,480
little up and down back and forth.

1467
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,200
I have never been this disappointed to see my best friends.

1468
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,800
I was like, even if I don't go on these rides to just walk around it

1469
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,800
for a little bit, I will be happy.

1470
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,680
I did not bother going on one of the rides.

1471
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:52,880
I was so disappointed.

1472
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:53,840
Exactly what they are.

1473
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:56,680
There's not even going to be the quiet charm of like, of course,

1474
01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:00,160
it's an off the shelf, but you get to hear something John Ratzenberger did.

1475
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,760
Or whatever. It's like shitty, poorly rethemed carnival rides

1476
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,520
with Toy Story characters.

1477
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,200
It is not very visually compelling.

1478
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,000
It is even built out to the same degree as like Toy Story land.

1479
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,600
I don't think it's even my memory.

1480
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:14,880
I was I breezed through it, but it didn't seem to me like even a Bugsland.

1481
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:18,040
No, like you might call if you're cynical, you might say Bugsland

1482
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,440
was all off the shelf stuff and who cares bulldoze it.

1483
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,800
But now I've caught people were kind of I was kind of charmed by Bugsland.

1484
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:24,840
Yeah, in a way.

1485
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:30,040
So it's not a small area with three very tiny rides, all condensed into a very

1486
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,640
is forky there at all.

1487
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:36,320
Not at all, because I was thinking maybe this would have saved it a little.

1488
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,840
And there was

1489
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:43,320
there was a lot of forky merch for he does continue to seem to be a big mover

1490
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,240
on the merch side of the parks. OK.

1491
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,000
I bought a little forky keychain.

1492
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,480
Thank God for that.

1493
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,960
Truly good. You got hit. God for that.

1494
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,320
But there was no forky.

1495
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:56,440
It felt like nothing from for period.

1496
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:59,640
There was a big buzz statue that spoke dialogue.

1497
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,280
It would flip back and forth between Tim Allen,

1498
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:06,640
the man who they so rudely took the part away from.

1499
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:09,200
He will never get paid to be Buzz Lightyear ever again,

1500
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,360
other than the 10 times a year he does.

1501
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:15,600
And if they decide to do it for some reason, probably well,

1502
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,520
have not said they won't never stop getting paid to be Buzz Lightyear.

1503
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,920
They cut him out of one movie and it's the movie that no one likes.

1504
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:24,040
Buzz Lightyear, by the way, on the Disney Plus menu.

1505
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:28,920
And maybe it's just my recommendations really far on the recommended

1506
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:32,440
like really the more down the new one.

1507
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:34,920
Yeah. Oh, that's another thing.

1508
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:40,080
In France, I believe that movie is called Le Claire.

1509
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,120
What Le Claire like L apostrophe, a Claire, E.

1510
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,640
Claire, like an E. Claire, Le Claire.

1511
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,480
What does that mean? I don't know.

1512
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,960
What? Oh, I don't like I.

1513
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,800
I feel like that's not his name.

1514
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,800
Like I feel like I've heard them say like Buzz Lightyear.

1515
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,240
You hear French people go like Buzz Lightyear.

1516
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,520
They just like adopt.

1517
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,320
They just jam English word.

1518
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:05,360
But I walked by the poster and I saw like the French version of the letter

1519
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,200
March and it was L apostrophe.

1520
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,280
I believe E.C. L.A. I.R.

1521
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:13,040
I am pretty curious what the entomology of Le Claire is and why.

1522
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:14,360
But there was there was that.

1523
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:17,120
There was like two fixed statues of Mr.

1524
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:20,240
Mrs. Potato Head holding an Etch A Sketch.

1525
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,720
You would see families walk up to him and be like, oh, cool.

1526
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,480
Does the screen change? It doesn't.

1527
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,800
They would stand there for 45 seconds and go like, oh, it's just the one image.

1528
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,080
And then it's this three.

1529
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:33,600
The the army men thing is a little drop thing.

1530
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:36,400
Perish or drop. But like a

1531
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,120
a local traveling carnival size drop.

1532
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,360
Yeah. Yeah. The RC is that thing where it's like a U.

1533
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:46,720
Yeah, that's not all the way up to one side, all the way back the other side.

1534
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:47,840
You're in a big RC.

1535
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,560
That at least looks a little cool. Yeah.

1536
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:53,080
And then the Slinky Dog thing is like, quote unquote, a roller coaster.

1537
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:56,960
And it's basically a perfect circle and it just moves continuously in one.

1538
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,520
It's not the Disney World.

1539
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,680
No, I have the answer for what Le Claire is.

1540
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:03,640
OK, yeah. Le Claire means the lightning flash.

1541
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:09,520
And the reason I have a Wikipedia open and Le Claire is an opera comey.

1542
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,400
Hmm. Oh, comic opera.

1543
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:15,960
But I believe the light year movie is called Le Claire.

1544
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,040
Well, let's take a look.

1545
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:21,280
Like, does light year not exist as a term and did they have to go lateral to Le Claire?

1546
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:26,200
He's Buzz Lightning Strike or Lightning Flash Lightning Flies Buzz Lightning Flash.

1547
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:27,880
That's a good question. I don't know.

1548
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:30,160
I kind of like it. Le Claire.

1549
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,720
Mother falls to the floor.

1550
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:34,640
Something says Buzz Le Claire.

1551
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,360
I see multiple YouTube's that just say Buzz Le Claire.

1552
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,640
So maybe his name is Buzz Le Claire.

1553
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:42,240
That poster just said Le Claire. I think.

1554
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,160
So, yeah, because it's called light year. Yes.

1555
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,880
It's not called Buzz Lightyear.

1556
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,640
That's why because the movies call light year.

1557
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,320
So I guess it would be called Le Claire.

1558
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,680
Wild. Yeah. Wow.

1559
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:53,640
Why has he always been Le Claire in 1995?

1560
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:56,320
Was he Le Claire? Yeah, right.

1561
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:59,200
There's fandom Buzz Le Claire right here. Yeah.

1562
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,080
So I guess it is.

1563
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:04,200
I'll say I was such a obviously Toy Story obsessed kid.

1564
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:08,000
And my mother being French so badly wanted me to become fluent in French

1565
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:11,680
that at one point she noticed how many times I was watching Toy Story and VHS

1566
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,840
and that I could mouth the words along with it.

1567
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:19,520
And she had a friend in France in port, a VHS of Toy Story dubbed in French.

1568
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:23,120
But we've had to find someone to transfer the tape because it was pal

1569
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,520
to VHS format. Wow.

1570
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,880
And then put it in the VCR and looked at me and said, now speak along with the movie.

1571
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,200
Wow, really? Yeah.

1572
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,080
I'm making my mom sound very much like Mike talking about the

1573
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:35,600
Marshall Gate thing.

1574
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,160
But no, no, no, no, it didn't work that way.

1575
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,320
But she was like, maybe I can get him to watch this movie

1576
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,480
and speak along with it over and over again.

1577
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,360
And one day, suddenly, he will know every word in French.

1578
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,920
Geez, that's right. How much did it pay off? Not at all.

1579
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,440
OK, I mean, look, good theory makes sense.

1580
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,680
Therapists have spent years trying to unlock why I can't learn French.

1581
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:56,400
But I don't remember the character ever being named Le Claire.

1582
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,600
And I've watched that movie in French.

1583
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,320
You know that part, at least.

1584
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:00,800
Yeah, that's really strange.

1585
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,160
But the new one is certainly called it.

1586
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:06,320
There's something that I that I'm dying to know about.

1587
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,880
And I want to make sure we don't get too deep without it coming up.

1588
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:12,240
It was even mentioned as possibly the main topic of the episode.

1589
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:17,120
Yes, that is the well, you know, I'd like you to say the name of the food that you.

1590
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:20,360
Yeah, absolutely. So Dix are oriented to run through the rest of

1591
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,080
Hollywood Park, Hollywood Studios Park.

1592
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:25,680
Yeah, I did crush his coaster, which you had not done before.

1593
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:28,720
You said you were curious for me to go on because. Yeah, yeah.

1594
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:30,680
I didn't get to do it. Yeah, the line was just not.

1595
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:31,840
It's pretty simple, but it's fun.

1596
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,240
It's like an indoor roller coaster.

1597
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,560
And the big thing is that you're in a crushed turtle shell

1598
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,560
and it spins around the whole time.

1599
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:40,960
So it's it's always chaotic and different because you're. Yeah.

1600
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:44,520
It's like it's supposed to be like when the turtles are on the East

1601
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,080
Australian Current, there's a lot of blue lights.

1602
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:49,160
They play the Thomas Newman score.

1603
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,400
It's fun. It's a simple.

1604
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,880
It's a simple little thing, but it's fun.

1605
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:54,680
That very much seems to be one of those popular rides there. Yeah.

1606
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:58,280
And I heard that line is like kind of torture.

1607
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,080
Not much to see.

1608
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,600
So it kind of deflates an hour plus.

1609
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:06,680
That was one where I was very happy that I had the priority access. Yeah.

1610
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:11,560
Then I'm trying to think of what else is even there of note?

1611
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,440
Well, well, there's cars road trip.

1612
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,240
Well, this is what I'm saying. Yeah, I'm sorry.

1613
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:18,600
I just want to make sure there was nothing else

1614
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,480
I was forgetting before I get to this.

1615
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,920
Oh, there's the Tower of Terror, which is exactly the same.

1616
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,880
It's the it's the California Adventure one that we don't have.

1617
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:26,760
It's exactly the same.

1618
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,240
Yeah, right. There were no differences.

1619
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:29,960
It's the least remarkable at this point.

1620
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:33,400
I still enjoy that ride, but there was there were no differences of any kind.

1621
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,320
And that's that's still tower tower.

1622
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,720
They haven't flipped it to guardians.

1623
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,040
No, it's still Tower of Terror.

1624
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,440
I think those are all they tried.

1625
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,720
There's there's a cars thing that's like bumper cars

1626
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,080
in a different part of the park.

1627
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:47,400
Like the two cars, things are spread out far from each other.

1628
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,560
Oh, I hadn't thought about that. Oh, yeah.

1629
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:52,320
From the start of Route 66 to the end of Route 60.

1630
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,680
It's like there's a run

1631
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:58,040
that in order goes like crushes coaster, whatever the cars,

1632
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:59,720
bumper cars thing is called.

1633
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,480
Then you walk through a little tunnel.

1634
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:04,760
And then I believe it's Toy Story land and then Ratatouille.

1635
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:09,360
And then if you walk further, take a long walk in that direction,

1636
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:13,480
you get Cars Road Trip, which is the single worst attraction

1637
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,760
in any Disney park I've ever witnessed.

1638
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:17,480
I listen to your episode.

1639
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,880
Oh, yes. This here's a second gate to fill you in on.

1640
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,920
Also, we discussed this on the second.

1641
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,920
This is this remodded ride.

1642
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:27,320
It was there. Pretty pathetic.

1643
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:32,720
Tram tour, a tram tour of locations that have never been used in a movie.

1644
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,560
They recreated the set of flown.

1645
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:39,520
Rain of Fire was not filmed in this Parisian field ever filmed there.

1646
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:40,720
Yeah, yeah.

1647
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:44,680
I just found it notable because of the Matthew McConnaght talking about

1648
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:46,600
eating ash, the dragon.

1649
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,280
I learned that in that movie.

1650
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:50,760
So if you go to the second gate, if you want to hear our thoughts about

1651
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,760
a movie where dragons are eating ash.

1652
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:56,560
Watching YouTube videos of this ride, you had not gone on it.

1653
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:00,840
No, I didn't even do the tram to we were so kind of dying to get out of that park.

1654
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,720
We're like, we know what this tour is going to be.

1655
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:03,160
Let's not.

1656
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,480
We had gone on and told you firsthand that it was bad.

1657
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:07,560
Or did she just give the tip off of watching videos?

1658
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,160
I think she went on it.

1659
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,040
I remember. Yeah, I did.

1660
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,080
But I listen to that episode.

1661
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:14,360
That episode was a lot of fun.

1662
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,760
The whole eating ash tangent was great.

1663
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:18,920
And you said, obviously, don't go on cars.

1664
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:22,200
And I was like, God, don't tell me what to do.

1665
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,200
I'm going to go to cars.

1666
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,560
I listen to that episode. I had a great time.

1667
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,920
Another fight. Why wouldn't I go?

1668
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,040
No, no, no. We're communicating.

1669
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:28,760
We're communicating.

1670
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,840
But also, I was like, I have priority pass.

1671
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,040
Right. I paid for this.

1672
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,080
Fuck. Yeah, it's not going to be a big worry. Right.

1673
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:35,240
And you're there for you.

1674
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:37,320
Like you're partially there for trash.

1675
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,960
Yes. And this is the part of this. I'll say.

1676
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,280
So my brother was like, I'll come to Disney with you.

1677
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,160
But my brother has never been a theme park guy.

1678
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,760
Anytime we went when I was a kid with family,

1679
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,080
he after like four hours and be like, can we get out of here?

1680
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,080
And it was always this tension between us where I'd be like,

1681
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,560
I want to be here from opening to closing.

1682
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:53,440
Uh huh. Yeah. Yeah.

1683
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,520
And he'd be like, here's my bandwidth.

1684
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:57,520
Yeah. That was his case as a child.

1685
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:00,200
And as he has grown up, he has become less and less of a theme park guy.

1686
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:03,200
Which we were doing kind of an advice run.

1687
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:06,920
And I was I was trying to figure out which park you go to.

1688
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,440
And I was basically saying,

1689
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:11,960
I'm going to pay for the priority thing because I think he'll stay longer

1690
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:15,120
if he doesn't have to wait on any rides, any lines for any rides.

1691
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:18,080
And I was like, I should do one park in the morning before he shows up.

1692
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:19,880
He has work in the morning.

1693
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,760
He has to go to training.

1694
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,640
And then like their gym was close to Disneyland Paris.

1695
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,400
And he was like, I'll meet you in the afternoon.

1696
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:30,640
So it's the question of, do I do studios first or Disneyland proper first?

1697
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,080
And I didn't know the answer either.

1698
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,160
It was something we had to talk about it.

1699
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:34,880
More thorough.

1700
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,400
I don't think he cares about going on the Marvel shit.

1701
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,280
Like I was like, the ride to his rides, the only ride

1702
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,560
it feels like he would maybe enjoy it.

1703
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,920
Studios. I'll just knock that out in the morning.

1704
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,160
So I was like, I might as well do pretty much everything here.

1705
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,280
Yeah. So I got through everything pretty quickly and I was like,

1706
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,280
let me go do this car's thing.

1707
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,560
Walking up, there is a food truck.

1708
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:57,960
Yeah. That sells an item called the Croc McQueen.

1709
01:17:59,480 --> 01:17:59,880
I enjoyed it.

1710
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,200
I'm glad you said it, because I think I would have been more like croak.

1711
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:03,480
But correct me.

1712
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:04,240
Croak.

1713
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:07,960
Mm hmm. I texted you and I said, this might be the episode.

1714
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:14,040
Well, now that we're in it, if we're doing a mini croak, McQueen,

1715
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,880
I've said, what are we dealing with here?

1716
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:17,200
I go up, I see this thing.

1717
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,960
I'm so charmed by it.

1718
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,120
The truck is not open.

1719
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:25,600
Great. No, no, much like all these parks post covid.

1720
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,600
Some things just have not reopened.

1721
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:33,640
But also I was there in December 2014 and so many restaurants.

1722
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:34,040
That's what I'm saying.

1723
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:37,760
They had a what maybe the closest equivalent a park has ever had

1724
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,680
as far as I can tell of like a pea, an actual pizza planet.

1725
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:40,880
Yeah.

1726
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,040
We're like, well, we got to go in there.

1727
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:43,000
Closed, gone.

1728
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,000
So many of some of the food options that sounded kind of neat.

1729
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:46,200
Yeah.

1730
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:47,040
On wanted.

1731
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,720
And like there's always been a Toy Story gift shop closed.

1732
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,120
And I'm like, it's Toy Story merch.

1733
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:55,400
Yeah, that's what you fucking doing.

1734
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:59,160
Want some toys of the toys, the most one to one toys there are.

1735
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:04,320
And this the cars on the road road trip thing is so far out

1736
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:07,000
because you have to think about like if you've been to Universal Studios,

1737
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,840
Hollywood, the tram tour has to be like a completely separate area.

1738
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,680
The loading from everything else, because it's like,

1739
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,920
and now we're going to take you around a circuitous path

1740
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,840
far away from where the rest of this park is.

1741
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:20,160
It would massive vehicle trains of four cars in a row.

1742
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:23,600
So you're walking so far to this abandoned area where there's nothing on the way there.

1743
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:26,040
And then I see this food truck croak McQueen.

1744
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:27,480
I'm laughing. I'm smiling.

1745
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,160
I'm trying. I want one.

1746
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:30,880
I'm hungry. It's closed.

1747
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,400
And I'm like, I want this.

1748
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,720
I now don't want to eat anything else.

1749
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:39,840
I've walked by other food stands, but I will be disappointed if I eat anything else.

1750
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,520
Will this reopen later?

1751
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:43,760
May I come back later?

1752
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,120
And I'm like, let me just do this fucking cars right now.

1753
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:47,360
I could just walk on it. Right.

1754
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,560
So I walk on it. You're hungry and mad.

1755
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:50,960
Yes. To start. Yes.

1756
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,040
I go. The ride is it is a tram tour.

1757
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,200
The vehicles have not been changed.

1758
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,400
They have not put Pixar eyes or mouths on them.

1759
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,920
You are getting onto a tram.

1760
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:00,120
It looks like a backlog tour tram.

1761
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:03,200
You're going to see alive cars with eyes.

1762
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:04,680
But you aren't in.

1763
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:08,040
And remember, in the Cars universe, all vehicles have eyes.

1764
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,680
But we are in the one vehicle in the entire car.

1765
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,640
No personality. You get in this thing.

1766
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,840
There's a video like we're talking about.

1767
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,040
I'm in the court.

1768
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:19,880
Yes. That's the only.

1769
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:21,000
We've removed the eyes.

1770
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,160
It's like Swiss Army man.

1771
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:24,240
You're riding a dead body.

1772
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:27,040
A farting rand. Yes.

1773
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:28,520
You get on this thing.

1774
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:32,360
There's a video screen that is Cruz Ramirez and Sally Carrera,

1775
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,720
I believe, is her name, the Bonnie Haunt character.

1776
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:34,680
But she's speaking in French.

1777
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:36,560
Cruz Ramirez is speaking in English.

1778
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:40,720
OK. And you're hearing them respond to things that the other person said

1779
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:43,800
in a different language. The other car, excuse me.

1780
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,560
But basically, this road trips could be a lot of fun.

1781
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:46,760
We're going to see some real sites.

1782
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:48,360
They're like hyping this up.

1783
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:51,840
And I'm like, look, you know, I have been told what this ride is.

1784
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:53,600
This is a converted tram.

1785
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:57,880
We are adding fake roadside attractions in the universe of cars.

1786
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:00,080
I will find this pleasant.

1787
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,280
I will find this pleasant.

1788
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:02,880
I love the universal tram tour.

1789
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,600
This does not need to be anything fancy.

1790
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,400
I understand this was a cheap rush job.

1791
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,600
That's fine. You ride through.

1792
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:11,440
They're like, look there. It's the biggest lug nut.

1793
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,280
You ride through a little further.

1794
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,160
Wow, that's a huge wrench.

1795
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:18,120
Then you go to these are not animated items.

1796
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,840
Static. Yes, they're just big things.

1797
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,040
As I remember, the wrench is pretty isolated.

1798
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:25,360
There is a static Lightning McQueen inside the lug nut, I believe.

1799
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,520
But the wrench is just on its own.

1800
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,240
There's a lot of just barren landscape.

1801
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:31,080
Just nothing.

1802
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:32,920
They're playing this video and they're playing this music.

1803
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:35,360
And then you pull up to the catastrophe Canyon Point. Right.

1804
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:38,880
Oh, and this is part of it that it's a it's a very universal tour type,

1805
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,520
something where there's going to be disaster and fake rain and explosions.

1806
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:43,760
And that was left over.

1807
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,120
And it kind of looks like the red rocks of cars.

1808
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:50,360
So maybe we can mod that that might fold in directly to a car.

1809
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,920
So they put like an 18 wheeler truck there.

1810
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,760
I guess it's supposed to be like a gas truck.

1811
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:55,920
And it's there.

1812
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:59,000
And they're setting it up in French and they're like, oh, no, he's in trouble.

1813
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,200
I think we need to help him or whatever. Right.

1814
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:04,080
And it just felt like there was a lot of silence.

1815
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,800
And then the area shook for a little bit.

1816
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:11,400
And then like a water tower spilled over and a bunch of water poured out.

1817
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:13,640
And it's the thing where everyone in the tram goes like, oh, no,

1818
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:15,960
am I going to get wet? And it does. And it comes up just short. Right.

1819
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,080
I was like, that's a weird beat.

1820
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:21,520
And then I went back and listened to the episode and looked at the footage

1821
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,960
that you guys were talking about. He's supposed to be on fire.

1822
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,200
He's supposed to be in flames.

1823
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:29,280
The entire point is that the water is putting out the flames

1824
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:31,120
and the fire wasn't fucking working.

1825
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:35,640
So you just watch a truck sit calmly in the middle of some rocks

1826
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:37,920
and then water just pours on him.

1827
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:41,160
We try to get natural gas in Europe these days.

1828
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,720
It's got off the supply chain.

1829
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,720
Yeah. Fire.

1830
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:47,800
No fire. Anywhere. Not him on fire.

1831
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:49,960
Not any. Wow. Not a lick of fire.

1832
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,840
They move on to the next point. It's made.

1833
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,520
He's like, look, I mean, I've towered the branches or whatever.

1834
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,600
End of ride. Wow.

1835
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,480
She's with that.

1836
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:02,680
It's been possibly worse than our assumption, having not gone on

1837
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:06,800
like three minutes total for a ride that moves very slowly.

1838
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:10,480
Is this a candidate for worst existing worse?

1839
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:14,880
How about maybe worst Disney ride on the worst Disney attraction

1840
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,000
I have ever experienced?

1841
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,320
Wow. Things that I've experienced that are worse than this

1842
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,800
are at parks that do not have the budget.

1843
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,840
I would cut them a little slack.

1844
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:27,120
Yes. Like I went on the fucking terrible dark night coaster

1845
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:31,360
at Six Flags, Great Adventure, New Jersey, and you just you feel bad for them.

1846
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:33,640
That's terrible.

1847
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:35,720
But you're like, well, what could they do? Yeah.

1848
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,120
Yeah. There was no option.

1849
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:40,080
Even if the budget was this thin,

1850
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,320
put up some fucking cardboard cutouts or something.

1851
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,600
Most of the time, you're just driving by grass.

1852
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:48,200
Yeah. Yeah. Like open fields from the video. Yeah.

1853
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,760
Yeah. And the one thing you got to do is make this thing on fire.

1854
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,600
So then I leave this area, the truck still isn't open.

1855
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,960
I'm going to go on four more fucking rides and then have to walk back

1856
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:59,920
to this area to hope the crockman's your truck is open.

1857
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,120
Go back. I do the remaining rides. I come back.

1858
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:03,880
The truck is open. I wait online for a while.

1859
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,320
I'm like, this better be fucking good.

1860
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:09,400
It's basically they got like a panini press with Lightning McQueen's face on it.

1861
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,840
And it's a circular ham and cheese sandwich

1862
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:18,000
that they press on and Lightning McQueen's face is like toasted into it.

1863
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:19,080
I like that.

1864
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:21,640
I might want to consider this for the episode artwork.

1865
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,600
We should make sure we get eyes on it.

1866
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,560
It seems like one of the primary things we need to visualize about your show.

1867
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:29,040
Charming. And you're like, this is what this truck sells.

1868
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:32,680
Croc McQueen, baby bell cheese.

1869
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,680
OK, soda.

1870
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:37,760
I believe that is the entire menu. Wow.

1871
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,520
And I just got I got a Fanta.

1872
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:42,320
Wow. European. Yes.

1873
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:46,280
And I ate this crock McQueen and I felt so happy.

1874
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,520
It was like all the anger dissipated out my body.

1875
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,880
It was so simple. It cost like.

1876
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:53,800
Six euros. It was a pretty cheap considering.

1877
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,720
You're at a theme park eating a sandwich. Yeah.

1878
01:24:56,720 --> 01:25:00,000
And a lot of my complaints from going were food oriented,

1879
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,120
and it would have gone a long way if there was like this isn't gourmet great food,

1880
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:07,880
but it's a good little like the good the swarm and Avengers like.

1881
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:11,480
So that's amazing if they that honestly is a huge boost to the park.

1882
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:15,200
If there's like one charming, cheap food item, that's the last thing I did in studios

1883
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:17,960
and at least left me on a bit of a high note. Wow.

1884
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:22,040
You pulled it out at park and it wasn't a good thing.

1885
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,880
It was exactly like because you accidentally I don't know if you just noticed,

1886
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:27,040
you accidentally said the name of the French sandwich.

1887
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,280
It's based on the croque monsieur. Yes.

1888
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:32,560
So is it is it was it exactly the same makeup as like this?

1889
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,400
It's a ham and cheese.

1890
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:37,880
It's kind of a simplified version of it, but it is it is.

1891
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,680
And it's that's clever. That's funny. It is funny.

1892
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:43,120
I agree. It's the way it looked and it tasted good.

1893
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:47,120
The kind of like burnt black depiction of Lightning McQueen.

1894
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,160
Yeah, it's got a nice crunch to it.

1895
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,360
The cheese was really melty. It was like good.

1896
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:54,440
If I had waited online.

1897
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:56,760
Having to go back for the second time when the truck was open

1898
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:59,840
and then it tasted bad and I was like, why do I fucking eat a bit

1899
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,760
rather than something I would have enjoyed?

1900
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,040
I would have been twice as angry.

1901
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:06,360
But instead, I was like that really hit the spot. Wow. Wow.

1902
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:11,080
I also it is so clearly in photos like Lightning McQueen,

1903
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:14,440
which when we were talking about this, I was like, oh, here's the test.

1904
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:18,040
Show it to my two and a half year old who is obsessed with Lightning McQueen.

1905
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:19,640
Showed him a picture of that sandwich.

1906
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:24,480
And sure enough, Queen, one of the things he says, which I love to hear.

1907
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:25,800
So it communicated.

1908
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:28,120
And you show him a picture sometimes of Brian May as well.

1909
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:29,280
And he says that.

1910
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:31,280
Oh, we.

1911
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:34,840
But this is a good point is like I'm staying at the truck.

1912
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,040
I see the poster with the preview image.

1913
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,880
I'm like, is there any way the sandwich comes out looking that good?

1914
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,760
Am I going to get this thing?

1915
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,000
And the and the print is kind of blurry.

1916
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:46,520
And fudgy. And it looks like nothing.

1917
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:47,760
Clean, crisp image.

1918
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,720
Wow. Wow. I love it.

1919
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:51,400
Hard to find. Lines. Printing.

1920
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:52,560
I would love one right now.

1921
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,120
So I'm salivating.

1922
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:56,120
They should sell them here and they shouldn't change the name.

1923
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,760
How much does this make?

1924
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:00,080
How much does this make you want to get there, Jason?

1925
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:02,080
I feel like I'm watching your enthusiasm.

1926
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:04,520
Shoot. I am.

1927
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:08,680
Look, I'm not one too often set a pile of money on fire,

1928
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:12,920
but I've allocated two days for Disneyland Paris of my adventure trip.

1929
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:14,000
Well, they will.

1930
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:14,560
Are you?

1931
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:20,480
Oh, this is a catastrophic, catastrophic, catastrophic, catastrophic.

1932
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:24,760
I'm telling you, I'm telling you, a the commute to and from there

1933
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:27,600
from any part in Paris proper is pretty quick.

1934
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:30,400
Sheep and. But that actually is more of an argument for him to go there

1935
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:31,560
because that's going to exhaust him.

1936
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:32,880
Get into it. I hate that.

1937
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:33,920
I hate the travel.

1938
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:36,800
I need that two days to really spread out and relax.

1939
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:40,560
Even days. I think a better use of money would be one day.

1940
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:44,760
Both parks pay the priority access, get a hotel room there.

1941
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,560
OK, take the train back the next morning.

1942
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,560
You do not want to pay two admission days.

1943
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:52,720
I opened the Disney and I wonder if that would cost out basically to the same thing.

1944
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:54,600
Yeah, maybe. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1945
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:55,400
Probably. Yeah.

1946
01:27:55,400 --> 01:28:00,480
The Disney Paris website, by the way, is like really pushing

1947
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:04,160
like right at the top of the home page, that Hotel New York, the art of Marvel.

1948
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:07,960
I mean, I was tempted by I just think it's so funny that they're like

1949
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:10,280
the first Marvel hotel. That's the big bragging point.

1950
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:11,520
It's the first Marvel hotel.

1951
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,200
The theming is New York.

1952
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:15,800
It is a fake New York, you know, where some of the Avengers lived.

1953
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:17,880
It's such a like cake.

1954
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:19,080
It's a very it's one of those.

1955
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:23,040
I think it's that Michael Graves, I think, is the architect

1956
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:26,560
who built the dwarves building that's near where we're recording.

1957
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:31,600
And it's so it's you can't they have to change every color on that thing

1958
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:36,280
to make it not the most 1992 building, which I let now.

1959
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:38,520
That makes me I loved walking around that place.

1960
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:41,440
But I think if you're if you want current Marvel vibe,

1961
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:45,680
I have to spend a lot more money to get it fully all the way there.

1962
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:50,400
Well, and to the phrase art of Marvel, to me means something.

1963
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:54,120
I don't know what it means to the Disney Corporation, because, yes,

1964
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:57,960
to me, it means decades and decades of like hardworking artists.

1965
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:59,560
You want to be in a Ditko suite.

1966
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:01,120
That's what you're imagining.

1967
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:05,240
It's like, is this MCU concept art around the MCU?

1968
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:09,840
It might maybe a little pop party like some Ditko or Kirby panels

1969
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,480
that they blow enough and pop art.

1970
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:12,160
Here's what you want.

1971
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:16,280
You want to be in the Leifeld room with Cable and his pockets and his big guns.

1972
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:20,680
Yes. You support it somehow by the strangest feet you've ever seen.

1973
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:25,000
The Rob Lyle pockets, you won't want the bed to look like one of Cable's.

1974
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:27,240
Pouches, one of his pouches.

1975
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:27,960
Yeah. Yeah.

1976
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,680
You want to button yourself in that.

1977
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:31,520
Climbing a Deadpool pouch.

1978
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,640
Yellow. It's an off color joke.

1979
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:34,880
Yeah. Right.

1980
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,280
So that's the art of Marvel.

1981
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:40,480
Yeah. Let's let's actually play out the day's argument a little bit.

1982
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:42,200
I think there's maybe a version.

1983
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:45,640
Well, I think you're right about like if you now you've you've done it.

1984
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:47,440
We did like too many.

1985
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:51,640
We thought we knowing ourselves and knowing that we like hanging out at Disney hotels.

1986
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,040
We blocked out a whole night.

1987
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,360
It's like we will get in.

1988
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:57,160
We will go around this weird their city walk and we'll go.

1989
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:59,360
Well, like hotel bar hop, essentially.

1990
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,480
And and we were that night war on us really quick.

1991
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:06,840
We did get a full day out of the Disneyland Park proper there.

1992
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:09,760
And then it was essentially like a morning at

1993
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:12,360
at studios.

1994
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:14,120
I was tired at the end of the day.

1995
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:16,480
It was like a little like I'm on a train.

1996
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:18,280
I wish I was back in bed right now.

1997
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:21,120
You know, it was like an hour and 15 minutes.

1998
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,200
I wish I could have gotten back. Right.

1999
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:27,160
Maybe an hour and a half. Yeah.

2000
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:30,240
The appeal of at the end of the night, we're going to be tired.

2001
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:32,360
We'd love to just settle in. That's fine.

2002
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,640
Sure. You've done a whole episode in the Disney village.

2003
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:36,080
There's not a ton to do there.

2004
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:40,440
No, limited appeal to hotels just to be able to like take that train on a good night's rest.

2005
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,760
I think that makes sense.

2006
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:43,760
That is fine.

2007
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:48,320
But I'll say like my my brother wasn't sure which day he was going to be available.

2008
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:51,600
So we had to book the tickets late and the priority access late.

2009
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:54,920
And I think if you're actually planning this trip out in advance,

2010
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:59,720
both are significantly cheaper and you can get on literally if you want to.

2011
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:04,400
You could get on every single attraction in both parks with time to spare.

2012
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:08,360
Well, you got the one day and go back into the city and stay in the city.

2013
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:09,240
If you want to.

2014
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:12,400
What I'd recommend to Jason, if you want to have a more relaxing time,

2015
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:14,280
is I would get priority access.

2016
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:17,480
I would do everything and then say to hotel that night and take the train back the next day.

2017
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:18,520
Here's what I'd recommend.

2018
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:20,600
He cuts in town to half days.

2019
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:21,240
He gets in town.

2020
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:23,760
He takes two days at the hotel to relax from the train.

2021
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:28,440
Watch the French king of Queens.

2022
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:32,680
Which is a full season of French King and King of Queens.

2023
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:35,320
He does three days for both parks.

2024
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:38,360
Yeah. Then he takes two more days at the hotel to relax from that.

2025
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:42,200
Then he heads back, but only halfway back on the train.

2026
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:45,000
He stops halfway at a different hotel.

2027
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:48,400
I don't know what town it is halfway between Paris and the parks.

2028
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:52,080
Orly is the town, I think, that that the park is in.

2029
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,680
ORLY, I believe.

2030
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:54,840
Yeah. OK.

2031
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:57,040
It's funny that when it's not funny, but it's cute.

2032
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:58,880
When you're on the train, you're looking at the stops.

2033
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:01,720
There's sort of that map showing like the stops ahead.

2034
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:03,800
Orly has a little Mickey.

2035
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,160
Oh, that's nice.

2036
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:06,800
Oh, that's great. That's cute.

2037
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,320
Yeah. Do you think you're going to Paris or Tokyo first?

2038
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:12,720
I don't know. I'm still speaking.

2039
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,480
That was purely hypothetical.

2040
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:16,440
The I also always want to.

2041
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:21,200
What I would say to parrot what Griffin said, doing Paris before

2042
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:23,680
Tokyo would be catastrophic.

2043
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,960
You have to go to Japan.

2044
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,160
You should go to Paris.

2045
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:28,480
I've always wanted to see the city of lights.

2046
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:32,840
You will enjoy the city is one of the greatest movie going cities in the world.

2047
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:33,960
You have the finest food.

2048
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:36,400
It's people talk about the food of Paris and whatever.

2049
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:39,000
The thing I think is under discussed, the thing that is so impressed

2050
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,280
about the food in Paris is that you can go to any place on a corner.

2051
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:44,600
And the quality is surprising. Right. Right.

2052
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,520
It's not about the fancy restaurants. Yeah.

2053
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:49,600
It's that they're like bras and cafes that are the equivalent

2054
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,080
of like greasy spoon diners.

2055
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:55,280
You can order a steak and it costs $15 and it's good. Yeah. Yes.

2056
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:58,040
And you have a glass of wine and you're like, this is the life. Yeah.

2057
01:32:58,040 --> 01:33:00,920
There's neighborhoods full of repertory movie theaters

2058
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:03,400
where they're just doing marathons all day of all the movies

2059
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:05,200
you wish you could see on a big screen.

2060
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:08,200
And you just sit there with a bunch of other film nerds and it's fucking great.

2061
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:11,400
That's great. You should spend one day at Disney.

2062
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:13,600
Yeah, I would agree. You're right.

2063
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:17,040
I'm discounted because our time in Paris proper was amazing.

2064
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:18,160
And it will. True.

2065
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:22,480
I can't imagine not then doing the Disneyland part and going like we've

2066
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,320
I've lost Paris time because we're here.

2067
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:29,080
I can wake up in a hotel there and recover and then take the train

2068
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:32,840
and then enjoy another full day in Paris. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2069
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:35,080
I think that's my strongest advice.

2070
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:37,680
I think if you're if you're if you're evaluating like what are trips

2071
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:39,720
I want to do in my life, that makes all the sense in the world

2072
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:41,080
and going anywhere else in Europe.

2073
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:44,280
But if you're going purely if your theme park motivated, it's got it.

2074
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:46,880
It's Japan. Like, yeah, that wasn't percent.

2075
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:50,400
I think Europe, too, I would consider it's like, well, I'm on the continent.

2076
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:54,800
Should I like trek to Efteling or Gardaland or something like, you know what I mean?

2077
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:56,520
A little. Yeah, yeah, totally.

2078
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:58,680
OK, so at this point, I jump parks.

2079
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:01,080
I jump over to Disneyland proper.

2080
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,680
My brother is meeting me now.

2081
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:06,000
There's this area. I start sending you guys a lot of photos

2082
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,400
because I'm waiting for my brother to meet me.

2083
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:10,720
And I'm very charmed by this area, the sort of main street,

2084
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:16,920
little plaza entrance area near where the train station is, is outfitted with

2085
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:21,400
so many ghost sculptures. Right. Right.

2086
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,160
Still Halloween season. Right.

2087
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:26,320
Yes, I'm there mid-October, I believe.

2088
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:29,200
They got these funny ghosts.

2089
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:30,640
They are full body statues.

2090
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:33,840
They are not characters that exist anywhere in the Disney library.

2091
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,880
And they're doing little scenes.

2092
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:39,040
Oh, great. There's like a ghost playing baseball, a different ghost

2093
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:41,280
pitching in the ball and he's swinging the bat.

2094
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:44,040
Oh, man. There's like a ghost caricature artist

2095
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:46,360
taking doing a caricature of a ghost couple.

2096
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,560
Wow. They're like fancy.

2097
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:50,800
There's a ghost. There's a dentist office facade.

2098
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:54,400
And there's a ghost who, like, like he's from a baby Huey cartoon,

2099
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,720
has like a bandaged around his head.

2100
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:57,880
Oh, man.

2101
01:34:57,880 --> 01:34:59,880
What did this guy do to me?

2102
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:02,920
And I just text me, you guys, and I go huge Sheridan energy

2103
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:05,760
from all of these ghosts.

2104
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:08,720
I could imagine Jason's voice coming out of any and all of them.

2105
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:10,600
They feel like characters he would create.

2106
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:12,440
They feel like his best friends.

2107
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:15,840
They feel like they are the cast of a show that only Jason has heard of

2108
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:17,840
from 60 years ago.

2109
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:19,800
But they seemingly don't exist out of the five.

2110
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:20,920
Just this holiday season.

2111
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:23,080
And they're just nice little ghost towns people.

2112
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:24,320
They are charming.

2113
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:26,400
I'm immediately in a better mood here.

2114
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:27,720
Yeah. Great. Disneyland.

2115
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:29,880
I like. Great. I've never heard of these ghosts.

2116
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:31,240
This sounds one fun. Yeah.

2117
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:34,360
Fun. And so many of I was like, oh, a couple of ghosts at the entrance.

2118
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:36,000
Can tell my brother like meet me by the ghost.

2119
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,840
And I started exploring around. I'm like, there are like 60 ghosts.

2120
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,800
They're like spread out. That's great.

2121
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:43,240
And they're unique.

2122
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:46,040
And they each got a little story to tell you. Wow.

2123
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:49,120
This is very similar to there's a lot of little egg

2124
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:52,720
hijinks in the Easter season in Japan.

2125
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:56,840
Like and also where everyone is distinct in their little clothing.

2126
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:59,720
And these ones are golfing, you know.

2127
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:01,040
So I they should do.

2128
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:03,200
Why are they not doing this stuff everywhere?

2129
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:05,000
I will. I took many photos.

2130
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,760
I will. I will send them so they can be posted on the social channels

2131
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:09,040
when this episode comes out.

2132
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:11,560
I need people understand the photos I'm sharing represent

2133
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,880
maximum 10 percent of the ghosts.

2134
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:15,680
Wow. Wow. Cool. Cool.

2135
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:16,840
Awesome. Yeah.

2136
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:19,720
I could I could spend the entire day just capturing these ghosts.

2137
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:22,040
Hey, yeah. Yeah, we get that.

2138
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:22,880
I can assure you.

2139
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:25,560
If you go around Halloween, you might need that extra day to get the ghost.

2140
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:26,800
To get the ghost. Yeah.

2141
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:30,560
What a what a massive departure from your the first park.

2142
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:31,440
He went to that day.

2143
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,320
Just like theming. Yeah. Yeah.

2144
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:36,120
Yeah. And unique proprietary. Yeah.

2145
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:37,560
Who are these guys? Yeah.

2146
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:40,360
Some Parisian engineer going like, hear me out on this.

2147
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:44,320
Right. Right. Cast of ghouls.

2148
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:45,840
So now we hear we got it. Yeah.

2149
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:49,880
Wonderful. Now my brother's in tow and I'm like, I got to be very strategic

2150
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:52,600
about what I put him on. Oh, boy. OK. OK. Right.

2151
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:56,360
So I'm like, let's prioritize Phantom.

2152
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:01,280
Yeah. And in a manner, and some manner, their equivalent, their haunted mansion,

2153
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:05,760
which has a lot of similarities, but like it's not a fully different ride

2154
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:08,920
than I mentioned, but a ton is is different.

2155
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:13,160
And it's like generally like the Western vibe of it.

2156
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:16,160
So you had said to me, that's really good and it's different.

2157
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:19,960
And I was expecting theme park nerd different where it's like, oh, yeah.

2158
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:22,840
You pick up on the slight this order and this and that.

2159
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,680
There's like a whole final act of the thing that is

2160
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:28,600
unlike anything. Yeah.

2161
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:30,360
Oh, the town. Right.

2162
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:33,560
Go to like an underground Western ghost town.

2163
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:36,480
Yeah. And it has like its own characters.

2164
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:38,960
Yeah. Yeah. And it's like, oh, sorry.

2165
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,600
I was going to leave the mansion. You leave the end of it.

2166
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,080
This is during the pandemic.

2167
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:45,760
We were like, let's watch it because I'd never seen it before.

2168
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:47,200
So we watched on YouTube.

2169
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:50,880
And it was still that's one that like being there will still fully.

2170
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:54,240
You'll look. But even just when you start to go down

2171
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:56,160
and you're underneath the house and you're leaving the mansion,

2172
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:58,280
whatever, you're like, this feels so different.

2173
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:01,640
The other thing we should mention, the pre ride audio,

2174
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,760
when you're going through the queue and everything, I turn my brother.

2175
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:09,440
I'm like, that's a really good Vincent Price impression they got doing this audio.

2176
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:11,160
And then I look into it.

2177
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:14,600
It is audio that Vincent Price recorded

2178
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:21,160
for the opening, I believe, in the 90s, when he was pretty close to death.

2179
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:25,480
Yeah. Yeah. And when the park was opening itself and they decided not to use it.

2180
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:28,000
And it was like sitting on a hard drive for a long time.

2181
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:30,400
And they like remastered Institute five years ago.

2182
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:34,840
And you're like, I'm listening to the final unheard Vincent Price performance.

2183
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:38,640
Now, I love Thorolz Ravencroft, but it's pretty fucking cool

2184
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:42,160
to hear Vincent Price get you ready to go on a haunted mansion. Right.

2185
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:45,840
Oh, yeah. Yes. And I believe like, oh, wait, does he

2186
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:49,520
does he take kind of the spot where where would be ghost host?

2187
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:51,880
Is that what you're OK? OK. Yeah. Yeah.

2188
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,480
Everything up until boarding the Dune buggy.

2189
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:57,920
Yeah. I think for a long time and probably when I went on it,

2190
01:38:58,160 --> 01:39:01,560
there was the stray element that remained was a laugh.

2191
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:04,200
I think there was a laugh from Vincent Price that was still in there.

2192
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:07,560
So it was just a little kind of like, oh, do you know that's Vincent?

2193
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:08,680
But like, what a cool.

2194
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:12,400
And then I think they put it back in maybe 17 or 18.

2195
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:15,720
And it's the thing where it's it's once again, it's two voices.

2196
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:18,560
It's alternating between a French guy and a Vincent Price.

2197
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:20,680
But there's a lot of Vincent Price.

2198
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:23,120
And you get on the thing and the plane, a lot of the hits.

2199
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:27,160
You got the singing boss, you got the ballroom, you got Leota and whatever.

2200
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:28,800
And then it just fucking veers.

2201
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:29,880
And you're starting to see this guy.

2202
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:33,840
I don't know this guy's name, but it feels like he's the hatbox ghost.

2203
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:36,360
A Phantom Manor where you're like the Phantom.

2204
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:37,720
I think so.

2205
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:39,480
Yeah, he's so skeltonate.

2206
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:44,760
Yeah. And he's got like a little bit of like a like an old timey proprietor vibe.

2207
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:48,800
He's got a mischievous energy to him and he's showing up a little bit like

2208
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:54,160
it's a good version of like Jack Sparrow in the Pirates ride,

2209
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:55,840
where you're like, why is this guy keep on popping up?

2210
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:56,880
What's going on here?

2211
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:58,760
And then the ride feels like it's slowly saying like,

2212
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:01,160
he's going to fucking pull you into his own story.

2213
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:03,720
He's pulling you down to his old ghost town.

2214
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:07,680
Other thing that's cool, the house is like kind of like decrepit and rotting.

2215
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:10,200
There was that whole famous thing with Walt where he was like,

2216
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:14,120
I can't look bad. It's Disney. It has to look nice.

2217
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:15,680
Everything has to look nice.

2218
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:17,760
Make it like a beautiful, you know, right.

2219
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:18,480
New Orleans man.

2220
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:21,160
And they're like, this is like an old French romantic

2221
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:24,080
Gothic mansion that is crumbling.

2222
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:28,520
And then you're going into like ghost cowboy town and it fucking rolls.

2223
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:30,720
And I see my brother go like, that's pretty cool.

2224
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:34,520
The other thing I what I recall about my stride,

2225
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:37,760
I don't remember a lot of specifics and story,

2226
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:40,600
but I remembered like a full episode on this 15 years from now.

2227
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:42,280
You're done with the American. Yeah.

2228
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:46,560
We don't know the rules if they can go concurrently or if we have.

2229
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:49,640
Yeah, we don't know the rules. We've not decided that, but

2230
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:52,480
it'll be whatever is the most complicated, I'm sure.

2231
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:56,200
But what I strongly remember is just vibe and feel.

2232
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:59,960
And that like I'm not scared by the haunted mansion, probably because I've done

2233
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:04,560
it a zillion times, but I was like very uneasy in that.

2234
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:07,640
Yeah, it is like that you walk out with just a

2235
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:11,120
just a feeling in the chest for sure.

2236
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:12,960
They it's so affecting.

2237
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,000
So we do that.

2238
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:18,640
Then we go to Big Thunder, which I was like, this is the best Big Thunder.

2239
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:21,160
Yeah. And you didn't think that. Yeah, I did.

2240
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:22,440
And I couldn't remember.

2241
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:25,920
I think I texted you and I go like, that's much longer. Right.

2242
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:28,360
Yeah. It feels like a full minute longer.

2243
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:30,200
And they fixed the issues I was talking about.

2244
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:34,080
Yeah. But it does have the grand finale, which as I've talked about,

2245
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:36,720
I didn't get to do because that was my walk off.

2246
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:38,280
That was the greatest walk off of my life.

2247
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:42,800
Sure. While getting to go through like the big mountain pieces and the walk.

2248
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:47,200
The walk we had to take was so long because the ride is so long.

2249
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:49,200
And so to have to get all the way back to home base.

2250
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:50,280
So I had no regrets.

2251
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:53,360
But wait, why is it better at the end? Is it it's it's faster?

2252
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:55,680
It's it does end more intense.

2253
01:41:55,720 --> 01:41:57,200
That's what I that's what I've never been on it.

2254
01:41:57,200 --> 01:41:59,840
But that's what I believe is the situation where it does feel like you

2255
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:02,000
actually end on the like fastest, coolest part.

2256
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,280
Yeah, it like builds to a crescendo.

2257
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:06,960
And you're pretty like you're you're along the river.

2258
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:10,400
You're like you're like right next to Rivers of America for or what?

2259
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:11,000
I don't know what it's called.

2260
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,320
On an island. Right.

2261
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:13,880
It goes under the river.

2262
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:16,000
It is Tom Sawyer Island. Right.

2263
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,600
That's why I think they have more space for it,

2264
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:20,240
because it's on this sort of odd island to itself.

2265
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:21,680
You get these cool tunnels.

2266
01:42:21,680 --> 01:42:23,440
It's really good.

2267
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:27,000
We were the order of my trip was like all the bullshit

2268
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,320
was stacked for we did a lot.

2269
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:31,200
We had a lot of hijinks and like bad meals.

2270
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:33,200
And we didn't do studios first.

2271
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:36,200
But basically we ended up we were like we are down on the place.

2272
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:37,600
We are missing Paris.

2273
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:39,680
And it was not till the end of the day that we did

2274
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:42,520
what you just talked about, Phantom Manor and Big Thunder.

2275
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:46,920
And that all made me feel like, well, this this frontier land is a triumph.

2276
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:47,640
It's incredible.

2277
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:49,320
It's like I cross over to the second park.

2278
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:51,240
I'm charmed by these ghosts.

2279
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:56,760
And then I go on two French versions of American rides that are arguably superior.

2280
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:00,200
I wouldn't say Honda Mansion superior, but it is so interesting and is.

2281
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:02,440
Yeah, it has its own distinct value.

2282
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:03,800
And then Big Thunder is better.

2283
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:06,080
So I'm like, they're doing stuff here.

2284
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:07,320
Yeah. Yeah. Right.

2285
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:11,080
They're actually like this is there's there's some investment in this.

2286
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:12,720
There's some great deal right in 92.

2287
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:15,840
And of course, like the bones of it are incredible.

2288
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:19,360
It's I mean, it's the most it's Tony Baxter's full vision of

2289
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:23,880
I'm doing a magic kingdom and it shows and they can they can't like

2290
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:26,600
wash all that away even if they tried.

2291
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:31,120
And no matter how like janky the operations of it get or various aspects,

2292
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:32,920
it's it's it's backstory.

2293
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:34,960
No matter what we do.

2294
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:36,920
And my brother's really into that right now.

2295
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:38,720
I was like, I don't know if I get him on a single roller coaster.

2296
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:40,800
Seemed a little nervous about he had a fun time.

2297
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:45,320
Then we go on Indiana Jones, which is fine and absolutely suffers

2298
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:47,440
from being right next to Big Thunder.

2299
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:49,800
Oh, gee, they are next to each other.

2300
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:52,360
Yeah. And it's like this is kind of shitty or Big Thunder.

2301
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:55,840
Not a full not Indiana Jones Adventure.

2302
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:58,120
It's a coaster. It's the first coaster with a mine.

2303
01:43:58,360 --> 01:43:59,640
It doesn't coaster. Yes.

2304
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:02,600
Which the loop is kind of fun and surprising because my brother was like,

2305
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:03,880
does this loop? And I was like, it's Disney.

2306
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:05,400
Nothing loops.

2307
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:09,320
And then you you sure as hell do loop.

2308
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:12,600
And it's you're in like the mine cart from Temple of Doom.

2309
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:15,920
But it's not very well themed.

2310
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:19,480
It just feels like an outdoor coaster that's pretty small with one loop.

2311
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:20,960
You're in the thing. It's fine.

2312
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:23,920
It would if it was on a whole other side of the park, it was in studios.

2313
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:25,080
It would be fun.

2314
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:28,240
If you're on the order that we've been in, which is basically walking

2315
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:30,320
through the park forward from the entrance.

2316
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:32,160
Yeah. You're going to hit Big Thunder first.

2317
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:33,600
And that's a knockout. Right.

2318
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:38,720
Right. Then we do pirates, which basically registers to me is exactly the same.

2319
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:41,240
And I'm like, having a great time. This is going on.

2320
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:43,360
My brother's like, I'm going to tap out and feel nauseous.

2321
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,800
Whoa. You nauseous. Yeah, that's very fast.

2322
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:49,960
And I was like, well, we pretty much did the two things that are coasters.

2323
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:53,080
Everything we would do after this would be like a pretty slow story writing.

2324
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:55,200
He's like, yeah, I don't know, but pirates made me feel sick.

2325
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:57,680
Oh, geez. And I'm like, water smell.

2326
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:00,520
That's his bandwidth. He's like, it's I love my brother.

2327
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:03,440
But it's like I knew I wasn't going to get much out of him.

2328
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:04,720
Yeah, I got exactly that.

2329
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:08,320
But I do feel like three of the best rides he went on.

2330
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:10,600
That's great. And he was like, yeah, no, I get it.

2331
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:12,720
It's good. I understand why you like it. It's pretty cool.

2332
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:14,440
Glad he went. Yeah. Yeah.

2333
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:15,760
Yeah. I knew he had to work.

2334
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:19,360
You know, he had to do the traditional 10 hour French work week.

2335
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:20,560
You know.

2336
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:25,080
Yeah, he had to put in his daily 80 minutes.

2337
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:26,600
Yeah. Yeah.

2338
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:29,400
He said it's funny. He's like, I mean,

2339
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:33,320
I don't want to say too much, but like he is an American

2340
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:36,360
working for a French basketball team and a lot of his work he ends up doing

2341
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:40,440
is being the sort of conduit between American people and French people.

2342
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:44,800
And he's up against that thing where French people are like,

2343
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:48,280
it's lunch, the day is done.

2344
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:51,440
And American people on a different time zone who he's trying to negotiate with

2345
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:54,240
are like, we're sleeping 45 minutes a day.

2346
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:56,280
The rest of the time you are on call.

2347
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:57,760
Uh huh. Yeah.

2348
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:00,760
And it's like his office is like, got it figured out.

2349
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:04,320
And everyone he's calling is like, how dare you not pick up?

2350
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:07,560
Which he does. He's very good at his job.

2351
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:08,760
He seems very tired.

2352
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:10,880
He has to basically work on both coasts at the same time.

2353
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:13,520
Oh, wow. Yeah, geez. Fascinating work. Oh my God.

2354
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:16,080
Yes. Very, very fascinating.

2355
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:18,920
And going to games was the most I've ever cared about watching any sporting event

2356
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:21,760
because I was like, oh, now I have an emotional investment.

2357
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:24,000
I want my brother to keep having this job.

2358
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:26,760
I want to see this team win. Pretty good strong.

2359
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:29,000
Now I know who to root for. Yeah. Right.

2360
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:30,480
So he leaves.

2361
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:34,680
And then I think I just kind of being out most of the things that are

2362
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:37,200
basically the same, but fun.

2363
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:39,240
Yeah. C-Land's all pretty. Yeah.

2364
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:41,200
All well done, of course. Yeah. Oh, I'll say

2365
01:46:42,160 --> 01:46:47,680
Peter Pan doesn't do the track at the beginning that you go off of. Oh.

2366
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:53,120
It just starts and it's clearly visibly track above head.

2367
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:56,240
Oh, not like fake out on the bottom.

2368
01:46:56,240 --> 01:46:58,280
And the fake, that's my favorite part of the.

2369
01:46:58,280 --> 01:47:00,640
They lose the fake out. That was a bummer.

2370
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:02,520
Everything else was good.

2371
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:05,360
Small world closed for construction. OK.

2372
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:08,520
I don't think anything too special there as far as I recall.

2373
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:10,000
No, I go through the castle.

2374
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
The castle is beautiful. As you said, this beautiful time,

2375
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,400
it backs your castle. It's really the Sleeping Beauty Castle.

2376
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:18,320
And what's cool is it has like rooms.

2377
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:20,760
There's like an art gallery.

2378
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:22,040
There's like a boutique shop.

2379
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:25,480
There's more of the castle you can explore, explore internally.

2380
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:28,000
And the other thing I pitched as the only other thing I thought

2381
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,520
maybe was an episode, but it was pretty slight is underneath the castle.

2382
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:34,360
They have the Maleficent Dragon. Yeah.

2383
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:36,480
And it's a giant animatronic. Yeah.

2384
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,720
Sleeping there and angry that people are visiting it.

2385
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,120
And it's cool. It feels like a little hidden thing.

2386
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:42,280
It's not truly be kind.

2387
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:43,760
I know. Look for it. Sure.

2388
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:45,080
It's a beautiful time to try.

2389
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:47,880
It's like puffing and puffing and blowing smoke in that room.

2390
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:52,200
It's yes. It's small and cramped and creepy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2391
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:54,480
Yeah. You feel that steam. Yes.

2392
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:57,240
Yeah. Cool thing. Cool thing to put in a castle. Yeah.

2393
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:00,520
Best castle possibly.

2394
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:03,880
Arguably. I mean, I have not been to the Asian parks. Yeah.

2395
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,360
Tokyo is the same as Disney World.

2396
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:10,760
Yeah, I don't know enough about Shanghai.

2397
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:13,760
The Shanghai one is giant and really cool looking, but I don't know.

2398
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:17,240
Yeah. Hong Kong just got like doubled in size.

2399
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:18,440
Yeah, that could be cool.

2400
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:21,160
I wonder how that looks, though, because it looks a little chaotic.

2401
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:24,160
And also they have those beautiful green hills in the background.

2402
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:29,920
And so I think it is odd from my point of view to like obstruct the view.

2403
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:32,160
Because Tony, because it was the same castle as Disneyland,

2404
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:34,960
which was a Michael Eisner saving money thing.

2405
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:38,240
But like I've heard Tony Baxter talk about before this,

2406
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:42,880
like they talked about making the Disneyland Castle bigger, but it's too hard.

2407
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:45,760
Like he was like, it's hard because it's like a forced perspective

2408
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:48,920
and it's going to look odd in relation to the rest of the park.

2409
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:51,640
So I wonder how that one ended up looking when you're actually there.

2410
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:55,080
Yeah, it's just this castle feels fully built out.

2411
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:57,640
Like I'm sure there is a bit of forced perspective, but it's also

2412
01:48:57,640 --> 01:48:59,240
there's like a balcony observation.

2413
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:01,680
Like hills are like fake rolling hills.

2414
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:05,240
Yeah, I love all the yeah, those are like terraces of grass.

2415
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:06,760
Yeah, yeah. Possibly.

2416
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:09,600
We've never talked about how we do the castles.

2417
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:10,320
It's never good.

2418
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:10,920
Oh, good point. Yeah.

2419
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:12,920
So I have any ideas.

2420
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:14,200
Castle month. Yes.

2421
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:15,600
Yeah. OK.

2422
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:17,840
Or, you know, do we put them against each other?

2423
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:19,280
Is it a tournament?

2424
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:20,520
Castle battle? Yeah.

2425
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:22,520
Yeah. Yes. Castle battle has a nice ring to it.

2426
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:25,680
Listeners, if you have any ideas how you want us to cover the castles.

2427
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:28,280
I end the day with Discoveryland.

2428
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:30,920
Yeah. I was looking for a late night snack, perhaps.

2429
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:35,640
There was a food stand, a Star Wars food stand that sold

2430
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:37,720
Mustafar bites.

2431
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:39,400
Oh, speak of my language.

2432
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:42,720
That were essentially like jalapeno cheddar tots.

2433
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:44,800
Great. Were like blackened.

2434
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:50,040
It's good. Like like the burned parts of Anakin's body.

2435
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:51,880
I'll show you the picture. It looked fucking incredible.

2436
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:53,400
It was close.

2437
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:56,760
Oh, jeez. You got you lured us in our mouth.

2438
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:58,320
Oh, that's great. I know.

2439
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:02,280
I know. I clocked it like early when I got there waiting for my brother to show up.

2440
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:03,720
Like, oh, come back around and get that later.

2441
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:06,160
I want to end the night on Discoveryland and it closed early.

2442
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:10,200
They also sold desserts, which were like

2443
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:13,520
Star Wars, like waffles,

2444
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:18,680
like a Darth Vader stormtrooper and maybe Mando, like chocolate banana waffle.

2445
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:20,880
All right. They look cool. They look nice.

2446
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:22,720
I didn't get to eat any of this. I was kind of bummed out.

2447
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,520
God, so it would have been. Yeah.

2448
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:27,120
I did Buzz Lightyear. Is it actually the same? Yeah. Yeah.

2449
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:30,640
I did Star Tours.

2450
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:31,640
I got.

2451
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:36,320
Kashyyyk. Yeah, the Wookie planet, the Wookie planet.

2452
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:39,600
And the other one I got was one I hadn't got before and I can't remember.

2453
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:41,040
Newer new sequel trilogy.

2454
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:44,280
No, I got two prequel trilogy planets. That's what I'm trying to remember.

2455
01:50:44,280 --> 01:50:47,440
It was Naboo, Coruscant. Is it the Boba Fett?

2456
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:49,840
It was Naboo. It was Naboo. It was Naboo because we went underground.

2457
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:52,080
We saw under the water and we saw Jojo.

2458
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:53,600
We saw Jojo. Yeah. Yeah.

2459
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:55,760
So that was fun. Mitch would have been happy. Yep.

2460
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:58,520
Two prequel planets. No modern.

2461
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:00,360
Mitch would have been happy. He would have been thrilled.

2462
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:02,200
I was thinking of him the whole time. I wish he was here.

2463
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:04,000
Oh, if only Mitch. If only Mitch.

2464
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:08,640
And then I'd Hyperspace Mountain.

2465
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:10,440
Oh, that's what now I can't track.

2466
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:12,600
What is what? That is Hyperspace Mountain.

2467
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:17,600
Yeah, which is kind of a bummer because it's like show building is so fucking cool.

2468
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:19,760
The ride itself is so cool.

2469
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:21,520
Yeah. The verne of it all.

2470
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:24,240
The Jules Verne vibe is so cool.

2471
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:27,920
It does just feel like the Star Wars stuff is a little hat in the hat.

2472
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:32,720
Yeah, I did feel like it's kind of done more with laser lights than screens.

2473
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:34,960
And you have sort of like space battles happening around.

2474
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:36,280
Have you done the one out here?

2475
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:37,920
When it's like I have. OK.

2476
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:41,320
I don't know how similar it is, but it is one of those things where it's like

2477
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:43,240
that is a semi permanent overlay.

2478
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:45,480
I think it has been that for at least two or three years.

2479
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:47,240
Has it been that straight?

2480
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:48,880
They turn it on and off here all the time.

2481
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:51,520
I believe it has been straight this for two or three years.

2482
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:53,720
And they basically said it is this permanently.

2483
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:55,600
It's just a bit. That's a bummer. Yeah.

2484
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:57,880
Yeah. I kind of wish I could have just gone on the normal version of it.

2485
01:51:57,960 --> 01:52:01,880
Yeah, it is old enough now that I feel like

2486
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:07,440
they would people would be so excited if they restored it to the original.

2487
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:08,440
Yes. Version.

2488
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:11,640
Now there's a nostalgic clamoring for. Yes.

2489
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:13,080
Yeah. Yeah.

2490
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:14,680
At least it still looks that way.

2491
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:17,680
I'm like Discoveryland is so up my alley.

2492
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:21,280
I will just like longingly stare at photos of it.

2493
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:22,480
And you got to see it at night.

2494
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:24,800
Yes. Night five is fantastic.

2495
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:27,280
Little neon stripes. I love that land.

2496
01:52:28,040 --> 01:52:30,320
So now it's night parks closing.

2497
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:31,560
I think I'm most of our bites.

2498
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:35,480
I'm hungry. And I realize I think it's time for the main attraction.

2499
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:38,760
The thing I've been building up to all night, the most important part of this trip.

2500
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:43,240
Yep. The reason I need to go visit my brother before the end of this calendar

2501
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:47,440
year, because if I go any later, I miss the window of operation

2502
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:49,680
for planet Hollywood, Paris.

2503
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:53,120
Beautiful. It has arrived.

2504
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:54,760
It really truly is.

2505
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:58,200
It feels like the last classic planet Hollywood still in existence.

2506
01:52:58,200 --> 01:52:59,800
It's the last stupid looking.

2507
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:01,640
It's the last the last stucco.

2508
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:03,160
A giant globe.

2509
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:04,480
It's really stupid.

2510
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:07,720
The the the the Disney World one.

2511
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,240
Same idea, but just better done.

2512
01:53:10,240 --> 01:53:11,640
This looks like a miniature golf.

2513
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:13,000
It's like the planet Earth.

2514
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:16,000
And there's a there's a staircase going up to it

2515
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,080
with a tunnel around it that looks like a birth canal.

2516
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:20,920
Sure.

2517
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:24,280
And I do our Ant-Man going up.

2518
01:53:24,280 --> 01:53:26,440
Then you're getting ready to blow him up.

2519
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:31,640
And I walk up to this and I'm like, I know this thing is closing.

2520
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,360
People are astonished. It's still even open.

2521
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:36,960
Yeah. Is this going to be like decrepit and sad?

2522
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:39,520
That feeling when you go to a place that you know is about to close,

2523
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:42,120
you can't stop thinking about all the employees there who are about to lose

2524
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:45,320
their job and you see the business failing and you're like,

2525
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:47,720
I wish I'd been here in the halcyon days or whatever.

2526
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:50,320
And as I'm walking up to the entrance, I'm like,

2527
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:52,600
oh, the place looks dusty. It looks bad.

2528
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:54,680
Like the fucking memorabilia and stuff.

2529
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:56,920
And I walk up and I go, oh, no, it's Halloween decorations.

2530
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:58,960
It's fake cobwebs.

2531
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:02,960
But I was so worried about it looking depressing that I took the Halloween

2532
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:06,600
decorations at face value and I walk in and the place is fucking bumping.

2533
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:08,000
It is packed to the gills.

2534
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,200
Whoa. It is full of life. Really?

2535
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:14,400
I'm on like a weekday night at like eight or nine p.m.

2536
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:17,960
Do you think it's gathering steam because it's going away?

2537
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:20,000
Do you think people are like, we got to get in there?

2538
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:21,400
Well, I'll say this, too.

2539
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:24,480
The memorabilia collection, pretty fucking impressive, includes a lot of recent

2540
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:26,680
stuff. What do we got in there?

2541
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:29,440
So with my photos quickly, the thing I saw that I was very happy with

2542
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:32,800
immediately was they had Dolph Lundgren's He-Man sword from the Masters

2543
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:34,840
of the Universe movie. Oh, pretty.

2544
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:37,920
I was seated directly in between

2545
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,600
Dustin Hoffman's outbreak containment suit.

2546
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:44,760
Cool. Oh, great. And Val Kilmer's batarang.

2547
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:47,400
I mean, what else?

2548
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:50,920
At the entrance, full Tron costume.

2549
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:53,080
Yeah. Actual screen worn.

2550
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:57,280
There was a sign I saw that was like, I believe, like props on loan

2551
01:54:57,280 --> 01:54:58,720
from French Movie Museum.

2552
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:01,760
It feels like they got a good partnership going.

2553
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:05,080
So they're not pulling from the Earl collection of props.

2554
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:06,680
And it's not the rubber.

2555
01:55:06,680 --> 01:55:09,240
They did they because clearly they just cranked out all those

2556
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:11,520
demolition man.

2557
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:13,280
But of course, they had one of those.

2558
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:15,800
Oh, OK. Of course, they did.

2559
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:17,960
I got ahead of myself.

2560
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:21,120
But additionally, they also had some other stuff that looked like

2561
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:24,880
some things that there aren't just seventy five of apparently rotting away

2562
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:28,160
and like Australian goodwill's.

2563
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:30,240
Where was that found recently?

2564
01:55:30,240 --> 01:55:32,320
It was like some with some who was just founded.

2565
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:35,160
Yeah. Why is there a naked Stallone in this store?

2566
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:38,800
I'm trying to remember. I think it was in Australia.

2567
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,720
It was like, yeah, it was for sure.

2568
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:43,040
But I know and someone and they did.

2569
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:46,000
I asked what the price was like.

2570
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:50,360
And the answer, I believe, was five thousand dollars.

2571
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:55,800
So I don't know how much that would then cost to ship to America.

2572
01:55:56,760 --> 01:56:00,160
Well, look, you got to figure out getting animatronic trees out here.

2573
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:03,320
They figure out that shipping and then you can see rubber saloon

2574
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:06,240
or saying a bit of rubber saloon surrounded by cobwebs. Right.

2575
01:56:06,520 --> 01:56:08,640
They were really hard on the fake cobwebs.

2576
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:11,280
I'm trying to see what the other things were.

2577
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:12,120
Prop wise here that I'm.

2578
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:14,640
Do we have anything from a Frank Marshall film?

2579
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:16,000
Has to be right.

2580
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,960
I should have clocked it. The episode hadn't come out yet.

2581
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:19,000
You weren't getting that.

2582
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:22,880
Marshall, you were in my world, not thinking about Frank Marshall all the time.

2583
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:26,920
But here was a reason one like a hip one that I was pretty surprised with.

2584
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:29,960
Tom Hardy's sweats from Venom.

2585
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:32,680
Well, I'm like, that's new.

2586
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:34,360
That's a new movie that people like.

2587
01:56:34,360 --> 01:56:36,680
This is not like 90s prop collection.

2588
01:56:36,680 --> 01:56:41,280
The manager had to coordinate a delivery like a delivery from a movie studio.

2589
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:45,800
He had a French manager had to like talk to the studio like Sony

2590
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:48,680
and figure out how to get the sweatpants in a safe way.

2591
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:50,680
Giant Beetlejuice costume.

2592
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:52,240
Awesome. Oh, jeez.

2593
01:56:52,240 --> 01:56:54,720
With the little carousel on top of his head and the hammer arms.

2594
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:56,320
Wow. Wow.

2595
01:56:56,320 --> 01:57:00,440
I mean, you did mention the the great respect for the cinema.

2596
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:04,200
Yeah. Well, in in France, no other city loves the cinema more.

2597
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:06,680
And so it of course makes sense that the planet Hollywood

2598
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:08,640
would be the apex of that love.

2599
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:13,960
The finest cinematic institution in the entire nation of France, would you say?

2600
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:17,560
Do a celebration of the life and work of Godard.

2601
01:57:17,720 --> 01:57:21,360
And then you hop on that subway to get down to that planet Hollywood for did.

2602
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:25,240
Jason, do you know, do you know a movie called

2603
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:29,400
You're Never Too Young?

2604
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:32,000
They had like a little sailor suit from that movie

2605
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:35,880
next to a black and white still, and I can't tell if it's a Rooney picture

2606
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:37,520
or something. But this was the other thing.

2607
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:40,040
It was like deeper cuts. Mm hmm.

2608
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:45,000
I think that's the movie where Babe Ruth meets the little rascals.

2609
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:50,000
Am I correct? Someone did tweet at us a pencil case

2610
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:54,440
that featured a drawing of our gang.

2611
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:56,280
Mm hmm. Yes.

2612
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:58,400
Now tell me the part where it proves your theory.

2613
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,360
OK, and the baby.

2614
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:01,880
There is a pencil case.

2615
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:04,440
Someone also got a pencil case was a movie.

2616
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:07,640
No, no. Someone tweeted what I was thinking,

2617
01:58:07,720 --> 01:58:13,400
which is a short where a kid is bored by math lessons in school.

2618
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:16,640
And he looks outside and Babe Ruth is like, come on, kids.

2619
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:19,200
Oh, yes, I watched that. I liked that a lot.

2620
01:58:19,200 --> 01:58:21,440
It was really cute. This is another second gate thing.

2621
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:22,640
I'm sorry we were dropping so much.

2622
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:25,480
But Jason had the theory that there is a film where Babe Ruth

2623
01:58:25,480 --> 01:58:29,240
interacts with the little rascals and that he had to do it because money was tight.

2624
01:58:29,480 --> 01:58:33,800
Griffin. Yeah, this is possibly one of the most French things

2625
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:35,040
you could see. Yes.

2626
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:37,080
You're never too young starring.

2627
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:39,480
Who else? Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.

2628
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,360
Incredible. Jerry was in the sailor suit with a big loli.

2629
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:45,480
So that was that was Jerry Lewis.

2630
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:48,800
Oh, my God. I had in the background of a picture and I couldn't figure out what it was.

2631
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:50,720
Yes. In the poster, incredible.

2632
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:52,200
The little sailor.

2633
01:58:52,200 --> 01:58:55,880
This place was well maintained and was clearly operated with love.

2634
01:58:55,880 --> 01:58:57,640
I got the L.A. lasagna.

2635
01:58:57,640 --> 01:58:59,400
I felt I had to.

2636
01:58:59,400 --> 01:59:01,280
I regret to inform you.

2637
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:02,320
It was delicious.

2638
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:05,160
It was one of the better things I ate in Paris.

2639
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:07,400
I was disgusted by having that opinion.

2640
01:59:07,960 --> 01:59:08,920
It was so good.

2641
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:13,280
I was expecting like even if I enjoy this, it's going to make me feel sick

2642
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:14,640
and bad about myself.

2643
01:59:14,640 --> 01:59:17,640
Yeah. Now, I don't remember if it was L.A. lasagna came up

2644
01:59:17,640 --> 01:59:20,360
when we talked about Planet Hollywood, but like, well, you describe what it is.

2645
01:59:20,360 --> 01:59:24,200
And also listeners Google image this because I looked at photos

2646
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:27,000
and I thought it was so disgusting.

2647
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:30,080
I sent you guys a photo from the menus and I was in between the Captain

2648
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:33,000
Crunch chicken fingers and the L.A. lasagna.

2649
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:36,240
They had removed the branding from the Captain Crunch chicken fingers.

2650
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:37,920
Long, long ago.

2651
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:39,880
Our world famous chicken crunch. Right.

2652
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:41,840
And then the L.A. lasagna was pretty hot.

2653
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:44,160
I was hungry because I didn't get those most of our bites.

2654
01:59:44,160 --> 01:59:46,120
I was like, I could make a full meal of this.

2655
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:51,680
I would describe this as lasagna, giant lasagna, egg rolls.

2656
01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:54,040
Yeah, that's a very good descriptor.

2657
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:58,560
Their description was a California twist to classic lasagna lasagna.

2658
01:59:58,560 --> 01:59:59,360
They didn't say lasagna.

2659
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:00,600
They say lasagna.

2660
02:00:00,600 --> 02:00:01,280
That's how you say it.

2661
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:02,840
With an E.

2662
02:00:02,840 --> 02:00:05,720
They talk about fresh pasta tubes filled with ricotta cheese

2663
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:09,200
and a homemade bolognese meat sauce deep fried to a golden brown

2664
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:11,800
and covered with a garlic cream and tomato basil sauce.

2665
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,400
It was fucking great.

2666
02:00:13,400 --> 02:00:16,800
I got a giant mojito in a goblet.

2667
02:00:17,680 --> 02:00:19,840
You better believe it was a collectible glass

2668
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:21,480
commemorating your dream.

2669
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:23,960
The imminent closing of this restaurant.

2670
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:27,680
Jason text me, he says, please get me a closing shirt.

2671
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:29,360
I go, of course.

2672
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:30,480
Oh, boy.

2673
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:32,080
This is a listener.

2674
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:34,720
Noah sent us this on Twitter.

2675
02:00:34,920 --> 02:00:37,000
And I was thinking about it for ages.

2676
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:41,920
And I was like, well, what is the likelihood anyone I know will be in France?

2677
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:43,920
And I forgot I knew you're going.

2678
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:45,040
I couldn't remember when.

2679
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:47,480
And you started texting us from Disneyland, Paris.

2680
02:00:47,480 --> 02:00:50,440
And I this was our individual text.

2681
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:53,360
Yes, they were. You split this up because you don't want them to think about this

2682
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:55,840
and get a shirt as well. This is your.

2683
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:57,000
He's trying to cut us out.

2684
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,960
Anyone else would care.

2685
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:02,240
But also, you had texted me when I was staying at the Margarita Hotel.

2686
02:01:02,240 --> 02:01:03,120
You had done a shirt.

2687
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:05,840
You got a Margarita Hotel shirt. Yes. Yes. Yes.

2688
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:09,320
So I was like, which, by the way, did help you get the shot glass.

2689
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:11,000
I mean, this was a mutually beneficial thing.

2690
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,360
Yes. You got your little stamp on the card.

2691
02:01:13,360 --> 02:01:16,200
Oh, I see. What did you get out of that deal, Griffin?

2692
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:17,400
Well, this is where you could.

2693
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:19,120
Perhaps the balance is not quite even yet.

2694
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:21,920
Oh, well, I use that chocolate to water my plants.

2695
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:24,920
The people at the nursery.

2696
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:27,000
Meanwhile, Griffin's plants are dying.

2697
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,480
Yeah. No, he has no nothing to put out.

2698
02:01:29,480 --> 02:01:30,760
No shot glass.

2699
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:34,040
So I said and I said,

2700
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:37,480
only if it's not out of your way,

2701
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:42,160
would you get me a memorial plant at Hollywood in remembrance.

2702
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:44,640
And I said, Jason, Gum, I'm having dinner there.

2703
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:46,520
I could not believe my luck.

2704
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:50,520
It is the final immovable part of my plan.

2705
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:52,320
I am eating dinner there by myself.

2706
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:55,000
I drink this great giant mojito, fresh mint leaves.

2707
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,480
I go down to redeem the clean glass.

2708
02:01:57,480 --> 02:02:00,320
Yeah, right. All shirts by 150 percent off second.

2709
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:02,160
Oh, wow. What a deal.

2710
02:02:02,160 --> 02:02:05,560
So Jason for Jason, I got a reveal in a second, the very classy.

2711
02:02:05,560 --> 02:02:08,320
And it was sort of the same insignia that was on the glass itself.

2712
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:09,920
And this speaks to the spirit of this place.

2713
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:11,440
They're not depressed. They're not down.

2714
02:02:11,440 --> 02:02:13,920
They seem happy to have ran it for this long.

2715
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:15,280
And people are there celebrating it.

2716
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:17,760
And they just got this classy thing that's like playing

2717
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:21,080
Hollywood Paris, 1992, 2022.

2718
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:23,360
Wow. It's just a good run.

2719
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:24,520
This is a good run.

2720
02:02:24,520 --> 02:02:25,920
We had a good run here. Broadway.

2721
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:27,040
So you paid. Yeah.

2722
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:30,480
I got a very weird shirt that is a green monster hand

2723
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:33,360
grabbing the planet Hollywood goal.

2724
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:35,240
Cool. But it just felt like the weirdest thing.

2725
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:37,200
And it just says Paris.

2726
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:39,480
Huh? I got this bag here.

2727
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:43,680
This is bag. It says Paris bag, which is odd because like they probably

2728
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:47,720
started consolidating merch because there was a planet Hollywood Paris, too.

2729
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:50,920
Yes, there was planet Hollywood Paris and planet Hollywood Disney Disneyland.

2730
02:02:50,920 --> 02:02:52,760
Yeah, not anymore.

2731
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:55,720
You know, I'm trying to like maybe slightly consolidate

2732
02:02:55,880 --> 02:02:58,920
the amount of lungs I have in my life with some things in the storage, what have you.

2733
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:01,400
It's very hard not to just buy every single thing in the store,

2734
02:03:01,400 --> 02:03:03,320
because I was like, well, I'll never come back here again.

2735
02:03:03,320 --> 02:03:05,840
Yeah, this is the last chance. Yeah, this is the last grass.

2736
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:07,920
But I got I got this shirt for Jason.

2737
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:10,000
I knew I was coming with this.

2738
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,320
It has crossed oceans. Wow.

2739
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,560
Right. Oh, yeah.

2740
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:15,480
Classic.

2741
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:18,360
Or it's ninety ninety six twenty twenty three.

2742
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:20,240
Wow. Yes, it is going to make it.

2743
02:03:20,240 --> 02:03:22,760
It's so listeners, if you want to get if you're going to be there.

2744
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:26,160
You know, the very you can ring in twenty twenty three.

2745
02:03:26,160 --> 02:03:28,120
I think it's January 7th.

2746
02:03:28,120 --> 02:03:30,040
They close its first week of January.

2747
02:03:30,040 --> 02:03:34,080
OK, you know, I felt a little odd coming all this way

2748
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:36,800
with a gift for Jason and not for the two of you.

2749
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:40,800
Now, don't now look that way, especially because, you know,

2750
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:44,960
look who's over there watching over us, baby, Aladar himself still in the garage.

2751
02:03:45,800 --> 02:03:48,040
So they're staring right at you this whole time.

2752
02:03:48,040 --> 02:03:50,240
He's still too sticky for Scott to let in the house.

2753
02:03:50,240 --> 02:03:53,760
Since the last time I touched, I touched it to like move it from there to there.

2754
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:56,520
Yeah. And it and like, Jesus, it's so sticky.

2755
02:03:57,840 --> 02:04:01,480
But also, since the last time I was here in the garage,

2756
02:04:01,480 --> 02:04:03,800
it really feels like there's a menagerie here.

2757
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:07,520
Whereas before, I feel like this wall was like Scott things, your visor.

2758
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:10,360
Yeah, right. A lot of that's your almanac.

2759
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:12,040
Now I'm seeing more PTR.

2760
02:04:12,040 --> 02:04:14,240
I'm seeing Aladar, your art gallery.

2761
02:04:14,240 --> 02:04:15,640
I'm seeing a little a little while.

2762
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:20,960
I'm seeing the blue 32 zipper pouch, the Disney plus day button. Right.

2763
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:24,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it's more things that fit into the lore

2764
02:04:24,520 --> 02:04:27,160
of your favorite things that have been discussed on the show.

2765
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:28,960
A jar of Knott's Berry Jam.

2766
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:32,120
And I came here, I land Charles, right, that the mouse said was in.

2767
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:35,480
Yes. By the way, how do you feel about fundamental

2768
02:04:35,480 --> 02:04:37,960
being the way to do a Griffin Newman impression?

2769
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,680
I texted Charles immediately and I said, I think you know that.

2770
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:42,120
I think that was really good. Well, well.

2771
02:04:42,160 --> 02:04:44,400
And you didn't feel there wasn't self consciousness about like,

2772
02:04:44,600 --> 02:04:47,080
oh, do I say did it seem familiar? Did it?

2773
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:49,360
No, I did. It's it's not.

2774
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:51,240
It's one of those. I'm sure you guys have this, but you're like,

2775
02:04:51,240 --> 02:04:53,000
how would I do an impression of myself?

2776
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:54,720
How would other people make fun of me?

2777
02:04:54,720 --> 02:04:57,640
And I had never clocked it as a thing, but I think he's absolutely right.

2778
02:04:57,640 --> 02:05:01,800
And I do think it's a word I put some extra spin on in the way of hammered.

2779
02:05:01,880 --> 02:05:04,080
Right. Hammered little.

2780
02:05:04,240 --> 02:05:06,560
I've heard fundamentally.

2781
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:09,760
I've heard very few of myself in one of the I was asking the question,

2782
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:10,800
like, how would you do me?

2783
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:15,280
And I asked this to people might have seen something out there

2784
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:17,320
with a very funny Jenny Pearson.

2785
02:05:17,320 --> 02:05:21,400
She did an impression for me that was hilarious, but horrifying.

2786
02:05:21,560 --> 02:05:24,040
It's one of the only that was just so like scattered.

2787
02:05:24,040 --> 02:05:27,960
And this and it was just like me maybe with party energy or something.

2788
02:05:28,280 --> 02:05:29,760
And I it's burned in my brain.

2789
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:33,320
I loved watching it, but also it was like I'd love to never see

2790
02:05:33,320 --> 02:05:34,960
an attempt at an impression again.

2791
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:36,280
That's it. If anybody.

2792
02:05:36,280 --> 02:05:37,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right.

2793
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:39,760
I mean, anyone try. I'm curious.

2794
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:42,200
But some here, I land here, I'm here for like a week.

2795
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:44,120
I realize I only have the gift for Jason.

2796
02:05:44,120 --> 02:05:46,280
I don't want to come with the.

2797
02:05:46,280 --> 02:05:49,480
I was going to then mow you, but no, please.

2798
02:05:49,480 --> 02:05:51,000
On the house. Oh, thank you.

2799
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:54,560
On the house, because I was able to write off the entire Disney day

2800
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:55,720
as a work expense.

2801
02:05:55,720 --> 02:05:58,720
Now that this episode is foreign correspondent for podcast, the right.

2802
02:05:58,720 --> 02:06:00,600
I had to cover everything too bad.

2803
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:03,840
We just and so like make sure that

2804
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:07,120
like if anyone from the IRS is listening,

2805
02:06:07,720 --> 02:06:10,560
like make sure that you listen to the entire thing

2806
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:12,400
because you might have gotten lost in Marshall Gate.

2807
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:13,600
Yes. And what? Wait a minute.

2808
02:06:13,600 --> 02:06:14,920
And he's writing off.

2809
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:16,880
He like why is there so much Frank Marshall?

2810
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:19,800
There was a point where we were talking about maybe I should just pick

2811
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:21,920
a different attraction, not from Paris and cover it.

2812
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:24,680
And I was like, if we do that, then are they going to audit me?

2813
02:06:24,680 --> 02:06:26,960
Are there going to be? Oh, yeah.

2814
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:30,840
It is the listeners in the IRS going like it's a fucking episode

2815
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:33,000
on a ride that closed in Orlando in 97.

2816
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,440
It was never even in Paris.

2817
02:06:36,240 --> 02:06:39,320
And they like, yeah, now they're working with they like

2818
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:43,840
what's the they subpoena our listeners like now you listen carefully

2819
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:44,920
to this bullshit.

2820
02:06:44,920 --> 02:06:47,440
What can you tell us about where Griffin Newman was?

2821
02:06:47,480 --> 02:06:49,680
This is in October twenty twenty two.

2822
02:06:49,680 --> 02:06:52,560
This is scary because like like say Scott, you know,

2823
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:56,360
there's a living with the land fan in the IRS who loves podcast.

2824
02:06:56,360 --> 02:06:59,080
The rise and acts to Scott might get audited

2825
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:03,400
years in a row because of that controversial opinion that it's not good.

2826
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:06,080
They're already going after true patriots.

2827
02:07:06,080 --> 02:07:10,840
How long until they go after fan of people who don't like the rides they like?

2828
02:07:13,200 --> 02:07:16,200
I was I was looking once I landed here for like, I should I should find gifts

2829
02:07:16,200 --> 02:07:18,720
for for Scott and Mike, just little things, right?

2830
02:07:19,680 --> 02:07:22,960
But you guys you asked me for nothing, right?

2831
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,720
What do I get? What do I get for the men who have everything?

2832
02:07:26,280 --> 02:07:30,560
Right. And you had mentioned a recent episode that you had bought

2833
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:32,040
a little gift for Scott.

2834
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:34,400
You might have bought the gift for Scott

2835
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:36,960
commemorating one of his favorite characters in all the pop culture.

2836
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:38,120
Can go. You got a deep.

2837
02:07:38,120 --> 02:07:40,200
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Pocket pop key chain of Kingo.

2838
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:42,360
Can go. Yes. Brian Mariani.

2839
02:07:42,360 --> 02:07:43,800
Yeah. Turnals can go.

2840
02:07:43,800 --> 02:07:45,880
Currency of Brian Mariani.

2841
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:50,680
Well, wait, let's build out a little bit of a Kingo collection for Scott.

2842
02:07:50,720 --> 02:07:51,800
You like that pop pop.

2843
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:54,360
You might want some other Kingo merchandise.

2844
02:07:54,360 --> 02:07:55,280
So what do you do?

2845
02:07:55,280 --> 02:07:57,680
What you is another pocket pop of Kingo,

2846
02:07:58,440 --> 02:08:00,800
but also another pocket pop of Kingo.

2847
02:08:01,600 --> 02:08:06,720
And then a third pocket pop of Kingo, a combined six dollars.

2848
02:08:08,120 --> 02:08:09,800
The guy at the GameStop asked me,

2849
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:12,160
why are you buying three of the same character?

2850
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:16,840
And I say, we needle my friend to like he loves Kingo.

2851
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,480
And then he said, I'll pull off the price tag

2852
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:22,320
so he doesn't know how little money you spent.

2853
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:23,520
And I went, no need.

2854
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:26,200
But he did it. And say this out loud as I'm giving it to you.

2855
02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:28,600
This is delightful. It's so funny looking at these.

2856
02:08:28,640 --> 02:08:29,880
We'll post a photo of it.

2857
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:32,480
And with the fourth that might that might give me originally,

2858
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:34,640
you know what? What's really strange here?

2859
02:08:34,640 --> 02:08:36,800
Let me go back to something I said earlier.

2860
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:40,840
I said that my son points at Lightning McQueen and says Queen.

2861
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:42,680
He I haven't told you this, Mike.

2862
02:08:42,680 --> 02:08:44,640
He took to the King.

2863
02:08:44,640 --> 02:08:46,880
It's one of his favorite things in the little toy room.

2864
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:49,240
And he points to it and he says King.

2865
02:08:49,720 --> 02:08:52,840
He says King and Queen and Queen.

2866
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:56,040
The royalty to my son is so he honestly will be psyched

2867
02:08:56,040 --> 02:08:57,040
that there's a bunch of King.

2868
02:08:57,040 --> 02:08:58,320
He's got a Kingo family.

2869
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:00,080
They had a deep discount.

2870
02:09:00,080 --> 02:09:02,160
King of Marvel legend. They had a full size pop.

2871
02:09:02,160 --> 02:09:03,120
There's some other Kingo stuff.

2872
02:09:03,120 --> 02:09:05,880
And I think it's funny if he only owns the keychains.

2873
02:09:05,880 --> 02:09:06,880
Yes.

2874
02:09:07,200 --> 02:09:08,200
Yes. Yeah.

2875
02:09:08,200 --> 02:09:11,240
It's also it's the only thing I could name about Eternals.

2876
02:09:11,640 --> 02:09:14,640
It's the only I have one word I couldn't tell you the story,

2877
02:09:14,640 --> 02:09:18,600
even though I watched a lot of it before falling the hardest asleep

2878
02:09:18,600 --> 02:09:21,360
I have in the last five years.

2879
02:09:21,640 --> 02:09:23,840
Look, it's a very effective movie in that sense.

2880
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:26,640
Oh, well, someone hasn't tried extraction.

2881
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:31,080
Mike, I got you three of the new McFarland World of Avatar.

2882
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:33,960
They're not even blind boxes. They're blind terrain.

2883
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:35,720
I've heard. Wow. Yes.

2884
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:38,360
Inside are different creatures from the land of Pandora.

2885
02:09:38,360 --> 02:09:39,600
We don't know who will be inside.

2886
02:09:39,600 --> 02:09:41,520
Do I open them now? I think you should.

2887
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:44,640
As we're wrapping up, I feel like, yeah, we need to know what's inside here.

2888
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:49,240
You do them over the course of, you know, as we do our business here.

2889
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:51,120
Thank you so much, Griffith.

2890
02:09:51,120 --> 02:09:52,240
Sure. This is funny.

2891
02:09:52,240 --> 02:09:53,440
And how much you thought this?

2892
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:57,480
Well, this is a needling gift and it cannot be a more sincere gift.

2893
02:09:57,600 --> 02:09:59,600
This garage is becoming the Batcave.

2894
02:09:59,600 --> 02:10:00,400
So the gift.

2895
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:02,480
Sweet. It's really a gifting suite.

2896
02:10:02,480 --> 02:10:07,560
It's crazy how nice so many of our favorite guests are who give us things.

2897
02:10:07,560 --> 02:10:09,560
And we're not we're not setting the standard.

2898
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:11,880
But no, no, you don't need to light it every time.

2899
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:13,560
No, I should I should mention this.

2900
02:10:13,560 --> 02:10:19,000
I think I owe you guys for I in two weeks from today.

2901
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:23,440
Basically, I begin filming a movie in upstate New York.

2902
02:10:23,880 --> 02:10:28,320
Oh, I basically have like took a couple of years off from acting on camera

2903
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:29,840
and really focus on the voiceover stuff.

2904
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:31,600
And the PIP thing feels like the culmination of that.

2905
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:32,840
And I've really enjoyed it.

2906
02:10:32,840 --> 02:10:34,160
And I was in this state post this.

2907
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:36,200
I was like, I don't know how much I want to do this anymore.

2908
02:10:36,520 --> 02:10:37,520
Really? Yeah.

2909
02:10:37,520 --> 02:10:40,360
And I've really had been auditioning less and all this sort of stuff.

2910
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:44,680
And my agent emails me and says this director wants to meet with you.

2911
02:10:46,160 --> 02:10:48,520
I don't I don't know if I should name him for reasons.

2912
02:10:48,520 --> 02:10:49,640
I'll bring up in a second.

2913
02:10:49,640 --> 02:10:51,800
But it's what I go.

2914
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:53,800
Why? People will be able to put this together.

2915
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:55,600
But I'll tell the story in this order. Right.

2916
02:10:56,120 --> 02:10:57,120
Why? And they go, I don't know.

2917
02:10:57,120 --> 02:10:58,600
He wants to meet with you.

2918
02:10:58,600 --> 02:11:01,000
Apparently, he has a new project.

2919
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:01,720
He's got a new script.

2920
02:11:01,720 --> 02:11:03,560
There's a part he wants to play you to play.

2921
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:05,600
And I'm like, what is this? Right.

2922
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:07,640
Go meet with him. I'm talking about stuff.

2923
02:11:07,640 --> 02:11:09,800
We're talking about the this sort of stuff.

2924
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:14,160
And I go like, I have to ask, why are you even like aware of me?

2925
02:11:14,440 --> 02:11:16,480
What is it that made you like?

2926
02:11:16,480 --> 02:11:18,560
Why am I on your radar? Right.

2927
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:20,880
And he goes, I have to be honest.

2928
02:11:21,760 --> 02:11:24,000
I listen to podcasts, the right.

2929
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,280
Wow. Wow.

2930
02:11:26,280 --> 02:11:30,960
Now, which you had told us the beginnings of this and that you had the meeting.

2931
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:32,560
And now you are going to film.

2932
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:34,720
I only officially got the part like 10 days ago.

2933
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:39,560
He basically was like he was like, look, I'm a secret podcast, the right fan.

2934
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:43,720
Secret. He was like, I come out and say it.

2935
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:45,000
Say it. You know, I'll say it.

2936
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,160
He was like, I'm a secret theme park guy.

2937
02:11:47,880 --> 02:11:50,760
I don't want people to think of me as a theme park guy.

2938
02:11:51,560 --> 02:11:53,200
Sort of. I get it.

2939
02:11:53,200 --> 02:11:55,080
I'm not outing him. Right.

2940
02:11:55,080 --> 02:11:57,200
But he does not outwardly. That's why you're not saying his name.

2941
02:11:57,200 --> 02:11:58,440
Like a theme park adult. Yes.

2942
02:11:58,440 --> 02:12:02,840
I mean, people put this together. But and he was like, so I listen to his podcast.

2943
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:04,600
I've gotten really into it. I heard you on it.

2944
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:06,160
I really liked you on it.

2945
02:12:06,160 --> 02:12:09,560
And then at some later point in time, I watched Search Party and I went,

2946
02:12:09,560 --> 02:12:12,560
that's the guy from podcast, the right. Wow.

2947
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:15,640
And then I started writing this thing in your voice.

2948
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:18,160
Oh, my God.

2949
02:12:18,160 --> 02:12:21,640
And your voice base that involves your performance in Search Party,

2950
02:12:21,640 --> 02:12:23,960
which I love, by the way, and like your voice

2951
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:26,560
comes out of what you do here.

2952
02:12:26,560 --> 02:12:29,720
Well, the part I will say is more similar to the character I played in

2953
02:12:29,960 --> 02:12:33,640
Search Party than how it's more similar to that than you talking about our

2954
02:12:33,640 --> 02:12:37,360
Frank Marshall business in his head because of this podcast.

2955
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:38,600
Wow. Wow.

2956
02:12:38,600 --> 02:12:42,040
If this person is listening right now, thank you for listening.

2957
02:12:42,040 --> 02:12:43,840
And then thanks for giving this part to Grim.

2958
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:45,040
I'm so excited.

2959
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:47,560
And Michael Taberski, I'll name him.

2960
02:12:47,560 --> 02:12:49,120
We're doing where I think it's really good.

2961
02:12:49,120 --> 02:12:53,800
But I texted Charles Rogers about this

2962
02:12:54,360 --> 02:12:56,320
because I was bringing up the fundamentally thing and I was like, Charles,

2963
02:12:56,320 --> 02:12:58,480
I can't believe I forgot to tell you this.

2964
02:12:58,480 --> 02:13:01,520
I got cast in a movie and the only two reasons I was cast in it

2965
02:13:01,800 --> 02:13:05,560
and you're the exact person to find this funny are because of podcast,

2966
02:13:05,560 --> 02:13:07,640
the right and search party.

2967
02:13:07,640 --> 02:13:10,680
And Charles's response was, why am I not in this movie?

2968
02:13:10,680 --> 02:13:13,880
I have those two credits as well.

2969
02:13:15,880 --> 02:13:18,040
Point. Yeah.

2970
02:13:18,040 --> 02:13:21,800
Fair point. But but it truly bizarrely have now been cast in a film

2971
02:13:21,800 --> 02:13:25,160
predominantly because of this podcast.

2972
02:13:25,160 --> 02:13:29,120
Wow. I mean, is it just do people think of Charles more as fundamentally

2973
02:13:29,120 --> 02:13:30,840
as behind the scenes? Right.

2974
02:13:30,840 --> 02:13:32,200
That maybe that great actor.

2975
02:13:32,200 --> 02:13:34,960
He's a great actor, perhaps fundamentally.

2976
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:37,040
He is more of an utter.

2977
02:13:37,040 --> 02:13:37,800
That's great.

2978
02:13:38,160 --> 02:13:43,640
Well, and so the precedent has been said, casting can occur

2979
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:46,560
off of this podcast.

2980
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:48,120
This can be a platform. Yeah.

2981
02:13:48,120 --> 02:13:49,120
Yeah. Yeah.

2982
02:13:49,120 --> 02:13:54,120
So don't don't give up hope on the thing you baldly called out a couple months.

2983
02:13:54,120 --> 02:13:56,760
Oh, you're talking about me when I begged for acting work for Jason

2984
02:13:56,760 --> 02:13:58,480
and I on this podcast.

2985
02:13:58,480 --> 02:13:59,280
Sure.

2986
02:13:59,280 --> 02:14:03,480
Look, I've said I was trying to play it cool here, but yes, no, I begged for it.

2987
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:05,520
I've said to you many times.

2988
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:06,400
That's how I remember it.

2989
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:08,480
I'm saying all the truth again.

2990
02:14:08,480 --> 02:14:11,760
And then started shouting and yelling about Frank Marshall again.

2991
02:14:11,840 --> 02:14:12,600
Yeah.

2992
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:14,440
It doesn't like first.

2993
02:14:14,440 --> 02:14:17,080
I have had on camera in four and a half years.

2994
02:14:17,240 --> 02:14:18,880
Wow. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

2995
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:22,440
Oh, my God. Some of that's my choice, but a lot of it isn't like, you know,

2996
02:14:22,440 --> 02:14:25,920
it's a common, you know, pandemic was in there banging down my door,

2997
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:27,360
you know, the couple of things I've heard for whatever.

2998
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:29,000
But it was it was very unexpected.

2999
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,600
I do think it is an affirmation that it is possible

3000
02:14:32,200 --> 02:14:35,240
that doing a podcast is not perhaps a career killer.

3001
02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:42,320
I was starting to worry that maybe it's not like a circuitous

3002
02:14:42,320 --> 02:14:45,880
exit path from the industry you started trying to get into.

3003
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:46,960
Perhaps not.

3004
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:48,400
Perhaps. Good to know.

3005
02:14:48,400 --> 02:14:51,360
Because I got to start setting up meetings next next week

3006
02:14:51,360 --> 02:14:54,000
for a remake of You're Never Too Young.

3007
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,040
This is what I'm saying.

3008
02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:59,520
If you are similarly a director, writer, director out there

3009
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:03,000
who is secretly a PTR fan, help me write.

3010
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,480
All our secret fans start writing.

3011
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:08,200
Mike and Jason Buddy comedies.

3012
02:15:08,200 --> 02:15:09,400
They don't want to tell.

3013
02:15:09,400 --> 02:15:11,720
This is Martin and Lewis right here.

3014
02:15:11,720 --> 02:15:13,720
This is what I'm saying.

3015
02:15:13,720 --> 02:15:16,080
Let this pin it in your head right now.

3016
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:18,360
He's the guy. Jason's the guy in the sailor suit.

3017
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:20,680
And Mike is the guy who gets hammered.

3018
02:15:20,680 --> 02:15:23,160
Hammered in the tuxedo.

3019
02:15:23,160 --> 02:15:24,880
Yeah, it writes itself. It's perfect.

3020
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:27,080
What's in the avatar packages?

3021
02:15:27,080 --> 02:15:30,440
OK, there are two of them are Navi.

3022
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:32,040
OK, might be the same Navi.

3023
02:15:32,040 --> 02:15:33,360
And forgive me, I don't know.

3024
02:15:33,400 --> 02:15:34,640
I can't identify.

3025
02:15:34,640 --> 02:15:38,040
And then one of them is absolutely the Sigourney Weaver Navi,

3026
02:15:38,040 --> 02:15:38,520
I think.

3027
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:40,240
No, the new character.

3028
02:15:40,240 --> 02:15:41,240
No, it's the original Dr.

3029
02:15:41,240 --> 02:15:42,920
Grace Augustine in Navi form.

3030
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:45,000
I believe it's that.

3031
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:45,880
In her avatar form.

3032
02:15:45,880 --> 02:15:47,560
I think these are all first movie.

3033
02:15:47,560 --> 02:15:50,200
Because MacCrawlin's product has been two waves right now.

3034
02:15:50,200 --> 02:15:52,040
The stuff on shelves is, in fact, from the first movie.

3035
02:15:52,040 --> 02:15:54,600
And the way of water is coming out soon.

3036
02:15:54,600 --> 02:15:56,320
It's all on preorder as way of water.

3037
02:15:56,320 --> 02:15:58,000
Have you pulled the trigger yet?

3038
02:15:58,000 --> 02:15:59,840
I haven't had I haven't gotten any of them,

3039
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:01,960
but I think it's very smart because I was waiting.

3040
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:03,560
Dorkside Toys dot com.

3041
02:16:03,560 --> 02:16:05,720
Yes. Often has really good sales.

3042
02:16:05,720 --> 02:16:06,480
They have great sales.

3043
02:16:06,480 --> 02:16:07,600
You got to stay on them like a hawk.

3044
02:16:07,600 --> 02:16:11,000
But MacCrawlin made a bunch of Princess Bride toys.

3045
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,600
And there's, of course, a Wallachian toy.

3046
02:16:12,600 --> 02:16:16,360
It's finally, as of yesterday, nine ninety nine and in conceivable.

3047
02:16:16,360 --> 02:16:18,680
Holds the trigger on that baby.

3048
02:16:18,680 --> 02:16:21,000
I waited because it was like, you know, it started at twenty five dollars

3049
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:22,920
or whatever, but I waited till nine ninety nine.

3050
02:16:22,920 --> 02:16:23,920
I got him coming.

3051
02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:24,960
He's coming home now.

3052
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:25,880
I'm sorry. What is it?

3053
02:16:25,880 --> 02:16:29,520
Is it the just Wallachian from the movie Princess Brice?

3054
02:16:29,520 --> 02:16:30,520
OK, I see.

3055
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:32,840
His character's name, very well seen.

3056
02:16:32,840 --> 02:16:35,040
Vizzini. Yes, thank you.

3057
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:38,200
But so I guess what I'm saying is, even though there have been good deals on it,

3058
02:16:38,200 --> 02:16:39,320
I'm still waiting.

3059
02:16:39,320 --> 02:16:41,400
Yeah, I think we'll there'll be a McFarland toys.

3060
02:16:41,400 --> 02:16:43,960
Generally, there's a good discount period for most of them.

3061
02:16:44,280 --> 02:16:48,800
So I'll maybe get a couple after the hype dies down for movies.

3062
02:16:48,920 --> 02:16:52,240
But will it ever? I mean, I look, I hope it doesn't.

3063
02:16:52,240 --> 02:16:54,800
But that's what my strategy is right now.

3064
02:16:55,840 --> 02:16:59,560
Yeah. Well, if this is if this is winding us down,

3065
02:16:59,680 --> 02:17:03,360
then I think an important thing to do at this point is to say

3066
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:06,280
Griffin Newman, you survived podcast The Ride. Yes.

3067
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:08,480
Let's exit through the gift shop.

3068
02:17:08,480 --> 02:17:13,120
Are there any chipmunk oriented projects that you would like to put

3069
02:17:13,320 --> 02:17:17,440
the Disney plus original film disenchanted that I think may be of some

3070
02:17:17,440 --> 02:17:21,080
interest to listeners of this podcast comes out November 18th.

3071
02:17:21,400 --> 02:17:24,120
I think it is really good. I really like it.

3072
02:17:24,360 --> 02:17:28,680
We talked about it when you guys were on Blank Check, but I auditioned

3073
02:17:28,680 --> 02:17:32,360
for Jiminy Cricket in the Pinocchio movie and was very bummed that I didn't get it

3074
02:17:32,360 --> 02:17:35,560
because I was like, it would have been cool to be the fun little animal

3075
02:17:35,560 --> 02:17:37,200
sidekick in a Disney movie.

3076
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:41,080
And then this part landed somewhat circuitously.

3077
02:17:41,800 --> 02:17:46,600
And I could not be happier as to which movie I ended up

3078
02:17:47,960 --> 02:17:52,480
as having all experienced one of these films together.

3079
02:17:52,560 --> 02:17:54,960
Yes. Yeah. And and not the other.

3080
02:17:54,960 --> 02:17:58,480
We have not seen this in Chantia, but I I love

3081
02:17:58,480 --> 02:18:02,720
I've been loving the drops because there had been PIP drops in both trailers.

3082
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:06,640
Yeah. Extra information revealed in the last one, which I liked so much.

3083
02:18:06,640 --> 02:18:08,120
Got some range in this movie.

3084
02:18:08,120 --> 02:18:10,360
He's he's got a couple of different forms he takes.

3085
02:18:10,360 --> 02:18:11,080
There's a lot of fun stuff.

3086
02:18:11,080 --> 02:18:14,720
And they did a character poster this week, which is a movie nerd is like a big thing

3087
02:18:14,720 --> 02:18:17,200
where it's like, yeah, there's an isolated PIP poster.

3088
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:18,760
That's great. God, incredible.

3089
02:18:18,760 --> 02:18:19,560
Which is cool.

3090
02:18:19,560 --> 02:18:21,480
So yeah, theme park connection.

3091
02:18:21,480 --> 02:18:25,840
I believe you told us about this movie when we were sitting in the galaxy set.

3092
02:18:26,400 --> 02:18:27,480
Yes, I believe so.

3093
02:18:27,480 --> 02:18:28,960
It's it's been a very long thing.

3094
02:18:28,960 --> 02:18:31,280
I mean, it was I

3095
02:18:31,280 --> 02:18:35,320
I got asked as a favor to fill in at a script read through.

3096
02:18:36,560 --> 02:18:39,480
And they were trying to, as Disney is want to do,

3097
02:18:40,160 --> 02:18:43,520
get a famous person to play the role and more famous person.

3098
02:18:43,520 --> 02:18:45,840
And Tom Hanks.

3099
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:50,800
Yeah, no, I was I was filling in and I was told explicitly there is no job here.

3100
02:18:51,240 --> 02:18:53,560
Well, do you want to do this favor?

3101
02:18:53,560 --> 02:18:56,400
My friend Barry Josephson is the producer of the movie and produced the tick.

3102
02:18:56,680 --> 02:18:58,760
OK, so you'd be doing me a really big solid.

3103
02:18:58,760 --> 02:19:02,160
I know you're enjoying doing voiceover and you'd be on a zoom

3104
02:19:02,160 --> 02:19:05,000
with all these Disney execs and maybe some other thing comes of it.

3105
02:19:05,480 --> 02:19:07,920
It'd be a nice little show reel to do.

3106
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:10,960
And I did this this zoom read and a week later, he calls me.

3107
02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:12,800
He's like, we're going to hire you to play a German.

3108
02:19:12,800 --> 02:19:14,480
Oh, wow. And it was a wild thing.

3109
02:19:14,480 --> 02:19:16,920
And I truly have spent the last 18 months being like,

3110
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:19,000
they might replace me at any moment.

3111
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,640
You know, I could be the scratch voice for this.

3112
02:19:21,640 --> 02:19:23,800
I was told I was the guy,

3113
02:19:24,440 --> 02:19:27,320
but it felt so bizarre that it happened that way.

3114
02:19:27,520 --> 02:19:31,840
Yeah, that the whole time it's been precarious, just in my anxious mind.

3115
02:19:32,240 --> 02:19:34,880
Yeah, but I've really, really enjoyed working on it.

3116
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:37,200
And so fun to do.

3117
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:40,520
I mean, because like this enchanted is such a riff on the sort of archetypes

3118
02:19:40,520 --> 02:19:42,840
of the classic Disney princess movie. Right. Right.

3119
02:19:42,840 --> 02:19:46,000
And so so often it was going like, oh, it's this type of scene.

3120
02:19:46,880 --> 02:19:49,960
Uh huh. You know, like, oh, this needs to work by.

3121
02:19:49,960 --> 02:19:53,000
I'm referencing that kind of thing, not directly,

3122
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:56,880
but tonally, you're like, you have to hit these beats and kind of do it

3123
02:19:57,080 --> 02:20:00,560
with a little awareness of like, yeah, we're doing a trope.

3124
02:20:00,600 --> 02:20:02,520
People will recognize it's a trope scene.

3125
02:20:02,520 --> 02:20:05,520
So like how much do I play into that?

3126
02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:07,440
Yeah. And there was a thing.

3127
02:20:07,440 --> 02:20:12,960
I'll say spoiler, but my my character is like the book ends of the movie.

3128
02:20:12,960 --> 02:20:15,600
He like sort of narrates the beginning of the end of the movie.

3129
02:20:15,600 --> 02:20:19,760
And so there's like the opening five or so minutes are me sort of

3130
02:20:20,600 --> 02:20:24,200
an insane thing is in the first movie, this is done by Julie Andrews.

3131
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:25,920
They do this sort of classic Disney.

3132
02:20:25,920 --> 02:20:27,920
The book opens and they tell you the story.

3133
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:30,640
And in this one, I do it, which is wow.

3134
02:20:30,640 --> 02:20:33,280
That's a lot about what's happened to the entertainment industry

3135
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:34,960
in the last 15 years.

3136
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:37,560
But it's gotten better. Yeah.

3137
02:20:37,560 --> 02:20:39,840
The first five minutes are like mostly me

3138
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:42,760
marathoning all the sort of table setting for the movie.

3139
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:45,120
And we did it really early on.

3140
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:48,280
And I recently went back and I said, like,

3141
02:20:48,280 --> 02:20:51,800
it was the last thing we could sort of change still as they were like

3142
02:20:51,800 --> 02:20:55,520
locking the movie. And I said, and you go back and you do little lines.

3143
02:20:55,520 --> 02:20:58,200
Every four months, they call me and I do a little bit, you know, they'd say,

3144
02:20:58,200 --> 02:21:01,000
we want to change this or this got rewritten or this isn't playing this way

3145
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:01,760
or whatever it is.

3146
02:21:01,760 --> 02:21:03,960
How literally I'm always curious about things like that.

3147
02:21:03,960 --> 02:21:06,800
Would you go in and it's four lines or is it always a ton?

3148
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:07,920
It was never four.

3149
02:21:07,920 --> 02:21:11,720
The first day I did it, they were like, we're about to start filming.

3150
02:21:13,080 --> 02:21:16,640
Or they just started filming on set in Ireland with the live action actors.

3151
02:21:16,640 --> 02:21:20,160
And they were like, we need you to do the entire movie so we can replay this

3152
02:21:20,160 --> 02:21:22,080
on set for people to act off of.

3153
02:21:22,080 --> 02:21:25,440
Whoa. So that was sort of like fairly rough first draft stuff.

3154
02:21:25,440 --> 02:21:28,040
I was still figuring out the voice, but it was the whole thing.

3155
02:21:28,040 --> 02:21:30,440
And then every time I went in after that, I was like, is it going to be a thing?

3156
02:21:30,440 --> 02:21:32,520
And they bring me in for just two or three lines. It'd be a lot.

3157
02:21:33,160 --> 02:21:34,800
And it's like they shoot the whole live action movie.

3158
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:36,840
The animation comes in, they adjust things.

3159
02:21:36,840 --> 02:21:38,800
There were reshoots at a certain point.

3160
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:40,720
It's like an ever moving thing.

3161
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:44,880
But I said, like, is it possible to redo the whole opening thing?

3162
02:21:44,880 --> 02:21:48,200
Because so much of it had been sort of getting replaced one line at a time.

3163
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:52,760
And the thing I picked up on it was I really think they screened

3164
02:21:53,160 --> 02:21:56,960
Sleeping Beauty in New York at the Museum Moving Image, which like

3165
02:21:57,760 --> 02:22:01,200
rarely do the classic Disney animated film get shown in theaters anymore.

3166
02:22:01,360 --> 02:22:04,640
And like on its film prints, 70 millimeters incredible.

3167
02:22:05,080 --> 02:22:07,720
And I watched that and I was like, oh, the thing I'm missing

3168
02:22:07,720 --> 02:22:09,960
is the musicality of the thing.

3169
02:22:09,960 --> 02:22:12,920
And I was like, well, you let me do this again from beginning to end,

3170
02:22:12,920 --> 02:22:15,200
because it finally took me that time to realize

3171
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:18,320
the thing that makes it work is the like,

3172
02:22:18,680 --> 02:22:21,240
da da da da da da da da.

3173
02:22:21,240 --> 02:22:25,360
You know, it was like, oh, it truly has to be this sing songy thing,

3174
02:22:25,360 --> 02:22:27,320
even though I'm not singing.

3175
02:22:27,320 --> 02:22:30,240
And then that was sort of such a fun thing to realize of like, oh,

3176
02:22:30,240 --> 02:22:34,600
I'm like figuring out the math of what makes a Disney movie sound like a Disney movie.

3177
02:22:35,240 --> 02:22:39,760
So you're using the like you you went to that screening just to go to that screening.

3178
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:44,600
Like your film nerddom feeds directly into you get to use it.

3179
02:22:45,120 --> 02:22:49,160
What's so cool about this part is I feel like so much of it feels like weird

3180
02:22:49,160 --> 02:22:53,040
karate kid wax on wax on stuff where I'm like all the things I've like hyper fixated

3181
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:54,600
on throughout my life.

3182
02:22:54,600 --> 02:22:57,760
I now understand like, oh, I understand exactly what the scene needs to be,

3183
02:22:57,760 --> 02:22:59,760
because I understand the trope we're playing with here.

3184
02:23:00,520 --> 02:23:02,600
You know, they were receptive to you.

3185
02:23:03,280 --> 02:23:08,000
They were. I mean, once again, I was like, I keep on thinking you're going to fire me.

3186
02:23:08,040 --> 02:23:10,160
Sure. I keep on thinking of a placeholder.

3187
02:23:10,160 --> 02:23:12,120
And I was surprised by how much they let me.

3188
02:23:12,120 --> 02:23:17,120
And it was a process of earning the confidence to say, like, can I throw something out?

3189
02:23:17,120 --> 02:23:20,200
Can I try this? Is it more that or this or whatever?

3190
02:23:20,480 --> 02:23:25,400
But I really felt like it was a very, very creatively satisfying process.

3191
02:23:25,400 --> 02:23:27,000
I'm really happy with how it turned out.

3192
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,760
And it's great. In my contract.

3193
02:23:31,320 --> 02:23:33,120
Oh, go ahead.

3194
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:36,440
I feel like we I believe we didn't know how this was going to. Yeah.

3195
02:23:36,920 --> 02:23:39,560
We're going to figure it out in my contract.

3196
02:23:40,080 --> 02:23:42,480
It was the one thing I was like to my eyes.

3197
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:44,680
I was like, get this in there.

3198
02:23:45,400 --> 02:23:49,200
If they do anything in the theme parks, they have to get me to do it.

3199
02:23:49,200 --> 02:23:50,880
It's it's not.

3200
02:23:50,880 --> 02:23:53,200
There's no Jim Hanks.

3201
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:55,080
There's no sound alike.

3202
02:23:55,080 --> 02:23:56,280
Yeah, I am not.

3203
02:23:56,280 --> 02:23:58,440
They're not getting your brother from Paris to do it. No.

3204
02:23:59,040 --> 02:24:01,320
Although he probably does get balls.

3205
02:24:01,320 --> 02:24:03,840
You can hear basketballs bouncing in the background.

3206
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:06,160
Yeah, I don't know. What's this line?

3207
02:24:06,200 --> 02:24:07,760
You probably could do a good impression of me.

3208
02:24:07,760 --> 02:24:11,040
But but that was the so it's just like there's nothing in the works.

3209
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:11,840
There's nothing locked in.

3210
02:24:11,840 --> 02:24:14,560
Obviously, based on the movie success, people want to see stuff or whatever.

3211
02:24:15,160 --> 02:24:18,440
But it is like I got that in there where it's like if there's any other thing

3212
02:24:18,440 --> 02:24:22,400
where the character talks, if it's a toy or a theme park or whatever.

3213
02:24:23,320 --> 02:24:26,120
Yeah, God, I want to still be the voice.

3214
02:24:26,120 --> 02:24:30,160
You might you you made this be hammered out via reps.

3215
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:31,520
This had to be discussed and.

3216
02:24:31,520 --> 02:24:34,480
Yeah. And it wasn't even like a money term thing.

3217
02:24:34,480 --> 02:24:36,720
It was like you just have to call me.

3218
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:39,120
Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

3219
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:41,200
So you and you made good it.

3220
02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:42,640
You got up to that.

3221
02:24:42,640 --> 02:24:45,960
But like a like a dream plate to get up to.

3222
02:24:46,280 --> 02:24:49,480
And you did like what you feel like you had to do.

3223
02:24:49,840 --> 02:24:51,960
It's a movie. I'm making sure that I'm always.

3224
02:24:51,960 --> 02:24:56,680
Yeah. Yeah. Because I'll fucking ride this horse like Gad, if I can.

3225
02:24:57,280 --> 02:25:00,480
Sure. Yeah. I would be happy to ride this into the ground.

3226
02:25:00,480 --> 02:25:02,320
I like this guy. He's a cool little chipmunk.

3227
02:25:02,320 --> 02:25:04,000
I play him for 20 years.

3228
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,280
I do anything they want me to for this.

3229
02:25:06,680 --> 02:25:09,000
Well, when the Mickey copyright expires, they're going to say it all.

3230
02:25:09,160 --> 02:25:10,400
Remember, it all started with a chipmunk.

3231
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:11,440
It all started with a chipmunk.

3232
02:25:11,440 --> 02:25:13,120
And then you're going to be the face of a lot.

3233
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:15,040
They're going to tell people it was Pipps the whole time.

3234
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:18,040
Yeah, exactly. There was always like Mickey drew Pipp on a train.

3235
02:25:18,280 --> 02:25:19,200
Yeah. Yeah.

3236
02:25:20,360 --> 02:25:22,040
It was Mickey's drawings.

3237
02:25:22,040 --> 02:25:24,080
So actually, he's more important.

3238
02:25:24,080 --> 02:25:25,080
He didn't.

3239
02:25:26,320 --> 02:25:28,160
Well, created Mickey's.

3240
02:25:28,160 --> 02:25:30,880
It's Mickey's apartment now in Disneyland.

3241
02:25:31,040 --> 02:25:33,360
That's Mickey's lamp moving everyone over.

3242
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:36,160
Walt first lives in Toontown now.

3243
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:38,360
Oddly enough, they just kind of squawked.

3244
02:25:38,360 --> 02:25:39,800
Yeah. It's like the holiday.

3245
02:25:39,800 --> 02:25:41,360
It's a holiday situation.

3246
02:25:41,360 --> 02:25:42,560
Yeah, it's a holiday situation.

3247
02:25:42,560 --> 02:25:43,560
Yeah.

3248
02:25:43,560 --> 02:25:44,840
Well, we're so excited for you.

3249
02:25:44,840 --> 02:25:45,840
Tamoshanter. Yes.

3250
02:25:45,840 --> 02:25:46,840
Yes.

3251
02:25:48,040 --> 02:25:50,880
I think you would have the right to go carve it into the table.

3252
02:25:50,880 --> 02:25:53,160
I think nobody can say no to that.

3253
02:25:53,160 --> 02:25:54,160
Get the knife out.

3254
02:25:54,840 --> 02:25:55,840
Carve it in.

3255
02:25:55,840 --> 02:25:56,840
Yeah.

3256
02:25:57,040 --> 02:25:58,600
I'm carving Pipp.

3257
02:25:58,600 --> 02:26:01,160
Get out of here. Get out of my face.

3258
02:26:01,160 --> 02:26:03,120
We're so excited to to check it out.

3259
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:04,120
Excited for you.

3260
02:26:04,120 --> 02:26:05,560
Let's just check it out.

3261
02:26:05,560 --> 02:26:06,720
And good boy.

3262
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:09,680
I hope that if the next step is Pipp in the park, somehow.

3263
02:26:09,680 --> 02:26:10,680
Just something.

3264
02:26:10,680 --> 02:26:11,680
Yeah. Yeah.

3265
02:26:11,680 --> 02:26:13,160
Put him in the partner statue.

3266
02:26:13,160 --> 02:26:14,160
Put him in.

3267
02:26:14,920 --> 02:26:16,480
He can be holding Mickey's hand.

3268
02:26:17,080 --> 02:26:18,560
It's the third, the lower tier.

3269
02:26:18,560 --> 02:26:20,080
It's a little they step down.

3270
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:21,080
Yeah. Yes.

3271
02:26:21,480 --> 02:26:22,480
Beautiful.

3272
02:26:22,480 --> 02:26:23,440
Well, excellent.

3273
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:24,440
Congratulations.

3274
02:26:25,160 --> 02:26:26,640
Unless there's any more Marshall stuff to go.

3275
02:26:27,280 --> 02:26:29,760
No, the only final thing I said, the only final correction, I just want to

3276
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:30,760
settle here.

3277
02:26:31,080 --> 02:26:34,640
Mike did, I believe in the Munsters episode, say that he

3278
02:26:34,640 --> 02:26:37,640
believed that I had also purchased a NECA

3279
02:26:37,640 --> 02:26:42,280
figure of Zombo, the character from the show within the movie.

3280
02:26:42,280 --> 02:26:44,320
There was some uncertainty on my part, but yeah, you're right.

3281
02:26:44,320 --> 02:26:45,320
I did not do that.

3282
02:26:45,320 --> 02:26:47,880
I threw it out. The idea that I thought it was never do such a thing.

3283
02:26:48,600 --> 02:26:52,040
He said, not only do I think Griffin owns it, but I think he texted me and said,

3284
02:26:52,040 --> 02:26:53,040
I need that.

3285
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:57,720
Well, I'm not angry about it.

3286
02:26:57,720 --> 02:26:59,440
I'm not angry about these mistakes happen.

3287
02:26:59,440 --> 02:27:01,400
We text each other about a lot of different products.

3288
02:27:01,400 --> 02:27:03,400
What was the toy then you said you needed?

3289
02:27:03,400 --> 02:27:04,880
It was at the same.

3290
02:27:05,880 --> 02:27:08,720
It was one of the San Diego Comic Con exclusive for twenty twenty two at the

3291
02:27:08,720 --> 02:27:12,840
NECA booth. I needed we were both trying to find the pre sale windows where they

3292
02:27:12,840 --> 02:27:14,560
were going to go up. You want to buy Zombo.

3293
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:15,640
Gremlin is what you want.

3294
02:27:15,640 --> 02:27:18,480
I wanted Greta the Gremlin bridal dress from Gremlins 2.

3295
02:27:18,880 --> 02:27:21,960
And I wanted the action figure of the poster from the thing.

3296
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:23,360
That's right. Yes.

3297
02:27:23,560 --> 02:27:24,560
I got those.

3298
02:27:24,560 --> 02:27:28,040
NECA made the figure of the poster, which is like that cool.

3299
02:27:28,040 --> 02:27:31,000
Harco with the light coming out of the light coming out of the thing that's not

3300
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,240
really in the movie. But I did not buy a Zombo.

3301
02:27:33,280 --> 02:27:35,640
I have not bought a Zombo. I will not buy a Zombo.

3302
02:27:35,640 --> 02:27:37,520
I do not need one. I'm not offended.

3303
02:27:37,520 --> 02:27:39,400
I just want I have a reputation to maintain here.

3304
02:27:40,320 --> 02:27:43,640
You need the directors are listening to this podcast about whether or not

3305
02:27:43,640 --> 02:27:44,880
apparently to hire us.

3306
02:27:44,880 --> 02:27:46,840
You're a Zombo guy. You may not have gotten the role.

3307
02:27:46,840 --> 02:27:48,720
I would not have gotten the role.

3308
02:27:48,720 --> 02:27:51,320
Yeah. You would never buy a Zombo.

3309
02:27:51,320 --> 02:27:54,080
You buy three Kingo by three Kingos.

3310
02:27:54,320 --> 02:27:55,640
No Zombo's three Kingos.

3311
02:27:55,640 --> 02:27:57,080
Zombo is not Kingo.

3312
02:27:58,560 --> 02:27:59,800
It's not Kingo.

3313
02:27:59,800 --> 02:28:03,360
OK, you can find us on the socials at Podcast the Ride.

3314
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:07,640
Birch is available in our T public store for three bonus episodes every month.

3315
02:28:07,640 --> 02:28:11,120
And to understand what the fuck we were talking about for the first 45 minutes

3316
02:28:11,120 --> 02:28:12,120
and a lot of other stuff.

3317
02:28:12,120 --> 02:28:13,840
And here's the best episode ever.

3318
02:28:13,840 --> 02:28:14,880
What an ad.

3319
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:16,800
Wow. For endorsement.

3320
02:28:17,640 --> 02:28:21,240
Judge for yourself by checking out Podcast the Ride, the second gate

3321
02:28:22,480 --> 02:28:25,360
or get one more bonus episode on our new tier club three.

3322
02:28:25,360 --> 02:28:28,600
All that is at Patreon dot com slash podcast the ride.

3323
02:28:28,600 --> 02:28:31,960
We're heading, I believe, into a little Thanksgiving break,

3324
02:28:32,480 --> 02:28:35,880
at which point your assignments are to watch Disenchanted on Disney Plus.

3325
02:28:36,040 --> 02:28:37,880
And also the whole family.

3326
02:28:37,880 --> 02:28:39,280
Yes. Get everybody in there.

3327
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:40,720
Yes. Don't leave.

3328
02:28:40,720 --> 02:28:41,680
Don't leave Grandma.

3329
02:28:41,680 --> 02:28:42,680
No, no. She'll love it.

3330
02:28:42,680 --> 02:28:44,360
Love Pip. Yeah.

3331
02:28:44,360 --> 02:28:47,400
And as for us, we're going to be off on the main feed.

3332
02:28:47,400 --> 02:28:49,640
But I think this is a time out.

3333
02:28:49,640 --> 02:28:52,840
If you want to hear us do something, I think on Club Three,

3334
02:28:52,880 --> 02:28:56,400
we're going to delve into Kingdom Hearts and figure out what the fuck.

3335
02:28:56,400 --> 02:28:58,000
Oh, that's exciting.

3336
02:28:58,000 --> 02:28:59,960
I was a daunting hill.

3337
02:28:59,960 --> 02:29:01,000
I haven't started yet.

3338
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:02,240
I haven't started.

3339
02:29:02,240 --> 02:29:04,680
Yeah. Got the game sitting in plastic.

3340
02:29:05,280 --> 02:29:06,720
Oh, you got the. Oh, you're going to play it.

3341
02:29:06,720 --> 02:29:09,360
Yeah. I started going down there.

3342
02:29:09,360 --> 02:29:11,520
I would hold during the pandemic and it's deep.

3343
02:29:11,800 --> 02:29:13,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

3344
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:14,000
I'm not going to get to all of it.

3345
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,320
Sounds deep, confusing, bizarre.

3346
02:29:16,520 --> 02:29:20,560
So check all that out at Patreon dot com slash podcast the ride.

3347
02:29:21,320 --> 02:29:22,480
Griffin, thanks for joining us.

3348
02:29:22,480 --> 02:29:24,560
Great thing, as always.

3349
02:29:24,560 --> 02:29:28,080
And just two exclamations, I think, to say at the end.

3350
02:29:28,080 --> 02:29:32,520
One is jumping jelly sticks and the other is sacre bleu.

3351
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:39,880
