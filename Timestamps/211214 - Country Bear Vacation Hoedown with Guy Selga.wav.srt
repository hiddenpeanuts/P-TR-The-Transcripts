1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Dog.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Stay tuned with the Country Bear Jamboree Week.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We got Guy Selga from the TourPlan's website joining us.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This episode contains California bears, secrets discovered via animatronic nametag,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and the difference between theme park work trips and theme park fun trips.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's the Country Bear Vacation Hoedown on Podcast the Ride.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Welcome to Podcast the Ride Country Bear Jamboree Week Day 2.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This feels good, right? How long has it been since you just immediately got a new podcast?

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I assume having devoured yesterdays, which, you know, despite it being exceedingly long.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, wait, I haven't been introduced, I guess.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh, yeah, really well, yeah. I'm keeping the names alive, so I'll go through them.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm swinging Scotty Gardner, seeking to speak, is big car-owl-son, and yes, go ahead.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh, I was just going to say, yeah, like the first episode of this was already longer than the first Get Back.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So we're already winning as far as doing content on very famous bands.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So will this go long? Because I think the second episode of Get Back is actually longer than the first.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So will we go longer than yesterday? That's really my question. And I don't know. I don't know the answer.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's up to all of us to be a little Peter Jacksons.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We are little Peter Jacksons today.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Little Peter Jacksons, including Jughead J. Sun Bonnet Sheridan. Hi, J. Sun.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The littlest Peter Jackson.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Among little, like three little ones, but you're the littlest.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I do have, sometimes he would do interviews, I feel like, around the Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit,

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and his hair was very frizzy and frizzed out, and my hair is very long and Peter Jacksons.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Well, I'll probably get a cut before then. So as we're recording.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Your hair looks like you were ready for senior prom versus what Peter Jacksons looks like during an interview.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
His is crazy. His is wild.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He knows cameras are in front of him and he's still like, this is fine.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
He's unkempt. You look like you're ready.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm picture ready.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You look like you're ready for the Sadie Hawkins dance. You look like you're ready to go.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yeah. Well, thanks. I'll take it.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Looking sharp, J. Sun.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Anyway, it's day two and today we are covering the vacation hoedown,

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
the seasonal overlay that they started doing in 86.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
There's so many fragments of different shows and pieces of The Country of the Jamboree that we got to get to.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And I know a fan of this particular iteration and The Country of the Jamboree in general is seated over to my left.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He is the Disneyland writer for touring plans and the co-author of the unofficial guide to Disneyland.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's Guy Selgo. It's going on.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hey, thanks for having me. Walking in here, I thought we were going to talk about coming out of their shells tour.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, man. But from what I understand, this is this is the showbiz pizza band.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Close. Very close. Yeah. Oh, wait. See how he's all mixed up.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I thought he knew what all the things were. Go with it.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
OK. Yeah, sure. Anyway, so Billy Bob, he drinks gasoline or something.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I believe so. OK. Yeah.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
There's little guys who pop up out of holes.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I don't remember any of their name. You probably do know more about.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We actually haven't done that. Mizzy Mozzarella. Yeah. Mizzy Mozzarella. OK.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Trying to beat you to the names. Yeah. Bats. You know, the four little shavers.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Wow. Geez. We haven't we done. We probably got to do that one.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's an episode. Yeah, we got to get what's his name on the show, too.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Just kidding. The inventor of. Yeah, just kidding.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I don't know about that.

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah. Guy, thanks. Thanks so much for being here.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Thanks for having me talking about my favorite attraction of all time, specifically the vacation version.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So I'm really happy to be here. Oh, fantastic. Great. Great. Well, OK.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So, yeah, we had heard that you were a Country Bear fan.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I even looked up. I was like, I think I Googled your name and country bear.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I saw that you like this one like, OK, that is perfect. That's great.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So we will leave that to the side in our first episode and narrow in here.

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Also kind of funny how you came to be on the show when we were talking about who do we who is a country bear fan, like a super fan.

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah. Really next level bear fan.

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And somehow Jason knew Jason brought up your name when we were discussing people.

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And then I was at Disneyland a month ago drinking alone at the Ant Man bar, as is one's right to do.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I've done it a couple of times. It's a pretty good spot. It is a pretty good spot.

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I guess I've only been there alone once.

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But soon enough, I was not alone because I bumped into Chuck and Sally, who are listeners to the show.

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
My good friends. That's just what I've heard.

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And so I started saying, hey, I think we're going to do this country bear thing.

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And they said you got to talk to Guy Selga. He's a fan of this.

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And also, he's the person who married. Yeah, I think wedding out in Phoenix.

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. In another state, even.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is commitment. A good friend, a good, good helper.

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So they spoke very highly of you and it was nice to meet them.

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So there's a lot of love going around here.

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So it was meant to be, I feel like, between all of these these endorsements.

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah. It does real quick before we even talk to the Bears.

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I want to let the audience doesn't know your job is to be at Disneyland, essentially.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah. Touring plans. We we take the guesswork out of trip planning

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and we help you save time and money in Disneyland and Walt Disney World and Disney Cruise Line and that sort of thing.

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And we have our day to day itineraries that go where the crowds aren't.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And we have every bit of information you could possibly want to plan a trip.

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Right. So it's your job to gather this information essentially on an almost daily basis.

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yeah. And I'm the Disneyland dude.

85
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Keep everything up to date over there and do a lot of blog posts and whatnot.

86
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And yeah, I've been there for about 10 years. So, geez.

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So for that amount of time, you've been going to Disneyland. How often a week?

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It depends on what the needs of the company are.

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Like sometimes I'll be there every day, but you know, sometimes it'll be a couple of times a week.

90
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But wow. Wow. And then what is the divide end up being between like, are you are you having your Disney fun a little bit,

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
but like observing things doing your work as well?

92
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm good at in my brain flipping on the fun mode versus work mode switch when I'm at the parks.

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So if like if I'm there with friends, I can just flip it off and enjoy it like and really like Disneyland never gets old.

94
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I mean, we agree with flipping it on and off.

95
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah, like we were there for a couple for the opening of Marvel, the opening of Marvel and the opening of Star Wars.

96
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Like those lands were we're a little stressful.

97
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Like you're about you're about here. Can I finish what your point is?

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I think you're going to make is that when we went to the opening of Marvel, you had the work switch switched on. I did.

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You are the kid you are. You are.

100
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I've noted a number of times you saying like, well, I'm here for work.

101
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So like the degree of stress was also like very stressful.

102
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I mean, yeah, of course you had to have a reservation, the wait in the line or a reservation for the ride to get in the land.

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It was all kinds of chaos. I mean, I'm sure you saw a little of it.

104
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
If you were not there, I was there.

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The line stretched back to I think like Little Mermaid and it was kind of unorganized.

106
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
They said the line is going to cut off. Yeah, it was it was stressful.

107
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember I was about to just say I remember seeing aerial pictures.

108
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Oh, yeah. Little Mermaid. I apologize for that.

109
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That word specifically. But yes, I looked really insane.

110
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Have you been there for like a lot of the initial like first Galaxy's Edge first?

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yes. Yeah, everything. We're not big on, you know, being first and getting all the blog posts out and like bragging lies.

112
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We just want to get the data. Yeah.

113
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You're like just your organization is just like just the facts.

114
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yes, pretty much. It's no frills.

115
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's like a Bill Moyers PBS style. You know, it's not like a trashy Fox News type place.

116
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah, we don't post rumors or anything.

117
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And you know, like being a Disney blogger is a is a very negative job to have.

118
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I feel like you make fun of. But I like being for turn planes because I can say I'm a writer.

119
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I can say I'm a writer. Right. Right. Sure.

120
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Well, yeah, I mean, being that you're just trying to not like a go nuts with opinions, that definitely puts you in a different category than a lot of these sites who are so full of complaints.

121
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah, weirdness. Well, that yeah. Good for you. I mean, like other stuff just being that you're there so free.

122
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I mean, what like is it? Will it just be like I'm just going to watch how a line works today for a while or if like focus on this attraction, that attraction?

123
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah. So we have a team of data scientists and sometimes all they need is to sit in this on this bench in this walkway in the park and count how many people walk by.

124
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And then other times it's just ride this ride over and over and get the actual wait times because Disney's wait times are reactionary and are and we predict the wait times.

125
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So they're they're posted away if it's 40 minutes. That was the wait 40 minutes ago. And so we predict the way. Right. Right. Gotcha.

126
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Can I ask a question? And maybe this to inside and I'll have to cut this. But since Disney reopened after the pandemic, Disneyland opened, I feel that each way time is double what it actually is.

127
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:13,000
They say it's like 75 minutes and it'll be half that. Yeah. There's a lot of bloated wait times going on right now for sure. OK, because I have I have thoughts and theories about that.

128
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But I don't we'll talk about that off air. Do we have to? What's the what are you worried about something? I'm not worried. No, I'll talk about it.

129
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I feel the theory is sorry to interrupt. The conspiracy theory is that they're bloating it for lightning lane to make it more.

130
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yeah. Oh, OK. So because because the Guardians, like it feels like every time I've been out in the last few months, it's like 75 minutes, 80 minutes.

131
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And I'm I breeze through that line. Yeah. And it feels like they're get they're priming people and getting them ready to go.

132
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Oh, 80 minutes. All right. How much? 15. OK. Yeah. Even rise of the resistance.

133
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I've been timing that a lot this this week and last week since they put it on a standby wait. And that's been 30 or 40 or 50 minutes under the post to wait sometimes.

134
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Because I was giving this theory to somebody else. I was ran into some friends and then I told them the theory and they're like, oh, we'll check.

135
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And then two hours later, they were like, yes, you're right. It was half the time. Yeah. I feel like they're yeah, I feel like it's real.

136
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I feel like this is a conspiracy theory that's real. Yeah. Yeah. It was kind of that same way in Florida, too, because I got the Florida and

137
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Cali, Anaheim touring plans apps a month or so ago in anticipation of going down to Florida.

138
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And I did find like touring plants was usually pretty accurate, like usually impossible to predict, like phenomenon of like, OK, they're holding the entire standby line

139
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
because there's a full family that doesn't know how to scan their lightning lanes. The cast members over and everyone's overwhelmed.

140
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And it's Disney Plus Day and no one knows what that means.

141
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So weird phenomenon would pop up that like, oh, no app could account for this. Yeah, it's scary accurate sometime.

142
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Can I say something, too, about Disney Plus Day? Yes, I feel like at Disneyland, they had a big blue carpet out covering the entire entrance of the park.

143
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Well, really into the train station and stuff. OK, I feel like that's a future like look at this weird thing that happened at Disneyland 20 years ago.

144
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Disney Plus Day. Remember Disney? Oh, yeah. It's just gigantic blue carpet like one of those like it's tailor made for.

145
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Wasn't there a thing where there was an Olympic size swimming pool on Main Street? Yeah. It's one of these oddities like really?

146
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Or like when Chicken Little was hovering over MGM Studios? Yeah, totally. That's going to be when Disney Plus is dead and gone.

147
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah, the pod. Yeah, the pod. Like whoever is us in the future like that as a theme park, like whatever nano podcast would just be like,

148
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
did you know there was a blue carpet out 20 years ago? That's weird.

149
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And it goes it's a nano because it's like nobody needs headphones anymore. It's like little nanotechnology allows it to just be in there.

150
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And then some auction way down the line will sell pieces of the carpet for like $2,000. Oh, yes. Disgusting, stinky pieces of the carpet.

151
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And that, yeah. Well, I mean, we'll all be like go and see it before it's auction and go, oh, it's a carpet. I was alive.

152
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I tell my grown child, you brought me out for this. I mean, I consider there was an eBay auction for some of the inflatable Castle Cake.

153
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yeah, I remember panels not too long ago. And I was like, I don't know how well verified this is.

154
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And also this might stink like this sort of industrial rubber that was sitting in the Florida sun and humidity for whatever that was.

155
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah, they should really disclose at an auction if something's going to smell, if it's something's going to be smelly, something's going to be smelly.

156
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Good condition, lightly stinky, a little stinky. Is there a guy, do you have like, how often are you doing something that maybe you haven't done?

157
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Is it pretty much like it falls into a couple of categories or like once in a while are they like, we need you to count how many people buy mozzarella sticks at the stage door?

158
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Even though I think I don't think they offer them anymore. It's pretty consistent on what I do for work.

159
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But it just depends on what the stats team needs and any given time. Like right now, for example, rise of the resistance just switched over to standby.

160
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So I've been told to go to the park and rope drop rise of the resistance and time the weights for the first couple hours of every day.

161
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So we can get a solid prediction set up for that for the future. Gotcha. Are there any other people that are doing like your job for a different organization?

162
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't think so. I think a lot of them, a lot of the other non Disney wait time apps just scrape Disney's wait times and just be done with it.

163
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So you're the only person that has your job probably in the world as far as I know. Yeah. But then we have our Florida researchers.

164
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:03,000
We have two researchers for Walt Disney World. Right. Gotcha. I was wondering if there's like a group of like people like they're all doing a different but yeah.

165
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah. Yeah. You ever seen the episode of step by step at Disney World where there's a character named Flash who's trying to break a Russian guy's record of go doing all the rides and Disney well, the rides and shops and restaurants.

166
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And Disney World in four days. I haven't seen that. But that sounds like a TGIF plot point.

167
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Like a thing that wouldn't happen. There wouldn't be a Disney like NASA headquarters with a bunch of people in lab coats.

168
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And I guess does that sound do you think that if you watched that, would it resonate at all with your job or would you just think, oh, this is wildly inaccurate?

169
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yeah, I probably tear up and it would probably be like the Bible. You know, I'd get really emotional watching it.

170
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Finally feel seen. Yeah. Representation television.

171
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Okay. Well, to bring it to the Bears. Yeah. After several people had said that you're a Bears fan. I think I looked at your Twitter and then indeed you had just posted this this pile of merchandise that you just come across.

172
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yeah, I mean, I was going to bring this up later, but Japan still really loves the Bears out there. Yeah. Yeah. And they regularly release merchandise.

173
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So recently they released a line of plates and trays and cutlery.

174
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:38,000
This is new. It looks so like cool and it's brand new like, and so out there they have, you know, the Country Bear Theater where Country Bear Jamboree plays and then they have hungry bear restaurant.

175
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And it's it's all curry. Every dish there is curry. So in this new line of merchandise was a curry bowl and like a curry like a wooden. Yes. I know what you're saying is I look at this.

176
00:16:49,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Their curry is pretty good. That's like it's pretty good to in that. Yeah. We ate there. Yeah. Yeah. They used to have a curry house in in LA here and it was the same company.

177
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I think it was called House Foods. Really? Oh, really? It would be like my little bit of Tokyo Disneyland food here in LA, but they they got bought out by hometown buffet and they they closed all the curry house location.

178
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:26,000
That's how evil is that? I thought you were in it for a COVID closure somehow, but I didn't expect that even worse. Yeah. How long was it? I'm going to be so upset that I could have gone to that.

179
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And it was it was like a year and a half ago. Yeah. This Japanese curry around. Maybe not that Japanese curry. It exists. That is, of course, there's. Yeah. But that's a little piece of Tokyo.

180
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Right. And our yard. You know, so also sorry, the they they love the bears. They're still releasing stuff. They just announced days ago they are going to sell Country Bear Jamboree branded packets of curry that you can take home.

181
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Really? Wow. I swear. Look it up.

182
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So great curry because I know it universal in Osaka. They have like cup noodle with like Spider-Man. Yeah. It's Spider-Man themed cup noodle that you can take home with you. Yeah.

183
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Wow. So is that I'm trying to think in Tokyo. Is that uncommon where it's like they have I mean, I guess like in the whatever confectionary or whatever they call the bakery or whatever there. But I'm trying to think is there other like food items that's branded with a character there?

184
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yeah, they'll they'll do they'll do like they're they're moving through the food so fast there. They're coming out with new stuff all the time and retiring old stuff. Like I remember they had a couple a couple trips ago. They had this Chippendale like pastry and it was it looked like a peanut.

185
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And one half of it was sweet and the other half was savory. Wow. And then in universal Japan especially like they they had the it was like a jaws some kind of breading with a hot dog sticking out. Yeah. And then like I saw that back draft.

186
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
They had a body bag with like a turkey leg inside.

187
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Wow. Yeah, so good. So good. Yeah, that's kind of the secondary element I think of when I think of factor. Yeah, go to the fire first. Yeah, really think of human human suffering.

188
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:37,000
The cost of our set of malicious ours. And now you get to enjoy and enjoy it with your taste buds. One more thing about in Tokyo the the hungry bear restaurant in the lobby for country where theater they have a napkin from hungry bear and written on it is the lyrics to the

189
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Bear Band Serenade. So it's like Henry was in hungry bear having a meal and he jotted down the lyrics. It's just it's so good because there's like a little glass case of paraphernalia stuff. That's very get back just you know you said where he doesn't know where inspiration is going to strike.

190
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:10,000
If it's at a restaurant than it is the napkin dirty. I think I met with is the napkin knew because we ate there but I missed it. I know it's in the lobby of the show the theater. Oh, I missed it there to the year. They also have a cover of climb magazine where they were named.

191
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yeah, I mentioned climb yesterday and there's something where is this the same thing actually where like there's musical notation scratched out where like he makes the dears. This is E and this is G. Yeah, that's that's so cool. It's a cool lobby.

192
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I mean so well this implies that you see you've seen you've been to Japan you've seen the show in Japan. Oh, yeah. Was it exciting to see it there was the enthusiasm high. That's what I found. So I got I got legit emotional because so let me let me just let me just give a little history here.

193
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Yeah, please. I've had a Disneyland annual pass since 1994 and before that I would go almost every week with my mom because one of her friends dad was like a old time monorail pilot who could get us into the park for free whenever we wanted.

194
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So, growing up country bear jamboree vacation hoedown was my country bear show. Oh sure yes because they just switched over to it permanent right and I didn't see the original show until I went to Disney World in 96 and 2008 those were the only times I saw the original show.

195
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Wow wow okay. So, yeah, it and then it closed on September 10 2001 I think which ended up not being the worst thing to happen that week.

196
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And then, yeah, going back to Japan I think about 15 or 16 years later and seeing the vacation show again it was mind blowing it you know some of the songs were in Japanese and some of them were different like Trixie sings a key breaky heart.

197
00:21:48,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yeah, it's so weird that one opened later it opened in 94 right they gotta keep it relevant. Yeah, relevant to them. Yeah. Did you know at the time what you were going in for was it like, like, did somehow they say it's going to be this one, or did it just wash over you like oh I haven't seen this in decades.

198
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Yeah, I mean I knew we were going to be there in the summer season so because they still show all three shows there they cycle through all three of them is while they get in there they change those clothes, unbelievable, they put the sandwich and Trixie's hand, the sub.

199
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Yeah, that's that's so cool. Did you find that the audience loved it. Yeah, they're that that show is still very popular, it's in a it's in a really prime location as well.

200
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And it's also right off the parade route and prades are just massive yeah it's like one of the main forms of entertainment there. So it gets a lot of traffic, and yeah people are really into it and if they keep doing the merch obviously like people are buying it and it's popular,

201
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:03,000
because they, they they also released over the last few years, a line of plushies of all the characters.

202
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And then also for each of the shows, the seasonal variety of the shows so it's like, there's so many of these stuffed bears now and they're like $18 each and me almost a 40 year old man just having a big box of stuffed bears in my closet.

203
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Well I came back from Japan with like it was unreal how many little bags I had because like they always have to give you one and like, like, geez I'm like, like the pile was like 50 deep and I'm in America I'm not a theme park merch buyer at all.

204
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Yes, I was shy just like could not stay away from everything there was crazy. Yeah, yeah, I got my sister the sun bonnets in the bathing suits. Oh yeah, they have of course good stuff.

205
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Do you are you so like, there's so many different, I think we've talked about a little bit on the show. There's like services now to get merchandise from Tokyo Disney, and have it sent here.

206
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Are you generally just buying it when you go there or do you are you in got like something going on. I'm buying it when I go there I mean I haven't been since 2019 now because you know, you know,

207
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Yeah, but yeah I have some friends over there that are able to send me the stuff and I just pay an insane amount for shipping but I don't have to pay like the service charge that a lot of those personal shoppers do.

208
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Geez, yeah, it's a whole industry I've looked into yeah yeah I'm not gonna start doing it. I'm saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I bought some I bought that popsicle shirt.

209
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Yeah, I did a free service. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I didn't just like take a picture. Oh yeah you bought that for me. Yeah, yeah. Right.

210
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Yeah, vacation hoedown specific although feel free also any bare stuff. Yeah, yeah, if there's anything that made you fall in love with the franchise, although I guess you were saying, vacation hoedown was was your first.

211
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I mean vacation and Christmas when Christmas would roll around which is also a great show but I'll get I'll stick it to the I'll keep to the vacation version.

212
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I wrote some stuff down. Oh, if you don't mind we just get into it.

213
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:24,000
So, the original country bar jamboree opened in Disneyland in 1972 it was so popular in Walt Disney World that where it had only one theater that in Disneyland they built two theaters because they're like this is going to be a hit, people are going to love the bears build two theaters.

214
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
So that was really all that was back in that corner of the park in bear country.

215
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It was a dead end, and it brought in the people for a couple months. But then it kind of slowed down so they said, we, you know, we need to, we need to do something about this.

216
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So Tony Baxter and his team were thinking about reworking the land but that was going to take several years. And so these two young imagineers came along and they said, why don't we just make a new country bear show that we can get together in six months or a year instead of, you know, 10 years.

217
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So,

218
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
David fighting and Michael sprouts were the two imagineers. Okay.

219
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:15,000
They were big fans of the country bear jamboree and they said quote those bears must get tired of singing the same old songs over and over again.

220
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
They said this in the Disney News magazine in an interview.

221
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So they pitched developing new shows to Marty score, and they showed him sketches that showed hey we can take this these existing see stages and bears and we can redress them and write new songs and make a new show.

222
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So, Marty saw the potential and he approved.

223
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:56,000
So the, the Christmas show was first was the first one to come along. And it was a big hit. And so they pretty much immediately like within months approved a another new show, which ended up being the vacation version.

224
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So they, they, they did that and it opened and it was also a hit but but ultimately it slowed down again because again there was still no attractions back in that corner.

225
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Yeah. And so can I just say to some things I love about the vacation version is that it builds upon the lore of all the bears. I feel like in such in such believable ways, like you can see.

226
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You can see shaker being kind of like a duet artist singing with a little penguin or a little octopus.

227
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:48,000
You know Henry with his with his old camp t shirt on, you can see him being kind of nostalgic for being back in camp and still hanging on to the shirt. I don't know I just growing it a little bit it's getting dirty.

228
00:27:48,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Yeah, it all makes sense in the character it all makes yeah it's not like they just threw it up in the air and said well who cares about keeping consistent with the narratives that we've, or whatever yeah the character games of these different pairs.

229
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Yeah, I love hearing that I like I did not know any of that that it was done by that it was developed by people who were fans of the original now to measure it because you that makes so much that it's like, it feels like a cool like you know, hey Oakley and Weinstein on the Simpsons like started watching it and then they were now they're running the show.

230
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Right now like what do we want the characters to do what a dream. It was like a mini version of that. It's that's very charming.

231
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I almost brought up the camp grizzly shirt when we were talking about merch because as soon as I saw that I was like, they have to do a camp grizzly like they do all these throwback things.

232
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:45,000
You are wearing these at the yesteryears. Yeah, this is yesteryears with big Al in his vacation.

233
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Right. So he's flannel shirt and his little minor hat and whatnot. Yeah, his little teddy bear.

234
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Yeah, I have that. So I think that would be a hit if they sold that shirt. Also, if they sold as a half shirt, that would be very funny because yeah, he thinks him.

235
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I mean, I don't know about it. I feel like, you know, two tops half shirts are very in style.

236
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
That's true. You're right. X number of years. That's true.

237
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:19,000
So to open the vacation show they play the great outdoors a song called the great outdoors great song probably one of my favorite Disney songs ever.

238
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Yeah, we were saying I was saying you I don't know if you find this controversial, but yesterday I was saying I like maybe a weakness of the original show is there's not like the hits.

239
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
There's not a great grinning goes. Yeah. And I think maybe great outdoors is as close as you come.

240
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yeah. And the Christmas show has tracks in the snow, which is also a banger opener.

241
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Just a total bop. So I'm such a big fan of great outdoors. I've always have been. I used to watch country bridge and very like multiple times a week at Disneyland.

242
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I just so I a few years back. I was watching the Disneyland fun sing along to. Yeah. Yeah. And they they do their great outdoors on there. Yeah, they they sing it on there.

243
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:15,000
So I'm watching the credits and I see this name great outdoors by George Wilkins and so I'm like I got to look this guy up. He's a genius. I don't know what else he's done, but he's genius just for the song.

244
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So I write him and I'm like your song changed my life.

245
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:35,000
So anyway, he's like funny you bring that up because I actually didn't write that song. My colleague, Phil Baron did and I wrote a song called great outdoors for Winnie the Pooh, some Winnie the Pooh project.

246
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:51,000
So Disney credited it wrong and and then he had Phil also write me and he said that even Disney mixed it up and he they were sending Phil's royalties to George for the song for a little bit.

247
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And once they realized it, they got it all straightened out and I've seen compilation CDs and since then that have credited correctly. So they they obviously did fix it along the way. This is wild lore.

248
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:25,000
They communicated with these people and found this clerical issue. This is what's often so infuriating like trying to research some of this stuff. It's like, okay, I went to a book. I went to a book by the company. I went to a primary as primary source I could get or even like if you try to reach out to someone and you're like, oh no, the book's wrong.

249
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And it's like, okay, well, I get someone doing like a Geo cities or a blog spot. They get a fact wrong or something, you know, but like when the when stuff like that is wrong or the company's paying the wrong person.

250
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It's just like, oh, well, what do you do that happen with the horizons where like the big mural at the end, I had found like one very old blog that said it's in a cast member building backstage and I couldn't find any one else.

251
00:31:50,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I like emailed every reporter I knew like, do you know where the painting is? I've heard it's preserved and no one email the budget report. I emailed. Yeah, email like Carly and Todd. And I was like, you know where the mural because I couldn't find any other.

252
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And then after that we put that episode out. Someone did tweet at me like, hey, another show just talked about this. This is the cast member building. It's in it is still there, but I couldn't find any other. I hadn't found anything else like after like a week of looking.

253
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:39,000
You think somebody would have snuck out a picture of it since then? Right, yeah. It's also massive. Yeah, gigantic. Yeah, right. So yeah, so they yeah, I watched that sing along to a lot. I remember as a kid not know. I knew they were the country bears, but I was like, what is this song from?

254
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Because I wasn't even aware of the multiple shows. I had just seen the regular show and it was only like maybe less than 10 years ago, right? I was like, oh, okay. And like I figured out what it was. But yeah, that is yeah. Yeah.

255
00:32:51,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You bring up not seeing the original or only seeing the original show and I'm that's one thing I've never gotten a clear answer on is why they gave up on it so fast at Walt Disney World because I think it only the vacation show I think only lasted there for less than 10 years, maybe five or 10 years.

256
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:24,000
92 I read 92. So yeah, there you go. Yeah. So what what happened there? Because they still would switch to the Christmas show up until I think 2008. But then they didn't want to pay the what I heard was like 50 grand to switch over shows.

257
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:33,000
That's what it cost like every time that that's what I read on Jim Hill's some some ancient Jim Hill Geo cities.

258
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:50,000
But yeah, they gave up on the vacation show so fast over there. Huh? I don't know. I like it's all you're already on vacation. Maybe there's more vacationers there. Don't want to be reminded they're on vacation. Yeah. The stresses of vacation. It's like a double up of it's a hat on a hat.

259
00:33:50,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Or is it just like we don't need to spend money because more of these people are tourists and you're you're seeing more like fresh eyes on the show right? Yeah, then you would on Disney at Disneyland and it's not popular enough like in Tokyo to warrant the price.

260
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Although in Tokyo you get the sense they spend money because it's fun. Right. Which is nice and they don't do that as much in the American parks anymore. Well, if they don't change the ending of a show about progress in the future from an ending scene where they say, boy, the 21st century is going to be great.

261
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Yeah, why would they constantly change outright song of singing bear show? That's a point. Yeah, but virtual reality and voice commands did eventually come back. They thought, you know what, if we just hold out a little longer, the Oculus is going to show up.

262
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
They're just waiting for laser discs to come back.

263
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So going back to there being two theaters in Disneyland's version of Country Bridge Ambry. This is what I think ultimately doomed the ride was because it took up so much real estate. Yeah. Yeah. I think if it would have been in Frontierland one theater, it probably would have made sense to keep it around.

264
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Because even by the end of the seventies, they were already thinking of cutting the building in half and re theming half of the show building to something else. What I read was one of the ideas was to make it something called Mark Twain tonight.

265
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:31,000
So they would have half the building would be Country Bridge Ambry and then the other half they would make a facade on it that would look like a building and then inside would be called Mark Twain tonight, which apparently was a one man show at the time.

266
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Oh, so it existed. Yeah. And this was in 1982. They wanted to make an animatronic version or maybe a live actor, whatever version of this thing called Mark Twain tonight. So that's something. Howell Holbrook? Was that what he was doing?

267
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Yeah. Howell Holbrook, I think. So they're trying, we got to cash in. All the kids are talking about the Howell Holbrook Mark Twain one man show. Playing your local performing arts center. Well before Val Kilmer also did.

268
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Before that the Val Kilmer one. Yeah. Mark, when you say Mark Twain tonight, the first thing I thought of was, oh, it's a talk show parody at late night talk show parody with Mark Twain. That's what I thought too.

269
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Which is by the way, a great idea. Yeah. So and then one of the other ideas was to re-theme Hungry Bear as a hoopty-doo style venue and show, which can you imagine that at Disneyland? How great that would have been? Yeah, I can imagine that. Yeah.

270
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:35,000
But then that's, but then like, were they still doing Golden Horseshoe then? Is it? Yeah, they were. Yeah. So they're now they maybe have two Western entertainment venues. Maybe that's why they decided not to do it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's already covered a little bit.

271
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Wow. That is Mark Twain. You're bringing us some deep stuff here. I will. Yeah. Mark Twain tonight will haunt my dreams. Yeah. Like Mac tonight, Mark Twain tonight. That also feels connected. I don't know. I guess that's the word tonight.

272
00:36:51,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Is if yeah, Mark Twain. So if there's animatronic standups and if Mark Twain likes him, then he gives him the wave over the couch and then yeah, slowly walk over here. Cigar.

273
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:37,000
And it's like, it's historical figures doing standup. It's like Ben Franklin doing standup or something. Like it's not just a random. Sojourner truth. It's Lincoln. Come on. It's also Lincoln. Yeah. Wow. That's insane. It's also you were sorry. You were just saying it was like there's no rides over there too. So it's like it's a victim of just traffic too. I know they were saying like it's also I've heard maybe Tony Baxter say the same like there's not enough traffic going there. Plus it's more of a

274
00:37:37,000 --> 00:38:07,000
local crowd. So it's more unusual to go to country bears a lot. Right. Like if you're a local because you've seen the show, you don't need to see it, which I was, of course I would disagree. You don't need to see it more than once every couple of months. Yeah. And you know, even in the last few years, the show was open in Disneyland. I can't even recall them running both theaters. Yeah, sure. Sure. Yeah. So you think, well, maybe can you definitively say, I mean, you were only eyeballing it then it was not your job, but you probably know the kind of

275
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:23,240
like the flow and capacity of Winnie the Pooh. Do you think it makes sense from a strictly numbers standpoint? Like did they make the right call just in the drive? That's impossible. You're you're you're going to say, no, it's got to be bears.

276
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:53,240
I mean, you know, who is one of the least attended rides in the park just by eyeballing it? I would say it's on a busy day. It's 10 minute wait. I'm sure more people write it than do country bears and the merch, obviously, because they blow out of the water though. It's not like tremendously more people than country bear. I think it is taking the merch into account. It probably that probably right. That's what makes it. Photo ops and states. It becomes like the Pooh corner. Yeah. Where Pooh corner.

277
00:38:53,240 --> 00:39:23,240
Is and where that that's that Pooh store is. That was all country bears stuff as well because they had the mile long bar where they had Max Buffen Melvin on the wall, which are in the Pooh right now. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That they're from the mile long bar. And then they had teddy bears swinging arcade, which they stole the sign up for outside of the building. Oh, yes. Yes. Yeah. That's crazy. That's where they had hoof and Henry, which is why this did not come up yesterday somehow despite a very long episode. Yes. Explain hoof and Henry. This is hoof and Henry was, I mean,

278
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:40,120
in spirit, it's still there as like Woody dancing Woody or something in in in frontier land. Right. OK. But it's this little arcade machine. You put a quarter in, you tap the buttons and you make this little marionette of Woody dance. Or back then it was Henry and it was called the Woody one. I don't think it's in frontier mercantile in in frontier land.

279
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:55,120
Oh, my God. Things I've never seen in Disneyland. Is it the same one as the Pinocchio one on Main Street? Yeah. Same thing. OK. And you can look at pictures, too, of the Woody. I mean, it's still the country bear stage inside the Woody arcade.

280
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:05,640
Right. Really? They just modded out the same. Yeah. And they sold hoof and Henry the puppet in one of the auctions a couple of years ago. And he went for like one of those now. Yeah.

281
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:18,200
One of any auctions. Yeah. Right. They also sold the marquee from the from the attraction. And yeah, we saw that. Right. Was that at the big one where we did the show? Yeah. That was from the that's that's from Disneyland. Yeah.

282
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:30,240
That's oh yeah. OK. That sounds familiar. And so I found the original guy, the original dude who did the woodworking Raymond. Yeah. Raymond. And I mean, I mean, and I'm just as Raymond.

283
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:43,680
I'm just everybody loves Raymond. Yeah. And I like, hey, what how much just just just just just a ballpark. Just a quote. Yeah. How much would it make to recreate that?

284
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:52,240
And he said, like, I will recreate it down to the precise detail for like 10 grand. And I'm like, OK, that's a little out of my price range. But thank you.

285
00:40:52,240 --> 00:41:02,160
He is so it's yeah. Boy, if you win the lottery and I follow him on Facebook or I'm friends with him, I think I'm like following him. I didn't like friend the guy. That would be weird. Right.

286
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:08,600
I'm following like his page and he does like a lot of I'm assuming you're following this as well. Yeah. He does like a lot of these customs.

287
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:14,400
So he will like show like he did a poo one or something. And it is just like looks like it belongs to Disneyland. Yeah. He did.

288
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:23,440
The how I even found out about him was somebody messaged me and was like, look at this. And it was some family commissioned their own country bear marquee.

289
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:31,520
But it said like the Smith family or something. Wow. Wow. Yeah. That does sound cool. Wait. So what's who's Raymond?

290
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:40,360
I got to look up his last name. Yeah. I don't call his last name. I have again. I follow him. I'll find it much more dignified than right after it closed.

291
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:46,360
I found a picture on yesterland of where they just covered the marquee in a seemingly a garbage bag, a garbage bag. Yeah.

292
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:53,280
God, there's a there should be another picture. It's like a little printout that says like the bears are harboring, harboring or something like that.

293
00:41:53,280 --> 00:42:01,080
Yeah. And they're taking their show on the road. Yeah. There's a new come on back for the new ride. Yeah. OK.

294
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:06,240
Raymond Kinman and Kinman. Oh, and that's his custom wood pieces.

295
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,880
That's his I mean, that's obviously the picture of it. That's his like whatever you call it. Sure. Photo on Facebook.

296
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,800
Oh, wow. OK. Yeah, it seems like I love my I love my Disney wood.

297
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:24,360
This is always thing. He's got a web website called Woodcarver. Hold on. Woodcarver guru dot com. That's a good name. Wow.

298
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:29,440
Yeah. And he's got different pictures like there's like I don't know if you can see this.

299
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:36,280
Here's like Chip and Dale with like a laugh at Daniels. So whoever the Daniels are had this commission.

300
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:42,880
Can you see that with the Disney? Yep. Yeah. So so what are you thinking you're going to get?

301
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:49,680
I think maybe we all know we need wood versions of the three of us as bears. Yeah.

302
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:54,240
OK. The good boys with us close to the two of G's.

303
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:01,400
You can get to the Disney. If you're a patron subscriber, if you would change your pledge from five to ten thousand,

304
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,360
appreciate that.

305
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,280
Geez. Wow. This is all crazy stuff.

306
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,040
This is a great outdoors.

307
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:18,680
I think one of the things that I it's very catchy, obviously, but I think lyrically, I think it stands above the rest

308
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:27,720
with the fun of like join us bears and suck up some air. Yeah. There's something so weird and brutal about that.

309
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:37,560
I was going to say this was like to me, it feels like it was almost the start of that 90s Disney like attitude a little bit

310
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:44,560
where like the ride the ride scripts were like a little sharp, you know, like the dinosaur pre show and the test track pre show and all that kind of thing.

311
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:51,280
Yes. Like they like Jamboree Vacation Hoedown. It's like it's it's it's really quick. It's quick witted.

312
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,080
It's sharp. It's fast. I feel like a lot of 90s Disney stuff was like that. Yeah.

313
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:02,720
I think it's funnier maybe. Yeah. The original. I might say some great lines, some great delivery.

314
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:11,760
Yeah. I laughed too when I realized what the clothes like I was trying to as as you know, I'm watching rewatching it more recently.

315
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:18,480
And I'm like, OK, yeah, California Bears. That's very funny.

316
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,120
What are the other singing in the rain ghost riders in the sky?

317
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:29,400
And I was like, oh, what's the closer? And then when I slowly dawned on me, it's thank God I'm a country bear.

318
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,360
I thought that was so funny. So good. Yeah.

319
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:37,360
To probably a good percentage of our listeners, that's a song by John Denver.

320
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:45,880
And to those same listeners, he was a singer long ago. This is an old reference and not as old as some of the ones yesterday.

321
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:50,440
But well, we have been talking about little Jimmy Dickens a lot and that's a much older reference.

322
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,240
Yes. His song was Country Boy, though.

323
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:59,440
Thank God I'm a country bear. He didn't write about bears. John Denver. More recent than Tex Ritter.

324
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,520
Yeah. Yeah. And Bob Wills. Yeah. Bob Wills. Yeah.

325
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:11,160
He's like a modern artist compared to those guys. Yeah. I'm also a fan of And If You All Don't Join Us, We'll Chase You Up a Tree.

326
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:16,000
I love the bite. There's a literal bite in this song.

327
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:23,360
Also, they for Trixie's song, they really got rid of all the like making fun of her for being a bigger bear.

328
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:28,280
Like she's just singing about I'm going to eat and everyone's like, hell yeah.

329
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:32,680
And I do you. Yeah, that's pretty well deserved. Yeah. That's the song.

330
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,680
In this one, it's the song about if. Wait, what is it?

331
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,280
If heartaches were fried chicken, I could buy them by the pound or sell them by the pound.

332
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,320
Yeah, I. And she's got that sandwich. Yeah.

333
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:48,400
That plastic sandwich, the sub. I.

334
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,640
I just that is like such an appealing.

335
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:55,040
I know I couldn't eat that, but don't you want to eat that specific this plastic?

336
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,360
Sub. Yeah. Did they ever? They didn't. They didn't sell that a country bear or a hungry bear, did they?

337
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:03,400
Oh, I wish that would. Yeah, that would be. That's a bit submerged.

338
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:10,680
There was a video. I was there was a video I was watching that really maybe was the same one of the show where it like really like feels like it features the sub.

339
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:16,080
Like it feels like I feel like the sub is really picking up like three, four quarters of the frame.

340
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:20,160
Yeah, there is a shockingly good multi camera.

341
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Recording of this show on YouTube.

342
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,320
They get right up in there like they're walking around right up front.

343
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,920
Like, yeah. Yeah, very watchable. Yeah, absolutely.

344
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:38,440
You brought up a video. Look up this video. This this this annual pass holder party in 96 was legendary.

345
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:46,600
OK, was it? There there were several behind the scene ride experiences so you could go underneath star tours and see it.

346
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:52,920
The the simulator moving. The best thing, though, and the thing I was obsessed with, I think I did it five times.

347
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:59,600
You could go up on the stage of Country Bear Jamboree and it was when the vacation version was was installed.

348
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:07,160
And you can look up a video of people walking through it and there's several pictures out there of people posing with the bears.

349
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:13,400
It's just amazing. That's actually how the Country Bear Jamboree fandom found out.

350
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:23,880
You know, it's a raccoon. Sammy the raccoon is a or Sammy the Sammy the raccoon is a skunk in the vacation version. Yes, but they never name him.

351
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:36,040
Oh, so so in in that video and in those pictures, each of the bears, each of the characters have name tags on and the skunk has a name tag, Randy.

352
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:40,760
So nobody knew it was Randy. No, it was really on the stage to know that was Randy.

353
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:46,360
And this wasn't even realized until maybe like five years ago in some Country Bear Facebook or something.

354
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,760
Wow. Well, it's not said in the show.

355
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,960
Not said in the show. Yeah. Geez. Well, so you got to do you went on stage with them.

356
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,680
Yeah. On stage and and a little bit of backstage. Yeah. Well, then they weren't moving.

357
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:02,240
No, not moving. No. So how was it because you were a younger man at that point.

358
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,680
Was that creepy at all? I mean, I was 13.

359
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:11,680
So I was I was probably like at that age where I should be aging out of country, but I was just more into it than ever.

360
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:18,960
Right. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm also just interested in this event in general because this feels like this is they'll never do this again.

361
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,480
Yeah. And I don't think they ever really did it again after.

362
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,160
I mean, they had annual pestle their parties. Right. Right. Yeah.

363
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,440
No, no behind the scenes stuff. But you don't get to go to the bowels of a ride anymore.

364
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:33,200
Yeah. Man, that's cool. Yeah. That seems beyond like it's too cool.

365
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,960
Now they because now the vents are all just like here's a button.

366
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,160
They were a couple of years ago they were doing it where like if you got up at six a.m.

367
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,040
and paid us five hundred dollars, you could eat on the Jungle Cruise.

368
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:50,400
Is that right? I don't think outside on the bank of the it's not in our boat, but you could pay to do that.

369
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,400
And then there was a Honomanche one right where you could like pay them eight hundred dollars and eat.

370
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,920
Yeah, I think that was a club 33 one. OK. You could eat in the portrait hallway. Yeah.

371
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,840
Oh, OK. OK. Yeah. There's pictures of that one. Yeah. OK.

372
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:07,440
And Bob Gur was in the graveyard scene. I remember seeing pictures of that. OK.

373
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,640
He was just hanging out. Yeah. Just hanging out.

374
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:12,440
Lying in a grave. He sat up. Hello.

375
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,320
Gotcha. I've seen that ghost.

376
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:21,480
Wow. So that's always I did think about like as a kid, I was like,

377
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:26,000
I would love to sing on the stage with these animals, but they really couldn't make that come true.

378
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,200
I guess that would be logistically too hard.

379
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,240
You know, we didn't talk about yesterday was the opening special.

380
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,440
This might have come up when we talked about the opening special a couple of months ago.

381
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:40,080
But you get the whole show essentially in the 71 Disney World

382
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:43,280
opening special and Glenn Campbell gets to be on the stage. Right.

383
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,360
It's to actually perform with live your dream.

384
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:50,920
Oh, they finally rescued him from the swamp underneath the monorail beams.

385
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,800
He's wandering through the opening. Yeah.

386
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,560
He's just singing verse after verse of a song he's making up on the spot.

387
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,960
Wish I had a flair with me.

388
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,360
All I have is a camera man and a sound guy.

389
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,880
Do you guys know where we're going? Yeah.

390
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,680
On your own, Glenn.

391
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,680
Other songs, obviously, hey, like now, why is it that I like this one more?

392
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,040
Yeah, why? The other one.

393
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,520
We got California Bears.

394
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,920
We got a Beach Boys. I'm a big Beach Boys guy.

395
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,000
I did forget this, though, that I think I have let it like

396
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,880
there's a bunch of odd little Beach Boys Disneyland connections that pop up.

397
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:37,320
And there's still a picture of the Beach Boys in the Lincoln area.

398
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,440
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Like great America.

399
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,800
Like I was there with my friend who was he said, like,

400
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:47,120
and you know, there's a picture of Edward James almost like, I don't know that.

401
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,600
Really? I like I didn't know that.

402
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,320
That's one of the more obscure corners in general.

403
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,240
Anyway, the Beach Boys are hanging out there and the Beach Boys

404
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,880
have got a song covered by an even better band.

405
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,240
The Sunbonnet.

406
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:05,840
The Sunbonnet Trio, another family got together, started harmonizing,

407
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,880
you know, just this family fun.

408
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,960
And then it blew up, took off.

409
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:15,240
And and a great backdrop behind the Sunbonnets as they sing California Bears.

410
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,280
It's all the bears relaxing on the beach. Yes. So good.

411
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:23,880
So the stuff on the screens is really under underrated,

412
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,200
but so good, like so funny. Yeah.

413
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:30,120
Like the on the road again stuff is all it feels like.

414
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,760
I feel like there's too much going on. You got to see it a couple of times.

415
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:37,120
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, the slides. Yeah. They repurpose the slides. Yeah. Right. Yes.

416
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,080
Well, I love how they made Wendell kind of this.

417
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:45,520
I don't want to say pathetic, but, you know, like the pathetic dad trope

418
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,680
they kind of gave to him in that and the Christmas show. Right. Yes. Yeah.

419
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:52,680
He's just kind of like a bumbling fool, but but so endearing.

420
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:57,880
So that's a great joke where an over it sounds like an overhead voice

421
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:00,600
is yelling at Wendell. No flash photography.

422
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,920
Like, sorry, that is really solid.

423
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,040
I remember that kind of tricking me as a kid.

424
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,880
Like, did something activate some robotic voice

425
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,800
that would play if you did something wrong in a ride?

426
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,720
And then when they say that means you, Wendell, like, oh, OK, it's part of the.

427
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,400
I think I think I bought it.

428
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,760
Well, and after he takes the picture, it shows the picture of the audience on this

429
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,920
on the slides and it's all bears.

430
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,080
So are we are we bears watching the show?

431
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,320
I think we're bears is the idea. Yeah.

432
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,440
There's like a premise to this that we didn't even know

433
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,640
that wasn't even established in the 70s.

434
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:40,400
Yeah. Similar to you put on the bug goggles and it's tough to be a bug.

435
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,120
Yeah. Or like Avatar or something.

436
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:47,200
Wow. It's pre dates Avatar and the transformation and the hookup.

437
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,840
That's where I got the idea from. It has to be.

438
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,800
It has to be for them. Yeah, not just the ride, but the films.

439
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,800
James Cameron got the entire universe from this one moment,

440
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,800
from this one bear photograph.

441
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:02,320
He predicts the design trend that like, yes, you are the star of the ride.

442
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,840
Like you are Spider-Man.

443
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,560
You are helping Spider-Man. You're not just an observer.

444
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,920
Verify yourself on this ride.

445
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,200
You verify yourself.

446
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:11,840
This is OK.

447
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,240
This is the only thing that could probably be misconstrued

448
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,560
as a bit of criticism for the ride.

449
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:20,040
And I so apologize for even getting close to that.

450
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,320
It feels a little too new sometimes when I watch the videos.

451
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,480
I like the feeling that the show is going to break down a little bit

452
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,680
or that the puppets are the excuse me, the robots look like they're going to.

453
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,080
The head's going to fall off.

454
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,040
There's something to that.

455
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,720
That is cool.

456
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:36,760
Do you disagree?

457
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,800
Agree with what I'm saying? The vacation one specifically?

458
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,760
I'm saying the vacation one.

459
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,320
Sometimes I see all the outfits look a little bit too modern for me, for my taste.

460
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,440
The outfits that were put in in 1986 are too modern for you.

461
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,320
A little bit too modern for me.

462
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:53,280
And I like seeing like the original version of the show on the video,

463
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,920
because I feel like the I keep saying puppets, the robots are like.

464
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,160
You're saying robots, the animatronics.

465
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,240
Yeah, but we say robots all the time.

466
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,320
You're going to hit him for that.

467
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,120
That wasn't that weird.

468
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,320
I'm just teasing because you're going in on yourself.

469
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,440
I'm just joining the fun.

470
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,600
It's a complaint on every episode.

471
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,640
Finally, it's been addressed.

472
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,320
My mom was upset.

473
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,520
You know, my mom was like, why do you keep calling them robots?

474
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,360
I go, because we say animatronics.

475
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,440
Whatever.

476
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:23,120
But yeah, I like there is something I like about the old one,

477
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:26,080
because I like imagining that it's been there for 100 years.

478
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,080
That's all I'll say.

479
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,400
That's the closest thing I can say to a criticism.

480
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,400
That said, as a compliment, this show really moves at a quick pace.

481
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,200
Like, yes, it's a nice clip.

482
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,360
It's a great show. I love the show.

483
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:42,200
Are you at all upset that we are maybe I will say I have definitely landed at

484
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,120
I like vacation hoedown better.

485
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,960
I definitely do.

486
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,520
That used to be a controversial statement.

487
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,720
I feel like with the generation before ours.

488
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,720
But yeah, I am firmly vacation is a better show.

489
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,240
And Christmas is also a very good show.

490
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:56,960
Crazy.

491
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,600
It's not crazy.

492
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,000
I'm not upset.

493
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,440
I like the original better because I just the older the older it gets,

494
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:09,360
especially the closer to Bob Wills and little Jimmy Dickens, you get.

495
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:13,160
I feel like I feel more of a connection to that, like what feels like another

496
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:18,000
world of like old timey country music, music recorded in a tin can.

497
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,280
Exactly.

498
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,120
And then like, yeah, Bob, oh, like as long as that's in the feels like it's

499
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,760
recorded like, yeah, 200 years ago.

500
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:31,120
Since you brought up criticism, Mark Davis, who was the designer of the show,

501
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,280
he did not like the vacation or Christmas.

502
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,880
His wife, Alice Davis, also an imaginary also Disney legend,

503
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,800
said, why do they have to change things?

504
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:40,840
Why can't they just leave it?

505
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:46,440
So, you know, Jason says that in therapy every week.

506
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,480
Well, yeah, what's everyone else's problem?

507
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,240
Six million people of the world are assholes.

508
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:56,000
And I'm just there just trying to do my thing.

509
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,520
I'm thinking I'm back for that robot remark.

510
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,840
Zing. Yeah, no, I assume I assume if I sat down with Mark, I would say,

511
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,040
don't these costumes look too new? This is new.

512
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,440
These modern music market.

513
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,040
You're like, yeah, you're right.

514
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,800
Got to go to the old school. This is crazy.

515
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,000
This is when why do things have to change?

516
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,680
This is the this is often where the I'm not we sometime.

517
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,960
We certainly have our things where we don't want them to change.

518
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,960
But I feel like overall, don't you feel like we land in like,

519
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,840
this is the opinion of the like backwards theme part?

520
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:33,840
I'm not against the show being I love the idea that there's multiple shows.

521
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:37,560
I'm just saying if I had, I'm just trying to feel out all my thoughts on it.

522
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,200
And that's just a thought I have about the newer shows.

523
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,040
But I like I wish there was a new show every month.

524
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,520
Yeah, I wish the Bears were singing Gangnam Style.

525
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,280
I want so, yeah, a couple of things.

526
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:52,280
And I say this every time anybody puts a mic in front of me, I say,

527
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,000
Pete Rennaday is still alive.

528
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,880
The voice of Henry Disney.

529
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,040
If you're going to do a new show, do it now.

530
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,360
He's like 95. Wow.

531
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,600
Get get a microphone over there. Do a new show.

532
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:09,720
Yes. And also, this is also from I think it was Jim Hill posted this rumor

533
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,000
years ago, probably like 10 years ago now.

534
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,040
He said one of the ideas being thrown around for a country bear modernization

535
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,480
was called a barricade idol.

536
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:26,800
What were the bears with modern songs and the audience would cheer

537
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,880
for which songs they liked or performers?

538
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,320
Oh, my God.

539
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:35,040
And, you know, who knows, that could have just been somebody's napkin pitch.

540
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,360
Yeah, probably never even got far.

541
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:42,080
But that's the only modernization of the show that I could find.

542
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,280
Oh, my God.

543
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,400
Baby, you're a firework.

544
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,640
Come on, let your colors grow.

545
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,160
That sounds great. I'm not sure.

546
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,080
That sounds awesome. I would love that.

547
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,760
I do know what I think we like that.

548
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,560
I think I would askew I don't want judges in the audience.

549
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,400
I don't want to big Al is Randy or whatever.

550
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,800
I'll maybe I do as I'm saying it, because I if they had done that

551
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,200
and then it's still locked in place and it's several generations

552
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:11,000
of American Idol judge ago, like they have not like, no, all I was so long ago.

553
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:16,000
But I think we maybe we want the modern songs in the jamboree setting.

554
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,560
Maybe that's the ultimate.

555
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:22,640
Yeah, like a country versions of of modern songs, even to sections in

556
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:27,840
in a show now where you would have like the younger bears in the show play

557
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:31,040
like a modern a couple of modern songs for the kids in the audience.

558
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,520
No, baby Oscar finally grows up.

559
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,960
There you go. Oh, he's like, well, he's in his max goof.

560
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,120
He's like he's 15 or so age. Yeah.

561
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:45,320
He looks he is wearing like a scout uniform and his teddy bear

562
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:48,480
has a little kerchief in the show. It's very cute.

563
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,760
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

564
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,440
I have the little plush of that.

565
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,400
Oh, wow.

566
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,160
They just released a plush where Oscar's little teddy actually squeaks too,

567
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,160
which I thought is such a nice. Wow.

568
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,160
That's a great touch. Yeah.

569
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,480
Mike, what you want is like you want to like a boy band going on.

570
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,560
You want you want Bear T.S.

571
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,720
Yeah, I mean, I do want that.

572
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,800
Seven member bear band.

573
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,360
I always forget what's the band that's the band that's

574
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:19,440
that Mickey special from a few years ago that Mickey breakdances.

575
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,120
I for my favorite clip on YouTube.

576
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:25,440
Other than other than seeing Mickey drum, it's my favorite thing.

577
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,040
Like Mickey in a suit does.

578
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,920
I love watching Mickey drum, especially in Tokyo at the big.

579
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,720
There's a lot of numbers in NCT 127.

580
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:36,000
Yeah. Mickey's 90th spectacular.

581
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,320
Mickey breakdances with that band. And I love that.

582
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:41,400
And you make Lindsey's mom watch it again this Thanksgiving.

583
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,400
No, we had too much Beatles to get through.

584
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,920
But I have made I have made her watch that.

585
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:51,280
I want the country bears maybe to just watch it again.

586
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,080
Country bears maybe to just recreate.

587
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:59,080
Can we just program all eight hours, feed the audio of get back into.

588
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:04,000
And it's just noodley like it's it's as slow as that documentary often is.

589
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,840
Yeah. Yeah.

590
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,240
Just watch the whole bear show with.

591
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,720
But also, can you dub though?

592
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,360
I kind of want the voices to.

593
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:15,120
Yeah. The acoustics ain't great at Twickenham.

594
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,240
The technology. Can't we go back to Apple?

595
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,560
The technology exists for them to do that right where it just transfers it.

596
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,040
I think some things we haven't said yet.

597
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:29,320
A lot of stage time for the five bear rugs.

598
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,360
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

599
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,520
They get featured a little more.

600
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:37,040
I feel like they get swept under the rug a little bit on the other show,

601
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,440
even though they're in the back.

602
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:41,280
Did they all sing as opposed to in the previous?

603
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,600
Like, aren't they more instrumental in the first one?

604
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:47,480
And then they all get little moments and ghost writers in the sky.

605
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,080
Yeah. And and really the opening great outdoors also.

606
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,200
They get like a couple words here and there.

607
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,760
Yeah. Mm hmm.

608
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:57,520
I think the ghost writers in the sky is very charming and it helped

609
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:01,280
save that song for me, which has been tainted for a long time

610
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:06,960
by its inexplicable appearance in Blues Brothers 2000.

611
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,080
Has anyone ever seen that?

612
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,160
I haven't, actually.

613
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,080
Yeah, I somehow haven't.

614
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:15,400
I don't say inexplicable in the songs in there.

615
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,800
That makes plenty of sense, but it's just this like

616
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,280
long, jokeless.

617
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:25,960
And then like the sky opens up and there are literal ghost writers.

618
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,400
Yep, it just like how have I watched an awful thing?

619
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,480
How did why did a studio finance?

620
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:37,120
There was a Nintendo 64 game about Blues Brothers 2000.

621
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:40,280
I remember reading about a Nintendo power.

622
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,200
Yeah. Do you play as them?

623
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,240
Do you know anything about it?

624
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,880
I don't know anything about it.

625
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,520
Oh, my gosh.

626
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,400
In that level of graphic.

627
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,520
Oh, my God.

628
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,040
Well, we got to go.

629
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:51,760
Are they on the road?

630
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,720
We're doing in the New Year.

631
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,600
I mean, there's there's been there's a Blues Brothers episode for sure.

632
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,200
That's they performed in theme parks.

633
01:01:59,200 --> 01:01:59,960
There's plenty to talk about.

634
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:03,720
Well, then we've we also discovered that there are like there are alternate

635
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,360
Blues Brothers touring.

636
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,840
Well, yeah, yeah.

637
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,880
So like they've licensed or whatever, or they have us like,

638
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,440
what would you even call them like?

639
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,520
Like sub Blues Brothers touring.

640
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:20,000
But then also you can still see Dan Aykroyd and Jim Belushi

641
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,600
touring as the Blues Brothers.

642
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:24,360
You have to make sure that to check the casino schedule

643
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,520
to see which version of it is, is just like two younger guys

644
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,480
like performing the old stuff or is it Danny and Jimmy?

645
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,360
Well, I saw for Ghostbusters Afterlife, the media tour.

646
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:39,720
For some reason, Dan Aykroyd just starts singing on so many of those interviews.

647
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,000
And then that's a nice show.

648
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,880
Suffice it to say those have gone around a text chain of ours.

649
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,200
Yeah, yeah.

650
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,000
So he still looks great.

651
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,800
He still got it.

652
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,960
Yeah, I always had it.

653
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,560
Loves a little spook.

654
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,280
This will get the kids into the sea.

655
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,000
Yeah, this movie for babies.

656
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,280
Let's put this old man

657
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,480
swinging his hips up there.

658
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:08,280
Cool. Screaming.

659
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,520
Very old man doing a gravelly Robert Johnson cover.

660
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,080
Well, Bill Murray tries to remain in the literal shadow.

661
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:18,920
He like, like, can I just be in the dark and move around?

662
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:22,280
Am I a supportive enough friend if I do that?

663
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:27,120
Speaking of things kids would be like,

664
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:31,320
I know young Jason would have been very excited to see Swing and Teddy

665
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,880
Barrett come out and sing it in the rain.

666
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:36,280
You know what?

667
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,960
This has been this has been sick of me since yesterday.

668
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,560
I feel like I'm watching performances because we discussed how do you say the name?

669
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:46,440
Sometimes I'm watching Henry and I'm like, he's kind of saying Swing and Teddy Barrett.

670
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:50,240
I think it depends on what you're do you have a ruling on this guy?

671
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,240
I mean, I don't have the twang.

672
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,160
I'm a I'm a California boy.

673
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,360
I got the surfer accent, right?

674
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,360
So, you know, you couldn't possibly.

675
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:01,760
Yeah, that's what I can't tell is if that because you only hear Henry say it

676
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,000
and there's the twang. Yeah.

677
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,520
Yeah, it's confusing to me.

678
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,920
And it's spelled A. It's spelled B-A-R-A.

679
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,560
Probably Barrett. I've Shazam.

680
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:11,800
No, I'm saying the opposite.

681
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,840
You know, I'm saying it's Barrett.

682
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,160
You're mumbling. It's probably what I think anyway.

683
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,560
No, no, I'm saying I'm I'm Shazam.

684
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:19,880
Kazam. I'm confused.

685
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,960
I'm convincing myself it's Barrett because she's a bear.

686
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,640
Yeah, it probably is Barrett.

687
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,920
Maybe. Yeah, I know, because it's after because it's because it's Theodore

688
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,840
Barrett, the the old actress. Right.

689
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:35,280
Which this is I don't know how this I don't know how you didn't bring that one up.

690
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,720
Yeah. How did a Barrett reference?

691
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,960
You had your shot. I know.

692
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:44,760
Well, one thing's for sure is that the vacation show really hammered home

693
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,920
how horny Henry is for Teddy.

694
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:49,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right.

695
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,080
You're in a little more so.

696
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,440
And the first one's already a little. Yeah. Yeah.

697
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:55,400
Yeah. Now I forget how does it go further?

698
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,760
What is the flirtation?

699
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:01,120
Oh, well, the Christmas one is come up and sign my cast.

700
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:03,120
And he says, soon as I find a ladder, I'll be there.

701
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,200
The first one, though, that's similar.

702
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,600
There's no ladder in the he says, like, I'll see if I'll get a ladder.

703
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,000
I'll be right up.

704
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,080
He says that in the first one.

705
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:11,880
And then he makes the noise.

706
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:13,680
I think I said yesterday he was like,

707
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:18,040
like, there's some really, really intense noise he makes.

708
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,880
Yeah. Like some grunting, lustful noise.

709
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,880
Peter Rennaday dug deep for that one. Yeah.

710
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,520
That came from the soul.

711
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,200
Yeah, we need to get him desired.

712
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,360
As you were saying, Disney needs to get a microphone in front of him

713
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,720
so he can do that again. Yeah.

714
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:34,720
We need to get a couple more of those on tape.

715
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,880
Can I say something about a voice actor?

716
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,440
The great Frank Welker. Yes.

717
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:42,960
In this show, he's Melvin in this and he's Randy the skunk

718
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,360
and Frank Walker.

719
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:48,320
I'm so obsessed with and impressed by.

720
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:52,000
He's been Fred and Scooby Doo since 1969.

721
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:56,200
He's Abu Raja and the Cave of Wonders in Aladdin.

722
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,240
He's the Mars Attacks aliens.

723
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,760
I didn't know that till recently.

724
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:00,760
Quack, quack.

725
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:03,440
One of the craziest sounds you ever heard in anything.

726
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,280
None of these things sound like each other.

727
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:09,920
I feel like I used to only know him as like if the Simpsons needed a monkey

728
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:13,040
or like he's the best animal guy. Yeah.

729
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,720
But his just rather voices and stuff are so great.

730
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:18,040
In theme park world,

731
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,880
Zerg in Buzz Lightyear, Mr.

732
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:25,920
Eggs in Kitchen Cabaret and Megatron in Transformers.

733
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,920
He's Megatron in everything but the movies.

734
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,080
So in the ride as well.

735
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:37,640
And just when you say putting microphones in front of these luminaries,

736
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,680
I've been plugging in a ton.

737
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:43,280
I apologize. But the new show Saturday Morning All Star Hits is out.

738
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,640
And we got to work with Frank Walker.

739
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,920
It was a zoom. We couldn't even see him.

740
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,680
I know he looked like but like this was like such a dream to get him.

741
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,360
Would he do it?

742
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:57,440
And it's not it's although he oh, he did do some animal stuff for us, too,

743
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,520
which ruled. I forgot about that.

744
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:03,440
Anyway, if you check out the show is up on Netflix, check out episode six.

745
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,640
He plays a character named Ronnie Selfish.

746
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:10,760
It was a huge deal to get to have him to be a villain and do crazy laughs

747
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,160
and then like bring some of the Megatron.

748
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,480
We're all nerding out a ton.

749
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:18,920
So I was earnestly thrilled about that.

750
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:23,000
And you didn't have a chance to ask him about any of the bears.

751
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,480
No, no, no.

752
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:28,000
I don't think I knew the.

753
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

754
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,360
And say it's tough on a zoom.

755
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:34,880
But I hadn't done my country bear Jamber Week research yet.

756
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,800
I scarcely knew he was Randy or that Randy's name was Randy. Right.

757
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,320
Now we know we know so much.

758
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,360
That's very cool.

759
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,840
Can I bring up a slide that I like?

760
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:49,400
This slide that shows the Statue of Liberty is a bear.

761
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,360
Oh, yeah. Good stuff.

762
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,280
Yeah. Really good.

763
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:55,200
Does it imply I mean, we don't have to get too bogged down in this,

764
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:58,680
but does it imply that it's a bear, a complete bear world?

765
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,480
Like we were saying in the picture.

766
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,240
So like when we enter there, we all become sort of bears and we are.

767
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,520
It's like a window into their universe.

768
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,760
Yeah. Exclusively bear.

769
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,280
But it actually history played out in a similar way.

770
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,560
Obviously, like Bear France gave us that statue.

771
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,760
The French bears gifted it to us.

772
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:23,000
I have to imagine that history played out in a similar way. Yeah.

773
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:29,360
Yeah. And it greets bear immigrants coming from the bears from other nations.

774
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:32,440
Yeah. They seek to be everything of a bear.

775
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,360
A bear. Yes.

776
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:38,560
So, you know, so yeah, it would seem to imply an alternate timeline

777
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,920
that I'm interested in. Yeah.

778
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,560
Yeah. I want to go there.

779
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:46,680
Yeah. I also want to just let's stick with the history

780
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:51,120
and convert all the presidents, the controversies that will always be from now on.

781
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,280
Just make them all bears. What a great idea.

782
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:56,080
That's right. And you have to think of puns for every.

783
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:00,400
Yeah. That's true.

784
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,720
Sounds like we could do that, though.

785
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:02,800
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

786
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,320
Have to stare at him for a while.

787
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:07,920
But, you know, of course, when in doubt, it's just Joe Joe Baird and.

788
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,520
And yeah, yeah.

789
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,640
For, you know, well, he's already Teddy.

790
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:13,800
So he's oh, yeah.

791
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:17,520
But because it'd be Franklin Roars of Elts if you needed to do.

792
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:18,600
Yeah. What do you say?

793
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,720
I think of something different.

794
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,800
Take the Teddy away because that's that's too obvious.

795
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,080
You're right. It's already.

796
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:26,320
Yeah. And you know, when they say Theodore, so it's they use the proper name.

797
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,440
Yeah. That shows they wouldn't even let you get away.

798
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:31,240
All right. Theodore Roars of Elts. Yeah.

799
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,120
All right. So that's an overlay.

800
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,600
Mark Davis be damned.

801
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,280
That's an overlay.

802
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:41,320
We're demanding.

803
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:45,040
What is doodles of the Hall of Presidents were much more whimsical.

804
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:49,640
They were all it was like

805
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:53,640
Millard Fillmore was like like putting out a fire with his butt.

806
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,920
Fun little hijinks. Yeah.

807
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:01,000
More presidents butts were on fire in the Mark Davis version of Hall of Presidents.

808
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,520
Martin Van Buren is trying to like steal a picnic basket.

809
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:07,720
What other shit?

810
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:10,040
I mean, those are the songs I noted.

811
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,640
I singing in the rain is a lot of fun.

812
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,000
Yeah, that's a good outfit.

813
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,960
I like that you're right. It's very modern.

814
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:21,760
It's bright that the like slicker that it's a great outfit.

815
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,080
Again, I don't think outfits are really good.

816
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,520
I'm just saying for my personal taste.

817
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,560
Yes, it is. It feels like a more modern outfit.

818
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,920
I like after there's is it is it like does this

819
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:36,920
the rainstorm kind of build to a torn and then it goes dark?

820
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:41,080
And that's maybe when Ghost Riders in the sky happens.

821
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:44,560
There's just a sequence in it where then it gets very dark

822
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,920
and there's that like night cricket chirping atmosphere

823
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:53,440
for a little bit that I think that's just a tone that Disney does so well,

824
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:56,440
that I'm so nostalgic for.

825
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:59,400
The it's I feel like American Adventure is stuff like that.

826
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,880
And the, you know, the beginning of the Blue Bayou and Pirates.

827
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,520
I just I like my Disney cricket chirps.

828
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:06,560
They're always great.

829
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:11,200
We hear Oscar speak for the first time in that in that part,

830
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:14,200
because they say Oscar, you want to hear a story, a scary story.

831
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,600
Yeah, it's like that's all we need.

832
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,280
Uh huh. Is that all he says in any of them?

833
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,560
Do you think? I think so. Wow.

834
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,400
Huh. One line wonder.

835
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,640
We don't know whose voice is probably not sure.

836
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:28,000
Probably not documented very well. Yeah. Yeah.

837
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,120
Just like so much about this this version of the show,

838
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,360
it there's nothing out there. Yeah.

839
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,160
I've asked imagineers over the years,

840
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:37,440
like, do you know anything?

841
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,480
Do you know anyone who worked on this? No, nothing.

842
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,600
Like nobody knows anything about it.

843
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,080
It was just a just a quiet little project.

844
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:45,400
That's so interesting. Yeah.

845
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,640
You would think. Yeah, I guess.

846
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:51,880
When when was there a shift even in just like somebody's going to be interested

847
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:54,360
in rides and the history of it?

848
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:56,800
Obviously, like there's a lot of stuff from Haunted Mansion Pirates,

849
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,560
but it does feel like that's a switch just in culture in general.

850
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:01,920
Like we should document everything.

851
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:05,240
And even back whenever this when these two were made, it's like,

852
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:08,080
no one's going to ask us about this ever again.

853
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:11,320
Yeah, I'm curious about what the first thing was also

854
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:14,320
that kind of got the ball rolling that made Disney realize

855
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:15,960
people were interested in that sort of thing.

856
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,920
Yeah, I don't know. That's a good question.

857
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,440
I'm going to say I yeah.

858
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,640
I mean, it all feels like mid 90s seems like when all right,

859
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:29,000
like Comic Cons are getting bigger and yeah, like Star Wars isn't going anywhere.

860
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,920
People are only going to be more interested in this and it's not niche.

861
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,040
It's not just what nerds are into. Yeah.

862
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:38,360
Yeah. It seems like like from that point, like, yeah, nobody's outgrowing.

863
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,600
All the things are obsessed with that they grew up.

864
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:44,200
So start start having some stories and keeping track of some stuff.

865
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,120
Oh, I was going to say for the public.

866
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,560
Yeah, I think that that timeline sounds about right.

867
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:53,840
But I mean, the Disney archives, I mean, that was kind of

868
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:58,680
they had been saving a lot, although you always hear the stories about that guy.

869
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,800
Is it Dave Smith? Yeah.

870
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:04,200
Like they were going to just get rid of a bunch of stuff.

871
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,920
And he like saved it from the incinerator.

872
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,560
I mean, his story sounds like quite a story.

873
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,000
And like maybe it'd be interesting to see a movie

874
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,560
where you get to see what a young Dave Smith was like.

875
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:18,240
I don't know if you know where I'm going with this, Jason,

876
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,960
but there's there was some discussion on our socials

877
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,720
of who looks like a young Dave Smith.

878
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:26,440
Oh, don't. Oh, man.

879
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:28,320
The dream. Oh, I'll do it.

880
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:32,120
Have you seen it like I did? Oh, man.

881
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:36,560
People at fan you're being you've been fan casted as Disney archivist Dave Smith.

882
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,840
I'll take it. You know, I lost out on Jughead.

883
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,600
I lost out on, I don't know, Pugsley.

884
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,480
There's probably been some Addams Family.

885
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,480
We put a shot at Pugsley.

886
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:50,000
Like Pugley is an adult Pugsley show coming soon.

887
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,880
I how they I guess they're animated that.

888
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:55,240
We said, yeah, sure.

889
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:58,240
And yeah, but yeah, no, I'll do it.

890
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:00,320
I'll do I'll do.

891
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,120
Yeah, happy, happy to do it.

892
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,000
Look at the photos. It is pretty good.

893
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,240
Yeah, I see it. I'll take it.

894
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:09,840
I saw there was there was like an hour special in the archives

895
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,800
recently went up on Disney. Yeah, yeah.

896
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,160
I feel like he wasn't his hair wasn't so unkempt, though.

897
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,920
So you might have to trim.

898
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:19,800
I'll hit up Floyd soon enough.

899
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:22,600
Give me the Dave Smith, you'll say.

900
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,960
You know, in the photo for the barber.

901
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:26,360
I got to walk. I got to walk along Alameda.

902
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,640
I got to walk in front of this lot of punch.

903
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:34,080
You know, we haven't talked about Rufus, the disembodied voice

904
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:40,000
Rufus that is stomping around and that has to solve problems in the show.

905
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,400
I forget if I said yesterday that that how that feels like one of the more

906
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:47,240
Muppet show ish elements, just like stuff's going wrong.

907
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:50,640
And now this huge character's got to go take care of a tech problem.

908
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:54,120
Rufus is this whole I'm no expert on this

909
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:57,360
like backstage manager there kind of thing.

910
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.

911
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:03,400
But isn't this a character who even predated?

912
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:05,000
I guess no. All right.

913
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,880
Disney bear country only ever existed for the country bear jamboree.

914
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:14,280
But when you walked into bear country, there were big growls.

915
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:17,320
And that was this character Rufus, a bear that you didn't see.

916
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,880
Yeah, it was. He wasn't in the show yet.

917
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:22,120
It was a cave and you could hear a bear snoring.

918
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,160
That's what it snoring. OK, OK.

919
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:28,040
Which you can still hear on on Splash Mountain that you go by

920
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:31,640
rare bears, little hut thing and snoring bear.

921
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:33,160
And that's the same snoring sound.

922
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:35,480
Oh, I didn't know that. OK, OK. That's cool.

923
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:39,800
That's an interesting like mythology jumping like was just in the land

924
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:43,160
ambiently and then ended up in country bear and now is in.

925
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:44,440
Yeah. Characters don't jump.

926
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:47,760
You are attractions that you're giving us so many things to annoy people

927
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,000
that will be there with soon.

928
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,560
Oh, yeah. Oh, did you know this is the bear song from what?

929
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,320
Well, OK, yeah.

930
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:57,480
I don't know if any of you remember the show at all, but that it was a really

931
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:02,520
convincing sound when when Rufus would roar and moan and complain

932
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,760
because it was it was behind you up in the balcony.

933
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:10,240
And so it would be like hit the lights, Rufus, and you would hear like stomp,

934
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:13,160
stomp, stomp from one side of the theater to the other behind you.

935
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:15,360
Really convincing. And I remember as a little kid,

936
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,760
I would always like look up and behind.

937
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,240
Oh, yeah. You thought you were going to see some.

938
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,880
Yeah. Yeah. It was so convincing.

939
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,160
Like really shook. Yeah. That's so cool.

940
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:27,240
On good context, because some of these things get lost when you just watch a video.

941
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:29,640
Yeah. Yeah. Effective, it was in person.

942
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,880
What did anything else you haven't called out?

943
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,400
Like just favorite moments or little things characters do.

944
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,480
Oh, wait. Big one.

945
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:41,360
Two different worlds.

946
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,800
Yeah. You know what I'll say about two different worlds.

947
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,360
So so that's the shaker Terrence.

948
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,760
He's singing to an octopus.

949
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,280
And we saw that in Japan.

950
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,280
And that's the one that I'm going to make sure I should probably make sure.

951
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,360
But I think it's that's when in Japanese.

952
01:16:55,360 --> 01:17:00,520
Yeah. And the difference is and it's kind of the same with the Christmas show, too.

953
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:05,400
The octopus has an articulated mouth and sings along with the song.

954
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:06,600
And right. His version.

955
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:07,720
Only in Japan. Yeah.

956
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:09,320
That was it was not that way. Wow. Yeah.

957
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:11,880
And this one, it was just that sound, which is such a great sound.

958
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:14,760
That was like, like that kind of thing.

959
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,960
And I'm sure somebody was going to bring this up.

960
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:21,080
But Dolores, the octopus is in the queue for Mission Breakout.

961
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,160
Oh, yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes.

962
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:25,240
Crazy. Honestly, I forgot it, but I didn't know that.

963
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,760
I swear to you, I would have passed the light.

964
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:29,120
I knew that I just was forgot.

965
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,520
And I was going to say, what's the name of the octopus?

966
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,640
Yeah. I was going to say, though, that like even not even know.

967
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:39,840
I mean, you could tell what the song was about in the Japan version,

968
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:43,960
but it's so funny and so funny in Japanese, too.

969
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:47,680
We were just like just the characters and yeah, what's going on?

970
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:52,200
But yeah, he's you're like, oh, these this octopus and bear are in love.

971
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,120
And as the curtain is closing and the lights going out,

972
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,880
you just hear him say, I thought you were going to help me sing.

973
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:58,960
So good.

974
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:05,000
Wow. It's a pretty perfect like, you know, that's like an opening.

975
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:09,160
Those curtains open and you see that tableau and he sings that line and like,

976
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,520
all right, I know everything I need to know about this.

977
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,720
Yeah. Now I can just sit back and enjoy it.

978
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:17,360
It's just a perfect like it's all contained in that first line.

979
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:22,840
And yeah, you most I guess almost all the numbers just because the bears look

980
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:27,280
funny and it's the music's fun and like they all play probably

981
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,400
really well in any language.

982
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,240
Yeah. You still go, oh, that's funny.

983
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:34,440
I don't know what they're saying, but less melancholy this show,

984
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,920
except for Jesse. Yeah. Yeah.

985
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:40,960
That's you know, that achy breaky heart is so funny.

986
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,320
I will try to isolate a clip of that.

987
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,040
Because that's in Japanese.

988
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:48,160
Like, well, the first half is in Japanese, the second half is in English.

989
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:50,080
Oh, OK. Vice versa. OK, OK.

990
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:55,440
Just a funny song to hear any of in Japanese and what a and so it's still that

991
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,720
like in 2021.

992
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,720
Long past Billy Ray's relevant.

993
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:02,080
I love that though.

994
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:05,640
One thing I wanted to bring up that I love about the vacation show is that

995
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:10,840
each bears little section of the stage got dressed

996
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:15,600
in rather than just being a normal curtain backdrop like shaker

997
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:20,240
and the octopus are on a little dock by some water.

998
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:25,360
And Ernest is out with a little campfire and his violin

999
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,000
has a hot dog on the end of it.

1000
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,440
And I just love that everybody gets their own background

1001
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,840
and it looks really nice and really dynamic.

1002
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:35,480
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, that's a great detail to point out.

1003
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:39,920
And I it's it just like it's really nice that what these overlays

1004
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:43,760
are spoiled down to is just like playing dress up.

1005
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:47,120
And when they install these, that just a crew gets to come in

1006
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,400
and put a scarf on this one and a shirt on this one.

1007
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:54,600
And there's something very like charming and lo fi about it.

1008
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:58,480
Yeah, Gomer's piano has a clam on it. A big clam. Yeah.

1009
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,000
Yes. Yeah.

1010
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,920
Oh, and he's in like one of those kind of frayed straw hats.

1011
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:06,400
Like it's all the all the pieces are flying all over, I think.

1012
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,200
Can I just bring up one?

1013
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,720
This is going to be so in the weeds.

1014
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,200
Just just so nerdy.

1015
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:16,680
Yes, he is in the American version of the vacation hoedown.

1016
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,480
I think it's bunny, you know, their bunny bubbles

1017
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,520
and be like in their swimsuits.

1018
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:26,000
Bunny is wearing sunglasses in the American version.

1019
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,280
The sunglasses are over her eyes in the Japanese version.

1020
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,720
They are above her head.

1021
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:35,280
I have a lot of Japanese followers that I've accumulated over the years.

1022
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:38,120
So I put the question out to them on Twitter one time

1023
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,040
and I got a lot of responses.

1024
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:44,360
And somebody said they think it's because in Japan

1025
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:47,400
they associate people who wear sunglasses with the Yakuza.

1026
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:49,280
Oh, wow.

1027
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:52,760
And so in the show, they wanted her to have the sunglasses up.

1028
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:57,080
But then I responded back and I sent a screen cap and I said,

1029
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,480
Gomer wears his sunglasses in the Japanese version and the American.

1030
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,680
Oh, interesting.

1031
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:04,280
What does Gomer get up to at night?

1032
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:05,320
You don't know.

1033
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:07,640
So he's the he's the quietest one.

1034
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:10,200
Yeah. What's he staying quiet about?

1035
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:14,080
Was it literally like they were like, well, these are these people are too young

1036
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:17,080
to be in the Yakuza, but Gomer, yeah, maybe.

1037
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,880
Yeah, he could be. So it's all right.

1038
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:22,040
Like it would it honestly, it was really more of an issue of like

1039
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,920
it made it unbelievable.

1040
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,760
It wasn't an issue of they were worried about the bears being affiliated

1041
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:27,720
with the Yakuza.

1042
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:30,360
How many bears has Gomer killed?

1043
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:33,720
That's the big question you come out of the show in bear Japan.

1044
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,920
I mean, he's got those fast hands to play the piano.

1045
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:39,120
He's probably stabs and shoots pretty well.

1046
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,440
And it's also true.

1047
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,440
Parts also piano wire.

1048
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,560
Yeah. Oh, he's got plenty of it.

1049
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,960
Perfect. String that back up.

1050
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,200
Wipe your hands of it.

1051
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,960
And the police, yeah, they go, oh, why you have all this piano wire here?

1052
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,160
And he's like, well, I'm a piano player.

1053
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:54,640
Makes sense to me. Yeah.

1054
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:56,360
Be on your way, sir.

1055
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:58,160
Wow. That's crazy.

1056
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:00,320
That's so funny.

1057
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,760
Wow. Wow.

1058
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,160
Well, what else?

1059
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:05,320
Anything if we were interested in here, but the

1060
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:08,320
in terms of the show in Japan,

1061
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:12,320
you know, we mentioned like, oh, it'd be interesting to ask Imagineers

1062
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,200
about making this.

1063
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,880
I would be so curious to hear

1064
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:18,920
the Imagineers who worked on the Tokyo version of like,

1065
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:21,520
how did you decide what songs to swap out?

1066
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:24,320
Is it just these songs are more popular in Japan?

1067
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:25,800
And also, how did you decide?

1068
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:29,440
Because there are chunks of it in English and chunks in Japanese.

1069
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:32,080
All the banters in Japanese.

1070
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:35,120
But some of the verses on the songs are in English.

1071
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:39,880
Yeah. And of the three shows, it's the most changed from the English version.

1072
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:43,160
Yeah. Like it has a whole new ending number.

1073
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,560
I forget the name of the singer.

1074
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:48,480
It's an American song called Vacation, V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N.

1075
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,600
Like that's the chorus.

1076
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,960
Oh, V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N.

1077
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:51,920
Oh, they sing that really?

1078
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:52,520
They sing that in...

1079
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:53,320
Connie Francis?

1080
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:54,960
Yeah, they sing that in Japanese.

1081
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:55,760
Perfect mic question.

1082
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:56,280
Yeah.

1083
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:57,760
Connie Francis?

1084
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:58,560
Connie Francis?

1085
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:01,400
They sing that in Japanese in the Japanese show.

1086
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:02,080
Oh, OK.

1087
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,200
But that's the closing one.

1088
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:04,240
Oh, OK.

1089
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:07,920
And then the walkout music does like an instrumental of that

1090
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:11,040
instead of the Thank God I'm a Country Bear.

1091
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:12,400
Huh.

1092
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:13,040
This is pretty...

1093
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:15,920
So even so, like within your overlay,

1094
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:19,720
you've like it's already different for all the overlay reasons.

1095
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:24,000
And then Japan is all other set of overlay differences.

1096
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,320
This is really...

1097
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:27,200
This is why there should have been camera crews

1098
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:30,160
when they were putting this all together, like in the get back sessions.

1099
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:30,760
Mm hmm.

1100
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:32,080
And now we would watch eight hours.

1101
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:32,800
I mean, we would.

1102
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,680
All of us would watch eight hours of like just sitting going like,

1103
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:38,000
which song is it going to be?

1104
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,600
Which song should it end with?

1105
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:42,200
Gotta do the Connie Francis number.

1106
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,320
Japan loves Connie Francis.

1107
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,120
It's a well known fact.

1108
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:51,040
Japan loves Connie Francis.

1109
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:54,640
I... well, I...

1110
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:57,560
I'm trying to think like closing thoughts here.

1111
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:03,200
I mean, I do like this thesis that this is maybe the strongest one.

1112
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:06,520
I think it's that there's so much that's funny about it.

1113
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:11,520
I see why you're passionate about this one specifically for sure.

1114
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,880
I mean, but you can make an argument for The Christmas Show too.

1115
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:15,880
Also, a lot of the same things can be said.

1116
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:17,560
It's sharp, witty, funny.

1117
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:18,760
Yeah, yeah. Quick.

1118
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,720
Anything you want to call our attention to specifically,

1119
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:23,160
I have not done my deep dive on it yet.

1120
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:26,400
Do you have a favorite moment of the Christmas?

1121
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:30,240
Oh, Wendell shooting out the lights and you hear...

1122
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,240
This is another thing lost to watching on YouTube.

1123
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,400
You hear the bullet bounce around the show.

1124
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:35,160
Ah, OK.

1125
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,720
Because Henry calls it out, watch out for that old squirrel gun, Wendell.

1126
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:40,280
Then it goes, and it shoots out the lights.

1127
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,160
You hear the lights going out.

1128
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,960
And then it's dark and he's just like, sorry.

1129
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:50,040
So he has another one of those moments like the no flash photography thing.

1130
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:50,760
Where you say, sorry.

1131
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:55,120
Yeah, yeah. Oh, that becomes just a great little more of a little character game.

1132
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,400
Yeah. Do you have more?

1133
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:59,520
Yeah. Is there like really like, do you have more bearer

1134
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:04,240
fandom even like that we might not know, like digging deep in your fandom of country bears?

1135
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:06,800
Do you know like you're on Facebook groups or something?

1136
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,880
Do you know of like, what is the fandom like in general?

1137
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:12,400
Because I actually am not on these groups yet.

1138
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:16,200
Yeah. When I did have Facebook, I was in a Facebook group.

1139
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:20,840
Like one of the members on there has like one of Henry's hats.

1140
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:24,560
And another guy has the banner from when the show premiered.

1141
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:26,320
And it was like, go watch the country bears.

1142
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:31,720
He has that. And but that, like I said, that's where the Randy Sammy thing came from.

1143
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:37,280
But really, there there's not like a website or anything where all the

1144
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,960
country bear. Yeah. Yeah.

1145
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:43,440
Just a lot of people on Twitter, you know, will tweet about it.

1146
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,160
But yeah, I don't I can't think of any central hub.

1147
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,960
OK, I'll investigate. Yeah. Yeah.

1148
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:54,200
And I think not to get off on a whole tangent,

1149
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:59,920
but just quick thoughts being that you're you love the mythology and all the shows.

1150
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:03,400
Any any thoughts on the feature film?

1151
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:06,720
Oh, I can't stand it.

1152
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,760
Thank you. I think it's so bad.

1153
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:13,040
OK. Like almost nightmarish.

1154
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,520
Well, I can see.

1155
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:18,160
Custom wise. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

1156
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:21,560
Yeah. But hey, they tried. Yeah.

1157
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:26,400
Uh huh. People put effort. The hairs were laid on suits.

1158
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:29,680
Yeah. A complicated puppet mechanisms.

1159
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:31,400
So people lost sleep.

1160
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:36,320
Scott, one thing we we neglected to talk about one of the big Al.

1161
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,720
Oh, yeah. Right. Big Al song.

1162
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:42,760
Uh huh. And now no longer like you're you're not just doing the text

1163
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:46,720
writer cover, getting our own like new big Al stuff.

1164
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:49,640
Yeah. Do we?

1165
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:52,040
This is what maybe this is one where the other one I would not

1166
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,280
because blood on the saddle is so funny.

1167
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:57,760
But what? Yeah. What do you guys think of the big on my way to your heart in

1168
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:00,320
America and then in Japan?

1169
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:03,400
It's I've been working on the railroad. Yeah. Oh, OK.

1170
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:06,520
These are fun. But it's yeah.

1171
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:12,240
I do like the dogs howling in the in his song in the American version.

1172
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:14,440
I think that's funny and kind of spooky.

1173
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:16,920
And he's got the little teddy bear on his backpack.

1174
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:19,800
I think like aesthetically, he he looks better and funnier.

1175
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:20,680
But yeah, I mean, blood.

1176
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:23,560
You can't beat blood. Yeah. Yeah. That's the yeah, for sure.

1177
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:26,040
It's so funny that we we keep going.

1178
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,160
We think of this.

1179
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:30,200
Have anybody been like, no, I don't like this bear singing this song.

1180
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,480
You know, like a bear singing.

1181
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,880
What what what bear singing what song will we go?

1182
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:37,320
No bad.

1183
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:39,480
I guess 90 minutes of it.

1184
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:43,480
Particularly like bear singing.

1185
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:44,960
OK, fair enough.

1186
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:48,880
I see. I see. This show in the previous yesterday show.

1187
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
OK, OK. I guess I get what you're saying.

1188
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,760
Maybe export these bears.

1189
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:55,240
The bears bear.

1190
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:59,120
No. Yeah, you know, the bear, they could sing the phone book.

1191
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:01,240
That's right. You upset.

1192
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:03,280
And they should bring them back.

1193
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:06,680
Let's get them programmable to do whatever we want.

1194
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:11,440
Any whims. But maybe we just make them do this show because it's so charming.

1195
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,520
Yeah. Sorry. Real quick.

1196
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:13,520
One thing I wanted to bring up,

1197
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:16,200
there are still remnants of Country Bear Jamboree in Disneyland,

1198
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:17,480
even though the show is long gone.

1199
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:19,760
Yeah. Yeah. Just over 20 years, which is.

1200
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,680
And they just added one recently.

1201
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:27,520
When when you get off Splash Mountain, there is a sign that's like

1202
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,120
Sammy's recycling corner.

1203
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:33,640
And it's talking about recycling because it's it's the ride sponsored by Ziploc.

1204
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:34,880
Right. Oh, yeah.

1205
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,640
So they you get off the ride.

1206
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:42,320
And it's like a painting of Sammy standing there going like recycle everyone.

1207
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:43,520
Wow. And it's new.

1208
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,520
Yeah. Like new within the last couple of years.

1209
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,960
Wow. Yeah. Well, that's so there.

1210
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:50,000
So there are obviously fans keeping it alive in imaginary.

1211
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,600
Yeah. And I want to know who presents yourself.

1212
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,200
I just I have so many questions.

1213
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:55,640
Yeah. Make yourself.

1214
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:59,320
Well, yeah, if you're listening or if somebody knows who did it, email us.

1215
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,640
Yeah. Yeah.

1216
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:03,960
No. And please, I correspond with them and then come tell us

1217
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:08,440
how it went down, because your correspondences are fantastic.

1218
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:10,560
Your deep facts are fantastic.

1219
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:12,400
Thank you for sharing it all with us.

1220
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,880
I saw you survived podcast the ride.

1221
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:16,880
So happy you could do this. Thank you.

1222
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,560
Yeah. What a blast.

1223
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:20,200
Let's exit through the gift shop.

1224
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,320
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

1225
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:26,440
Touring plans dot com and touring plans on all social media platforms

1226
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:31,440
and my own personal Twitter at guys, Selga, G, U, Y, S, E, L, G, A.

1227
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:33,960
Right on. And you can go there and look at those plates.

1228
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:36,200
Look at those curry bowls and spoons.

1229
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:39,760
I tweet about a lot of dumb stuff.

1230
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:40,880
Sure. That's good.

1231
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,600
That's better. Not like our Twitter.

1232
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,880
No, that's so different.

1233
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,840
It's for work. Yeah, we're working.

1234
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,480
Hey, so as for us,

1235
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,880

1236

1238
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,200
Thank you, Mike.

01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:05,040

1241
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:09,360
Merch is available in our T public store.

1242
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:16,160
And tomorrow, I believe the main feed goes into hibernation.

1243
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:21,600
But the Hootenanny continues over on the second gate,

1244
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:25,200
which is at Patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

1245
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:29,760
So come see where our Country Bear oriented twists and turns

1246
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:34,400
take us down there behind that their paywall.

1247
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:39,440
Remember, change your pledge five to ten thousand.

1248
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:45,440
Or if just a bunch of you change it to, say, a hundred and you all band together.

1249
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,240
I want one good benefit.

1250
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:48,520
We want a lot of weight of it.

1251
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:49,640
Yeah, a lot of work.

1252
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:50,840
What if they all do it?

1253
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:52,360
You can donate your plasma, too.

1254
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:54,640
And that's just not just you guys, the listeners, too.

1255
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:56,360
That's right. Yeah.

1256
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:57,400
Give us your plasma.

1257
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:58,760
Give us your plasma.

1258
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:01,440
We say here at podcast the ride.

1259
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:02,240
Thank you for that.

1260
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:04,480
That's right. Yeah.

1261
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,320
Tagline. All right. Bye bye.
