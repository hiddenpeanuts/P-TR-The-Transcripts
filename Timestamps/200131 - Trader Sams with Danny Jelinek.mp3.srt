1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,560
Dog.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,520
Warning, the following podcast contains murderous hippos,

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,760
free ads for Pluto TV and seats,

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,160
both the kind you sit in and the kind you sit on.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,480
Danny Jelanick joins us to sip tropical drinks

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,120
and talk about Trader Sam's Enchanted Tiki Bar

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,160
on today's podcast, The Ride.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,160
["The Ride Theme Song"]

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,400
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a podcast about theme parks

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,040
with hosts who would gladly buy a $300 leather-bound

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,520
coffee table book called Letters from Short Round.

13
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,360
I'm Scott Gerner, joined by Jason Sheridan.

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,440
The Short Round, I can't.

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,640
Yeah, it's something.

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,560
I mean, I would, I also would buy that book.

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,480
Oh yeah, come on, like the little,

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,360
I say that because that's a thing that exists in this bar.

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,200
Of course.

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,880
It's cutting a little deep, Mike Carlson is joining in.

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,920
I'm here, I would have to buy it.

22
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,880
If it's in the parks and it's a very obscure thing,

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,000
no matter what the inappropriate level is,

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,480
I'd have to own it, I think.

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,480
That's the way that my collector brain works.

26
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,320
But there's nothing, the letter itself

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,280
is just from a child's brain.

28
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,480
There's nothing inappropriate about that.

29
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,560
Sure. I understand that.

30
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,400
Yeah.

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,000
But everyone's uncomfortable with Short Round,

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,840
is that the?

33
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,920
A little bit.

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,040
Even though Temple would do my favorite of the Indiana Jones,

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,560
there's still some issues maybe in the 2019 context,

36
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,400
but we don't know.

37
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,360
I would imagine, I haven't seen it in a minute.

38
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,400
Yeah.

39
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,640
I would imagine roughly two hours of issues.

40
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,680
No, when they're in the mine cart, there's nothing weird.

41
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,160
The mine, there's like five minutes

42
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,560
where everything's fine.

43
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,480
Though I bet if you watch it, I don't know.

44
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,520
Yeah, maybe.

45
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,840
Maybe you're right.

46
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,440
Oh, there's all that problematic stuff.

47
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,040
Oh yes, okay, I get what you're saying.

48
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,880
Okay, let's veer away from all this.

49
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,160
Kate Capshaw does a terrific job singing

50
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,800
Anything Goes in Mandarin, Cantonese.

51
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,640
Oh, I forget.

52
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,280
I don't know.

53
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,320
I forget, I don't wanna say something wrong.

54
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,200
And then I will be canceled.

55
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,800
For not knowing the language?

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,600
Yeah, now I'm on edge.

57
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,960
Anywhere, like Indiana Jones and traps.

58
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,920
You have to avoid with every step.

59
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,440
Let's veer away from this and let's bring our guest into it.

60
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,440
He's a friend and collaborator of so many

61
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,880
of your favorite podcast kind of people.

62
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,600
That's accurate, what did he say?

63
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,120
He's currently a director for Jimmy Kimmel Live

64
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,000
and previously of Comedy Bang Bang,

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,880
Children's Hospital and Lords of Synth,

66
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,000
live at the Necropolis, it's Danny Jolenek, hello.

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,840
Hey everyone.

68
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,680
Hey Danny.

69
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,240
Welcome Danny.

70
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,880
I was also talking to all of you out there in Podcastland.

71
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,560
Oh yeah, that was interest to us.

72
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,280
And they all said hi Danny at once.

73
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,080
I'm just gonna say one just for them right now.

74
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,920
Okay, only them.

75
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,440
Hey everyone, glad to hear it.

76
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay, and that was for them.

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,840
You've said one clearly for us.

78
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,160
I'm assuming they said hi Danny, we're good.

79
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,600
That's why I said glad to hear it.

80
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,760
I don't know if they said those exact words,

81
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,480
but potentially, but you left the correct amount of space

82
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,720
for them to say those words.

83
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,720
Then I followed up with an incorrect response.

84
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,800
Yeah, because somebody could have said like,

85
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,720
oh I'm doing horribly.

86
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,560
Glad to hear it.

87
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,680
Not so glad to hear it, and then you're a villain.

88
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,720
Perfect, just as I wanted it.

89
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,960
Should I do one for the people who are doing well?

90
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,960
Yeah, do one for the people who aren't doing well.

91
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,600
Hey everyone, sorry to hear it.

92
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,720
All right, great, that works really well.

93
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,600
Except that you said hey everyone

94
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
and then that would have required them to say hi Danny,

95
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,920
I'm not doing so well.

96
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah, same.

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,800
They had to fill in a lot into that gap.

98
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,400
So you did one for the people that just sort of offer up

99
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,800
what their life is like right now.

100
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,440
You should actually do one, maybe two,

101
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,120
say hi everyone, how are you doing?

102
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,960
And then, you know what, let's do it later.

103
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,080
That'll be sort of supplemental.

104
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,400
I just wanna get out of the way.

105
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,200
Okay, yeah, don't forget.

106
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,480
Hey everyone, how's it going out there?

107
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,160
Glad and also sorry to hear it.

108
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,240
Hmm, so that's like if somebody has two pieces of news,

109
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,120
one good news, one bad news.

110
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,960
They can just pick.

111
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,520
I just got a new job but my car has been totaled.

112
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,680
So that's good for that.

113
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,280
Or I just got a new car but my job has been totaled.

114
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,160
This is like the Dana Carvey sketch

115
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,800
where he's Tom Brokaw or Dan Rather?

116
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,640
Tom Brokaw.

117
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,160
Tom Brokaw and he's trying to,

118
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,200
well he's on vacation,

119
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,120
he's gonna get all the different options.

120
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,440
Or the possibilities out of the way of a great sketch.

121
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,840
A very good sketch, yeah.

122
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,880
If there's a way to do like glad in one ear

123
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,640
and sorry in another so that you can shift binaurally

124
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,840
to whichever one was gonna apply to you.

125
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,680
Right, there's gotta be a way.

126
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,400
It's really complicated.

127
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,720
This one's just for the left ear listeners.

128
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,000
Sorry.

129
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,240
We know what you did, we saw it.

130
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,280
You thought you were alone but we saw it.

131
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,360
You think you're ahead of us left ears.

132
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,880
Circling back, double check, it is Mandarin.

133
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,720
It is Mandarin.

134
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,040
Oh okay, okay.

135
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,360
Great, good to know.

136
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,200
All right.

137
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,160
Everything has been correctly said

138
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,520
and we did a perfect beginning into this.

139
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,680
Danny, thanks for being here.

140
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,200
I'm a clunky to you all.

141
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm a clunky.

142
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,600
Happy, happy, clunky, yes indeed.

143
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,240
Yeah, I'm sorry we're here.

144
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,080
I'm sorry we're here.

145
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,080
We're gonna recount a outing we had now a while back.

146
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,160
We got delayed in doing this but maybe this is

147
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,440
a good little memory test to recall every step

148
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,480
of a very fun outing.

149
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,040
Oh yeah, this would be a good exercise.

150
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,880
Yeah.

151
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,700
Or a memory test as you say.

152
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,560
How good is our memory,

153
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,800
especially when you mix drinks into it.

154
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,360
Yeah, mixed, mixing in mixed drinks.

155
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,360
Mm, yes. Sorry.

156
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,480
It's a precarious little cocktail here.

157
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,520
Yeah, we all went down, or not all of us went down.

158
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,480
Mikey didn't go down.

159
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,200
I didn't go, I forget why, too long ago, I can't remember.

160
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, something lame and bad,

161
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,640
some audition that would have been bad if you got it

162
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,560
and was bad to try to do it.

163
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,040
Yeah, probably, I mean whatever it was,

164
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,200
it was a waste of time.

165
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,640
As are all things that aren't podcasts, the right.

166
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,480
Yeah, that's true.

167
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,320
I feel for us, not you Danny,

168
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,440
you do a lot of things that are not this.

169
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,520
This is the first time you've done this.

170
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,060
Oh yeah, this is the first time I've done this, yeah.

171
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,920
Yeah, yeah, so it'd be unfair to judge that waste of time.

172
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,760
It will show.

173
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,360
Yeah.

174
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,400
If it hasn't already.

175
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,280
No, not at all.

176
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,280
Yeah, well it's good to have you,

177
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,720
and you're a person who,

178
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,280
you're not a mega theme park obsessive as we are,

179
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,440
but it seems like you have a lot of appreciation

180
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,160
for the finer points of these places.

181
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,080
I feel like you're like a normie who does go to these places

182
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,440
and like them and find unique angles on them.

183
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,600
Yeah, I feel like including you guys,

184
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,040
I know other people who have highlighted

185
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,200
the finer aspects of a theme park,

186
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,040
and I used to appreciate the artistry of something

187
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,680
like Cars the Ride at Night,

188
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,360
just like on a pure visual,

189
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,600
like wow, this is beautiful looking

190
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,840
and took a lot of work and things like that.

191
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,240
Yeah, yeah, there's a real.

192
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,760
And I like the history of Disney,

193
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,840
like not like,

194
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,000
like of the artistry, the history of the artistry.

195
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,400
Sure, sure, yes, yes, yes.

196
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,240
I'm not just like.

197
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,200
Plenty of corporate intrigue as well, you know.

198
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,040
What's that?

199
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,480
I said plenty of corporate intrigue

200
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,520
in the history of the company as well.

201
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,400
Oh yeah, it's all very interesting, a lot of history.

202
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,920
I don't know, I just like, I like being there, it's fun,

203
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,640
but I don't go all that often.

204
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,040
Yeah, but you made it to DisneySea before.

205
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,200
Oh yeah, I did.

206
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,840
I mean, that was just like amazing

207
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,320
and a totally unique experience in my opinion.

208
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,240
Just, I'm sure you guys have talked about it

209
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,880
at length and everything, but.

210
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,720
Really have.

211
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,560
It's really so cool.

212
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,280
Even without having done like specific episodes,

213
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,960
just when Mike and I both came back from it,

214
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,120
it's just like, okay, blah, talk,

215
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,560
and then we both had two and a half hours of stuff to say.

216
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,520
There's so much there.

217
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,120
Yeah, well, peace, we're gonna,

218
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,440
we'll do three hours on each ride.

219
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,360
Yeah, eventually.

220
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,160
My favorite ride out there is the water one.

221
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,560
Oh yeah, oh, Aquatopia.

222
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,400
Aquatopia.

223
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,560
I love that you came back

224
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,120
and were really high on Aquatopia.

225
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,760
Yeah, you don't see anything like that anywhere else.

226
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,800
It's like you're gliding on water

227
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,600
and it's an incredible ride.

228
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,520
It's such a, and I didn't know what to expect,

229
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,640
cause I guess I kinda knew the aesthetic of it,

230
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,640
but I didn't know what it was once you got on it.

231
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,080
And then it's like, I don't know,

232
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,440
it's a weird little whirligig.

233
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,280
Yeah.

234
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,120
Spin around, it's just this little rock.

235
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,880
If there was no water there,

236
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,880
it would be pretty normal,

237
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,520
but just adding that layer is amazing.

238
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,320
It's so, and like beautiful to watch,

239
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,400
even if you're not on it,

240
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,080
just watching these odd little vehicles

241
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,960
just kind of push and sweep

242
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,880
the little thin layer of water around.

243
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,880
Yeah, and you don't know which route you're gonna get on.

244
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,720
You have no idea.

245
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

246
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,400
Oh wait, of the two sides,

247
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,240
but then once you're on it,

248
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,080
you don't know what it's gonna do.

249
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,840
There's that illusion that like the wall,

250
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,900
if you like look on beyond the ride,

251
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,000
there's like a little wall

252
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,320
and then beyond the wall, you see the ocean.

253
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,160
Oh, yeah.

254
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,040
The wall is just high enough to make you think,

255
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,280
it's like such a perfect illusion of like,

256
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,840
oh, just beyond the wall,

257
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,080
the wall's holding the ocean back basically.

258
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,440
It's like really cool.

259
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,800
And it's around there where there's like a fake leak

260
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,960
in the wall also,

261
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,640
like where there's water pouring through,

262
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,000
which really makes you feel that way.

263
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,280
Such a great detail.

264
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,360
If you get on the monorail,

265
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,800
that's back behind that wall.

266
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,040
So there's like a service road,

267
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,600
there's a ton behind that wall,

268
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,800
but it's that infinity pool effect.

269
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,640
It's so cool.

270
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,840
So best parts of Disney see that level.

271
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,680
Although it's all.

272
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,680
I was gonna say like it's all.

273
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,600
How can you choose?

274
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,440
Yeah, yeah.

275
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,200
Our friend Matt Mazzani just got back.

276
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,800
He just went and I saw him this morning

277
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,320
and I got that mojo from him.

278
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,280
How's it going, Matt?

279
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,600
Hey.

280
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,440
And what if Matt's-

281
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,260
Great to hear it.

282
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,100
Yes, great.

283
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,480
I think he might've picked up and responded.

284
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,520
He might've developed the pattern.

285
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,720
Sorry.

286
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,080
No, no, no.

287
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,160
No, you did perfectly.

288
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,000
Oh, thanks.

289
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,800
Yeah, he did immediately like I'm going,

290
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,640
I'm gonna go back.

291
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,480
Yeah, he was, yes.

292
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,600
Yeah, like how quickly can I possibly?

293
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,440
Yeah.

294
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,640
Did you guys eat in the cafeteria there by chance?

295
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,240
Near Aquatopia?

296
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,080
I don't remember.

297
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,080
Actually, I shouldn't go into this.

298
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,760
I don't remember what I ate or where I ate.

299
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,600
I just remember-

300
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,440
Do you remember any keywords?

301
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,000
I just remember the dessert was good.

302
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,640
Oh, yeah, sure.

303
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,920
I had a Nemo colored churro.

304
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,760
That was awesome.

305
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,280
That was wonderful, cause that's sort of a Nemo zone.

306
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,760
I was just gonna say,

307
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,380
I didn't realize I didn't say this on the show,

308
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,360
but now that we've,

309
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,760
there's been a little more attention to Donald Duck's seat,

310
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,080
as we call it.

311
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,120
I ate a Donald Duck seat Sunday.

312
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,960
What?

313
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,960
With like his little like feet

314
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,000
and the ice cream was like his seat.

315
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,640
The dessert was, we're talking about his butt.

316
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,480
We keep- The seat?

317
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,440
Yeah, we have this thing,

318
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,240
this new thing that we are doing,

319
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,680
where we call it his seat.

320
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,640
Well, he used to have a really big seat back in the old days.

321
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,720
He still has a pretty large seat.

322
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,160
No, but in the 30s, his seat was huge.

323
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,280
Was it bigger in the 30s?

324
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,120
Yeah.

325
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,320
Was Donald's seat bigger than the 30s?

326
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,160
It was.

327
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,000
I just watched it.

328
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,160
I just watched a Donald Duck,

329
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,040
or it was actually a Mickey cartoon

330
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,400
that Donald's sort of like a Woody Woodpecker type in.

331
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,400
On Disney Plus, it's like this one where Mickey's conducting

332
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,400
an orchestra and it's an incredible piece of animation.

333
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,040
Obviously, it's like 30s Disney, whatever.

334
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,040
But Donald the Duck, as I like to call him.

335
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,280
He probably was that at some point.

336
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,760
I couldn't help but notice the size of his seat.

337
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,680
So even you, we didn't,

338
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,640
we hadn't even talked to you about this whole seat thing.

339
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,640
Us and our fans, we're all admiring this duck seat.

340
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,800
Why would you call it a seat?

341
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,600
Because we're, I forget why it came up,

342
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,040
but we're all very, we poke around swear words

343
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,040
in the most goody two shoes way.

344
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,680
And that seemed like the least offensive way

345
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,800
of saying rear quarters.

346
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,120
Hindquarters.

347
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,960
Piney.

348
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,400
I mean, I'm looking at,

349
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,680
this is an evolution of Donald picture,

350
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,840
but not as like completely on his seat,

351
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,520
not showing his seat.

352
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,440
Yeah, number two is jutting out more.

353
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,920
Yeah, yes it is.

354
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,400
And his beak is longer too.

355
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,240
He's got a longer beak.

356
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,240
This is the Donald Duck seat I was referring to.

357
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,080
Pretty big.

358
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,920
Pretty big.

359
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,840
If you're Google imaging at home,

360
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,760
I'm looking at the, it's a yellow background

361
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,160
and it says Donald Duck,

362
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,360
and he sort of has this look like, I'm fine with myself.

363
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,480
It's funny that Donald, vintage Donald, I'm proud.

364
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,280
Text me that photo of Donald's seat

365
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,640
and I will put it on the Twitter.

366
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,080
I'd prefer they just Google it.

367
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,680
Put it in your file.

368
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,480
Labeled DS.

369
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,480
I'll print it out.

370
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,320
Code for Donald.

371
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,480
One for social media, one for iCloud.

372
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,400
Password protected, encrypted iCloud.

373
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,120
What'd you Google to find that, Danny?

374
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,120
Donald Duck's 30s seat.

375
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,480
No, no, just Donald Duck 30s.

376
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,200
I believed it for a second.

377
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,440
Somebody labeled it as such.

378
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,280
Wow.

379
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,840
This is one of those Google things

380
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,680
that we can affect possibly.

381
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,640
We had a thing a couple months ago, Danny,

382
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,960
that we were really delighted by.

383
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,120
Mike is a big fan of Avatar

384
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,640
and the Avatar experience in Florida,

385
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,040
and he, for many episodes, has talked about

386
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,160
when you do a journey, a ride on the mighty Akron,

387
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,600
and so many times you've said that specific phrase

388
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,600
when you feel the mighty Akron and he breathes between you.

389
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,520
And then once Google searched for mighty Akron

390
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,520
was actually done, it was just Mike.

391
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,360
Oh wow.

392
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,840
That phrase had never actually been used.

393
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,240
It might not be in the movie.

394
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,960
I may just have made it up.

395
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,800
Wow.

396
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,080
I mean, Akron is obviously what's in the movie, but mighty.

397
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:16,080
30s Donald and 30s Daffy both have very long bills,

398
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,920
I feel like.

399
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,480
They both evolve to fatter.

400
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,640
They evolved concurrently.

401
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,640
The way cartoon ducks evolve,

402
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,960
the beaks shrink and the seats shrink a little.

403
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,600
But Daffy does not have a thick seat, correct?

404
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,560
Oh, that's a good question.

405
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,200
Does Daffy have a thick seat?

406
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,040
Will you just give us a read on that?

407
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,880
Yeah, hold on.

408
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,560
We should look up Howard the Duck.

409
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,560
Yeah, Daffy's seat has never been big, I don't think.

410
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,720
In no point.

411
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,680
There's here's one where he's kind of sticking it out,

412
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,760
but in general, like that's just his posture.

413
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,600
Yeah.

414
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,200
Daffy got that Hank Hill ass.

415
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,960
Oh yeah.

416
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,640
That's straight down Hank Hill.

417
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,040
It's a little, it's not a bad seat by any means.

418
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,480
It's just that it's never been Donald's.

419
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,400
You're now wondering what podcast have I entered into?

420
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,240
I like it.

421
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,400
Talking about seats for this long.

422
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,240
Seat.

423
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,600
Yeah, there's Donald's seat.

424
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,040
We had some plan about, we had a tangent in an episode

425
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,800
about ranking the seats, like doing a tournament of seats.

426
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
And Erin listened to it, my wife Erin,

427
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,240
and she was like, that was very funny.

428
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,560
Please don't actually do the seat tour.

429
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,400
Okay.

430
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,720
The people demand.

431
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,560
What people?

432
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,200
Look, we've got five ranking.

433
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,400
We've got five tournaments to do this year.

434
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,800
But all right, they demand it,

435
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,480
but I'm gonna get a fucking divorce

436
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,640
if I do this two hour seat episode.

437
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,840
I mean, that seems like there's another issue at play

438
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,880
if that's all it takes.

439
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm only one seat podcast away from a divorce

440
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,360
at any given time. Oh no.

441
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,400
But maybe she needs to hear it first.

442
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,680
So we'll record it for two hours

443
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,640
and then if she doesn't approve of that,

444
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,280
then we won't release it.

445
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,760
Just crying like Sally Erie hearing Mozart's like,

446
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,840
it's beautiful, I can't be mad, it's too beautiful.

447
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,960
Scott, I was wrong.

448
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,280
I was wrong. You needed to do this.

449
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,600
The world must hear this.

450
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,880
In fact, to do another two hours.

451
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,120
It's not long enough.

452
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,640
You didn't investigate the seats enough.

453
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,600
Boys talking about big theme park butts.

454
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,800
All boy butts though.

455
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,360
Did you hear when Scott said butts,

456
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,840
it actually made it real what it was

457
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,880
and it was too much for you.

458
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,000
That's why seat, Danny,

459
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,040
to illustrate what we're talking about here.

460
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,360
That's why seat is so important to this conversation.

461
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,840
I think we should just do the tournament of seats right.

462
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,480
Right? Now.

463
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,800
Do you have any others in your head?

464
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,640
The tournament of seats.

465
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,600
Do you go to another character with a seat

466
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,760
from theme park or not?

467
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,800
Oh man.

468
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,600
I mean theme park preferably.

469
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,040
I'm gonna not answer it.

470
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,120
That's a very put on the spot.

471
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,960
I don't know.

472
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,800
I just don't know.

473
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,440
Brer Bear, of course, Splash Mountain.

474
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,600
Brer Bear, yeah.

475
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,280
Dream Finder, a bigger fellow.

476
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,680
I feel like no humans.

477
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,520
No humans? I feel like it's only animals, yeah.

478
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,360
Not even a literal imaginary,

479
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,720
not even a fictional imaginary.

480
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,560
How about R2D2?

481
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,440
Well.

482
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,840
Mm.

483
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,880
If he's all thick is the issue.

484
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,280
He's the same amount of width.

485
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,000
Is he Disney canon?

486
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,840
Yes, he is.

487
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,040
Well, he's owned by them now.

488
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,880
He's owned by them.

489
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,720
And was already from the rise.

490
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,560
He's all seat.

491
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,600
He's all seat.

492
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,680
Actually, looking at your Rex toy,

493
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,640
Rex technically, his bottom part is bigger.

494
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,480
That's true.

495
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,120
But I don't know, but it's bigger all around.

496
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,800
That's like he's got a big seat and a big,

497
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,520
you know, an equally thick pelvis.

498
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,360
And hips.

499
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,040
It's like a hoop skirt.

500
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,160
I think it doesn't work.

501
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,360
Pelvis makes me uncomfortable.

502
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,320
Is there a better word for pelvis that's a little safer?

503
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,440
Pouch.

504
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,280
No, no.

505
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,840
Front?

506
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,680
Front.

507
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,040
I guess front.

508
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,400
Like grill.

509
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,360
I think front is the best.

510
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,560
Yeah, front.

511
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,400
Front.

512
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,880
He's got a thick front.

513
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,360
But let's be clear, front isn't your like,

514
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,200
No, no, no.

515
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,800
It's like, it's just your front.

516
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,800
That's all it is.

517
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,760
No.

518
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,960
There's another, we got to dive.

519
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,120
How about front seat?

520
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,400
Yeah.

521
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,760
It does help explain.

522
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,720
Yeah.

523
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,560
But who, no.

524
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,880
You guys don't sound like you agree.

525
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,080
It was just a pitch.

526
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,920
Oh yeah, no.

527
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,960
You don't have to be polite, cause I'm a guest.

528
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,000
I could just say, no, that doesn't work.

529
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,240
That's exactly why we had to be polite.

530
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,080
No, no, no.

531
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,280
Don't just think of me as if I'm not here at all.

532
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,480
Well, if we do that,

533
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,840
you won't be speaking for the rest of the episode.

534
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,160
That's fine.

535
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,200
All right, that's it.

536
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,760
And you'll sit patiently while we talk about Trader Sam's.

537
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,440
Yeah, we all went down to Trader Sam's a little bit ago.

538
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,680
Now this is a, we, this was your topic suggestion.

539
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,880
And of course we had to do it.

540
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,080
This is a great thing to talk about for a little while.

541
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,880
Did we have to go do research?

542
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,720
Probably not.

543
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,360
We've all been, we remember it well enough,

544
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,280
but how delightful it was to do research.

545
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,120
It was great.

546
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,960
It was great.

547
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,780
It's nice.

548
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,640
It's such a dark restaurant to go into

549
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,880
on the middle of the day and just pretend it's night.

550
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,280
We did it at opening.

551
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,120
Yeah, like 11 a.m.

552
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,440
To make sure that we got in

553
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,880
because it can get a little crowded.

554
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,760
And you can end up out on the terrace,

555
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,680
which is plenty pleasant,

556
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,240
but that's not what we're gonna talk.

557
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,520
It's not what we wanted to talk about.

558
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,360
We wanted to see the effects.

559
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,000
Never sit on the terrace.

560
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,480
Don't ever do.

561
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,320
Demand perfection.

562
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,600
It's better to wait in the non-waiting area by the door.

563
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
Yes. Yeah.

564
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,880
You always want the indoor experience at Trader Sam.

565
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,800
Well, unless you want quiet.

566
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,720
And then the terrace is usually,

567
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,680
like they have like spruced it up over the years

568
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,600
and put an outside bar and.

569
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,440
They have some musicians though.

570
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,800
So it sounds like so quiet.

571
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,760
It's nice. I like it.

572
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,400
I would never say don't sit on the terrace.

573
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,240
Yeah.

574
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,520
Maybe if you want the terrace, go to the terrace.

575
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,240
But if you're there for Sam's, it's a pretty big let down.

576
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,080
Yeah.

577
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,800
I mean, if you're going to see Sam's

578
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,480
and you don't do it a lot or you've never done it,

579
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,520
you gotta do it inside.

580
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,680
Yeah. It's like immersive.

581
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,680
Sam's is chaos in the traditional,

582
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,680
like happy hour nighttime.

583
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,520
Oh yeah.

584
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,440
You have to like stalk seats together.

585
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,280
Yeah.

586
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,480
And seats, literal seats, not butts.

587
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,440
Literal seats, not butts.

588
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,280
Chairs.

589
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,160
Those chairs are not part of the tournament.

590
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,120
Yeah.

591
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,000
This episode comes with a key.

592
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,360
Yes.

593
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,200
The way I say seats.

594
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,040
Assault key.

595
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,040
Assaults that matters.

596
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,520
I say them in different ways.

597
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,680
In my head at least.

598
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,160
You kind of glaze over at seats.

599
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,000
You don't go.

600
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,840
Seats.

601
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,680
Seats.

602
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,920
And the same applies for front seats as well.

603
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,960
Yes.

604
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,400
In this context.

605
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,840
There's no front seats in the restaurant

606
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,400
unless you turn it around and sit on it

607
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,240
in the cool teacher way.

608
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,080
You see Slater.

609
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,120
Which is how I sat.

610
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,960
Oh, that's right.

611
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,800
Yeah, yeah.

612
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,320
You're like check this out, guys.

613
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,400
Guys, let me show you a trick or two.

614
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,920
There's this new way to sit.

615
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,480
I don't know if you know about it.

616
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,320
It's pretty rad.

617
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,680
We should say, by the way, just in case you don't know.

618
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,960
So there's two Trader Sam's establishments.

619
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,640
One is Trader Sam's Enchanted Tiki Bar,

620
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,320
which is at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim.

621
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,440
And then there's Trader Sam's Grog Grotto,

622
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,320
which is in the Polynesian Hotel in Disney World.

623
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,480
Yes.

624
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,120
The first opened May 2011.

625
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,600
That was the Enchanted Tiki Bar.

626
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,080
Grog Grotto came along in 2015.

627
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,720
And they're similar, but Grog Grotto has a lot more

628
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,320
20,000 leagues under the seats stuff.

629
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,080
Like a lot more. Under the seats.

630
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,480
Under the seats, all right.

631
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,920
You've upset Jason.

632
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm sorry, Jason.

633
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,840
Yeah, so they've been around for a little while.

634
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,360
Sam. He's in the zone right now.

635
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,440
At the Disneyland.

636
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,280
All right.

637
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,440
We're done with the seats part.

638
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,760
Okay.

639
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,720
All right.

640
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,400
I love throwing this out. Keep rolling, keep rolling.

641
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,240
Yeah, all right.

642
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,080
Keep rolling, keep rolling.

643
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,920
You're doing fine.

644
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,240
I'm doing fucking research every fucking episode.

645
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,080
Come on, come on.

646
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,560
Go through the research.

647
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,360
So, you know, LA, home to a lot of Tiki bars,

648
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,720
influenced the Imagineers as they were designing all this.

649
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,560
Well, if you want to be saying,

650
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,680
why are you saying it's so tired and beleaguered

651
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,440
if you were excited to say all this?

652
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,440
Oh boy, this is always my favorite part of every episode.

653
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,440
You just said you're excited to say the research,

654
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,800
and you're like, LA is home to all of the things.

655
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,280
It's called Casually, Scott.

656
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,120
It's Casually.

657
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,800
You're staring into the corner of the world.

658
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,640
Anyway, keep going.

659
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,480
God fucking damn it.

660
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,320
Actually, man.

661
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,120
No, what did you want to say?

662
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,440
No, it is a full size.

663
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
I mean, it is like a Tiki bar,

664
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,480
and like to the size of a Tiki bar too.

665
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,440
It is very intimate.

666
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,320
It doesn't hold a lot of people.

667
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,160
Yeah, which is.

668
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,680
Brombrato a little bigger.

669
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,640
A little, yeah, but it seemed like,

670
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,680
now I did get to go down there in Florida,

671
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,280
and I walked around it,

672
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,360
but it was very super jammed in there.

673
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,120
There was no way I was gonna get a seat.

674
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,960
I walked past the hostess and like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

675
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,680
And I'm like, I'm not trying to get a seat, I swear.

676
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,920
I'm just gonna take pictures for two minutes,

677
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
and then I'm gonna get out,

678
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,240
because it's like a lot of competition

679
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,680
for both of these places.

680
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,240
Neither of them big bars by any means.

681
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,480
They have a better system, I think, in Florida of sitting.

682
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,080
Like they have a, like they're more.

683
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,920
There's a list.

684
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,440
There's a person that's in charge of the list,

685
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,280
and they will like a little bit facilitate that.

686
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,120
Oh, I didn't even,

687
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,440
that didn't even register to me as a difference.

688
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,520
There is no host.

689
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,760
Yeah, there's nobody.

690
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,600
That's why it's just around.

691
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,440
It's just kind of.

692
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,280
It's kind of chaos.

693
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,240
A lot of the Anaheim bars are kind of chaos,

694
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,960
except like Carthay Circle has someone with a list.

695
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,920
And that's a little.

696
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,760
But that's, yeah.

697
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,760
But this, yeah, for Trader Sam's is literally,

698
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,440
like you ask somebody, they just go, I don't know,

699
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,160
watch, watch if someone leaves.

700
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,080
People just like end up in a big pile at the door.

701
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,920
Yes, yeah.

702
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,760
It's a big pile of people.

703
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,800
Which is sort of a stressful time.

704
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,640
Yeah.

705
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,600
So I'd be better to be deeper in that bar, if you could be.

706
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,960
We were close to the door,

707
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,120
but I didn't feel the weight of clusters.

708
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,960
Oh, no, no.

709
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,040
I felt plenty relaxed.

710
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,280
We were there like really early.

711
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,120
Yeah. Yeah.

712
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:04,940
That helps.

713
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,960
And that might be the tip,

714
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,400
if you want to make sure that you get in,

715
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,960
that you actually, the tip is start drinking at 11 a.m.

716
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,120
I've done it once that early.

717
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,040
And I don't know if you guys had this experience,

718
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,240
but I'm sure I've said this on another episode.

719
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,480
I was working on something

720
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,360
because I was doing a show at WonderCon in a few hours.

721
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,240
So I was working at the bar and somebody came in.

722
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,840
The bartender went, oh, hey, his name was not Mac,

723
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,280
but let's say, hey, Mac, how you doing?

724
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,080
The usual.

725
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,520
And the guy was like, yep.

726
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,800
And it was like 11 or noon or something.

727
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,480
And he just pulled up and that was his usual drink.

728
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,320
And I was like, wow, this guy's doing it right.

729
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,160
Yep.

730
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,000
This is how it works.

731
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,240
If you at home want to play Mac,

732
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,080
we could do that.

733
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,320
You can just ask Mac right now.

734
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,160
All right.

735
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,720
Right now you're Mac at home.

736
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,560
Oh, no.

737
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,480
No, no, there is Mac.

738
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,240
And Mike will play the guy who says, hey, Mac.

739
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,520
So I'm the bartender.

740
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,360
The skipper is what he did.

741
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,160
And I will do the sound of the door.

742
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,720
Wait a minute.

743
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,240
You're kicking it off is what you're saying.

744
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,080
Oh, yeah.

745
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,600
Hey, Mac, will you have the usual today?

746
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:16,840
Yeah.

747
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,680
Oh, do I say yes?

748
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,920
No, now you say very good.

749
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,440
You're right.

750
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:20,760
I'm sorry.

751
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,840
I fucked the whole thing up.

752
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,360
Back to one.

753
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:22,880
Back to one.

754
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,000
Hey, Mac, what do you have today?

755
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,920
The usual.

756
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,920
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

757
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,600
Wait, no.

758
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,400
Wait, that was right.

759
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,160
That was right.

760
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,560
They just told me some devastating news.

761
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,760
Yes, I need my usual more than ever because.

762
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,560
It's not going to fit in my car.

763
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,640
My car has been totaled.

764
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,840
Everyone I know is in a car accident, friends and family.

765
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,880
Oh, sorry to hear that.

766
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,640
19 people were on the usual.

767
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,120
19 people were in a bus to my birthday and the bus flipped.

768
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,800
So I decided to come to Trader Sam's anyway.

769
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,680
Sorry to hear that.

770
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,080
But you will you have the usual?

771
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,400
People really be able to make their own podcast, their own conversation.

772
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,120
We've had so many different scenarios now.

773
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,120
Yeah.

774
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,760
So leaving blanks is a nice.

775
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,000
That's what's great about technology.

776
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,440
Yeah.

777
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,160
One of the things.

778
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,360
That's the only one.

779
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,320
There's only one.

780
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,360
This is the first thing that's been great about technology.

781
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,680
So but, you know, it's an odd place to be a regular because the, you know,

782
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,560
if you're really wanting the full Trader Sam's experience, you want you're

783
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,560
probably getting big crazy drinks that are on fire and stuff.

784
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,960
Which if that's your usual, it's a pretty insane usual.

785
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,360
Also, having a laptop at that bar, they squirt water at you and stuff.

786
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,440
Well, I didn't have a laptop that day.

787
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,240
Have I?

788
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,600
I've never actually I've had my laptop down there at plenty of the hotels,

789
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,360
not at the bar at Trader Sam's.

790
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,040
I would have this place to do it.

791
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,680
I would hope they didn't squirt water at you because they can control that.

792
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,840
That's not a thing.

793
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,600
That's like a bottle.

794
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,160
Yeah.

795
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,400
So they're like shipwrecked right on your laptop.

796
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
Straight at the ports at the USB.

797
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,560
They light my computer on fire.

798
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,760
Volcano.

799
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,520
Oh no.

800
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,000
Doing pile drivers on it.

801
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,840
But that, hey, that's the fun stuff though of this.

802
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,680
If you don't know this place and you haven't been there, of course, it's a

803
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,800
tiki bar, of course the drinks are fun, but what you really go for are these

804
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:37,920
interactive drink experiences, which are not triggered by every drink,

805
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,000
but a lot of them, but you sort of have to know.

806
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,640
I mean, I guess it's kind of a fun guessing game to like, Oh, I'm just

807
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,800
going to throw out a drink that sounds good to me from this menu.

808
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:51,240
And then some do nothing, but some there's this crazy immersive show that

809
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,880
breaks out over the whole establishment.

810
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,320
It's fun.

811
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,480
It's a lot of fun.

812
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:56,760
Yeah.

813
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,000
I like these things a lot.

814
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,920
Like it'd be pot.

815
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,760
You could see going into a place like this and think, and then like, Oh,

816
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,840
they're going to do a little thing.

817
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,800
Is that going to be cheesy?

818
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,640
Is that going to be like Johnny Rockets when it's somebody's birthday or something?

819
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,800
But this is so thoroughly imagineered.

820
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,000
And even though all of the illusions are, are little, it's limited to this

821
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,880
window or that ship in the bottle.

822
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,040
They're so cool.

823
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,400
It's such real imagineering and probably the only bit of real

824
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,200
imagineering besides in the parks.

825
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,800
We've just done many exhaustive episodes about downtown Disney.

826
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,720
If you remember, I'm trying to forget, but none of it is really, some things

827
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,600
are cooler than others there, but none of it feels imagineered.

828
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,720
But Trader Sam's is so imagineered.

829
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,320
Yeah, it is something like you could, it's one of the few things Disney was like,

830
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,920
well, anybody can get into this.

831
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,200
So it's technically free.

832
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,520
Why would we ever spend money on it?

833
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,280
But they did.

834
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,120
I guess it's for the hotel guests, but like, this hotel got a big refurbishment

835
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,040
around the time Sam's opened.

836
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,120
Yeah, in 2011.

837
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,440
There used to be a Neverland pool.

838
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:07,120
There used to be this pool with like skull rock and the ship, the pirate ship.

839
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,280
This is what it looked like.

840
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:16,560
Which, yeah, it seemed to be beloved, but it was only opened in 1999.

841
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,480
That pool before that, this was still the Marina.

842
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:27,600
This was still like an in-ground place you could drive small boats around.

843
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,520
Yeah, isn't that weird?

844
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:33,480
That whole area that's pools now, you could like take a boat out for a real boat.

845
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,040
Whoa.

846
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,560
Yeah.

847
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,560
That's not that much space.

848
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,560
No, that's wild.

849
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:43,200
It feels, yeah, that feels so like 60s, 70s idea of you're on a vacation.

850
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
Very strange.

851
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,520
So they only put in like a real like kids pool area in 99 and then redid it

852
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,480
not too long after.

853
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,000
In 2011, which was that's when they got the e-ticket pool.

854
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,680
There's a monorail themed slide and then the e-ticket logo like at the bottom of the

855
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,680
pool, all of that and Sam's came along in 2011.

856
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,400
And it all ties together very nicely because with that old monorail and the

857
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,360
vintage Disneyland sign, now you've got a 50s, 60s retro thing.

858
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:20,400
And then Trader Sam's isn't specifically retro, but the general idea of a tiki bar

859
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,760
feels very 50s or even before even even 30s, 40s.

860
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,200
It caught on first when soldiers were coming back from the Pacific and like

861
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:35,160
bringing like drinks and ingredients and this sort of antique culture, like

862
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,720
souvenirs and that sort of stuff.

863
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,600
So that's when it really caught on.

864
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,520
Where it really required somebody to like personally bring it.

865
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:47,000
And like, I went to this place and here with I found this vibe and now I'm

866
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,240
bringing it to you.

867
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,800
There were people bringing back pot.

868
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,080
Like we went to Hawaii, we bought back back pineapples.

869
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,240
You know, the thing you can only get a couple of times a year or in a can.

870
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,720
We brought it back.

871
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,880
They're flush with them.

872
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,120
Yeah, there was like a brief resurgence, apparently in tiki bar

873
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,000
popularity in like the 90s.

874
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,480
I'm assuming with like the swing dancing, like all of that, it feels very like

875
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,280
accompanied by the cherry poppin daddies, cherry poppin daddies culture again to

876
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,000
the 90s. Same with smuggling pineapples too.

877
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,600
And smuggling pineapples.

878
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,080
People you knew you can get them wherever, but the thrill of the chase.

879
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,880
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

880
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,960
Something to go for.

881
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,840
Are you a fan of tiki bars outside of this, Danny?

882
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,840
Great question, Scott.

883
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,200
Which you may not have an answer to.

884
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:40,000
I mean, I I don't seek them out, but I'm always happy to go to one.

885
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,520
Yeah, when I'm in one, I'm having a good time.

886
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,520
I like them. It wouldn't be my go to.

887
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,240
I live for the closest bar to me is a tiki bar, but it's like

888
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,400
it's a little bit of an exhausting vibe to do all the time.

889
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,200
Do you want to tell everyone across streets?

890
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

891
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,560
All of them or I'll just leave a blank here.

892
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,160
I did say what you think I got.

893
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,680
He lives in the Disneyland Hotel.

894
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,600
Oh, I wish.

895
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,400
Oh, if only if only.

896
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:10,720
Um, I found a secret tiki bar in Las Vegas.

897
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,360
Oh, is that the the off strip?

898
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,200
No, it's actually in one of the hotels.

899
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,440
Oh, wait, really?

900
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,920
Which hotel are we not allowed to say?

901
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,120
No, no, I'll say it. Why not?

902
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,080
Nobody lives there. No secret anymore.

903
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,800
I think everyone probably knows about it.

904
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,600
A cosmopolitan hotel.

905
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,480
Really? Where there's like.

906
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,160
It's right by where there's like a Hattie Bees and a bunch of like.

907
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,840
That's secret. I've been there.

908
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,040
I've eaten at that place.

909
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,200
But then there's like a secret door.

910
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,560
Oh, I do know this.

911
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,640
I saw this and it was packed and there was no way we were going to be able to go in.

912
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,720
Yes, I did.

913
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,280
There's like a little secret.

914
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,960
There's a little secret.

915
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,320
Yes, that's the issue with tiki bars is that it's always it's impossible

916
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,680
to move around it. Yeah.

917
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,720
They're a little tiki bar in Clifton's Cafeteria.

918
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,480
100 percent. Yeah, not even that little.

919
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,040
It's yeah. OK. Yeah.

920
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,080
Upstairs. But isn't it hard to get in? It's secret.

921
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,920
There is one in Silver Lake, too, that's like open randomly.

922
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,560
And you can smoke in it.

923
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,720
And that is tea. That's tiki tea.

924
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,080
Yes. You can smoke in there.

925
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,840
Weird. It's like a private family owned

926
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,840
and it was grandfathered in of like as a private club or something.

927
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,880
And that's how you could still smoke into it. Right.

928
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,120
Until last year or two years ago.

929
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,640
I think now you cannot smoke in it further out in North.

930
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,760
I don't know why I guess I'm like saying, oh, I don't smoke.

931
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,920
I haven't smoked in a while, but I kind of like the idea

932
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,120
of being able to smoke in one bar.

933
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,960
They should let one bar. That's a little.

934
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,400
Yeah. Yeah. This one.

935
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,720
This private bar city, one bar should be one bar.

936
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,440
But if that's a tiki bar, then it's even more chaos.

937
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,680
Yeah. Yeah.

938
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,680
I saw a list from and it's an out of date list now

939
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,080
because it was a couple of years ago.

940
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,800
But I saw an LA Weekly list of the top tiki bars in Los Angeles.

941
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,480
And LA Weekly is like a little hip and a little maybe a little judgmental.

942
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,600
So for them to put Trader Sam's as number two on this list,

943
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,840
I was pretty impressed.

944
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,720
I think it speaks to that while it is the Disney fight version of something,

945
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,000
it is also legit.

946
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,040
The drinks are good.

947
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,440
And it's sitting on there with a tiki tea was number four.

948
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,520
Number one, I don't know.

949
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,440
Purple Orchid and El Segundo.

950
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,920
Oh, what is that? I didn't see.

951
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,080
Yeah, I read that list to beat Don Don.

952
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:30,120
The Beachcomber is on there on the beach, which now is closed since that article.

953
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,920
Don, the Beachcomber is the original.

954
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:36,000
That's kind of the guy who, you know, kicked off this whole trend.

955
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,280
There were a bunch of those around, I think.

956
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,000
And then there was one remaining and weird, like South Bay.

957
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,360
Tonga Hut is the oldest one in L.A.

958
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:49,440
that's in Van Nuys, Deeper Valley, which is a fun bar, but also but crowded.

959
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,080
Crowded. You end up in a deeply crowded to.

960
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,720
Yeah. Like, what's the Chicago place?

961
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,600
It's got like a guy's name.

962
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,360
Is it the place I literally went to a month and a half ago?

963
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,920
It's like a it's like a fake tiki, but it's like somebody figured out, like,

964
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,760
how to make a big TGI Fridays.

965
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,240
Oh, oh, oh, that I did not go to that one.

966
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,200
I know what you're talking about.

967
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:14,080
It was big in Chicago when I was little, at least at least to my parents.

968
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,560
Like my dad talked about it all the time.

969
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,080
He's like, oh, and they invented the Mai Tai, he used to say.

970
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,080
Oh, which I that can't be true.

971
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,320
It could have been that one.

972
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,400
Yeah. I don't know why my dad thought it probably was like

973
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,360
the first time he had ever seen a Mai Tai.

974
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,360
And my dad was like, they invented it.

975
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,400
Just lodged in his head.

976
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,960
Why not? Could have been that. Who knows?

977
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,800
There's a trader Todd's in Chicago.

978
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,520
Ah, the exotic South Pacific from Todd.

979
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,280
Well, let me tie it all together and say that one of my favorite

980
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,840
tiki bar experiences was on the island of Kauai.

981
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,680
That I was in a very stuffy hotel.

982
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,120
We went and visited a stuffy hotel where we weren't even getting service

983
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,960
because the hotel was being so judgy of and like everybody around us

984
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,280
was a fucking rich asshole.

985
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,520
It was so snooty.

986
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,200
It was beautiful air, but we want out of there.

987
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,720
We want a place for the people.

988
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,440
And I looked up, is there anything fun to do around here?

989
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,160
I think Princeville is the town.

990
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,680
And I and sure enough found, oh, my God, you're kidding.

991
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,000
I can go to a place called Tiki and Niki,

992
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,000
which is a tiki bar owned by Todd Rungren.

993
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,160
Wow. Yeah.

994
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,320
Favorite musicians in the world.

995
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,120
He has his wife mainly runs it like seems to really.

996
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:31,040
It's almost like somebody went back in time and put that there for you.

997
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,120
Yeah. Yes.

998
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,280
What would make Scott Gardner happy right now?

999
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,280
Well, I put it there for himself.

1000
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,240
I did it. I'm saying like in the future, you like a wild stallion.

1001
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,440
Save my younger self.

1002
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,920
What all I'll have Todd Rungren open up a tiki bar.

1003
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,880
I need to plant the idea in Todd Rungren's wife's brain.

1004
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,880
And yes. Well, not only that, but it's also like and sometimes,

1005
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,920
you know, it's a place that some of the the Kauai locals could stop by

1006
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,800
and do a set like Walter Becker from Steely Dan.

1007
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,480
What? Yes.

1008
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,920
I don't know if that ever happened.

1009
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,680
But anyway, if you're on Kauai, that place was fantastic.

1010
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,360
I found out about it from an article called Aloha. It's me.

1011
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,840
Nice.

1012
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,760
Truly made for me. Very much made for me.

1013
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,800
Articles called that. Yes, they don't have.

1014
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,760
There's only one Todd themed drink, which is Bang the Drum Rum.

1015
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,520
Oh, yeah. Kind of a later.

1016
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,840
But yeah, they named it after his worst.

1017
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,480
His worst.

1018
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,960
But one of the more well known.

1019
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,640
The big yes. Yeah, yeah.

1020
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,960
What is his rock and roll part to it?

1021
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,720
He goes back in time and plant the seed in his wife's brain.

1022
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,080
About a Todd related drink.

1023
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,480
What would it be?

1024
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,000
Well, I don't have the drink ready to go,

1025
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,560
but I would love if it was called a wizard, a true bar.

1026
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,760
Hmm. After his album, a wizard, a star listeners, no wizard.

1027
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,280
Yeah. His best album is best.

1028
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,840
It's one of the top 10 albums ever made.

1029
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,480
No one listens to me on this fucking rules.

1030
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,720
A drink that I might need a minute on that one.

1031
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,760
Oh, sorry. Yeah, I didn't mean to put you on the spot.

1032
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,160
No, no, no.

1033
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,880
Is that is that Todd Rungert's own type?

1034
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,600
Is it is it just a rum drink that they make there?

1035
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,200
Or does he have an actual label like a Sammy Hagar of his own?

1036
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,960
Sammy Hagar, of course, has Beach Bum Rum,

1037
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,520
which has replaced his Cabo Wabo, which he sold.

1038
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,840
He sold. Yeah. Oh, really? Yeah.

1039
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,720
I'm never drinking Cabo Wabo again.

1040
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,200
What a loss.

1041
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,320
Oh, wait, I have it.

1042
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,880
It would be a drink named after one of his other best albums.

1043
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,640
And it would have to be like a mojito, something with mint in it

1044
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,840
so that it could be hermit of mint hollow.

1045
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,000
That's great.

1046
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,960
Of course, it is hermit of mink hollow, the real album.

1047
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,960
Right, right. OK. That's really good.

1048
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,920
Thanks. It just took me a minute. I'm sorry.

1049
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,040
You know, so it's like maybe you could work the word mojito in there, too.

1050
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,400
Hermit of Mint Hito.

1051
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,360
Yeah, there you go. Spelled with a W.

1052
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:47,960
Great. All right.

1053
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,360
I'll close I'll self close the door on Todd Rundgren thoughts and see myself out

1054
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,280
for more Todd Rundgren thoughts.

1055
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,200
Stop me in person.

1056
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,640
I'll do it happily.

1057
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,800
Where were we, though?

1058
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,480
Tiki and Tiki's and Todd's go together is what I'm saying.

1059
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,680
Sure.

1060
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,920
If you're a Todd, consider

1061
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,600
getting into opening a Tiki bar, being at a Tiki bar.

1062
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,320
That one's probably the easiest to do.

1063
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,600
Yeah. Just go be at one. Just go be at one.

1064
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,440
Do we know what the first trader something is?

1065
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,520
Is it from is it Vicks?

1066
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,040
Is that what it is? Yeah.

1067
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,680
I think who redating actually may have invented the Mai Tai.

1068
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,200
Is that something was invented at Trader Vicks?

1069
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,520
Not the Chicago guy.

1070
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,440
Not just the Chicago man.

1071
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,800
Not this Chicago shiester.

1072
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,840
Although what if it is?

1073
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,320
What if I want to know the name of you?

1074
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,960
I was going to Trader Ditka.

1075
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,800
No, no, it's not him.

1076
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,480
It's not him. It's a different one.

1077
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,720
If we're wrong and the Mai Tai was invented in Chicago,

1078
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,240
we always say people are yelling information at us.

1079
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,800
If we're wrong on this podcast, let's do what you said and leave the space.

1080
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,720
Trader Mai Tai's weren't invented in Chicago.

1081
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,400
And that was a space where you could have yelled angrily at us.

1082
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,080
And then you could say, oh, that's where they were invented.

1083
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,640
Thanks, listener.

1084
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,360
Oh, I guess we were wrong.

1085
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,920
Thanks, listener.

1086
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,920
Unless they were right.

1087
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,400
Oh, I'm glad you're agreeing.

1088
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,840
You were wrong. Dead wrong.

1089
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,440
Am I ruining your guys' podcast?

1090
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,560
I don't think so.

1091
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,280
Oh, no.

1092
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,520
We do that all by ourselves.

1093
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,800
Well, and also, this is unlike the one the we did some bars

1094
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,960
during the downtown Disney ordeal, and we used it being about bars to drink a bunch.

1095
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,360
And so this feels more coherent to me in that we're not drunk.

1096
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,560
That's where the Mai Tai was invented.

1097
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,960
Oakland?

1098
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,960
Oakland. Oakland.

1099
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,560
Thanks for letting us read it.

1100
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,560
By Victor J. Bergeron.

1101
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,640
Is that Trader Vic?

1102
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,520
Did he?

1103
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,480
Got to be right.

1104
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,080
Whoa.

1105
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,880
You'd have to think.

1106
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,160
Wait, Bergeron?

1107
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,000
Tom Bergeron, his grandfather?

1108
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,880
Trader Tom.

1109
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,840
Trader Tom?

1110
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,320
Dancing with the stars is Tom Bergeron?

1111
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,080
Wow. We got to look that up.

1112
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,400
Let's look no further into it and just assume it's true.

1113
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,080
Yeah, you're right.

1114
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,680
Tom Bergeron is the heir to the Mai Tai fortune.

1115
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,800
Oh, my gosh.

1116
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,880
Do you think Tom Bergeron has any drinks that he's made up?

1117
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,400
The Tom? Probably.

1118
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,440
But the Tom.

1119
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,680
It's just whiskey.

1120
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,520
It's just whiskey and ginger.

1121
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:23,280
America's funniest, America's bloodiest Mary.

1122
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,840
America's bloodiest home, Mary.

1123
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,360
Home, oh, my God.

1124
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,920
Is television host Tom Bergeron related to Trader Vic?

1125
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:37,760
Victor Bergeron is the founder of Trader Vic's and grandfather of TV host Tom Bergeron.

1126
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,600
Oh, my God.

1127
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,600
Wow.

1128
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
No kidding.

1129
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,600
So he doesn't have to wait for a table.

1130
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,560
He doesn't have to wait for a table in West L.A.

1131
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,240
Wow.

1132
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,320
We got to just remember to do the research.

1133
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,200
That's how he got the home videos gig.

1134
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,800
He was just they've like, yeah, he sent his grandpa to loosen up those ABC executives.

1135
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,920
That's a very bizarre fact.

1136
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,320
It's nice when some of the research we just save and do it live in the air,

1137
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,080
because then you get the joy of all of us together going, wow.

1138
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:07,960
Hold on a second.

1139
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,160
Oh, is it a lie?

1140
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,080
Is this a snopes?

1141
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:15,720
I was on Tiki Central, Tiki Room Dotcom, which is Tiki message board.

1142
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,040
What's your name on that message board?

1143
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,920
Michael Carlson.

1144
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,080
Mike, the beachcomber, Mike, the beach, Carlson.

1145
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,720
People are disputing this.

1146
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,920
OK, that brings me.

1147
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:36,360
So I also saw people disputing stuff on Tiki message boards when I was trying to figure out.

1148
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,000
Oh, no.

1149
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,080
Because I was trying to figure out what is in Trader Sam's Grog Grotto,

1150
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,000
which is the base for a lot of the drinks.

1151
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,520
OK.

1152
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,960
A lot of the drinks say it's a mix of tropical juices.

1153
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,320
OK.

1154
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,280
It seems to be people have reverse engineered it.

1155
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,640
And it's a lot of stuff that is used as like bases in tribal drinks.

1156
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,720
It seemed to agree that it's passion fruit, orange juice, guava.

1157
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,680
That's big and a Pog.

1158
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,120
You see Pog juice.

1159
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:12,080
Where the word Pog came from is passion fruit, orange guava, pineapple juice, lemon juice.

1160
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:17,440
And then possibly add ins of this is other stuff that's in a lot of the drinks at Sam's.

1161
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,680
Orgeat and Falernum, these are syrups.

1162
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:24,040
Orgeat is an almond syrup, almond sugar.

1163
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:27,760
I will correct you only because I wanted to compliment that item.

1164
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,640
So I looked up the pronunciation and it is or-jot.

1165
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,560
It's or-jot.

1166
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,040
It is apparently.

1167
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,480
I believe so.

1168
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,320
And it's because I don't usually like the fruity stuff in these drinks.

1169
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,400
But everything I've had with orgeat has been great.

1170
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,840
And it's some combo of orange water and almonds.

1171
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,960
Just got curious what it was.

1172
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,560
And I like it.

1173
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:51,840
That is like a sugar additive that is delightful.

1174
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,680
Falernum, very similar.

1175
00:43:53,680 --> 00:44:00,160
Also has a bit of a bite from ginger and lime and either cloves or allspice.

1176
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:05,040
So you see a lot of the drinks on the Sam's menu has orgeat or falernum.

1177
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:05,880
Nice.

1178
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,120
Allspice.

1179
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:07,840
Yeah, allspice.

1180
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,680
I hope not.

1181
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,080
They just open a can and pour it into my drink.

1182
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:11,760
I will correct you.

1183
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,160
Yes, I use allspice.

1184
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,800
That's why I always.

1185
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,960
Oh, wait, it's not allspice.

1186
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,200
It's old spice.

1187
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:17,800
Wow.

1188
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,320
Wait, oh, I thought you knew.

1189
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:19,840
No.

1190
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,960
Yeah, I thought you were.

1191
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,240
No, that was not a joke.

1192
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,360
I genuinely thought it was called allspice for a second there.

1193
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:25,880
That's good.

1194
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,640
That was like a natural A to C. You skipped the, oh, this sounds like old spice.

1195
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,440
But I'll say allspice.

1196
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,000
I skipped it by being dumb and thinking that the deodorant was actually

1197
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,920
called allspice.

1198
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,680
Allspice is a potent spice.

1199
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,080
So it would cover up odors.

1200
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,480
You could use it.

1201
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,720
A lot of people do, actually.

1202
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,520
It would probably irritate your skin if you're just rubbing allspice all over it.

1203
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,360
The thing is, yeah.

1204
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:54,240
But the thing that is debated is we're shocked in the Graug Grotto

1205
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,080
because some of the drinks have it listed separately.

1206
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,560
Their mix is called the Graug Grotto.

1207
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,800
Or Graug, or Gorilla Graug, excuse me.

1208
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,320
OK, OK.

1209
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,440
Gorilla Graug is like their base fruity kind of fruit punch.

1210
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,240
How hotly contested is this online?

1211
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,480
Oh, one or two guys on a 5'3".

1212
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,080
I'm just curious if it's like a bigger.

1213
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,960
People trying to make it at home.

1214
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,040
Oh, OK.

1215
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,200
Who are wearing roughly identical shirts.

1216
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,240
Yeah, everyone can agree on the fashions, that's for sure.

1217
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,320
Yeah.

1218
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,280
But it seems like Bergeron debated.

1219
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,400
I don't, I'm doubting it.

1220
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,360
There was a lot of people who said it was true on this Tiki room message board.

1221
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,600
And then somebody said no.

1222
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,360
And then I can't get it backed up on another site.

1223
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,880
So I'm guessing no.

1224
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,880
That would be delightful to think it's true.

1225
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,800
I'd like to assume it's true.

1226
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,240
Look, I've lost my faith in Tiki Central.

1227
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,360
Open 24 hours.

1228
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,560
Stay out of these message boards, everybody.

1229
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:58,400
There are hotbeds and the info we can't always believe.

1230
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,240
What have we had that we've enjoyed?

1231
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,200
I don't know when the appropriate time to bring this up is,

1232
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,960
but we missed out on a key feature of that bar.

1233
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,400
But what is that?

1234
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,720
The sinking stool.

1235
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,880
Yeah, yes.

1236
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,640
I did not know that.

1237
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,320
Yeah, that's a real thing.

1238
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:23,160
Like, it's a little prank the bartender will deploy, his or her will.

1239
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:23,640
Wow.

1240
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:30,000
They'll just push a button and very, very slowly,

1241
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,200
the seat will start to sink over the course of a half hour or something.

1242
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,400
And then the person's below everybody else at the bar.

1243
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,360
It's a great thing.

1244
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,680
If you order the shrunken head, I think that's the effect.

1245
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,200
Oh, I don't know if all the seats do it, though.

1246
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,360
But not all the seats do it.

1247
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,480
I don't think ours did.

1248
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,320
I don't believe that.

1249
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,360
Because I actually was like, I asked the bartender secretly.

1250
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,120
I was like, can you make one of our seats go down?

1251
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,080
And they were like, oh, you're not sitting in the right ones.

1252
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,320
It's only a specific.

1253
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,040
OK, OK.

1254
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,680
Oh, I like that you slipped in a little question.

1255
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,800
I wanted it to happen.

1256
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,840
I wanted to create a moment.

1257
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,240
Yeah.

1258
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,800
Should have given him a 20.

1259
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,080
Does this change it?

1260
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:10,760
Yes, actually.

1261
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,360
If you would sit this guy goes under the seat

1262
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,200
and just tries to move Jason's seat down with his hands.

1263
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,280
If you would successfully shrunk in our seats without us knowing,

1264
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,760
yeah, that would have been a delight.

1265
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,720
Is that true, though?

1266
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,920
You have to order that drink.

1267
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,720
The shrunken zombie head is certain barstools

1268
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,640
will begin lowering to the floor.

1269
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:36,200
Same if you order beer, the draft eyes start to glow

1270
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,320
and tiki drums and chants play.

1271
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,240
And if they order, if they're doing a bunch of beers,

1272
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,360
it will speed up the sound.

1273
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,040
Wow.

1274
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,840
Yeah, because all of the taps are tiki heads

1275
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,880
and their eyes will glow red.

1276
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,520
Yeah, OK.

1277
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,320
So we should just say all of these effects.

1278
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,600
So those are a few of them.

1279
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:04,000
I got shipwreck on the rocks, as I said, with Orjat, Knob Creek

1280
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,880
whiskey, dram, and pineapple juice.

1281
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,880
Oh, wait, no, I'm sorry.

1282
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,880
I'm reading the Spiced Island, which is what I had in Florida.

1283
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,080
I'm fucking up again.

1284
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,560
I don't remember what was in the shipwreck on the rocks,

1285
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,240
but it was wonderful.

1286
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:21,280
And that causes a ship in a bottle

1287
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,120
to sink, which is up on the shelf behind the bartender.

1288
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,960
Yes, that's from the Adventurers Club.

1289
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,280
That bottle is one of the few props.

1290
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,360
I read an interview with the head set decorator,

1291
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,360
and he's like, that's one of the few props

1292
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,480
we were able to claim for the Adventurers Club,

1293
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,960
because so many of the other props

1294
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,640
got sent to Mystic Manor.

1295
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,840
Oh, but they're all around.

1296
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:42,800
They're around.

1297
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,280
Wow.

1298
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,680
Yeah, but that bottle is original.

1299
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,560
They redid the ship inside.

1300
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,280
They redid the footage inside.

1301
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,600
This might be a very novice question,

1302
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,880
but what do you mean exactly?

1303
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,000
What is the Adventurers Club?

1304
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,200
The Adventurers Club was an interactive theatrical bar

1305
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,000
and club in Pleasure Island in Florida back in the 80s.

1306
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,720
There was an all night club district.

1307
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,080
And it was just crazy set decoration.

1308
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,360
It was like this, but two stories tall

1309
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,760
with multiple rooms and shows and actors.

1310
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,440
And that's closed now, and that stuff's just everywhere?

1311
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,560
They repurposed it all?

1312
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,200
They sent a lot to Mystic Manor, which is a ride in Hong Kong.

1313
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,640
It was an early success of this Imagineer Joe

1314
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,240
Rhodey, who's associated with probably some

1315
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:31,400
of the more tropical adventure kind of rides.

1316
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,880
Avatar in Florida and Animal Kingdom is him.

1317
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,520
So this was an early thing he did insanely well.

1318
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,040
Oh, cool.

1319
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,800
He is referenced in the bar.

1320
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,360
This is the nod to Joe Rhodey inside of him.

1321
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,480
Oh, there is a big Tiki head, and it's kind of sloppily

1322
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,480
labeled Joe.

1323
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,720
And it has the earrings.

1324
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,520
As part of our live show in Florida,

1325
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,600
we put on these big dangly earrings,

1326
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,360
which are what Joe Rhodey wears.

1327
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,560
And so this Tiki head has the big dangly earrings.

1328
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,320
That's awesome.

1329
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,320
Yeah.

1330
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,280
Wow.

1331
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:08,480
And I think part of the desire to build Trader Sam's here

1332
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,800
and part of the pitch on what the vibe was going to be

1333
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:15,240
was, let's have some of that adventures club spirit.

1334
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:15,760
Yes.

1335
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,160
Let's have it be like a kooky funny place.

1336
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,440
It seems like maybe there was a take early on in Imagineers

1337
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,160
developing it where it would have been a little more stately

1338
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:24,680
and classy.

1339
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,040
Like a posh Tiki bar.

1340
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,720
I don't even know what that looks like,

1341
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,080
but I saw that mentioned too.

1342
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:29,560
Yeah.

1343
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,080
Yeah.

1344
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:30,600
I'm not sure.

1345
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,600
Maybe more in the Grand Californian vibe,

1346
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,600
where that's like, yeah, it feels very sophisticated

1347
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,880
if you're getting a drink at Grand Californian.

1348
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,840
But it was this one Imagineer, and there's

1349
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,680
a few interviews with him, Brandon Clayla, hopefully

1350
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,960
I'm saying that correctly.

1351
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,880
But he was a former Jungle Cruise skipper.

1352
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,640
And he had just joined Imagineering

1353
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,680
and found out this was happening and went and begged

1354
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,080
to be part of it.

1355
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,320
I've got the take.

1356
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,320
This is me.

1357
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,320
I'm a Tiki guy.

1358
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,840
I know how to make this thing.

1359
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,600
The place has a passion to it.

1360
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,520
Oh, for sure.

1361
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,520
There's nothing like.

1362
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,280
Well, not only did this guy develop the backstory,

1363
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,080
the notes, he wrote the copy of all of the notes,

1364
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,680
short rounds note.

1365
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,200
He came up with the drink names.

1366
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,520
He developed the spiels that the cast say,

1367
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,360
telling you what the place is.

1368
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,880
He came up with the idea that this

1369
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,400
is the place where the skippers from the Jungle Cruise

1370
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,840
hang out during off hours.

1371
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,280
That's the back story.

1372
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,440
They aren't bartenders.

1373
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,560
They're skippers.

1374
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,000
And this is where all the skippers

1375
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,480
go to hang out when they don't have expeditions to do.

1376
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,480
That's really cool.

1377
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,320
It's really neat.

1378
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,880
And of course, what we haven't said

1379
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,360
is that Trader Sam is a character from the Jungle Cruise.

1380
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,120
So that ties everything together.

1381
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,560
But then not only did this guy, Brandon,

1382
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,800
develop all of this and really specifically

1383
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,000
hammer out all the details,

1384
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,920
he collected every prop himself in both of them,

1385
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,440
in Anaheim and Orlando.

1386
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,280
Wow.

1387
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,920
Anaheim, I think it's estimated at 1,600 items in it.

1388
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:04,760
Is it really that much?

1389
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,920
1,600 pieces.

1390
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:07,760
Yeah, it's super dense.

1391
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,600
It's snow.

1392
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,800
But you look around and what an insane,

1393
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,680
to have the vibe of it's kooky

1394
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,600
and things are exploding off of the walls.

1395
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,440
How hard to populate that.

1396
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,280
Yeah.

1397
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,120
Yeah.

1398
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,040
And the attention to detail to individual stuff.

1399
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,520
I saw one of the interviews with that guy

1400
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,040
and one of the things that brought him to,

1401
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,640
seemed like in his career,

1402
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,440
he made a documentary about the fan culture

1403
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,240
around Indiana Jones.

1404
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,080
Oh.

1405
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:36,800
And as a big, scenes have a big love,

1406
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,800
affection for Indiana Jones.

1407
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,240
And when they were talking about like,

1408
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,440
should we put Indy's hat and whip in there?

1409
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,920
And he's like, well, that's ridiculous.

1410
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,080
Indy wouldn't let go of his hat and whip.

1411
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,000
So they, the attention to detail,

1412
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,400
they're like, but maybe he gifted Sam a whip.

1413
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,040
So that is how we square that circle of like,

1414
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,200
there's a whip in here.

1415
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,600
And it is a gift from Indiana Jones to Trader Sam.

1416
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,240
So it's not like a,

1417
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,960
like a hard rock where you're gonna get the original guitar.

1418
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:05,800
The original.

1419
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,080
100% authentic, all of those hard rock.

1420
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,560
This is a guitar gifted from,

1421
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,400
Yes.

1422
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,720
Famous guitarist, Axl Rose.

1423
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,760
Yeah, Gary.

1424
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,840
Famously beloved guitarist.

1425
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,680
Yes.

1426
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,800
Beloved musician, Gary Glitter.

1427
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,200
All the Gary Glitter stuff still on the walls.

1428
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:28,800
That's awesome though.

1429
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,040
Yeah, how cool of this guy to take the initiative.

1430
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,560
The thought, the thoughtfulness of like,

1431
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,040
well, Indy would keep his whip.

1432
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:36,880
Let's not get carried away.

1433
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,880
Indy would keep his whip,

1434
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,240
but let's call the bartender skippers.

1435
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,120
Like all the bartenders are referred to as skippers,

1436
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,280
like the Jungle Cruise guides.

1437
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,080
There's a lot of real internal logic to it.

1438
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,600
Other Indy stuff, you've got the map

1439
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,800
of the Temple of the Forbidden Eye,

1440
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,040
mere feet away in Adventureland,

1441
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:00,240
which is the same one that's in Indy's office in the line.

1442
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,120
I think even maybe, I forget,

1443
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,640
I think the one that had been in the line

1444
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,640
got moved over here and they put a copy in Indy.

1445
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,400
So this one is the original map.

1446
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,600
Well, it seemed like they couldn't find

1447
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,080
the original map in the archives

1448
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,520
and realized it was in the ride, so they duplicated it.

1449
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:21,520
And so the one is in the, I think it's duplicates now,

1450
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,200
one in the queue and the other in the bar,

1451
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,920
and the original is being restored,

1452
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,760
because they're like, we probably shouldn't just have this

1453
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,280
sitting in the line.

1454
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,040
In a bar or a line, yeah.

1455
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,080
And while we're talking Indy,

1456
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:41,400
maybe it's a good time to bring up the short round letter.

1457
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:46,480
Yeah, there's a letter to Trader Sam.

1458
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,000
I feel like we've skipped around way too much.

1459
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,840
Part of the theming of this bar is that there's artifacts

1460
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,680
everywhere that Trader Sam is inherited

1461
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,560
from friends all over the world.

1462
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,920
As part of this guy Brandon's pitch

1463
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,240
is that Sam knows everybody.

1464
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,600
Everyone's stopped in his bar.

1465
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:09,200
He's visited people, so he knew Jack Sparrow.

1466
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,280
I like that detail, that Trader Sam

1467
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,680
is hung out with Jack Sparrow.

1468
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:16,120
This starts the precedent for mixing different movies

1469
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,160
and Disney park lore.

1470
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,960
We talk about the Guardians of the Galaxy ride.

1471
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:23,200
Tanelier Tavon is a big Disney parks collector,

1472
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,360
which I thought is funny.

1473
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,080
It doesn't quite make sense, but also this is actually

1474
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,160
the precedent for Indiana Jones knows characters

1475
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,880
from the rides that aren't Indiana Jones related.

1476
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,320
Yeah, and if they were in the bar at the same time,

1477
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:39,520
Indiana Jones could hang out with Jack Sparrow.

1478
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,720
Did you know Tony Stark sent Sam

1479
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,000
the original code for Jarvis?

1480
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:45,760
I didn't know that.

1481
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,200
It's in there, it's in the bar?

1482
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,840
The code, it's in the bathroom.

1483
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,120
Oh, okay.

1484
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:51,960
Only under-

1485
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,760
Jarvis talks to you in the bathroom.

1486
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,720
It's only in specific stalls.

1487
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,240
You gotta pick the right stall.

1488
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,360
The toilet seat opens its mouth.

1489
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,840
To talk to you.

1490
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,680
Hello.

1491
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,000
I'm Jarvis.

1492
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,920
But so he's collected letters and artifacts

1493
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,200
and he got a letter from Indiana Jones' buddy

1494
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,640
from Temple of Doom short round.

1495
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,160
The letter reads, Dr. Jones said to give this to you.

1496
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,800
He trusts you to destroy it so it not hurt him anymore.

1497
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,560
Thank you, short round.

1498
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,080
It's written in crown too, isn't it?

1499
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,160
Yes.

1500
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,000
Okay.

1501
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,240
In crayon?

1502
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,040
I think so, right?

1503
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:36,880
Yeah.

1504
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:37,720
It looks like it.

1505
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:38,560
It's very-

1506
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,400
Or grease pencil or something.

1507
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,240
Scrabble Scrawl.

1508
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,080
Yeah.

1509
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:46,080
And this is referring to a voodoo doll of Indiana Jones.

1510
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:46,920
Mm-hmm.

1511
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,320
And I have this question, which is,

1512
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,800
he trusts you to destroy it,

1513
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:01,040
but if you destroyed a voodoo doll,

1514
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,200
wouldn't that hurt Indiana Jones?

1515
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,600
That would kill Indiana Jones.

1516
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:05,440
Yeah.

1517
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,560
I think that's why he's bequeathing it to Sam.

1518
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:10,360
You know how to destroy this without killing him.

1519
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,320
Sam knows the ways.

1520
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,520
Sam knows the ways.

1521
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,880
There's only one way.

1522
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:15,800
There's one machine.

1523
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,360
It's like disposing of waster needles.

1524
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,200
Yeah.

1525
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,800
There's only one way to do it and have it be safe.

1526
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:23,640
Sam knows.

1527
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,520
And only Sam knows.

1528
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,480
So if you have a voodoo doll you need to destroy.

1529
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,840
It would also stand to reason though

1530
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,560
that Sam then knows how to use voodoo dolls.

1531
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:36,040
So he could do that to anyone at any moment.

1532
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,880
He is a shrunken head salesman.

1533
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,200
Yeah, that's true.

1534
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,320
Should be careful what we say.

1535
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,160
Yeah.

1536
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,000
It's true.

1537
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,320
Yeah, Sam, you think right on the line.

1538
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,000
I don't know how much longer Sam is to kick around

1539
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,040
in his current form.

1540
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,480
All this stuff is a little bit-

1541
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,400
All this stuff is a little right on the line.

1542
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,240
It'll be-

1543
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,480
No, I meant I didn't want to offend Sam.

1544
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,800
Oh, okay, excuse me.

1545
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,160
Oh, I see what you were saying.

1546
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,200
You weren't talking about that we're gonna stumble

1547
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,040
into saying something offensive.

1548
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,800
No, I was saying honestly,

1549
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,000
in all honesty, I was treating Sam like the character he is.

1550
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,920
You were worried that if Trader Sam somehow ended up

1551
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,840
with a voodoo doll of any of us-

1552
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,880
And he's like, I don't like those guys.

1553
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,760
And Ethan, we say that a drink price is unfair

1554
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:22,160
or that a tabletop wasn't sufficiently cleaned,

1555
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,920
then we could all end up with needles in the chest.

1556
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:25,760
Yeah. Sure.

1557
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,960
I mean, we must respect Sam.

1558
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,960
Yeah. We love Sam.

1559
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,160
He's great.

1560
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,960
And we also have to make sure no voodoo dolls get made of us.

1561
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:33,800
That's true.

1562
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,600
We'd all love action figures or plushes that look like us,

1563
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,320
but how do you prevent one from being voodoo-ified?

1564
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,000
Well, I know a guy named Trader Todd

1565
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,040
that knows all about that type of thing too.

1566
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,400
So maybe if Sam does something bad to us,

1567
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,640
Todd will step in.

1568
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,960
Todd can help.

1569
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,880
If he can't, then Todd Rundgren can play the guitar real good

1570
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:54,720
and cheer us up.

1571
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:55,560
Yeah.

1572
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,440
I feel like, oh, I found out I went to Lost Lake,

1573
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:02,760
the Tiki Bar in Chicago, which was fun and very crowded.

1574
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,040
This is the nature of-

1575
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,400
It's the nature.

1576
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,480
Look, they got that right.

1577
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,280
Much like a Trader Joe's parking lot.

1578
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,120
Yes.

1579
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:11,960
Oh, yeah.

1580
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:16,960
Anywhere Trader is cursed, they're all shrunken settings.

1581
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,800
Settings.

1582
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,640
Like?

1583
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,480
Like?

1584
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:24,480
This is another, there's probably some clean paragraph

1585
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,480
I could have read at the beginning,

1586
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,760
but I want to make sure to say the backstory

1587
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:34,720
that the reason Trader Sam's is doing a bar at all

1588
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,240
is that he is this character in The Jungle Cruise.

1589
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,520
He'll give you two of his heads for one of yours.

1590
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:43,000
This line has been said since 1955.

1591
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,840
He's got a bunch of shrunken heads.

1592
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:49,840
Whatever technology and potionry and apothecaratricity,

1593
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,080
that's the word, right?

1594
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:53,920
Yes.

1595
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,720
Whatever he's, Trader Sam is doing to make the heads small

1596
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,600
also applies to mixology.

1597
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,400
He also discovered via his potions

1598
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,680
that he's a great mixologist.

1599
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:07,600
And that's why he decided to open a bar,

1600
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:12,320
but some of his recipes and trickery

1601
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:17,400
and drink items, perhaps his gorilla grog,

1602
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,040
part of like things that he collected for it

1603
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,840
has angered the gods.

1604
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:24,080
Some of his methods have angered the gods

1605
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,760
and that's why those illusions happen.

1606
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:27,600
Right.

1607
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,040
So if the ship is sinking in the bottle

1608
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:31,880
or the volcano goes off,

1609
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:35,120
that means that the gods are angry briefly for 30 seconds

1610
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:35,960
and things go back to normal.

1611
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,240
And they don't really hurt anybody.

1612
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,680
It's just sort of a fun show.

1613
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:39,520
Yes.

1614
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,240
Honestly though, with the volcano and the shipwreck,

1615
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,280
it probably just kill hundreds of people on the island.

1616
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,240
It's just we're so far away, it doesn't matter.

1617
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,680
Like that in itself is a voodoo situation.

1618
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:50,520
Yeah.

1619
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,800
And though it's a fun little illusion to us,

1620
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,080
hundreds of people are drowning.

1621
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,800
Yeah, every time in lava, yeah.

1622
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,400
Also come the holiday season,

1623
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:00,160
that view of the volcano has snow going.

1624
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,000
Yeah, it's fun.

1625
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,840
Snow is in the window, it's fun.

1626
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,760
Snow shoots out of the volcano.

1627
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,600
Oh yes.

1628
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:05,440
They switch it over to snow?

1629
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,480
They switch it over to snow,

1630
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,000
which I found a couple days, a couple years ago.

1631
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,280
Also the shipwreck, first generation Tiki Mugs

1632
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,520
sitting over here.

1633
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,120
A lot of Tiki, a lot of Trader Sam stuff over on the shelf.

1634
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:20,440
Yes, so you can buy the mugs.

1635
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,560
They are very popular,

1636
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,400
especially like that Hatbox Ghost one.

1637
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,240
Oh yeah.

1638
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,080
And that Nautilus one.

1639
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,840
I paid premium eBay prices for those.

1640
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:30,800
Did you really?

1641
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:31,640
Wow.

1642
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,960
Maybe I should, I got a,

1643
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:37,440
what would you give me for this golden piranha I picked up?

1644
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,800
Yes, you got one when we were down there.

1645
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:41,440
I know what you're talking about.

1646
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,120
I got it on a whim.

1647
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,800
I was like, oh, people were there just to buy it and stuff.

1648
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,640
And I was like, I guess I'll get one, I'm here.

1649
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,560
It is cool, I don't have that one.

1650
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:53,800
I have twins, I have two boys,

1651
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:57,200
and I've decided like when something good happens,

1652
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,680
like they win the spelling bee or whatever.

1653
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:01,520
Yeah.

1654
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,080
Tie, they tie together.

1655
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,880
Two brothers win the spelling bee.

1656
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,760
Or if one, like let's say one of them wins the spelling bee.

1657
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,160
The other one wins the football bee.

1658
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:14,360
It's gonna be like a cup that they get to drink from.

1659
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,400
You will save it for a special occasion.

1660
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,040
Or maybe like if they're sick, it's like a sick cup.

1661
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:23,560
If one of them wins the acting bee, the Oscars.

1662
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:24,600
The acting bee.

1663
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,640
They'll already have a trophy, but.

1664
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,800
Are you concerned that you will,

1665
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,880
your children will associate piranhas

1666
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,920
with something positive?

1667
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,200
Like if they then travel the world

1668
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,680
and they're like, careful there's piranhas,

1669
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,160
and they just hopper on him.

1670
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,640
No, they're like, yeah, piranhas are good.

1671
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:40,480
Very cool.

1672
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:44,000
Do you know a lot of people die from like hippo,

1673
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,200
get eaten by hippos because people think.

1674
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,040
They're friendly.

1675
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,160
They're friendly, partially because of like Fantasia,

1676
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,320
I would imagine.

1677
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,240
Oh, that's a good point.

1678
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:56,760
But yeah, people think hippos are cute and stuff,

1679
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,920
but then so they get too close and then they get eaten.

1680
01:02:58,920 --> 01:02:59,760
That's a real problem.

1681
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,600
They are killers, yeah.

1682
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:01,720
It's a real problem.

1683
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,240
They don't think of.

1684
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:04,960
And I know this is a Disney podcast,

1685
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,440
so I think we should just tell everyone like,

1686
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,160
hippos are dangerous.

1687
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,000
Yes.

1688
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,400
I mean, if anyone, I don't think I knew.

1689
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,160
All the Disney hippos are a lot of fun,

1690
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,160
but you should also think of hippos

1691
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,680
ravenously eating marbles.

1692
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,480
And in the game Hungry Hungry Hippos.

1693
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,840
But the cartoon on that would make you think,

1694
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,440
oh, they only eat marbles, not bones.

1695
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:29,200
Yeah, but bones are kind of like marbles.

1696
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,960
And your skull is kind of like a big marble.

1697
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,040
That's really what those hippos.

1698
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:35,120
With a brain in it.

1699
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:36,800
I've had a hippo once.

1700
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,520
Oh my God, you live to tell the tale.

1701
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:39,360
Yeah.

1702
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:40,200
Wait, what'd you do?

1703
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,240
I pet like a hippo.

1704
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,080
How big was it?

1705
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:42,900
Full hippo?

1706
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:43,740
It was a full hippo.

1707
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:46,760
I went behind the scenes at the Philadelphia Zoo once.

1708
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,960
And they were like, oh, come here, he's out.

1709
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:50,800
That's scary.

1710
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,680
In captivity, the hippo is very friendly.

1711
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,000
I don't know.

1712
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,360
I wouldn't trust that hippo.

1713
01:03:56,360 --> 01:04:00,120
Almost like inches away from the mouth.

1714
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:00,960
We were petting.

1715
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,200
The hippo was licking some people.

1716
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:06,120
Yeah, I've read articles about how they're killing machines.

1717
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:10,280
So gosh, the hippo must have been drugged.

1718
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,120
Oh yeah.

1719
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:15,720
Oh, I think when their food stuffs are provided for them,

1720
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,560
I think it was a rescued hippo.

1721
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,440
We're sending a mixed message here now.

1722
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,320
It was used to living in captivity.

1723
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,160
Some hippos.

1724
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,120
Some hippos who have been fed are okay.

1725
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:27,600
Been fed and there's like multiple zookeepers

1726
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,120
and like tour guides around.

1727
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:31,880
I'm still advocating the listener not pet a hippo.

1728
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,880
If the hippo's a friend of your parents,

1729
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:34,720
Yeah.

1730
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:35,800
That's all you want.

1731
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,560
Don't let the hippo pick you up from school

1732
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:38,960
if they're a friend of your parents.

1733
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,360
If the hippo was a crossing guard,

1734
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:43,360
does that make it okay to go with him?

1735
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:44,200
No, it does not.

1736
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,040
No.

1737
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,800
Is it okay to talk to a hippo?

1738
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,360
A strange hippo will bite your skull off.

1739
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:54,080
There is in one of my favorite details and props

1740
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,760
that I wrote down in Trader Sam's Anaheim

1741
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:01,160
is a in case of hippo attack case.

1742
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,800
Not sure what was in there, maybe a gun.

1743
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,400
And it said in case of hippo attack, break glass.

1744
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,240
And the glass is broken.

1745
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:12,120
So implying some hippo attack that's happened in the bar.

1746
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:14,200
Like a hippo burst in there one time

1747
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,640
and they never replenished the case.

1748
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,840
It recently happened probably.

1749
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:19,680
Yeah.

1750
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:20,960
Like in the narrative of the bar,

1751
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,120
it like happened an hour ago.

1752
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:23,960
Yeah, possibly.

1753
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,120
It was like a hippo attack, yeah.

1754
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,760
Unless this is a thing like Gordon Ramsay would yell about

1755
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,840
and like the hippo attacked 90 days ago

1756
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,320
and you haven't replaced the gun.

1757
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,560
We're shutting it down.

1758
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,680
Everyone, everyone.

1759
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,520
Everyone, everyone.

1760
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,360
Everyone.

1761
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,180
Everyone.

1762
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:41,020
Everyone.

1763
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:41,860
Everyone.

1764
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:42,680
Everyone.

1765
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:44,560
We've been on the Gordon Ramsay kick lately.

1766
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:47,480
He loves when he gets to like,

1767
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:51,120
there's a drip of water on the chicken, shut it down.

1768
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,520
I was gonna do by the.

1769
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:53,960
I love when he goes into a freezer

1770
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:58,960
and it's just like pouring like really scary liquids out.

1771
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,960
Just like, look at that, look at that mush.

1772
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,920
That was next to your chicken.

1773
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,480
You guys like, it's good, it's good mush.

1774
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,320
It's perfect mush.

1775
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,160
No, no, that's fine.

1776
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,280
That was from two days ago.

1777
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:11,120
Yeah, it's fine.

1778
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:11,940
I put that in a glass.

1779
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,160
We serve it to the customers. Two days.

1780
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,000
Yeah, yeah.

1781
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:14,840
It's delicious syrup.

1782
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:15,680
Sorry.

1783
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,520
Kids love it.

1784
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:19,920
Also just a quick plug for Pluto.tv.

1785
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,040
Pluto, not the dog, Disney dog.

1786
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:22,880
No.

1787
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,960
But Pluto.tv.

1788
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,880
They have like a station where you can just watch

1789
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:31,600
like Hell's Kitchen and like Kitchen Nightmares for free.

1790
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,440
I plugged Pluto.

1791
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:33,280
I'm a Pluto.

1792
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,120
That was great.

1793
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,840
I'm trying to get word out.

1794
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:36,840
Yeah. Pluto's good.

1795
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:37,680
It's wild.

1796
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,120
It's like there's so many,

1797
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:42,200
it fills the need of channel surfing, I feel like.

1798
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,040
Yeah.

1799
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,720
Because there's so many different streams and channels.

1800
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,040
Coming on the middle of something.

1801
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,680
Vintage Nickelodeon stuff.

1802
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,320
Like, yeah.

1803
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,480
There's a value to coming in on the middle of something.

1804
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:52,320
Absolutely.

1805
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,160
Yeah.

1806
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:54,000
That's true, yeah.

1807
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:54,920
Just landed on something.

1808
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:56,800
Yeah.

1809
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,880
Sorry, I took us way, I veered us way.

1810
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,240
No, no.

1811
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,080
Sorry about that.

1812
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:01,920
We're all Pluto.

1813
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:02,760
Plug for Pluto.

1814
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,400
And we're Tangent fans.

1815
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,080
The other, I think another,

1816
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:11,080
like a theme of the decor is implied danger.

1817
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,320
A lot of like, that's probably like

1818
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,680
one of the crazier elements of it.

1819
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,680
But in the house rules, it says like,

1820
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:22,480
blow dart guns are not to be used as drinking straws.

1821
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,280
And cannibals may not serve people.

1822
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,840
And like this, like part, the rules are crossed off.

1823
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,280
You don't even know what the rule was.

1824
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,480
Like they got to some point and like,

1825
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,160
we can't even have that on the sign

1826
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,760
because that's just gonna happen.

1827
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:35,600
Yeah.

1828
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,160
So I like this idea that like,

1829
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,640
around any corner, a hippo could burst in here

1830
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,480
at any minute.

1831
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,160
A cannibal could lunge up behind me

1832
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,560
and start biting my neck.

1833
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:50,560
I like when Disney gets macabre or like a little dark.

1834
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,600
Like, you see that in New World,

1835
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,480
in Haunted Mansion and Adventureland.

1836
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:55,720
I think they used to do,

1837
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:57,360
they used to do that kind of thing more often

1838
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,200
in the 50s and 60s.

1839
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,440
Like way more implied danger.

1840
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:01,800
And this feels like a throwback.

1841
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,160
It feels like maybe they got away with it

1842
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:06,480
because it was like less of a high profile thing.

1843
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,080
It's like, oh, this is just a bar at the hotel.

1844
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:09,920
We're not gonna scrutinize it like.

1845
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,520
And if it goes over the kid's head.

1846
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,360
Yeah, but you know what I mean?

1847
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:13,200
Like if it was.

1848
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,720
It's a bar, so kids are allowed in there,

1849
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,880
but you know, it's mainly an adult audience you're playing to.

1850
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:18,720
Right.

1851
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,360
So they could probably get away with a little more.

1852
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:21,200
Yeah.

1853
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,040
I'm guessing.

1854
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:22,880
Have at it.

1855
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,760
You're gonna die today, it says.

1856
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,120
It should be more clever than that, I guess, but.

1857
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,520
Yeah, but that's the gist.

1858
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,480
That's why Brandon's the bigger.

1859
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:32,560
Now the sign that just says,

1860
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,680
ask, answer, grass, no one rides for free.

1861
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:37,040
I don't quite understand why they have that one up.

1862
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,360
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1863
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,200
Mm-hmm.

1864
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:46,320
I was just gonna say like the whole collecting culture

1865
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:50,200
of the Tiki mugs, they have generations of them.

1866
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:53,280
So Danny, you were saying you have the golden piranha.

1867
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,440
I think they're, have they already done a new piranha?

1868
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,240
They might have, I can't remember.

1869
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,480
But they've done two generations of the Hatbox Ghost

1870
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,280
they've done.

1871
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,160
Because one, I don't think I've even paid attention

1872
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,600
to these on your mantle, Mike,

1873
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,280
that in one, his head is in his head.

1874
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:09,120
Yes.

1875
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,040
And in the other, it's in the box.

1876
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,960
Yeah, now that's, the one with the head on the head

1877
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,040
is from Disneyland, the other one is from Disney World,

1878
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,440
which is why I had to eBay it.

1879
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:17,280
That's really cool.

1880
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,320
And then they've done another generation of those,

1881
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:20,840
which are just slightly different colors

1882
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,240
and might be different material.

1883
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,080
Mm-hmm.

1884
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,000
The shipwreck one I have right there

1885
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,400
is the first generation shipwreck.

1886
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:27,360
It's the green barrel.

1887
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:28,200
The green barrel.

1888
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,040
I have that too.

1889
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:32,600
The first one, they've done like four or five of them.

1890
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:33,440
Yeah.

1891
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:36,400
And then that Nautilus there is from Trader Sam's Grotto,

1892
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,680
which is first generation Nautilus

1893
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:41,280
from like the year or two after they opened it.

1894
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:44,080
That's a very impressive, I had no idea

1895
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,480
that you were such a Sam's head.

1896
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:48,240
I'm a Sam's head, I'm a collect,

1897
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,040
I'm an exclusive collector's head too.

1898
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:51,640
You're in the Sam's club.

1899
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,960
If there was a Sam's club for Trader Sam's,

1900
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,440
I would be involved.

1901
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,280
Wholesale.

1902
01:09:58,680 --> 01:09:59,960
That is dangerous though,

1903
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,640
like for different printings

1904
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:04,320
or different generations of stuff like that,

1905
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,320
that can drive you mad.

1906
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,320
Yeah, I mean, it's a collect,

1907
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,400
there's a whole secondary market for it obviously.

1908
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:14,200
Like there's, I think the first generations are like,

1909
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:17,040
vaguely, I don't know, $100 now maybe.

1910
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:17,880
Yeah.

1911
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:18,800
Do you think Danny's Golden Prawn

1912
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,640
is gonna accrue in value or has already?

1913
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:21,880
It is made out of real gold.

1914
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,880
You know, I think it will accrue a little bit.

1915
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:26,000
I don't know that that one had like so much demand for it,

1916
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,920
but I will take a look after.

1917
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,400
I might melt it down.

1918
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,240
I don't know if it's real,

1919
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:33,080
I don't think it's real gold.

1920
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:35,480
I really like though, when you buy one of the mugs,

1921
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:36,760
they take your dirty mug away

1922
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:38,040
and give you a clean one.

1923
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:38,880
Yeah.

1924
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:39,880
In a box.

1925
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,360
Also the, I don't,

1926
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,760
did you write down in the drink I had in that by chance?

1927
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,560
Well, I think it just was the golden.

1928
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:46,400
Oh, is that what it was?

1929
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,240
Wait, no, no, no.

1930
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,040
It was like, it was the-

1931
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,480
Was it the Piranha Pool?

1932
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,680
Maybe, I don't know.

1933
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,200
It was really good though.

1934
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:56,720
It was like drinking like a grape slushie.

1935
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,840
Was it a, does it sound familiar?

1936
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,880
Strawberry vodka, pineapple juice,

1937
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:05,680
cream of coconut, strawberry puree, blue curacao.

1938
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,160
Oh man, I don't know.

1939
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,400
My memory is telling me there was some kind of grape taste,

1940
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:13,080
but it was just very sweet and sugary and that very well.

1941
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,280
It's going for about $50 on eBay.

1942
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,120
Really?

1943
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:18,680
I don't know how much I bought it for, but it wasn't 50.

1944
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:19,520
30?

1945
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,520
I don't think I bought it for 50.

1946
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,000
Probably 30.

1947
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,680
Maybe I'll hold onto it a while longer.

1948
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,480
This could be your kid's future.

1949
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:26,320
This is like a-

1950
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:27,160
You pay for college with one mug.

1951
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,760
They drink out of it their whole life winning spelling bees

1952
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,600
and then I'm like, all right, now I sell it.

1953
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:33,840
You put away childhood things.

1954
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,640
No, you can't, you're a monster.

1955
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:36,480
Trader Sam's-

1956
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:37,880
This was my financial plan.

1957
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:39,840
Trader Sam's mug.

1958
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,960
Why do you think I always line the bottom of it with plastic?

1959
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,640
I needed to keep it mint.

1960
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:48,400
You knew this was coming.

1961
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:51,400
And tell you to not have like pins or needles near it.

1962
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,200
It can't puncture.

1963
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,240
You're drinking from your college right now.

1964
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,720
I think my go-to is usually the Krakatoa Punch.

1965
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,080
The Sailor Jerry Spiced Rum,

1966
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,240
Ired XO Reserve Rum,

1967
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:11,480
Orge Gorilla Grog and Hibiscus Grenadine.

1968
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:12,320
That one's good.

1969
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,140
What does that come in?

1970
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:13,980
What's the mug?

1971
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:15,840
I am not 100% sure.

1972
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,400
How many mugs do you have Jason?

1973
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,880
I have the barrel, the shipwreck one,

1974
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:23,160
and then I have one that's like clear glass.

1975
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,480
That might've been what it is.

1976
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:28,000
It's clear glass and it's like a tiki head

1977
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,400
with little wings on the side.

1978
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,480
But that one is very similar to ones you just find

1979
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:35,560
at like the 99 cent store tiki mugs.

1980
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,800
Right, for sure.

1981
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:40,720
In my research, does food set anything off?

1982
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:41,560
It's only drinks, right?

1983
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:44,000
So I don't think food does.

1984
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,280
And also the menu, the menu,

1985
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:49,400
so this bar shares a kitchen with Tangaroa Terrace,

1986
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:52,280
which is now an outdoor bar,

1987
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:53,840
but also the quick service,

1988
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,400
one of the quick service spots for the Disneyland Hotel.

1989
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,280
And this menu changes so fucking much

1990
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:02,180
that when we went down,

1991
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:05,440
like I had like the Kaluwa Pork Poutine,

1992
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,320
and that was new as of like February of this year.

1993
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,060
And shortly after we had been there,

1994
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:11,640
they changed the menu again.

1995
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:12,480
Really?

1996
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,820
All the Kaluwa Pork stuff is gone.

1997
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:15,480
And now instead,

1998
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:18,920
because they had Kaluwa Pork nachos and poutine,

1999
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:22,840
and now in its place is Tonkatsu Ramen, pork ramen.

2000
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:23,680
Whoa.

2001
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:25,420
Like a bowl of ramen.

2002
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:26,260
Like a bowl of ramen.

2003
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:28,160
Disney, that's pretty cool.

2004
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,320
I kinda wanna try that.

2005
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,240
I had ramen at Disney last night.

2006
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,080
How was it?

2007
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:32,900
Whoa.

2008
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:33,740
For Disney, good.

2009
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:35,040
For regular ramen, fine.

2010
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:35,880
Yeah.

2011
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,760
And they have Hawaiian,

2012
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,120
they called a Hawaiian platter,

2013
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,040
but it's a plate lunch.

2014
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:44,080
You were at Disney then last night and the day before?

2015
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,960
Well, no, I didn't go to Disney the night before.

2016
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,680
We just were at nuts.

2017
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,120
Where in LA, that's right, okay.

2018
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:52,960
Where in LA would you put it ramen-wise if you're...

2019
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,360
I'm not like a ramen expert,

2020
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,960
so I couldn't give you a definitive ranking.

2021
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,080
That's fascinating, though.

2022
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:01,080
I would say, I mean, I would say it's like a B, B-.

2023
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,240
I'm glad you tried it.

2024
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,080
I wanna try this.

2025
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:07,360
For Disney, though, good.

2026
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,960
Yeah, yeah, you're great on a curve.

2027
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:09,800
Yeah.

2028
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:10,880
Disney getting into the pork,

2029
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,200
like I feel like I see pork belly on menus a lot now.

2030
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,880
And I think that's a thing where it's like,

2031
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:20,640
well, pork is so easy to make in large quantities and cheap,

2032
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,400
but I do in my head go like,

2033
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,280
oh, pork belly, that's interesting.

2034
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:27,360
And they can charge a little more the perceived value.

2035
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,760
They can charge a little more for it.

2036
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:29,600
Sure, sure.

2037
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,200
But plate lunch, that's fun.

2038
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:35,600
Also in the changing menu thing you were talking about,

2039
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:39,440
I ordered poke, which I had seen a website say

2040
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,200
you can order poke and the poke is pretty good

2041
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,120
and it wasn't on the menu,

2042
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,000
but I asked them and then they brought some out.

2043
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,320
So I don't know, and it was good.

2044
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,640
I would say if you're looking for food recommendations there

2045
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:50,480
and you're with a group,

2046
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,360
maybe just try that poo poo platter,

2047
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:53,480
which we did as well,

2048
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:55,760
which was just a big sampling of a bunch of stuff.

2049
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,320
There's like fried asparagus on there.

2050
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:59,680
The fried long beans.

2051
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:00,520
I like those.

2052
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:02,200
Tango crusted long beans.

2053
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,040
Those were good.

2054
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,520
Fantastic, yes, not overhyped.

2055
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:07,000
And a good dipping sauce.

2056
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,640
Yeah, that aioli was really fantastic.

2057
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:12,640
Okay, officially on the menu, poke bowl officially listed.

2058
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:13,480
Oh it is, okay.

2059
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:14,320
Yeah. Gotcha.

2060
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,480
What else do we eat, sliders or something?

2061
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,360
You had the burger, you had the Hawaiian burger.

2062
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:19,200
Oh yeah, yeah.

2063
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:22,960
It was fine, I don't wanna say.

2064
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:23,800
You're saying rougher maybe.

2065
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,520
I don't wanna say anything about Trader Sam

2066
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,080
and Fear Hill retaliate.

2067
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,920
That's right, then you're gonna end up with a burger.

2068
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,640
It was kinda like cold, it came out cold,

2069
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,760
which I didn't understand.

2070
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,280
The burgers are cold!

2071
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,360
Yeah. Shut it down!

2072
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,120
So I wanted to shut it down like Ramsay.

2073
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:39,040
I feel.

2074
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,640
If you had started yelling that

2075
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:44,120
and people would have thought it was a tiki effect going off,

2076
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:46,000
but wait, that's just a guy in the bar.

2077
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,680
Yeah, that guy's just trying to shut down the restaurant.

2078
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:51,360
Speaking in a British accent, he thinks he's Ramsay.

2079
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,080
He said his burger's cold.

2080
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,840
I don't know why it was cold, but.

2081
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,360
You put that ring of pineapple on something

2082
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,200
and I think that cools it down.

2083
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:00,040
Oh, that cooled it off!

2084
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:01,160
Yeah, showing effects.

2085
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,840
It is good if you get it fresh.

2086
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:03,680
That's right.

2087
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:05,440
It is like bacon and pineapple and cheese, it's good.

2088
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,920
I wasn't thinking that through.

2089
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,280
They should warm the pineapple up

2090
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:10,240
before they put it on there.

2091
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:11,360
Hot pineapple.

2092
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,200
Hot pineapple.

2093
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,800
Cause it didn't pan for a second, yeah, you're right.

2094
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,360
You guess so, I think maybe that mix

2095
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,200
is why I don't do pineapple on stuff more often.

2096
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,040
You mean the cold and the hot?

2097
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:23,120
Yeah, I think you do have a weird temperature balance.

2098
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,280
It works with pickles.

2099
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,440
Oh, that's true, oh, you're right.

2100
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:27,280
But why not?

2101
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,760
But pineapples are bigger.

2102
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,480
They're big, yeah, you absorb more cold.

2103
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,640
You're not getting a really thick pickle on a burger,

2104
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,400
which doesn't sound good at all.

2105
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,480
Cold pineapple's like an ice pack.

2106
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:37,320
It is.

2107
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,160
Yeah.

2108
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,920
Yeah, no wonder that burger was cold.

2109
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,720
I was like, how's this even possible?

2110
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:44,760
You're winning this memory test

2111
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,960
because you put all this together.

2112
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,760
Yeah, I couldn't remember what.

2113
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,160
I forgot we were competing.

2114
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:53,800
I don't think I explicitly said that

2115
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,560
we were competing against each other, but I guess so.

2116
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:01,000
I just remember that I tried one of the non-alcoholic drinks,

2117
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:06,000
which is just the Gorilla Grog and the hibiscus syrup.

2118
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:07,560
And that was good.

2119
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,160
I don't remember your guys' drinks.

2120
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:12,480
I had like a coconut one or something, I feel like.

2121
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,440
Yeah, I forget what that one is.

2122
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,640
Jason, we skipped past that you're,

2123
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,640
one of the things you typically get, crack a toe punch,

2124
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:23,200
that is probably the one that triggers the coolest effect.

2125
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:24,280
That's the volcano.

2126
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,120
Yes.

2127
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:25,960
Oh yeah.

2128
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,400
That's where the volcano erupts.

2129
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,720
I love that there's little streams of lava

2130
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:30,800
that keep going down.

2131
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,280
Like there's a projected burst,

2132
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,640
which looks really cool against the sky,

2133
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:38,080
but then the volcano itself starts changing color.

2134
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,280
Like the lava's slithering down.

2135
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:43,000
And then the room turns red and flashes,

2136
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:46,960
and a rain projection, and that is super cool.

2137
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:47,800
Am I crazy?

2138
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,920
Is there a drink there that's like a shared drink

2139
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:53,920
that triggers fireworks or something?

2140
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,360
The oa.

2141
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:57,560
Oh yeah, there's like a chant.

2142
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:59,680
There is, they ring a bell,

2143
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:02,880
and that is the one that causes the water spray.

2144
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:03,720
Oh yeah.

2145
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,280
That is where they take out a water bottle

2146
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,120
and start spraying it real high in the room.

2147
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,360
All the laptops, if they see a laptop.

2148
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,560
Straight at the ports.

2149
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:11,880
Straight at the ports.

2150
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:14,520
So long.

2151
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:15,360
Firewire.

2152
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,840
It's fun if you're deeper into the restaurant

2153
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,800
and you feel the rain and you don't know

2154
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:24,640
where it's coming from.

2155
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:25,480
Yeah.

2156
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,720
There's the delay of, is there just,

2157
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:30,120
do they just have rain sprinklers in here?

2158
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:31,480
You don't realize until you look.

2159
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:32,320
The bartender.

2160
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,160
It's the skipper.

2161
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:34,000
Yeah.

2162
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,480
Now that, if you do it in Florida, oh man.

2163
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,200
This was the moment when I was like, as I said,

2164
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:44,760
I, in Florida a couple months ago,

2165
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:46,720
I ate outside, but I was like,

2166
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:49,480
I gotta go in and see what all the artifacts are.

2167
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,000
And I knew I only had a couple minutes

2168
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:51,840
because it was crowded

2169
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:52,680
and they were gonna push me out of it.

2170
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:54,880
But literally the second I walked in,

2171
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:57,360
somebody had just ordered the oa.

2172
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,680
So it was the perfect time to walk in.

2173
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,240
And I just got my camera out

2174
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:02,760
because I wanted to see what happened.

2175
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:06,120
And it's all the things that happen in Anaheim.

2176
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:09,760
The guy spritz and rain, my phone was intact, luckily.

2177
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:10,680
They're ringing a bell.

2178
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:12,760
It's all really exciting, lights flashing on and off.

2179
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:15,800
And it was really fun because I was just filming

2180
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,760
and I didn't even see this

2181
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,720
until my phone camera whipped around to it.

2182
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:22,800
I turned around from the bar

2183
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:27,200
and saw the big Tiki god, oa.

2184
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:28,600
Whoa.

2185
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:33,400
Yeah, it's this like amazing, like huge, scary.

2186
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:34,280
That's cool.

2187
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,720
What do you call it? Tiki doll?

2188
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:37,160
What is it?

2189
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,000
Idol.

2190
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:38,840
Idol, sure.

2191
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,280
Yeah, yeah.

2192
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,720
As soon as I whipped to it, its eyes are flashing red

2193
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:46,280
and I gasped like, oh my God, I'm so happy

2194
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:47,280
I got the view of this room

2195
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,480
where I didn't even know it was there.

2196
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:53,000
So that is probably the coolest illusion in any of them.

2197
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,760
I feel so lucky I got to see it.

2198
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:58,200
And I didn't know the history of oa,

2199
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:03,200
that oa is from Enchanted Tiki Room under new management.

2200
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:04,560
Really?

2201
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,400
Wow, I didn't know that either.

2202
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,240
Didn't know it.

2203
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:07,080
Wow.

2204
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,360
A lot of history here for you, Danny.

2205
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:10,040
Danny looks dumbfound it.

2206
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,600
Have you been to the Tiki Room?

2207
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:13,440
Like durr?

2208
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:16,840
Um, no I haven't.

2209
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:17,680
You haven't been to the Tiki Room?

2210
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:18,920
Wait, wait, wait, is that with all the birds?

2211
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:19,760
That's with all the birds.

2212
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:20,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2213
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,440
Birds sing words and flowers croon.

2214
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:23,800
That's actually a wonderful time.

2215
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:26,200
It is really wonderful, just like so gentle.

2216
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,720
It's like a great place to go and sit and enjoy.

2217
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:30,240
It's great little, whenever you're taking the boys there,

2218
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:31,440
that's a good little chill out.

2219
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,280
It's gentle, yes.

2220
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:35,120
Yeah, for a while it was not so wonderful.

2221
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:35,960
Go on.

2222
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:38,880
Yeah, so it has basically been the same show

2223
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:42,600
in Disneyland forever, but in Disney World,

2224
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:45,640
and we gotta get to this as a topic at some point,

2225
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:48,400
at Disney World they tried to liven it up for the kids

2226
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,520
and they changed it and they called it

2227
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:53,000
Enchanted Tiki Room Under New Management.

2228
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,480
And the main thing they did was add the big popular birds

2229
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:00,960
of Disney's famous 90s popular birds.

2230
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:05,960
Iago from Aladdin and Zazu from The Lion King.

2231
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,040
Wow.

2232
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,320
They're now flush with movie cash

2233
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:11,680
and they are investing in a restaurant,

2234
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,720
much like Todd Rundgren before them.

2235
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:17,440
And they have bought the Tiki Room and they own it now.

2236
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:20,240
And they're way bigger than the little Tiki birds.

2237
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:22,120
They're like creepily larger.

2238
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,280
Yes, you know those two bird characters

2239
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:26,920
who yell at people in different ways?

2240
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:29,320
Well, now they're yelling at the Tiki birds

2241
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:34,320
for being out of touch and for not being good.

2242
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,440
That is the boring.

2243
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:37,760
Boring.

2244
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:40,880
So it's the same show, but now with critics in the-

2245
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:41,720
Yeah.

2246
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:43,120
Basically, that's a good way to frame it.

2247
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:45,680
Yeah, I haven't watched it in a long time, but yeah.

2248
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:48,320
And that's considered like, yeah, this is fine.

2249
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,600
Like this is, you guys don't like it.

2250
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:52,440
Well, it didn't last very long.

2251
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:53,280
No one likes it.

2252
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,120
No one hated this.

2253
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:54,960
It's gone, okay.

2254
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:55,800
Because people hate when anything-

2255
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:58,000
What a funny miscalculation.

2256
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,800
Really, yeah, to bring 90s attitude.

2257
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:03,360
It was a very poochy move, I feel.

2258
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,200
Yeah.

2259
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,200
We need some attitude in here.

2260
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,720
And it was supremely annoying.

2261
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:12,320
It was sadly because it was one of the few theme park uses

2262
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,240
of Phil Hartman ever.

2263
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,160
Phil Hartman was in it, I forget how.

2264
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:17,720
But there was this whole section where,

2265
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:21,200
because all the Tiki rooms have kind of like a rainstorm part,

2266
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:25,040
but in this version, this character, Owa, rises up.

2267
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,160
And I don't remember what she did.

2268
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:29,200
I didn't get that far.

2269
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:30,720
But this was a full animatronic,

2270
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,760
and they took that animatronic and installed it.

2271
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:33,720
Wow, I didn't realize.

2272
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:36,200
Which, with Trader Sam's being a thing

2273
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,040
that ties together all these mythologies,

2274
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,560
I really love that they took something

2275
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:42,560
from a universally agreed to be bad attraction

2276
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,560
and made it work.

2277
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:47,920
And named the big crazy drink after it.

2278
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:48,760
That's great.

2279
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:51,360
So is the original Trader Sam's in Disney World?

2280
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,040
No, it started here.

2281
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,600
As we said, they haven't been around that long,

2282
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,280
not even a decade.

2283
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:59,440
Even though it feels like it's always been there.

2284
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:03,680
So is that ride under, or whatever that show is that now,

2285
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:05,520
under old management again?

2286
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,360
It's back to the old way.

2287
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:07,200
Yes, yes.

2288
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,400
Now the sign says under original, back to original.

2289
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:10,240
It does say that?

2290
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:11,080
No, no, no.

2291
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:11,920
I just believed it.

2292
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,320
Reverted back to original.

2293
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,200
We heard your complaints.

2294
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,040
We're sorry.

2295
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:17,000
We apologize.

2296
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,800
Oddly in Japan, that same show is taken over by Stitch,

2297
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,360
and that one didn't bother me as much.

2298
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:24,200
Stitch is kind of awesome.

2299
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,640
No, and he doesn't really.

2300
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:26,680
They love Stitch in Japan.

2301
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:27,720
He's a rascal.

2302
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,760
He's not mean.

2303
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,480
And he doesn't show up for a long time.

2304
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:32,320
He's in the regular Tiki room.

2305
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:33,920
Finale, yeah.

2306
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:36,880
I gotta find some YouTube of these angry birds.

2307
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,120
It's really, but do you remember any other details?

2308
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:40,960
I mean, we gotta just do this season episode proper.

2309
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:41,840
I haven't watched it in forever.

2310
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,040
I never saw it in person.

2311
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:44,000
I don't think I did.

2312
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,360
I saw it, yeah.

2313
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:46,200
I was upset.

2314
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:48,280
I wanted to see my friends sing their songs,

2315
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:51,040
and then Iago is.

2316
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:51,880
Shut up!

2317
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:52,720
Shut up!

2318
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,160
Don't say, shut it down!

2319
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:55,000
Shut it down.

2320
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,600
Did he say that?

2321
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:57,440
Yeah.

2322
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,000
The chicken is cold!

2323
01:23:59,000 --> 01:23:59,840
Oh.

2324
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:02,760
Just hating on the show you all like.

2325
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:03,600
Yeah.

2326
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,560
There's like, they change the lyrics to friend like me

2327
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:10,280
to like, we're out in this place now, that, that, that.

2328
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:11,280
Like he.

2329
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,120
It's very strange.

2330
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,520
They are like, aggressively ruining it.

2331
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,240
They're aggressively ruining it.

2332
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:17,320
And they make the birds feel bad and different

2333
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:18,880
because Zazu's more cutting.

2334
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:19,720
They make the birds feel bad.

2335
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:24,720
Zazu's more cutting, and then Iago's like just so big.

2336
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:28,840
But I think eventually Zazu and Iago come around

2337
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:31,360
and they're like, we can have it both ways.

2338
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:35,120
Cause they then anger the gods with their hubris.

2339
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,440
This is, yeah, we gotta.

2340
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:37,280
We gotta get into this.

2341
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:38,920
Are they truly flush with movie cash

2342
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:41,120
or is that your addition?

2343
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:41,960
It's like, oh they do it pretty good.

2344
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:42,800
Well they buy it, right?

2345
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:43,640
They do buy the room.

2346
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:44,480
Yeah, they buy it.

2347
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:45,300
So.

2348
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:48,280
I think it is, it is that Looney Tunes world

2349
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:52,400
where they are the actors who were in the movie.

2350
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,240
And now like, they, like an assistant would be like,

2351
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,880
telephone for you, Mr. Zazu.

2352
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,440
Like I think it is that they are movie famous

2353
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,600
and have money and are blowing it on a restaurant

2354
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:03,440
like any movie star.

2355
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,480
They're playing themselves in the movie.

2356
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:05,320
Yeah, yeah.

2357
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:06,160
Yes, yeah, yeah.

2358
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:08,360
And I, here, I just went to the Wikipedia.

2359
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:09,760
I mean, we'll do an episode later,

2360
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:13,080
but I can't not say, Jesus Christ.

2361
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:16,400
It is that there's, it starts with two animatronic,

2362
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:19,600
two can agents.

2363
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:23,520
One is named William and one is named Morris.

2364
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:24,360
Oh.

2365
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:25,200
No.

2366
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,120
Fuck off.

2367
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:27,400
This sort of 90s.

2368
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,920
As a WGA member, I'm walking out of this.

2369
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:33,080
I do not approve this show.

2370
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:36,960
The 90s self-aware humor aged immediately

2371
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:41,960
compared to the 50s, 60s, like kind of couched body

2372
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,480
that like couch goes over the kids' heads.

2373
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:45,320
Yeah.

2374
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:46,320
Which is still.

2375
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:47,600
It's cheesy, but in a forever.

2376
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:48,720
It's cheesy, yeah.

2377
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:52,840
But in, and like the 90s, like they, they may have been

2378
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:57,840
like kids are gonna listen to Tiki Tiki Tiki Room

2379
01:25:58,160 --> 01:25:59,920
on the Walkmans.

2380
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,360
Like they may as well have said something like that.

2381
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:03,960
It aged so fast.

2382
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:06,120
William and Morris were voiced by Phil Hartman

2383
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,440
and Don Rickles.

2384
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:08,280
Oh, man.

2385
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:11,800
Two greats wasted in a terrible.

2386
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,040
And they have to say dialogue about like, I gotta go.

2387
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:16,240
I'm going to sign Donald Duck.

2388
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:20,000
No, well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna sign the Mighty Ducks.

2389
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,920
Oh, wow.

2390
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,200
Wow, Mighty, what year does this open again?

2391
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:26,560
Like 97 or 98.

2392
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,400
The Mighty Ducks.

2393
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:28,240
98.

2394
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:30,680
Oh, and they're pushing the new hockey team and stuff.

2395
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:31,720
And the cartoon.

2396
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,360
Do you remember the Mighty Ducks series?

2397
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,520
That's another, we promised that as well.

2398
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,200
The Mighty Ducks was in a cartoon, wasn't it?

2399
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:38,040
Yeah.

2400
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:38,880
They did a cartoon.

2401
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,640
No, no, no, they were ducks.

2402
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,480
They were ducks.

2403
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:45,400
It was a sci-fi action adventure show about a duck world

2404
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,320
that also loves hockey.

2405
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:48,160
Oh, there's hockey.

2406
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:49,000
There is hockey.

2407
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:49,840
They all have guns.

2408
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:50,680
They're ducky pucks.

2409
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:52,640
Ducks who play hockey.

2410
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,840
And they were like, let's see how far we can push

2411
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,320
this Mighty Ducks thing.

2412
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:57,800
We got a movie, we got a hockey team.

2413
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:58,640
Let's do it.

2414
01:26:58,640 --> 01:26:59,480
Synergy, yeah.

2415
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:01,280
And now a really irritating cartoon.

2416
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:02,960
So it was bad.

2417
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,080
Yes, well, we have to watch it and see.

2418
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:05,920
We gotta watch it.

2419
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:06,760
Is it on Disney Plus?

2420
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:07,600
I like it as a time.

2421
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:08,440
It's on Disney Plus.

2422
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:09,840
Whoa, I gotta watch some Mighty Ducks.

2423
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:12,360
I watched the Jefferson Starship theme song.

2424
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:16,400
Weirdly, it's about a duck world,

2425
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,240
just like Howard the Duck.

2426
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:19,960
That's where Howard the Duck is from.

2427
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,760
So they stole the idea of a duck planet.

2428
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:23,600
Yeah, really?

2429
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,840
From one of the most unpleasant films

2430
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,560
in the history of time.

2431
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:29,480
But now Disney owns Howard the Duck.

2432
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:30,320
Yeah.

2433
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,600
They own the 80s Howard, they own the characters.

2434
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:33,440
They own the characters.

2435
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:34,280
The Marvel characters.

2436
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:35,120
Whoever owns.

2437
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,760
The characters in a couple of,

2438
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:38,640
it's in Guardians of the Galaxy, right?

2439
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:41,360
Yeah, people cheered at that.

2440
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,000
They should have a lot of affection for Howard.

2441
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,480
I'd like it if they brought back Howard.

2442
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:45,320
That'd be good.

2443
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:46,160
I think they could do it.

2444
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,000
They're doing a cartoon.

2445
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:48,840
They're doing a cartoon.

2446
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:49,680
There's a Hulu cartoon, I think.

2447
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,920
There was a popular run in the comics

2448
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:53,960
in the last few years.

2449
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:55,400
Oh yeah, definitely had a big seat.

2450
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:58,320
70s Howard the Duck in the comics world has.

2451
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,160
Definitely.

2452
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:02,840
But he's moving right up, just, yeah, yeah.

2453
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:03,680
But his, I mean.

2454
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:04,520
We've talked about that.

2455
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:05,840
Howard the Duck was very,

2456
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:08,240
I think maybe I was moving past it

2457
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:11,600
because Howard the Duck is an extremely sexual film.

2458
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:12,440
Do you remember this?

2459
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:13,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2460
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,280
There's nude ducks.

2461
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:16,520
There's duck nipples in it.

2462
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:17,600
Not for kids, basically.

2463
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,280
This is why we sanitize with that word seat.

2464
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:23,560
Because we know how far duck sexuality can be taken.

2465
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:24,560
We know, we've seen it.

2466
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:27,160
And that's, look, George Lucas pushed for that.

2467
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:28,120
They're sexualizing the ducks.

2468
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:29,840
He was producing the movie.

2469
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:30,680
It was him?

2470
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:31,760
There was a lot of duck fun.

2471
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:35,920
I know for a fact, 100%, that George Lucas himself

2472
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,880
crafted the duck breasts.

2473
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:38,720
No.

2474
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:39,560
I'm just kidding.

2475
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,280
You lie.

2476
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:44,360
And when he handed over to Eiger,

2477
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:47,240
here's my ideas for episodes seven, eight, and nine.

2478
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:49,280
It was a 500 page document,

2479
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,160
but it was just, most of the pages are empty.

2480
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:54,120
It was just one cover page that said duck tits.

2481
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:58,360
That's why Eiger.

2482
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:00,120
Eiger wrote about it in his book and said,

2483
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:01,360
you know, we respect George

2484
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:03,080
and what he's added to the pop culture,

2485
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:05,120
but JJ wanted to go a different way.

2486
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:10,920
And a reverent choice.

2487
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:13,000
George complained to Charlie Rose about it.

2488
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,640
Just didn't like the duck tits.

2489
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:18,320
And the wills.

2490
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:21,960
Anyway.

2491
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:24,640
What are we gonna recover from this?

2492
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:25,480
I don't know.

2493
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:26,320
I don't know.

2494
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:27,240
We're all lost now.

2495
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:28,800
There is a fun version to do, Howard.

2496
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,800
Howard the Duck kind of in comics regarded as like

2497
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:36,800
after the big, like first decade or so of Mad Magazine,

2498
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:39,840
Howard the Duck was kind of Marvel's like funny

2499
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,680
like character and well-received.

2500
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:43,120
Crumb inspired.

2501
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:45,600
Crumb kind of, yeah, more a PG crumb.

2502
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:46,960
And also some weird.

2503
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,320
Yeah, a little bit of like a lethario vibe.

2504
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:52,520
There's creators ownership issues with that too though

2505
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,720
with Howard, with like the creator and Marvel,

2506
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:56,560
like a little like Watchmen.

2507
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:57,400
Who is it?

2508
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:58,560
Is it Steve Gerber? Steve Gerber.

2509
01:29:58,560 --> 01:29:59,840
Yeah. Oh yeah.

2510
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:00,680
I don't know.

2511
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:02,360
He came back and did a new Howard the Duck series

2512
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:03,180
a few years ago,

2513
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:05,120
but I think there's still some tension there.

2514
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:07,960
I'm sure they, I'm sure all those comics companies

2515
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:10,280
will pay a really fairly for the characters they made.

2516
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:11,560
I'm sure they'll treat everyone fairly.

2517
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:13,400
They always do.

2518
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:14,680
Anyway. Anyway.

2519
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:18,160
Danny, I think they're implying something that they won't.

2520
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:19,000
I don't know.

2521
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,280
Yeah, that seems like a little.

2522
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,600
We said a sentence.

2523
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:23,840
Don't read into it at all.

2524
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,640
Don't read into it at all.

2525
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:26,480
Don't listen to Alan Moore.

2526
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:29,040
I'm skimming my notes and I'm wrapping it up.

2527
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:30,480
I don't have a lot left.

2528
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:34,360
Oh, we've got, it's on fire.

2529
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:35,200
They light the drink on fire.

2530
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:36,360
They bring it, they light it on fire.

2531
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:38,320
They throw some little stuff at it

2532
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:39,160
that makes a fire flare up.

2533
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:40,160
Yeah, like pops. Right, right.

2534
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:43,560
Yeah, that pops and you cannot order it alone.

2535
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:44,680
It is a punch bowl.

2536
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:47,200
You have to have multiple people with big straws.

2537
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:48,040
They don't want to kill anyone.

2538
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:48,880
Yes.

2539
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,080
That isn't what the regular,

2540
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:51,960
that's what isn't what Mac the regular

2541
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:54,400
we established earlier, hopefully is having.

2542
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,240
Right.

2543
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:58,000
Do you have like just a bunch of,

2544
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,360
I know we saw like something from up there,

2545
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:01,840
like a jug or something.

2546
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:04,280
Do you have like, I'd be really curious if you.

2547
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:05,120
Yeah, coin jar.

2548
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,280
Where they're collecting,

2549
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:08,920
like they're saving up for their big trip to Paradise Falls.

2550
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:09,760
Yeah.

2551
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:10,600
That the movie is.

2552
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:11,440
I'd be curious if there's,

2553
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:12,760
I know we talked about Indiana Jones,

2554
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:14,520
but whenever I'm there, I'm like,

2555
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:16,280
I'm missing a lot right now.

2556
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:17,440
I've learned a lot today.

2557
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:18,800
I probably have other ones.

2558
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:23,440
There's a newspaper that says Indiana Jones wanted

2559
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:24,960
by Honduran government.

2560
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:26,800
I like that.

2561
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,960
I like the aftermath of the press.

2562
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:30,200
He's like wanted.

2563
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:31,040
There's also some,

2564
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:33,560
there's a note from Sala.

2565
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:35,240
We're offering tours of our temple.

2566
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,720
I'll come back on Tuesday to get the map.

2567
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:39,280
So that like that map that he has,

2568
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:40,680
like Sala is going to come.

2569
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:41,520
Right.

2570
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:42,360
But at some point.

2571
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:44,880
And I didn't see this in looking through.

2572
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,360
And I would be interested to know what

2573
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:51,000
in the narrative of the place, what the date is.

2574
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,440
Did you come across that at all?

2575
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:54,920
Cause usually they do place like these places

2576
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:57,000
in a specific time period.

2577
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,920
So I would wonder if they actually have a date.

2578
01:31:58,920 --> 01:31:59,760
They probably do.

2579
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:00,600
Obviously this guy's a nerd.

2580
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,280
I think there can't be if up is in it.

2581
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:03,280
And I mean, I bet it's,

2582
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:06,360
I bet they're thinking it's 30s, 40s primarily.

2583
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:07,480
With the Indiana Jones.

2584
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:10,200
And that's what they turn the jungle crews into

2585
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:11,360
along with Indiana Jones.

2586
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:15,960
But as soon as like what year is Jack Sparrow happening?

2587
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:17,400
What year is Jack Sparrow from?

2588
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:20,400
Well, that would be, yeah, that would be very far back.

2589
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:23,600
That would be, is that 1800s, 1700s?

2590
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:26,400
But Jack Sparrow becomes a mortal in one of them.

2591
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:27,240
He does.

2592
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:28,080
Doesn't he?

2593
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:28,920
Yeah, sure.

2594
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:31,680
I feel like he gets like, he becomes a ghost in one of them.

2595
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:33,640
He's got that Keith Richards blood transfusion.

2596
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:34,480
That's right.

2597
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,560
He goes to a Swedish clinic and gets a.

2598
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,760
Yeah, a hyperbaric chamber shows up.

2599
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:40,040
And then Charlie Jones are sitting

2600
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:42,480
in a hospital room together.

2601
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:44,280
What's up, Q?

2602
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:48,560
It is a little ethereal, a little out of time.

2603
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:49,760
There's letters and postcards

2604
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:53,000
from Adventurers Club members in it.

2605
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,880
And they are always celebrating New Year's Eve

2606
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:57,240
of a certain year.

2607
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:58,680
It might be the late 20s.

2608
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:00,760
Oh, is this Pleasure Island?

2609
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:02,600
There's a, Danny, when you were in Japan,

2610
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:05,080
did you go on the Tower of Terror there?

2611
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,640
I didn't.

2612
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:07,680
I screwed up.

2613
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:08,520
I didn't go.

2614
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,200
You made a big mistake.

2615
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:14,040
I skipped out.

2616
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:15,440
I was like, I've been on the Tower of Terror.

2617
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:16,280
And then.

2618
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:17,120
No, you haven't.

2619
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:17,960
And I hadn't.

2620
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:19,080
I heard it was very different.

2621
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:19,920
I'm sorry to do this to you.

2622
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:22,440
I was like, I assume it's just Twilight Zone stuff.

2623
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:23,720
And boy, was I wrong.

2624
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:24,560
I'm sorry to do this to you.

2625
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:27,200
I have to leave the blank space for the episodes to yell.

2626
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:28,960
For the blank space for the listeners to yell,

2627
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,560
you fucked up, Danny.

2628
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,200
Okay, ready and.

2629
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:34,320
Ow. Sorry.

2630
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:35,160
That's okay.

2631
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:36,440
I can live with that.

2632
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:38,200
It's better than a voodoo doll.

2633
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:40,720
Yeah, I'll take that over a voodoo doll.

2634
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:41,560
Yeah, yeah.

2635
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:42,520
Just verbal stings.

2636
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,560
Well, I have something to say to the listener.

2637
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,080
I thought this through it also.

2638
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,040
Hey, listener.

2639
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:55,480
And now I'm in my car yelling at you.

2640
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:56,960
Oh. Oh, good.

2641
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:57,800
Oh, wow.

2642
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:58,640
Oh, my God.

2643
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:00,000
That was silent to silent.

2644
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:00,840
Yeah.

2645
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:01,680
Interesting.

2646
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:02,520
You know what?

2647
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:03,360
No, no, no.

2648
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:04,880
I think you, no, you bested them.

2649
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:06,440
You bested all of those listeners.

2650
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:08,520
I'm in an inception type of a situation.

2651
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,680
This is why you have the good jobs.

2652
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,800
By the way, I just wanted to talk about this chair

2653
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:16,880
for one second.

2654
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:17,720
Yeah.

2655
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:18,880
Since the moment I've sat in it,

2656
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:23,080
I've felt like I've been looking for a seatbelt.

2657
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:23,920
What?

2658
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:24,760
What do you mean?

2659
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:25,880
Not literally, but it's just, there's something

2660
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:27,400
like about this chair that makes me feel

2661
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:28,840
like I should have a seatbelt on.

2662
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:30,440
Like it's a ride or like it's on a car,

2663
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:31,280
like a moving car.

2664
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:32,120
I don't know.

2665
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:35,960
I mean, we should save this for after the podcast.

2666
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:37,520
And I hope I haven't offended my hosts.

2667
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:39,520
No, I think that people are gonna be very interested

2668
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,520
into it, because we don't really talk about this chairs

2669
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:42,640
where I was gonna say seats,

2670
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:44,320
the chairs and couches were sitting on.

2671
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:45,760
So I think that's actually probably an insight

2672
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,960
the listener would like to know.

2673
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:48,240
It is the hot seat.

2674
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:51,440
He's sitting on the guest chair, which is green chair.

2675
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:53,440
It's Lindsay's chair that she got from somebody

2676
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:54,360
and almost got rid of it.

2677
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:56,240
I think it's falling apart a little bit.

2678
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:57,080
Maybe that's.

2679
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,240
But that might be what it is.

2680
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:00,560
You just feel like your job is a bumpiness to it.

2681
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:01,720
I don't think it's a ride.

2682
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:03,720
I think it's more like a car instinct,

2683
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:05,120
like, oh, I'm right in.

2684
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:07,480
Do you feel like it's sinking slowly?

2685
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:09,280
All a stool.

2686
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,480
You guys are really tall right now.

2687
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:14,160
Maybe we played a little trick on you.

2688
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:16,520
We hit the chair shrinking button.

2689
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:17,360
Damn it.

2690
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:20,120
And you thought you had the upper hand

2691
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:21,760
with that car yelling trick.

2692
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,280
Is it Jackie Johnson?

2693
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:25,600
Is that from the did Lindsay get that from

2694
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,080
past guest Jackie Johnson?

2695
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:28,480
I feel like she mentioned it when she was.

2696
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:29,320
It's not.

2697
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:32,480
And I wanna point out, Jackie, this chair is great.

2698
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:34,600
And I like this chair.

2699
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:37,360
There's just something about it that I feel like

2700
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:39,360
I'm ready to put on a seatbelt.

2701
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:41,400
Maybe just being on the podcast,

2702
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:43,520
we're coming at you with some of the facts

2703
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:46,120
and quips and stuff that you feel like you need a seatbelt

2704
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:49,800
to strap yourself in from this adrenaline rush you've got.

2705
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:51,360
Yeah, you need sort of that harness.

2706
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:52,520
You're on the edge of your seat.

2707
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:54,560
But from all of this exciting information.

2708
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:58,440
You guys talked a lot about Goofy's roller coaster.

2709
01:35:58,440 --> 01:35:59,280
Not at all.

2710
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:00,100
His Sky School?

2711
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:01,600
It's a great roller coaster.

2712
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,320
We are a little freaked out by it.

2713
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:08,480
It's like a scary, it's supposed to be for kids and stuff.

2714
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:11,000
But it's actually a very, there's a scariness to it.

2715
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
It's a wild dance.

2716
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,080
It scares me way more than any of the big ones.

2717
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:14,920
Yeah, it's a great ride.

2718
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:16,960
You feel too naked on it.

2719
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:18,960
Like you don't have a lot to hold on to.

2720
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,960
And there's never a line you can get right on.

2721
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:24,480
Yeah, because most people I think feel the same way we do.

2722
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:25,760
I would think.

2723
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,560
Because now it's never even a thought in my head

2724
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:28,840
when I'm there to go on it.

2725
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:31,000
I'll go on it right before we do the eventual episode.

2726
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,240
Isn't that what Kyle said to us?

2727
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:34,280
Like he has to convince people to.

2728
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:35,320
You think so, yeah.

2729
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:38,240
He can't get his full party to go on Goofy's Sky School.

2730
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:39,280
It's an acquired taste.

2731
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:40,120
It's a good one.

2732
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:41,400
It's the scariest ride in the park.

2733
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:42,920
I just like that there's no line

2734
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:44,320
and it's a great roller coaster.

2735
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:46,640
That style of roller coaster is called a wild mouse

2736
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:50,800
because it makes you feel like you're going off the edge

2737
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:55,800
at every turn because the seat turns after the wheels.

2738
01:36:56,920 --> 01:36:58,600
So you think you're about to fall off.

2739
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:00,320
Yeah, it does have that feeling.

2740
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:01,140
I didn't know that.

2741
01:37:01,140 --> 01:37:01,980
That's a good name for it.

2742
01:37:02,620 --> 01:37:04,900
It used to be called Mulholland Madness

2743
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:06,700
and it was simulating what it was like

2744
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:08,900
to be on a crazy LA road.

2745
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:09,740
Really?

2746
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:12,020
Yeah, to be like a drunk celebrity.

2747
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:12,860
I'm glad I brought this up.

2748
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:13,940
Driving all over.

2749
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:14,940
Yeah.

2750
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:16,780
Taking one last hell ride.

2751
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:19,660
You're Mel Gibson pre-famous police stop.

2752
01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:20,500
Yeah.

2753
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:21,900
It's also like the beginning of Mulholland Drive.

2754
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:23,860
There's like a car crash, spoiler.

2755
01:37:23,860 --> 01:37:24,700
Oh yeah.

2756
01:37:24,700 --> 01:37:25,780
So it's kind of as close as,

2757
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:28,700
it was like an unofficial Mulholland Drive ride.

2758
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:31,020
It was like kind of a David Lynch.

2759
01:37:31,060 --> 01:37:33,580
There's no David Lynch theme park attractions are there?

2760
01:37:33,580 --> 01:37:34,700
Oh, if only.

2761
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:35,540
There should be.

2762
01:37:35,540 --> 01:37:37,260
No, I don't think so.

2763
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:39,300
Yeah, they should have him come into Imagineering

2764
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:40,700
that once in a while.

2765
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:41,540
Yeah.

2766
01:37:41,540 --> 01:37:42,360
Advise on something.

2767
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:43,200
Yeah.

2768
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:44,040
Something cool.

2769
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:44,880
I was gonna say this,

2770
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,740
I guess it starts sort of with Adventurers Club.

2771
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:48,820
The whole little universe they've been building out

2772
01:37:48,820 --> 01:37:51,600
and it goes from like this to Tropical Hideaway,

2773
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:55,200
which is in Disneyland and then Jock Lindsey's also,

2774
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,180
which is a little less fun.

2775
01:37:56,180 --> 01:37:58,980
Which ties in Indiana, also in Indiana Jones themed.

2776
01:37:58,980 --> 01:37:59,820
Yeah.

2777
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:00,780
And then in Orlando,

2778
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:03,100
like this little universe they've built out

2779
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:05,640
and continue to build out is very fun.

2780
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:08,100
Will it make an appearance in the Jungle Cruise movie

2781
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:09,260
with The Rock?

2782
01:38:09,260 --> 01:38:11,380
I've heard people say that it will.

2783
01:38:11,380 --> 01:38:12,220
I don't know specifically.

2784
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:14,020
A Trader Sam might be in the movie.

2785
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:15,220
I don't, something.

2786
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:17,540
I honestly, I don't know much more than just what I said now.

2787
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:18,940
So we'll see.

2788
01:38:18,940 --> 01:38:21,620
But supposedly there might be some little light references

2789
01:38:21,620 --> 01:38:24,700
to see, which is the Society of Explorers and Adventurers.

2790
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:26,500
It's a whole thing.

2791
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:27,340
So I like that.

2792
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:29,380
I don't know, hopefully this movie won't ruin it.

2793
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:30,900
Basically, Danny, there's all this stuff.

2794
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:33,860
They're connecting a lot of rides

2795
01:38:33,860 --> 01:38:35,220
and even just restaurants and stuff.

2796
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:36,820
They're establishing all of these figures

2797
01:38:36,820 --> 01:38:39,700
who are like the owners of some of the,

2798
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:42,180
here's the guy who owns the Big Thunder Railroad

2799
01:38:42,180 --> 01:38:43,620
or what I was starting to say,

2800
01:38:43,620 --> 01:38:47,780
the Tower of Terror in Japan is owned by a particular guy

2801
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:50,980
who went and stole goods from tribes and stuff.

2802
01:38:50,980 --> 01:38:52,220
Harrison Hightower.

2803
01:38:52,220 --> 01:38:55,020
And there's a letter involving him in Trader Sam.

2804
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:57,020
So they're building up all of this

2805
01:38:57,980 --> 01:39:00,540
past 30s old timey.

2806
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:02,340
They're all rolling it into one thing.

2807
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:05,380
It seems like, Trader Sam is yet another piece

2808
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:09,780
in them connecting all of these formerly disparate universes.

2809
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:10,620
Yeah, so they'll be like.

2810
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:12,140
And bring Jack Sparrow into it too.

2811
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:14,740
Or even like there's an Indiana Jones.

2812
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:19,220
They bring in a James Garner movie called The Castaway.

2813
01:39:19,220 --> 01:39:21,060
Castaway Cowboy.

2814
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:21,900
Yeah.

2815
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:24,100
Like they're pulling weird old 50s.

2816
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:25,100
What's this thing called?

2817
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:26,420
Castaway Cowboy.

2818
01:39:26,420 --> 01:39:28,460
No, this project.

2819
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:32,660
Well, there's a thing called Sea Society of Explorers.

2820
01:39:32,660 --> 01:39:34,500
So like the Adventurers Club was where like

2821
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:36,780
members of sea would get together.

2822
01:39:36,780 --> 01:39:39,100
And that was the place they get like hammered.

2823
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:40,780
And then they had made up all these characters

2824
01:39:40,780 --> 01:39:42,740
that are like the owners of rides.

2825
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:45,140
So there's a character named Barnabas T. Bullion

2826
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:47,140
who's the owner of Big Thunder Mountain.

2827
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:48,860
And they have references to them

2828
01:39:48,860 --> 01:39:50,580
and all these different attractions.

2829
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:53,500
Their headquarters is at Disney Sea in Magellan's,

2830
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:55,380
the restaurant Magellan's.

2831
01:39:55,380 --> 01:40:00,220
So they've slowly built out a not cinematic universe,

2832
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:02,060
but a whatever theme park universe.

2833
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:02,900
Like a ride universe.

2834
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:05,180
And like it's just like as they were filling in details,

2835
01:40:05,180 --> 01:40:07,100
cause they have to fill, come up with all these

2836
01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:09,500
different details to make the place feel lived in.

2837
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,700
They just started drawing the lines between them.

2838
01:40:11,700 --> 01:40:13,100
And it's like, this guy knows this guy

2839
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:14,420
and this guy knows they're all friends.

2840
01:40:14,420 --> 01:40:15,580
So it's very fun.

2841
01:40:15,580 --> 01:40:17,980
It's kind of an Avengers a little bit.

2842
01:40:17,980 --> 01:40:20,700
A lot like theme park ride owners

2843
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:23,020
who are not usually featured in the rides.

2844
01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:23,860
Yeah.

2845
01:40:23,860 --> 01:40:24,700
It's not.

2846
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:28,260
We've all been begging for it.

2847
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:29,460
It's also pretty subtle.

2848
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:32,500
So like only if you're a maniac who listens to the show,

2849
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:33,740
do you like care about it?

2850
01:40:33,740 --> 01:40:34,780
So like you're going through,

2851
01:40:34,780 --> 01:40:37,260
it's not like you need to know the name

2852
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:39,060
of the owner of the ride before you ride

2853
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:41,460
or else they won't let you, which would be funny.

2854
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:43,940
Like you don't have to answer a quiz.

2855
01:40:43,940 --> 01:40:46,420
There's nods to imagine nears.

2856
01:40:46,420 --> 01:40:47,260
Yeah, yeah.

2857
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:49,220
Sorry, back to the start.

2858
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:51,940
Better brush up on your trivia.

2859
01:40:52,180 --> 01:40:54,180
A lot of rides have nods to imagine nears.

2860
01:40:54,180 --> 01:40:56,740
We talked about Joe Rodie being in this,

2861
01:40:58,100 --> 01:41:01,180
I will call it an attraction, even though it's a bar.

2862
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:04,980
There's Banjo that says Banjo lessons from H. Goff.

2863
01:41:04,980 --> 01:41:08,220
Harbert Goff was a very early imagineer,

2864
01:41:08,220 --> 01:41:10,300
not often, sometimes not mentioned,

2865
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:11,780
but was like a very influential.

2866
01:41:11,780 --> 01:41:13,540
I think they jokingly called him

2867
01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:16,900
like the second imagineer Walt hired.

2868
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:19,220
The one who drew the layout of Disneyland

2869
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:20,500
took that initial order.

2870
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:21,340
Something like that.

2871
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:25,500
He also is known for designing the very first,

2872
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:29,460
the Glamour Trams, the first Universal Studios tour guide

2873
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:32,100
trams back in the 60s.

2874
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:32,940
The Glamour Trams.

2875
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:34,580
The Glamour Trams they called them.

2876
01:41:34,580 --> 01:41:35,820
I missed that name.

2877
01:41:35,820 --> 01:41:38,500
Yeah, that was what they just, the tour you said?

2878
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:40,460
Yeah, the tour trams, like the red ones.

2879
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:41,660
I wonder when they lost that name.

2880
01:41:41,660 --> 01:41:43,300
Scott should have been on the Glamour Trams.

2881
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:44,140
I would have loved to.

2882
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:44,980
Yeah, yeah.

2883
01:41:44,980 --> 01:41:46,220
That's much better than the trams.

2884
01:41:46,220 --> 01:41:48,300
The only way to have made that job better.

2885
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:51,300
Like the perfect job in my head.

2886
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:53,860
That's the most grasses greeners.

2887
01:41:53,860 --> 01:41:56,460
I've like built up that job now.

2888
01:41:56,460 --> 01:41:58,860
That was the best time of my life.

2889
01:41:58,860 --> 01:42:00,260
Forgotten all the shit.

2890
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:01,100
All the shit.

2891
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:03,060
What was boring about it.

2892
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:08,060
What could have gone wrong in the world in 2007, 2008.

2893
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:10,540
Like those videos where they let John Lasseter

2894
01:42:10,540 --> 01:42:12,580
back on the Jungle Cruise to do one more round.

2895
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:14,940
They should let you on the Glamour Tram

2896
01:42:14,940 --> 01:42:15,780
to do one more round. I mean, I agree with that,

2897
01:42:15,780 --> 01:42:17,540
but I cut off the first part of that.

2898
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:19,380
Yeah, I'm just saying that was the best.

2899
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:20,940
I don't think we could make that comparison.

2900
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:23,100
Best comparison I could think of.

2901
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:24,580
I am in a Hawaiian shirt right now.

2902
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:25,580
You are wearing a Hawaiian shirt.

2903
01:42:25,580 --> 01:42:26,420
Maybe that's why I thought.

2904
01:42:26,420 --> 01:42:27,540
I think our Hawaiian shirts

2905
01:42:27,540 --> 01:42:29,900
different than Tiki shirts though.

2906
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:31,940
Why are you looking at me?

2907
01:42:31,940 --> 01:42:33,020
Trivia, go.

2908
01:42:33,020 --> 01:42:34,860
You're back to the front line of this podcast.

2909
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:36,820
I think yes.

2910
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:37,660
Great.

2911
01:42:37,660 --> 01:42:38,500
I have nothing to back it up on.

2912
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:43,060
Danny, you have a can of pomade in your hair right now.

2913
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:44,820
I feel like you could answer this.

2914
01:42:47,540 --> 01:42:48,900
I don't know.

2915
01:42:48,940 --> 01:42:51,300
I feel like Hawaiian shirts has exploded

2916
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:54,380
into its own thing where anything can be a Hawaiian.

2917
01:42:54,380 --> 01:42:57,260
You could have a bunch of hockey players on your shirt

2918
01:42:57,260 --> 01:42:58,100
or something like that.

2919
01:42:58,100 --> 01:42:59,780
Oh, it doesn't even have to be floral.

2920
01:42:59,780 --> 01:43:02,900
Yeah, I look around, I see Hawaiian shirts and all kinds.

2921
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:04,100
So no, I would say.

2922
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:05,420
I guess the answer is no.

2923
01:43:05,420 --> 01:43:08,340
I'm just trying to maybe distance myself from Lasseter

2924
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:09,420
with that question.

2925
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:11,060
That was why the urgency of it.

2926
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:12,340
Right, right.

2927
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:14,660
But I think we've pulled you right back in

2928
01:43:14,660 --> 01:43:17,220
in the associated issue with this question.

2929
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:20,780
His wore more novelty shirts or bowling shirt-y.

2930
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:24,460
He would have, yes, he would have like a Maeder shirt

2931
01:43:24,460 --> 01:43:26,380
and then he would have 50 different shirts

2932
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:28,380
where Maeder would have different outfits on the shirts.

2933
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:30,220
He was getting that stealth custom.

2934
01:43:30,220 --> 01:43:32,900
He still, I'm assuming he still wears those shirts.

2935
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:34,060
They weren't revoked.

2936
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:38,020
Bob Iger came to his house.

2937
01:43:38,020 --> 01:43:40,300
Turning your badge gun and shirts.

2938
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:42,020
No, it's all I have.

2939
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:42,860
Walk-in closet.

2940
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:44,860
I have 400 of them.

2941
01:43:44,860 --> 01:43:46,020
Why do you have a gun?

2942
01:43:48,140 --> 01:43:48,980
Wear a badge.

2943
01:43:48,980 --> 01:43:49,820
Oh yeah, it's Disney guns.

2944
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:51,940
All Disney cast members have a gun.

2945
01:43:51,940 --> 01:43:52,780
Oh, I didn't know that.

2946
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:53,620
Oh wow.

2947
01:43:53,620 --> 01:43:55,260
So not to the old cartoons

2948
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:57,580
where Mickey was always just pulling a gun out.

2949
01:43:57,580 --> 01:43:58,620
Which is not a joke.

2950
01:43:58,620 --> 01:44:00,780
It is, we've talked about the gun cartoons.

2951
01:44:00,780 --> 01:44:02,780
Did Mickey had a gun?

2952
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:03,620
Oh yeah.

2953
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:04,460
Yeah, as an evening.

2954
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:05,780
Keep poking around on Disney+.

2955
01:44:05,780 --> 01:44:08,860
I bet you that's all not on there, right?

2956
01:44:08,860 --> 01:44:11,180
Yeah, maybe the gun stuff has to go.

2957
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:13,300
I'm really upset that on Disney+,

2958
01:44:14,260 --> 01:44:17,900
I grew up a lot watching these like goofy training videos.

2959
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:19,260
Like goofy goes swimming.

2960
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:20,460
They're not on there, right?

2961
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:22,740
Goofy goes to the beach and swim.

2962
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:24,180
Whatever that one's called is on there.

2963
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:25,020
But the how-to are.

2964
01:44:25,020 --> 01:44:25,860
There's a few.

2965
01:44:25,860 --> 01:44:28,020
There's a few, no, no, that one is a how-to.

2966
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:32,140
But the one that I remember that's like seared in my memory

2967
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:35,460
from watching it so many times is the skiing one.

2968
01:44:35,460 --> 01:44:36,300
Yes.

2969
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:37,620
And that one's not on there.

2970
01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:38,460
There must be something in there.

2971
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:39,980
That's what I was looking for.

2972
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:41,700
There's something rights-wise

2973
01:44:41,700 --> 01:44:44,180
or is there some incredibly offensive?

2974
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:45,620
We forget that in every frame of it

2975
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:48,220
he was smoking a cigarette and shooting a gun.

2976
01:44:48,220 --> 01:44:49,060
Yeah.

2977
01:44:49,060 --> 01:44:51,180
I think they're probably doing.

2978
01:44:51,180 --> 01:44:54,540
Oh, goofy.

2979
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:55,620
Like waves.

2980
01:44:55,620 --> 01:44:56,860
He didn't know what it meant.

2981
01:44:56,860 --> 01:44:58,140
Yeah.

2982
01:44:58,140 --> 01:44:58,980
Yeah.

2983
01:44:58,980 --> 01:44:59,820
What were you saying, Jason?

2984
01:44:59,820 --> 01:45:00,660
Oh, I think waves.

2985
01:45:00,660 --> 01:45:02,340
I think they're probably doing waves of content.

2986
01:45:02,340 --> 01:45:03,180
Yes, they are.

2987
01:45:03,180 --> 01:45:06,740
As people's membership year or six months are ending,

2988
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:08,260
then we go like, and here's a bunch of stuff

2989
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:09,180
to keep you around.

2990
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:10,460
So I bet that stuff is coming.

2991
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:11,460
We got the goofy stuff.

2992
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:15,980
You could cancel or watch the seven-minute cartoon.

2993
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:21,620
I saw it turned out to be a real click-baity article.

2994
01:45:21,620 --> 01:45:24,060
I thought it was a real website, but it was not.

2995
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:28,260
But Disney has promised more adult-oriented content

2996
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:28,860
is coming.

2997
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:31,500
And I'm like, wait, how are you using that phrase?

2998
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:32,500
Because I was like, oh, are they putting

2999
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:33,660
all the touchstone stuff?

3000
01:45:33,660 --> 01:45:36,900
Or are they putting all the actual PG?

3001
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:40,500
And then it turned out to just be marketing speak.

3002
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:42,380
And it was just the head of Disney Plus going,

3003
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:45,020
we're going to keep making original, great original

3004
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:47,700
content like the Mandalorian.

3005
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:49,860
And it's like, well, that's a PG-13.

3006
01:45:49,860 --> 01:45:52,060
That's not really what I was thinking.

3007
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:53,300
So not porn.

3008
01:45:53,300 --> 01:45:54,100
Not porn.

3009
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:56,180
Not porn of the Mandalorian.

3010
01:45:56,180 --> 01:45:58,020
Not even like Splash.

3011
01:45:58,020 --> 01:46:01,580
Not even like that sort of stuff.

3012
01:46:01,580 --> 01:46:03,740
Not high-end pornography.

3013
01:46:03,740 --> 01:46:04,460
Not high-end.

3014
01:46:04,460 --> 01:46:08,460
On the same sets as the Mandalorian.

3015
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:10,340
But they can put any actor in there.

3016
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:11,660
Yeah.

3017
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:13,340
Yeah.

3018
01:46:13,340 --> 01:46:15,220
Peter Cushing.

3019
01:46:15,220 --> 01:46:16,260
Grand Waff Tarkin.

3020
01:46:19,580 --> 01:46:21,700
His estate signed off on it.

3021
01:46:21,700 --> 01:46:24,900
We have all the face scans, and we can just do it.

3022
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:26,060
Yeah.

3023
01:46:26,060 --> 01:46:29,620
All the monsters, the raiders.

3024
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:30,460
Tusken Raiders.

3025
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:31,700
Yeah.

3026
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:37,900
And it would be the third woman to appear on camera

3027
01:46:37,900 --> 01:46:40,260
on those sets.

3028
01:46:40,260 --> 01:46:42,260
A lot of dudes in that Mandalorian.

3029
01:46:42,260 --> 01:46:42,940
A lot of dudes.

3030
01:46:42,940 --> 01:46:45,340
That's the issue with making the XXX.

3031
01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:46,020
Yeah.

3032
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:47,060
There's not a lot of people.

3033
01:46:47,060 --> 01:46:48,100
It's the raiders with each other.

3034
01:46:48,100 --> 01:46:49,140
I don't see an issue at all.

3035
01:46:49,140 --> 01:46:51,860
I don't see a problem at all.

3036
01:46:51,860 --> 01:46:54,700
Zuckus and Boss going at each other.

3037
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:55,420
No problem there.

3038
01:46:55,420 --> 01:46:56,900
All Raider dogpile.

3039
01:46:56,900 --> 01:46:58,140
Yeah.

3040
01:46:58,140 --> 01:47:00,540
OK, what else about the Fun Tiki Bar?

3041
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:03,500
We should start winding it down.

3042
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:07,940
I said many closing thoughts not related to Raider dogpiles.

3043
01:47:07,940 --> 01:47:09,820
I don't know.

3044
01:47:09,820 --> 01:47:10,860
I had a lovely time.

3045
01:47:10,860 --> 01:47:11,780
It's a fun place.

3046
01:47:11,780 --> 01:47:12,300
It's great.

3047
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:12,820
Yeah.

3048
01:47:12,820 --> 01:47:15,060
Packed with details that it would take you

3049
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:15,980
dozens of visits.

3050
01:47:15,980 --> 01:47:18,500
None of this stuff that we witnessed and enjoyed

3051
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:21,100
and talked about happened on the terrace.

3052
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:21,620
No.

3053
01:47:21,620 --> 01:47:24,700
You got to go inside, wait, stalk a seat,

3054
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:28,260
do all the things you got to do to eat inside the dark

3055
01:47:28,260 --> 01:47:28,980
restaurant.

3056
01:47:28,980 --> 01:47:30,300
You got to do it.

3057
01:47:30,940 --> 01:47:32,940
I disagree with Mike Carlson.

3058
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:37,340
And this is the only thing I disagree with him about.

3059
01:47:37,340 --> 01:47:39,300
Look, if you're coming from the jungle

3060
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:41,820
and you've got some scurvy and you need to sit outside

3061
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:44,260
and get some weight and see from fruit juices,

3062
01:47:44,260 --> 01:47:46,220
you might want to sit on the terrace.

3063
01:47:46,220 --> 01:47:47,940
There's also other places to eat.

3064
01:47:47,940 --> 01:47:49,340
If you have scurvy, though.

3065
01:47:49,340 --> 01:47:51,380
If you have scurvy.

3066
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:53,940
We'll do another episode about just the terrace.

3067
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:56,500
So we'll talk about it then.

3068
01:47:56,500 --> 01:47:57,620
Just about the terrace?

3069
01:47:57,620 --> 01:47:58,140
Yeah.

3070
01:47:58,140 --> 01:47:58,780
Just about the terrace.

3071
01:47:58,780 --> 01:47:59,420
Oh my god.

3072
01:47:59,660 --> 01:48:02,340
You don't listen to this podcast enough to know we'll do it.

3073
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:02,980
No, I know.

3074
01:48:02,980 --> 01:48:04,820
I'll be forced to do it.

3075
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:06,060
Oh.

3076
01:48:06,060 --> 01:48:07,180
Oh, pity the boy.

3077
01:48:10,420 --> 01:48:11,500
That was terrifying.

3078
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:14,220
That was like you turn into a warlock for a minute.

3079
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:17,740
Well, now there are warlocks in the adventurous clan.

3080
01:48:17,740 --> 01:48:19,740
There are warlocks in sea, I bet.

3081
01:48:19,740 --> 01:48:20,740
Magic is going to come.

3082
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:22,340
He turned into Norma Desmond in my mind.

3083
01:48:22,340 --> 01:48:24,220
The next time I say, I'm not sure there's

3084
01:48:24,220 --> 01:48:26,100
enough meat on the bone for that to be an episode,

3085
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:28,900
I will just get an all caps text, pity the boy.

3086
01:48:28,900 --> 01:48:29,540
Pity the boy.

3087
01:48:29,540 --> 01:48:32,060
I'll have to sit in this place he loves so much.

3088
01:48:32,060 --> 01:48:35,700
I think pity the boy honestly might become the new who gives

3089
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:39,780
a fuck about grapefruit or the counterpoint you are wrong.

3090
01:48:39,780 --> 01:48:40,980
I think pity the boy.

3091
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:44,260
This is developing quite a cadre of terrifying phrases.

3092
01:48:44,260 --> 01:48:46,940
I think that people are going to like pity the boy.

3093
01:48:46,940 --> 01:48:48,660
Oh, pity the boy.

3094
01:48:48,660 --> 01:48:50,260
That's also what I'm going to get when I'm

3095
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:53,580
getting antsy in an episode and showing it.

3096
01:48:53,580 --> 01:48:55,300
I'll get all caps pity the boy.

3097
01:48:55,300 --> 01:48:55,900
Pity the boy.

3098
01:48:55,900 --> 01:48:56,580
Pity the boy.

3099
01:48:56,580 --> 01:48:58,660
Yes, those little notes we pass each other.

3100
01:48:58,700 --> 01:49:01,020
Who would have thought that at the end of this episode,

3101
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:03,020
another phrase would be coined.

3102
01:49:03,020 --> 01:49:04,820
I feel honored to be here for it.

3103
01:49:04,820 --> 01:49:05,340
Yes.

3104
01:49:05,340 --> 01:49:09,020
You helped create it by mentioning this terrace.

3105
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:09,540
Yes.

3106
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:10,060
It's true.

3107
01:49:10,060 --> 01:49:12,820
There will, I guess, be an episode about.

3108
01:49:12,820 --> 01:49:13,340
Yes.

3109
01:49:13,340 --> 01:49:15,500
You don't have to.

3110
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:17,980
Just because you said it out loud, do you have to?

3111
01:49:17,980 --> 01:49:18,860
I don't know.

3112
01:49:18,860 --> 01:49:20,220
It's up to them.

3113
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:22,900
It's up to Jason and I.

3114
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:23,420
I will.

3115
01:49:23,420 --> 01:49:26,780
Look, I'm not promising it in the next month.

3116
01:49:26,780 --> 01:49:29,460
We promised about 100 episodes so far.

3117
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:32,740
And there's a lot of those I'd rather do than the terrace,

3118
01:49:32,740 --> 01:49:35,260
which we've all agreed is lesser than the bar.

3119
01:49:35,260 --> 01:49:36,540
It's not as good as inside.

3120
01:49:36,540 --> 01:49:37,540
That sounds like paywall.

3121
01:49:37,540 --> 01:49:38,340
I think that's the episode.

3122
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:39,900
I think you just did the episode.

3123
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:40,260
But there's.

3124
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:40,940
End of episode.

3125
01:49:40,940 --> 01:49:41,740
There's a fire pit.

3126
01:49:41,740 --> 01:49:42,980
You just survived the terrace episode.

3127
01:49:42,980 --> 01:49:45,180
There's a fire pit you could talk about over there.

3128
01:49:45,180 --> 01:49:46,020
And there's different cups.

3129
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:48,500
They don't want you taking it out in case you go by the pool.

3130
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:50,740
And now we've survived the terrace episode.

3131
01:49:50,740 --> 01:49:53,780
I love doing the episode within the episode, guys.

3132
01:49:53,780 --> 01:49:56,620
I also think that I should sign up and try to become a performer.

3133
01:49:56,660 --> 01:49:58,940
I play acoustic guitar outside to see what that's like,

3134
01:49:58,940 --> 01:50:00,340
to really enjoy that experience.

3135
01:50:00,340 --> 01:50:01,260
I mean, I agree with that.

3136
01:50:01,260 --> 01:50:03,860
So if I perform there, too, let's try that.

3137
01:50:03,860 --> 01:50:06,300
That would want a terrace episode for sure.

3138
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:06,820
I guess.

3139
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:07,660
I actually.

3140
01:50:07,660 --> 01:50:08,180
All right.

3141
01:50:08,180 --> 01:50:09,420
I'm not too interested in you.

3142
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:10,380
I'm not too interested.

3143
01:50:10,380 --> 01:50:11,300
Performer permits.

3144
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:12,340
Pity the boy.

3145
01:50:12,340 --> 01:50:12,860
Pity the boy.

3146
01:50:12,860 --> 01:50:16,300
Pity the boy who must play for the people who enjoy his tunes.

3147
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:17,980
Screw this up.

3148
01:50:17,980 --> 01:50:20,220
I worked myself into a shoot, as they say in wrestling.

3149
01:50:20,220 --> 01:50:20,740
Mm hmm.

3150
01:50:20,740 --> 01:50:21,260
Mm hmm.

3151
01:50:21,260 --> 01:50:21,780
Mm hmm.

3152
01:50:21,780 --> 01:50:22,300
Mm hmm.

3153
01:50:22,300 --> 01:50:22,820
Mm hmm.

3154
01:50:22,820 --> 01:50:23,340
Mm hmm.

3155
01:50:23,340 --> 01:50:25,380
Damn it.

3156
01:50:25,380 --> 01:50:29,220
Well, I guess in that case, we'll

3157
01:50:29,220 --> 01:50:31,340
start researching the terrace episode.

3158
01:50:31,340 --> 01:50:33,060
Danny Jelinek, you survived podcast.

3159
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:33,620
Oh, wow.

3160
01:50:33,620 --> 01:50:34,820
Thanks for having me, guys.

3161
01:50:34,820 --> 01:50:35,060
Yeah.

3162
01:50:35,060 --> 01:50:35,820
Hey.

3163
01:50:35,820 --> 01:50:36,500
Thanks for having me.

3164
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:38,380
Hey.

3165
01:50:38,380 --> 01:50:42,420
No pity for the guest, because I think you had a blast.

3166
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:43,660
I'm still smiling.

3167
01:50:43,660 --> 01:50:44,420
I'm still.

3168
01:50:44,420 --> 01:50:46,340
I mean, I didn't fall out of my seat.

3169
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:48,700
You didn't, despite there being no seatbelt.

3170
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:51,100
Despite no seatbelt, we talked about it all.

3171
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:54,860
And listener, it was great talking with you.

3172
01:50:54,860 --> 01:50:58,660
And what you got to say back to me?

3173
01:50:58,660 --> 01:50:59,500
Oh, that's a shame.

3174
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:00,460
Oh, that's harsh.

3175
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:01,580
Sorry to hear that.

3176
01:51:01,580 --> 01:51:02,380
Well, I tried.

3177
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:04,460
I'm not really great at being on podcasts.

3178
01:51:04,460 --> 01:51:06,860
So listener, I'm sorry you felt that way.

3179
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:10,260
But just know I'm going to stop this bit now.

3180
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:13,540
If you're man at the bit, it's over.

3181
01:51:13,540 --> 01:51:16,500
You never have to hear it again.

3182
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:17,220
Danny, you're great.

3183
01:51:17,220 --> 01:51:18,820
Hey, you were great on the podcast.

3184
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:20,180
And you're great at many things.

3185
01:51:20,180 --> 01:51:22,580
And working people could see you be great.

3186
01:51:22,580 --> 01:51:23,980
Let's exit through the gift shop.

3187
01:51:23,980 --> 01:51:24,740
That's what I say.

3188
01:51:25,340 --> 01:51:26,860
What would you like to plug?

3189
01:51:26,860 --> 01:51:27,580
Oh my.

3190
01:51:27,580 --> 01:51:29,940
I've recently started tweeting again.

3191
01:51:29,940 --> 01:51:30,500
I know.

3192
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:31,900
I've been enjoying that.

3193
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:34,300
But then I also have stopped tweeting again.

3194
01:51:34,300 --> 01:51:36,100
But if you want to read some of my old tweets,

3195
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:36,700
they're still there.

3196
01:51:36,700 --> 01:51:39,140
If you want to see a burst from around October, November.

3197
01:51:39,140 --> 01:51:41,460
List generator on Twitter.

3198
01:51:41,460 --> 01:51:42,420
Yeah, list generator.

3199
01:51:42,420 --> 01:51:44,140
Just spelled just how it sounds.

3200
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:46,660
And you're doing stuff on that Kimmel show.

3201
01:51:46,660 --> 01:51:47,140
Yeah.

3202
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:48,260
Oh, I have a zoom.

3203
01:51:48,260 --> 01:51:51,140
Are you now worried that you are an ABC employee?

3204
01:51:51,140 --> 01:51:53,700
Are you now worried at all that this is fire?

3205
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:56,980
I think I spoke very highly of Disney and all their property.

3206
01:51:56,980 --> 01:51:59,060
I just, hey, Disney, if you're out there listening,

3207
01:51:59,060 --> 01:52:04,420
put Goofy go skiing up sooner than later.

3208
01:52:04,420 --> 01:52:05,300
We'd all appreciate it.

3209
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:08,140
That's my only critique of the Disney corporation.

3210
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:10,420
When are they putting up Jimmy Kimmel live?

3211
01:52:10,420 --> 01:52:12,180
Oh, that'd be good too.

3212
01:52:12,180 --> 01:52:14,420
Well, it's part of the Hulu package.

3213
01:52:14,420 --> 01:52:14,940
No, no, no.

3214
01:52:14,940 --> 01:52:15,940
I want the archive.

3215
01:52:15,940 --> 01:52:17,500
I want all 15,000 episodes.

3216
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:18,180
They're on there.

3217
01:52:18,180 --> 01:52:18,900
They're on Hulu.

3218
01:52:18,900 --> 01:52:19,460
Are they all?

3219
01:52:19,460 --> 01:52:20,860
I think a lot of them, yeah.

3220
01:52:20,860 --> 01:52:21,620
There's no way.

3221
01:52:21,620 --> 01:52:23,220
It's like every episode.

3222
01:52:23,220 --> 01:52:24,540
You can watch a ton.

3223
01:52:24,540 --> 01:52:25,860
I think you can actually.

3224
01:52:25,860 --> 01:52:27,780
You might be able to watch all of them.

3225
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:29,340
You may be able to watch at least.

3226
01:52:29,340 --> 01:52:30,100
Start at one.

3227
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:31,260
You got to start at one.

3228
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:32,300
You got to start at one.

3229
01:52:32,300 --> 01:52:34,100
Making him alive is not going to make sense

3230
01:52:34,100 --> 01:52:35,740
unless you start at one.

3231
01:52:35,740 --> 01:52:37,220
You can't just jump in now.

3232
01:52:37,220 --> 01:52:39,180
Yeah.

3233
01:52:39,180 --> 01:52:43,580
The other thing I will actually plug as well is I

3234
01:52:43,580 --> 01:52:46,180
have a zine called Dipped.

3235
01:52:46,180 --> 01:52:47,340
Oh, yeah.

3236
01:52:47,340 --> 01:52:49,060
That you can get.

3237
01:52:49,060 --> 01:52:51,420
Dipped is delightful.

3238
01:52:51,420 --> 01:52:55,340
You can email me at dippedzine at gmail.com.

3239
01:52:55,340 --> 01:52:56,820
Me and Dan Abramson make that.

3240
01:52:56,820 --> 01:52:59,060
It's a zine that we make that we actually

3241
01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:01,660
dip into coffee, the first issue.

3242
01:53:01,660 --> 01:53:04,220
We're currently hard at work on the second issue.

3243
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:07,060
And it's going to be dipped into something else this time.

3244
01:53:07,060 --> 01:53:08,220
Yeah, probably.

3245
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:11,660
I don't want to spoil anything, but we're talking about wine.

3246
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:13,140
Oh, interesting.

3247
01:53:13,140 --> 01:53:18,820
I think at some point, glue would be fun to make it.

3248
01:53:18,820 --> 01:53:19,660
It might be.

3249
01:53:19,660 --> 01:53:21,140
Guys, I didn't really come here to talk.

3250
01:53:21,180 --> 01:53:25,300
Is that something you would have to investigate?

3251
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:26,620
Oh, I would test it.

3252
01:53:26,620 --> 01:53:27,260
OK.

3253
01:53:27,260 --> 01:53:30,900
But yeah, we just dip the bottom corner in each.

3254
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:33,260
Sorry, I didn't plan on talking about Dipped.

3255
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:34,020
No, we're talking about Dipped.

3256
01:53:34,020 --> 01:53:36,500
I don't even know if we have any more to sell.

3257
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:38,180
But I think we have some left.

3258
01:53:38,180 --> 01:53:40,740
If you email us, it's like $7.

3259
01:53:40,740 --> 01:53:44,140
I think someone who's been on this podcast

3260
01:53:44,140 --> 01:53:45,980
must have written for Dipped.

3261
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:46,980
Oh, yeah.

3262
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:48,220
I'll do it in the future.

3263
01:53:48,220 --> 01:53:49,540
I don't think we're done with it.

3264
01:53:49,540 --> 01:53:50,900
If you still want to.

3265
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:51,540
Oh, really?

3266
01:53:51,540 --> 01:53:52,740
I'm asking you on the air.

3267
01:53:52,740 --> 01:53:54,340
I'm asking all of you on the air if you

3268
01:53:54,340 --> 01:53:55,700
would like to submit to Dipped.

3269
01:53:55,700 --> 01:53:56,220
Sure.

3270
01:53:56,220 --> 01:53:58,060
Because I think you're all very talented.

3271
01:53:58,060 --> 01:53:59,740
I would like to buy it as well.

3272
01:53:59,740 --> 01:54:00,900
Oh, the audience is not invited?

3273
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:01,420
OK.

3274
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:04,300
Well, that's a lot.

3275
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:05,620
They are strangers to you.

3276
01:54:05,620 --> 01:54:07,060
Fair enough.

3277
01:54:07,060 --> 01:54:09,740
We went off on a very bad note, and that's their fault.

3278
01:54:10,580 --> 01:54:12,420
And that is on you.

3279
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:15,700
If you had said something nice to me in your car

3280
01:54:15,700 --> 01:54:20,620
and I had responded to the blank space positively, then yes,

3281
01:54:20,620 --> 01:54:22,420
you would have all been in Dipped.

3282
01:54:22,420 --> 01:54:22,940
Wow.

3283
01:54:22,940 --> 01:54:24,700
I'm going to stop talking about Dipped.

3284
01:54:24,700 --> 01:54:27,060
Anyways, I do think there's good.

3285
01:54:27,060 --> 01:54:28,060
You should check that out.

3286
01:54:28,060 --> 01:54:28,780
You would like it.

3287
01:54:28,780 --> 01:54:29,300
Audience.

3288
01:54:29,300 --> 01:54:29,900
Yeah.

3289
01:54:29,900 --> 01:54:30,900
Great.

3290
01:54:30,900 --> 01:54:32,900
I'll do something for it in the future.

3291
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:34,900
Yeah, and for more Podcast the Ride,

the second gate at patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

3297
01:54:48,580 --> 01:54:52,620
And I guess we will then say the Kongaloosh doesn't apply,

3298
01:54:52,620 --> 01:54:54,420
does it, as a goodbye?

3299
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:55,180
I don't think it does.

3300
01:54:55,180 --> 01:54:56,500
No, isn't that a little low?

3301
01:54:56,500 --> 01:54:58,780
It's kind of a toast sort of thing.

3302
01:54:58,780 --> 01:54:59,420
You can get it.

3303
01:54:59,420 --> 01:55:00,620
No, if it's a toast, then.

3304
01:55:00,620 --> 01:55:01,740
You can get it.

3305
01:55:01,740 --> 01:55:03,060
Oh, man.

3306
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:05,980
You can order Kongaloosh's old style and new style

3307
01:55:05,980 --> 01:55:06,740
at Trader Sam's.

3308
01:55:06,740 --> 01:55:07,620
Oh, oh.

3309
01:55:07,620 --> 01:55:08,580
It's not on the menu.

3310
01:55:08,580 --> 01:55:09,700
That's the secret.

3311
01:55:09,700 --> 01:55:11,020
Oh, that's fun.

3312
01:55:11,020 --> 01:55:12,620
So we should say it.

3313
01:55:12,620 --> 01:55:13,260
Yeah.

3314
01:55:13,260 --> 01:55:13,780
All right.

3315
01:55:13,780 --> 01:55:17,540
So then a hearty Kongaloosh.

3316
01:55:17,540 --> 01:55:18,860
Goodbye.

3317
01:55:18,860 --> 01:55:21,340
Forever.

3318
01:55:21,340 --> 01:55:22,340
Dog.
