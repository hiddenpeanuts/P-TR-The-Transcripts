1
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,980
Club Three.

2
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,980
Masked Magician, what's going on with Masked Magician here in the studio?

3
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,180
As we start Club Three anew in 2024, it's wild.

4
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,260
This has been, this was a very curious poll, I feel like.

5
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,860
Never a bride, always a bridesmaid?

6
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,260
What's the phrase I'm looking for?

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,140
Or like all that?

8
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,200
Always a bridesmaid, never a bride.

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,540
Oh, I flipped it, okay.

10
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,500
Never a, ah, I'm so sick of always being a bride.

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,220
I'm so sick of all-

12
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,520
I don't remember if that's what you said.

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,900
Always being, always an assistant to Never the Magician?

14
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,700
Is that a version of it?

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,020
Does that work one-to-one?

16
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,020
Is that translated?

17
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,240
It's pretty relatable.

18
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:02,700
Close.

19
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,880
Well, it's relatable for sure.

20
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,280
I'm just trying to make sure that-

21
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,340
How many people have been in that scenario?

22
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,540
I'm just updating that for a magician.

23
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:08,700
Yeah, yeah.

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,760
What I was thinking, I mean, I had a metaphor in my head,

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,800
which is like there's been a number, at this, but look, here's what happened.

26
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:25,040
Today's topic, ironically, considering what it is, I think was kind of a populist uprising

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,680
against what was like-

28
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,000
which has now been in three polls, and it has not won any of them,

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,060
but it keeps coming in runner-up.

30
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,620
You know what this is reminding me of?

31
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:44,180
Like all these election runner-ups, I think this is kind of a Beto O'Rourke situation.

32
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,120
Doesn't quite have the juice.

33
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,340
Somehow, with apologies, I forget who suggested Masked Magician.

34
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,300
Yeah, it's a Beto, it's number two.

35
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,500
I'm trying to think who else is number two a lot.

36
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,880
Hillary, maybe?

37
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,740
I think people like me might also just be terrified in the Magician's Code of Silence.

38
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,880
Oh, maybe so.

39
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,780
Oh, that's what you're thinking.

40
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:09,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,080
We could all have held, people are trying to protect us, maybe.

42
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,340
They're pulling it back so that we don't get a swarm of angry magicians when we leave

43
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,320
Forever Dog Studios from the-

44
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,200
Yeah, Secret Society of Assassins coming for us.

45
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,560
And there's things coming at you, and you're like,

46
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,820
I don't know how these work, I can't swat them away!

47
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,580
There's a magic floating spinning card.

48
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,640
There's pigeons everywhere.

49
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm getting pecked by pigeons.

50
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,380
Rabbits keep popping out of places that I don't expect, and they're nibbling my face

51
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,800
until it's bloody raw.

52
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,100
I feel bad, though, for the Masked Magician.

53
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,840
Yeah, I know.

54
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,380
Which, again, because I think it's a good topic, I think, but I also don't want to like-

55
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,160
I also, to go back to the br- I'm not married to it.

56
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,900
There could be another great topic, and that's what we need from you Club 3 listeners now,

57
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,180
just four more topics, regular topics, as-

58
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,840
We need four more topics as Masked Magician enters the fourth poll that it's been in,

59
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,040
and it will stay.

60
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,920
We don't have rules for this so far.

61
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,100
We don't have a limit.

62
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,620
It could be number two all year, potentially.

63
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,000
Should we amend the Club 3 constitution here?

64
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,260
Should we, should it be allowed to do this?

65
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,060
Because obviously we're still pretty new with Club 3,

66
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,900
we've said if we all agree-

67
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,340
Yeah, you're right.

68
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,380
Or do we say two-thirds?

69
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,580
I forget what I stated a couple months ago.

70
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,400
Was it two-thirds, or should we all have to have unanimous agreement when we change the

71
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:31,740
charter?

72
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,360
Or change the constitution of Club 3?

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,700
I mean, I could just punt it to my birthday pic.

74
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,940
That's thinking something an awfully long time.

75
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,560
Calling your birthday shot now.

76
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,460
That's how much you care about Masked Magician.

77
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,400
It's going to be your-

78
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:48,940
Well, it just fascinated me.

79
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,620
What's in your soul for your birthday?

80
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,440
I mean, I was one, stumping were kind of hard, but you know.

81
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,080
Yeah, well you could do that right now.

82
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,600
I could, you know.

83
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,860
Are you going to?

84
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,120
Well, no.

85
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,360
I feel like that would be against the Magician's candle.

86
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,720
I'm not in a canvas for the guy.

87
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,000
I hope he wins, but I don't know.

88
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,540
Well, I don't know.

89
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,880
I think at least for now, I think four is not crazy.

90
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,740
You're right, you're right.

91
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,880
But maybe around the fifth time, maybe we got to talk about this.

92
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,480
I don't know.

93
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,960
So listeners, it's up to you.

94
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,100
The Masked Magician's fate is in your hands and we need four more topics.

95
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,160
Or do we just, now there's kind of a challenge in like, you know,

96
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,360
like level flying of like an airplane.

97
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,520
Can we just keep it number two for a year and then it doesn't ever get it?

98
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,880
Oh yeah, perhaps.

99
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,560
That's yeah.

100
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,800
Do you want to use your votes just to keep a topic level?

101
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,540
That's funny, I guess.

102
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,480
It's funny for a couple thousand people.

103
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,080
And actually maybe just a percentage of a couple thousand.

104
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,980
A couple hundred.

105
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

106
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,280
Couple hundred, you know.

107
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,040
All right, those numbers are dwindling.

108
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,520
But anyway, none of that to distract from what came out of nowhere,

109
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,540
something that like I guess was lodged way, way back in my memory.

110
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:09,440
But I can't say that I was super familiar with the phrase that became the title of the episode.

111
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,700
This is from Bstands94.

112
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,600
Oh, and just a side note before I read what it is,

113
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,800
because this is a something that doesn't happen a lot in Club 3,

114
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,700
which is a Disney theme park oriented topic.

115
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,940
This is the first Disney theme park oriented topic since May,

116
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,940
which was Disneyland smoking areas.

117
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,560
Oh yeah.

118
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,280
Oh yeah.

119
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,940
Already when it gets picked, and you know what?

120
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,520
I know there's those times where like the boys need to go back to basics.

121
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,140
Yeah, yeah.

122
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,420
All right, well in Club 3, the audience picks,

123
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,540
and the audience does not pick Disney theme park stuff.

124
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,340
That's a very good point.

125
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:46,600
Very often.

126
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,800
Universal actually maybe more so, I would say.

127
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,580
Yeah, very good.

128
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,560
A very good point.

129
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,420
I can I say, well, this is a non- I shouldn't say this is a derail,

130
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,880
but did you see the thing that Universal is maybe going to do a cruise line?

131
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh yeah.

132
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,260
Yeah, I saw that kind of a rumor.

133
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,640
I'm just saying, I don't know, we got there first.

134
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:08,200
We've also, yes, but I've also heard that I've seen the chatter that the source on that is not.

135
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,520
Oh, I know what you're talking about.

136
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:09,900
Yeah.

137
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

138
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,780
But then some I've seen other people sort of try to defend this source you're talking about.

139
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,120
Okay.

140
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,100
I don't know.

141
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,520
I don't know.

142
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,220
See what happens.

143
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,800
Well, they certainly are, Universal is branching out in all these interesting regional directions.

144
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,260
And international, Britain.

145
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,260
Yep.

146
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,560
There's a lot to talk about there.

147
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,740
South Korea potentially.

148
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,740
Space I heard, Mars is coming, Universal Mars.

149
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,540
Yeah, and the negatives.

150
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,600
How do you do that logo where it's the Earth, but how do you put that on Mars?

151
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,980
Do you just like tint it red?

152
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,220
Just tint it red, I think.

153
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:38,680
Yeah, sure.

154
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,680
That's a start.

155
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,080
Well, they can steal that idea, like they stole our Universal cruise line idea.

156
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,120
Motherfuckers.

157
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,100
We're on to you.

158
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,920
Anyway, what we are doing here, this is from Bstands 94.

159
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,620
The actual in-person protests that took place at the Magic Kingdom

160
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,920
trying to stop the closing of Mr.

161
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,280
Toad.

162
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,060
I believe they called them Toad-ins.

163
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,320
Confirmed.

164
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:10,120
Seems weird how Disney just let this happen, including them having tell Pooh to go to hell,

165
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,240
paraphernalia.

166
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,720
And that took it.

167
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,580
This became a movement, and I got pretty into it.

168
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,000
I had to wrap my head around it.

169
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,880
This is, I think, an interesting case of sometimes we get presented with a paragraph

170
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,600
that explains what the topic is.

171
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:32,260
Then you try to condense that into a poll, into a couple words, and it doesn't really sell.

172
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,320
I think people were kind of hypnotized by this, and here we are talking about it now.

173
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,360
Like Toad and that poster, the famous scene.

174
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,080
They were hypnotized.

175
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,100
The phrase Toad-in is funny also.

176
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,480
That really helped it.

177
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,520
I think Toad-in is such a funny thing.

178
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,080
I really just kind of had to repeat it a couple times to make sense to me.

179
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,040
Well, I knew about it beforehand.

180
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,580
Did you guys know much about it?

181
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:54,880
I knew-

182
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,480
Maybe a little bit.

183
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,240
A little bit.

184
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,800
I don't want to take more credit than barely.

185
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,680
I knew about it as like fan outrage in the early days of the consumer internet

186
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,800
and like early like geocities and newsgroups.

187
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,240
Sure.

188
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:15,560
Organizing these 20 to 50 people going to ride the ride.

189
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,280
Some of them in t-shirts.

190
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,340
Some were coordinated.

191
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,660
Some t-shirts were there.

192
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,980
It seems like it feels very, because what we're talking about happened.

193
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,300
Oh, wait, why don't I have the year now?

194
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,120
97 and 98.

195
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:30,520
Yes.

196
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,180
Which does, that feels like an internet era that was kind of fun to flash back to.

197
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,980
I have just inherent funness for the word geocities.

198
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,080
I don't know.

199
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,640
Oh, yeah, yeah.

200
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,880
Just kind of, I don't know.

201
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,600
It just kind of like makes me imagine.

202
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,600
I just, I want to go to the geocity.

203
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,460
Yeah, I agree with that.

204
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,560
It's a blocky limited graphic city that has a counter of how many people have been to the city.

205
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,800
I'd like to be there.

206
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,020
Also, the excitement of the internet at the time,

207
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,360
I think is part of it when I like all that old internet shit.

208
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,720
The internet was the coolest thing I had ever heard of.

209
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,140
And I would go on and just waste hours every day going home.

210
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,180
It gave me something to do during the middle school lunch break.

211
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,560
It was not so evident that I didn't have a ton of friends.

212
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,020
Sure.

213
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,140
To go to that computer lab that they opened up.

214
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,380
Mr.

215
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,740
Bursler opened it up so I could go and go to Disneyland websites and then also learn about

216
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,040
the death of Phil Hartman and then have to go to class immediately.

217
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,260
That is a dark memory.

218
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,120
That's how you learned.

219
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:35,560
Yeah.

220
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,080
And then like, ding, all right, go to social studies.

221
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,560
And then the whole class, I'm just in a daze.

222
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,620
What do you mean?

223
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:43,560
Oh, wow.

224
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,160
Barely caught the words murder, suicide.

225
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,020
That's what, seventh grade for you?

226
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,320
Um, I don't remember.

227
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,800
That was probably in the same time.

228
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,620
Middle school.

229
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,680
That was May 98, I believe.

230
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,640
Did you do middle school six, seven, eight or seven and eight?

231
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,060
Or seven, eight, nine?

232
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,300
Some people, it's all over the place.

233
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,340
I did seven, eight.

234
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,140
It was a six, seven, eight.

235
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,220
You did a six, seven, eight.

236
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,900
Five, six, seven, eight.

237
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,260
What?

238
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,300
That's a lot of middle school.

239
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:08,880
They do those?

240
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:09,680
That's wild.

241
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,280
I only did two.

242
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,500
I did seven, eight.

243
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:11,920
Wow.

244
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,840
That's my middle school.

245
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,360
But I remember, hey, I remember when Phil Hartman died.

246
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,120
My mom told me in the car after picking me up from junior high.

247
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,020
Oh my God.

248
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,880
And she said, did you hear about Phil Hartman?

249
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,280
And I said, no, is he dead?

250
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,440
I didn't say it like that.

251
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,200
And I go, no, I probably was like, no, is he dead?

252
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:26,840
No.

253
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,580
How did you know?

254
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,800
I just, did Fardly die a couple months before?

255
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,280
How soon?

256
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,440
Yeah, like five months before.

257
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,400
I think that's why.

258
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,440
I didn't know that was possible.

259
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,180
So then it made anything.

260
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,100
So I think that's why, yeah.

261
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:40,780
I thought that.

262
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Next you're going to tell me Mr.

263
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,400
Bean was assassinated.

264
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,800
Comedy, guys.

265
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,600
I was really freaked out because Fardly died.

266
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,560
And then that Lewis and Clark movie came out.

267
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,500
And I'm like, how?

268
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,660
He is dead.

269
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,340
Oh, you didn't understand?

270
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,060
I didn't understand.

271
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,180
I just shot live.

272
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,540
It just freaked me out.

273
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,720
I do remember that, the posthumous release.

274
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
He's back from the dead.

275
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,240
It's a zombie performance.

276
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,060
The audiences will not accept a zombie historical comedy.

277
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,320
That's too many things.

278
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,020
That's why they didn't like that movie.

279
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,920
Yeah, I know, if he'd been alive when it came out, the mega hit.

280
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:24,440
Well, things from the same dark pre-internet, not pre-internet, early internet time.

281
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,960
But yeah, I don't know.

282
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,780
That's the thing I like about all this is looking at rudimentary websites.

283
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,120
But before it, let's kind of weave the story here.

284
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,500
Because what we've been backed into, what we've been voted into here,

285
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:44,320
is for the first time at any length, talking about Mr.

286
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,540
Toad's wild ride.

287
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,520
Sometimes you forget what we haven't done and big ones we haven't done.

288
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:50,880
Mr.

289
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,060
Toad's wild ride is as big as it gets.

290
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:53,540
Yeah.

291
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,720
Haven't done it.

292
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,340
We're not going to do it now.

293
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,000
But this is, I thank you for taking Toad ins off the plate.

294
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,920
That's a little chunk that now we don't have to do whenever we do Mr.

295
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,600
Toad.

296
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,320
But anyway, basics, Mr.

297
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,160
Toad's wild ride, opening day Disneyland attraction,

298
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,860
based on 1949's The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr.

299
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,200
Toad.

300
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,020
Well, it's based on half of it.

301
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,000
An out of the gate, beloved attraction, I think.

302
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,680
So I thought this thing throws it all into disarray.

303
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,940
You think Mr.

304
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,660
Toad is universally beloved, and then what Disney does here.

305
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,820
Yeah, you got Untouchable, it felt at the time.

306
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,680
So you would think.

307
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,940
Another opening day in Disney World as well.

308
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,000
And yes, this is also a funny thing because I'm sure we'll talk about it whenever in 2030,

309
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,940
when we do Toad.

310
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,280
But I was like, I haven't really watched, I've been on Mr.

311
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,940
Toad in Disney World,

312
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,900
but I haven't watched a video of it in many years, if ever maybe.

313
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,400
Yeah.

314
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,020
I was like, it's different.

315
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,280
It's two tracks.

316
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,980
Yes, they upped the game.

317
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,400
Yeah.

318
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,260
That's really, I think, that's all in terms of history, I wanted to say,

319
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:10,440
is that the first one, Modest Fun, the weirdest thing an original did,

320
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,060
the weirdest thing in Disneyland now, maybe.

321
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:12,560
Yes.

322
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:19,340
Then 71, Magic Kingdom, we aren't just going to do it,

323
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,640
we're going to blow it up, two different experiences,

324
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,980
left track, right track, different things, they weave in and out of each other.

325
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,220
Yeah.

326
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,440
And kind of like here, now we're in the town square,

327
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,900
and now the cars, if you're timing it right, can narrowly avoid each other.

328
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:40,460
So now you've got, for a dark ride, I think, the first real equivalent of like big set piece,

329
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:49,460
the Tomb of Mara, like big room where a tongue's going on, they're able to open that up.

330
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,020
Yeah.

331
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,380
And I just, all of this, I forgot.

332
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,740
I forgot that this looked like this, that there's two tracks that load,

333
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,700
that it would load separately on different tracks.

334
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:03,060
So I was just imagining, okay, people are now protesting, essentially, the biggest,

335
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:08,360
the big toad, not the tiny toad, which is what we have, we still have it.

336
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:08,620
Yeah.

337
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,780
Which, thank goodness, I feel like it's untouchable, I think, at this point.

338
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,200
I think in Disneyland, I was very interested

339
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,720
in seeing no mention of the Disneyland Mr.

340
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,500
Toad in a lot of, because the website,

341
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,200
Savetode.

342
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,260
com, is still live.

343
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,660
You can still find a lot of first-hand recounting of these toad ends.

344
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,440
Oh, yeah.

345
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,360
Which, for some reason, my browser was telling me it was being

346
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,000
hosted on the University of Miami's math department website.

347
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,060
It is absolutely still.

348
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,920
That's right.

349
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,220
Raises more questions than answers.

350
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,040
www.

351
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,900
math.

352
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,780
miami.

353
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:57,180
edu slash jam, toad, toadin.

354
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,260
html.

355
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,260
Do you have one of those squiggles?

356
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,840
Oh, there's a squiggle, yeah, I miss the squiggle.

357
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,100
Yeah, that's some early internet stuff.

358
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,160
I miss them, I like the squiggle dash.

359
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,340
com, but then it would reroute you.

360
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:12,680
Right.

361
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:12,900
Yeah.

362
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:18,020
Okay, so, but then you're technically looking at this kind of mealy-mouthed URL,

363
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,440
but you're saying Mr.

364
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,280
Toad, Anaheim, not anybody's concern, doesn't matter.

365
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,420
Doesn't seem to be.

366
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,640
Yeah, they were worried about it.

367
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:29,480
Yeah, there's, I was watching like a Yesterland video or something, and

368
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:35,140
they're like, they were trying to make the point that like, you know, Toad is the only

369
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,880
dark ride that hasn't really gotten a fancy new digital upgrade, so hey, hopefully it's safe,

370
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,780
but they haven't put anything new on it in a while.

371
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,820
Oh, that's like a, that makes you fear that they aren't like doubling debt,

372
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,580
they aren't bringing it into the 21st century.

373
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,980
Yeah, but you could argue, oh, maybe that's, they're like, let's keep this one,

374
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
because it's got more flats, which we've talked about, sort of versus like 3D environments.

375
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:57,600
Okay, yeah.

376
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,960
So maybe you could argue, oh, they're keeping it pure, but I don't know.

377
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,100
So that was the only sort of shred of doubt I even found when I was looking through anything

378
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,940
about Disneyland's Toad ever being in danger.

379
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I don't think, by the way, Disney's not building anything for a decade, so it's fine.

380
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:11,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

381
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,160
Don't worry about it.

382
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,060
I don't think they can even deconstruct it.

383
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,440
Yeah, there's no way, there's almost no way.

384
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,940
Unless it just was lit on fire and then they wouldn't put anything there.

385
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,340
Yes.

386
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,080
They'd put up a wall.

387
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:26,080
When Apple buys Disney though, then they will got Toad within six weeks, I think.

388
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,300
And it'll be a ride through the, yeah, you're going through the circuitry,

389
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,240
seeing what it's like for little zaps to move through an iPad.

390
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:41,440
Oh boy, you get to ride through like an iPod commercial from like the early 2000s.

391
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,480
Yeah, the E2, the pastel, the like people in Silhouette.

392
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,660
Or like Jet, are you going to be my girl?

393
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,620
It's like blaring over the Mr.

394
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,320
Toad track.

395
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,780
Might be good, actually, you know?

396
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,900
Being in the, yeah.

397
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:54,680
You know what?

398
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,780
Actually, if you do the math, those commercials are as long ago now as Mr.

399
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,060
Toad's time was in 1955.

400
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,120
It's exact.

401
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,160
I don't know what year Mr.

402
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,420
Toad's time, but I don't know.

403
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,320
Do you think we could contact the math department of Miami to double check that math?

404
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,780
To make sure you're correct?

405
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,760
I think it's sound math.

406
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,560
I don't think anybody, we don't need to get the university of Miami involved now.

407
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:24,960
We could call the phone numbers for the like half dozen Disney employees that they list contact info.

408
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,980
Yeah, yeah, that's a whole.

409
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:31,840
Some of whom have passed at this point because like here's how to call Marty Sklar.

410
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,640
And I'm like, oh, that's not accurate anymore.

411
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,580
They just leave the number open.

412
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,980
We shouldn't call it at the end of this episode.

413
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,200
Oh yeah, you want to see what happens to one?

414
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,360
Yeah, that's not a bad idea.

415
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,260
But yeah, I mean, point is they, it seems untouchable.

416
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,160
It's a particularly good one.

417
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,860
I think Raleigh Crump involved in this one, maybe more so than the first.

418
00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:01,000
But you wonder like, okay, Anaheim one, but it's Mr.

419
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,700
Toad crazy inherently.

420
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,920
Of course you die and go to hell.

421
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,400
So it's already got that.

422
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:20,780
But this one in and of itself, I feel like has some weirdness separate for that.

423
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,480
Wasn't in the Anaheim one mainly that.

424
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,400
Okay.

425
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,380
Well, there's like guns in it.

426
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,360
There's a police weasel shootout.

427
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,500
So you got that.

428
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,380
And then you go to the, at some point you are in a tavern gasp.

429
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,560
A place where alcohol is consumed, where adult libations are consumed.

430
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,260
And in that there's like a sexy naked lady.

431
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,160
I know what you're talking about.

432
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,520
There's a naked lady in there.

433
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,140
Oh my God.

434
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:47,680
That is.

435
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,360
Oh, the naked lady.

436
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:53,700
Yeah, cause the spinning beer glasses are in Anaheim in the bar.

437
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,360
Oh, you're right.

438
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:54,940
You got a bar.

439
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:55,240
Yeah.

440
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
But there's no naked lady in Anaheim.

441
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,660
I don't believe so.

442
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,000
Which is good.

443
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:00,600
Yes.

444
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,420
None of that.

445
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,920
None of that filth.

446
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,000
Somehow it avoided the clutches of the nearby Hollywood weirdos.

447
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,740
But this, I don't, I did not know this was here.

448
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,680
Yeah, I did not know that was there.

449
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,820
This is an attractive lady.

450
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,920
This is an attractive drawing, I'm going to say.

451
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,760
She looks like, oh, what's the character from Hercules?

452
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,080
Oh, Meg.

453
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:22,780
Meg.

454
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,500
Yes.

455
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,420
Yeah, kind of, yeah, yeah, similar kind of like exaggerated angular proportions.

456
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,580
But I wonder if between all of these things, they're like, we went a little too hard here.

457
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,340
We got a little too 70s, a little too kooky.

458
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:46,080
Do we need to get, was this always like the unwanted stepchild somehow of, in Magic Kingdom?

459
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,900
It's a good question.

460
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,840
Because yeah, they cited a couple of things, I think, like what, like

461
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,920
how many people could get through the ride capacity.

462
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,080
People complaining that their kids were scared.

463
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,680
Which I believe I was scared on this ride the first time I ever went on it,

464
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:07,220
but I was scared on every dark ride in Fantasyland except for Peter Pan.

465
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,560
Yeah, this is insane to lodge a complaint about.

466
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:09,980
Right.

467
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,560
I was freaked out on Snow White, I was freaked out on Toad.

468
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,240
I was scared of a bathroom where one of the lights was out.

469
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:16,800
Yeah.

470
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,920
Where only one fluorescent tube was working.

471
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:19,440
Sure.

472
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,000
Yeah, I didn't like open my eyes and see the naked lady and go, no, I didn't.

473
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,220
I liked Toad because it was crazy.

474
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,260
Well, sure.

475
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:31,120
I'm sure they showed it on early Disney Channel, which I like the animation of,

476
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,320
but mostly my memory of the Wind in the Willows, Disney,

477
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:42,440
is the opening credits with a very sad voice going, the wind in the willows.

478
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,820
And I, I don't, I haven't rewatched that.

479
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,220
I'm just like, that's just forever glued to my mind.

480
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,700
The opening credits song.

481
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,280
The sad voice?

482
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,060
Somebody's dying wish to get to do that song.

483
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:54,760
We watched.

484
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:00,060
It's also very possible that was a dollar store knockoff of Wind in the Willows that I am

485
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,380
And it wasn't the live action one.

486
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,160
Yeah.

487
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,760
I don't know if it's time to say this, but you bring this up and on the website,

488
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,180
I don't know, did you see this on the website?

489
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,660
How much did you scock home this website?

490
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,020
I combed the website pretty good.

491
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,640
Yeah, I'm sure.

492
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,460
We all, we all clearly hit up this website.

493
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,340
They refute these points.

494
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,340
Point by point.

495
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,560
They bring up the things like why you might think they are,

496
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,180
because that's part of it is when like, I mean here, why not?

497
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,640
Basically what happens is October 22nd, 1997, Orlando Sentinel publishes an article.

498
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,180
Is Mr.

499
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,080
Toad about to drive out of Disney?

500
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,700
It may be time to say goodbye to Mr.

501
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,660
Toad and hello to Winnie the Pooh and Buzz Lightyear,

502
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,000
the magic, that's a separate thing that's getting incorporated.

503
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,360
But anyway, it's like a rumor that Orlando Sentinel gets posts,

504
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:50,620
reports on this website is started very quickly after the fact, savetoad.

505
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,180
com.

506
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,480
And they try to go through them.

507
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:58,900
Right.

508
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,980
And that's, I was just gonna say real quick,

509
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,800
it was also a reaction to 20,000 leagues closing without any fanfare.

510
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,340
And people were freaked and mad because they said it was going to be temporary.

511
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,710
So then they were like, they did this like soft test of like,

512
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,180
uh, Toad may close and be replaced by Ride.

513
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,560
We suddenly have fully like realized here,

514
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,140
this is what it would be, it would be Winnie the Pooh.

515
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,920
So then they gave them like, uh, if, if it's like, hey, if you're a kook,

516
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,800
go on it a couple more times before we close it.

517
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,860
So they tried to plan almost.

518
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:28,360
Yes.

519
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,460
That's what it seems like.

520
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:29,780
Yeah.

521
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,320
Although they probably also, I think this is,

522
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,780
I think that is the plan and yet they did not reckon with the internet.

523
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,700
Oh, absolutely.

524
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:40,060
They didn't realize how annoying this could become for them.

525
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,660
Whatever was annoying and I haven't looked into it of the 20,000 leagues complaints of like,

526
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,640
you didn't give us a chance to go on this before telling you didn't tell us that we

527
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,540
never go on it again.

528
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,280
They're like, I know what we'll do.

529
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,300
We'll give a little bit of a heads up.

530
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:59,340
And then yes, they got another round, a different kind of backlash.

531
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:05,460
We're also in this era where classics are starting to become, uh, let's,

532
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,040
weird word, but let's say touchable.

533
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,000
We say we think untouchable this in this era, they're like, oh, they're touchable.

534
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,660
We're touching.

535
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,240
And, uh, so 20,000 leagues goes, um,

536
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,080
strong, I forgot all this strong rumor in this era that Disneyland submarine voyage would go

537
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,900
forever.

538
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,200
Right.

539
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,040
That's something now that we maybe advocate for, but at the time it just ain't like cutting

540
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:34,080
corners, laziness, environmental catastrophe next to the other gas cuddling environmental catastrophe.

541
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,580
No, we'll, so climate change is done.

542
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,700
If we just get rid of that area and tomorrow, 80% of it comes from that part of the,

543
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,700
no bigger chunk.

544
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,940
I just saw, there's always a round of this every couple of weeks.

545
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,700
Just drawing that part of the map and going, get rid of this.

546
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,240
I know, but it wasn't timed then.

547
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,220
You know what I mean?

548
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,340
I think it's clearly time now.

549
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,440
We weren't even thinking about utopia then, but then there were these other ones and I'm

550
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,380
remember, cause I was like a news group guy.

551
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,880
I was, I was at 13.

552
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,580
I'm going to Disneyland news groups.

553
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:09,360
And I remember there was a lot of outrage about the rumor, the possibility that enchanted

554
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,380
Tiki room in Disneyland becomes a quote food court.

555
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,440
What was that actually going to be?

556
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,580
I don't know.

557
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,600
I think that, oh my God, what is the tropical hideaway?

558
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,400
I think that that turned out very nice and very charming, but would a,

559
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,160
would 1998 version have been in the era of red rockets pizza port?

560
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:31,780
Yeah.

561
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,740
Would they have done something nice there or something kind of pizza style?

562
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,420
The food would have been bad.

563
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,360
That's for sure.

564
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,360
Yeah.

565
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,480
That's a easier aesthetic for them to like get right.

566
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,180
That can last then tomorrow.

567
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:52,340
And so perhaps it would have looked okay, but it would have been like just the worst

568
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,660
food you've ever had.

569
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,440
And they probably, and it would have been kind of grandfathered in like, yeah,

570
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,820
if that gets the traffic it's going to get, who cares?

571
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,240
Yeah.

572
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:00,520
Yeah.

573
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:00,800
Yeah.

574
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,220
So anyway, everybody's just on edge.

575
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:07,100
I think there was also maybe the precursor to this is a save horizons website.

576
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:07,720
Yeah.

577
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:07,940
Yeah.

578
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,420
They've mentioned that somewhere.

579
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,360
Work out either.

580
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,080
Right.

581
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,400
So as you were saying, yeah.

582
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:16,760
So these, all these like excuses that were given or that were out there were refuted

583
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,540
on this website.

584
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,160
Yeah.

585
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:18,660
Yes.

586
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,420
One of which being like the darkness or the ribaldry.

587
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,220
And the ride was too scary for children.

588
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:25,740
So they have it.

589
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,360
And if you go to the website, they'll have like it in quotes of like what the reason is

590
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,660
and then they'll refute it with a few sentences.

591
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:36,720
And in that case, it's like, well, they're building, they got alien encounter now.

592
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,240
There's they're doing dark things everywhere.

593
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,680
So we can't say this is the darkest thing.

594
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,240
Right.

595
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,300
I think I have one of the points.

596
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,840
Oh, well, as part of that preliminary reports of the poo ride reveal that there will be

597
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:58,440
a an area involving heffa lumps and woozles just as frightening if not more so than Mr.

598
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:58,660
Toads.

599
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,560
Yeah, that is true.

600
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,700
That's not a bad point.

601
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,620
The heffa lumps and woozles are scary.

602
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:09,060
And that's a whole component of this too is the, I think some of the anger came

603
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,920
from we're getting rid of Mr.

604
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,020
Toad kind of weird, singular, kooky, not original because

605
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,820
it's a movie.

606
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,840
But I think I feel like culturally we know Mr.

607
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,020
Toad's wild ride more than Ichabod and

608
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,320
Mr.

609
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,000
Toad.

610
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,640
So it feels like a park original in a way.

611
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,700
And they want to replace it with Winnie the Pooh.

612
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,800
And I can't imagine anybody having a big problem with Winnie the Pooh.

613
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,760
This isn't the same as like I don't think that's the same as like the way people didn't

614
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,980
like Ewoks or what.

615
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:44,080
No, the Toad in guy even admits at one point like it makes sense for Pooh to be in the

616
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,920
Magic Kingdom.

617
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,540
And especially in the 90s, Pooh hugely popular.

618
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,040
I feel like.

619
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,300
He's trying to, yeah, they're trying to say that we want Pooh here.

620
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,520
We don't want him to go in this spot though.

621
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,540
That's the difference.

622
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,600
You don't have to, I don't necessarily agree with everything, all the logic, because one

623
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,560
of the points he tries to refute Winnie the Pooh is more popular than Mr.

624
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,020
Toad and his

625
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,320
friends.

626
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:12,100
And then apparently he tries to argue that it's not the case, which I'll read what he

627
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,280
says.

628
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,260
If the Win and the Willows characters had been so vigorously marketed by Disney, they

629
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,900
would be at least as popular, if not more so.

630
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,480
That's a different argument than they are as popular.

631
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,660
Yes, as it stands.

632
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,240
There's absolutely no Mr.

633
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,100
Toad merchandise available from Disney other than the home

634
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:27,380
video.

635
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:31,280
But recently Disney customers received an entire catalog devoted to Winnie the Pooh.

636
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,380
They can't complain about poor sales of Mr.

637
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,780
Toad merchandise if they don't offer any.

638
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:42,960
In a recent investigation run by Team Toad, approximately 90% of all Disney store employees

639
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,600
surveyed did not even know who Mr.

640
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,680
Toad is.

641
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:50,640
Many of them flatly denied that he was a Disney character at all, even when the evidence of

642
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:50,860
Mr.

643
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:54,400
Toad's wild ride and the Win and the Willows video was brought before them.

644
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,580
Some even recommended trying the Warner Brothers store, apparently confusing Mr.

645
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,180
Toad with

646
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:04,760
Michigan Jay Frog, the singing frog from the WB television commercials.

647
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:05,760
Whoa.

648
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,020
Whoa.

649
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:12,940
No, that's not, no, you want, that's on level two and that's, you're thinking of Hello My

650
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,180
Baby, Hello My Honey, Hello My Right Time Gal.

651
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,760
Yeah, that's, you have to go to the store with the video screens where you can paint.

652
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,840
That's not here, man.

653
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,740
That's not here.

654
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,240
So this is not-

655
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,260
Let's talk about what this survey is.

656
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:26,780
This is-

657
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,840
Team Toad ran an investigation.

658
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:33,100
Team Toad, first of all, is a group, they were calling themselves Team Toad.

659
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,960
Yeah, as well as Toadies, Toadies is a term as well.

660
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:37,880
Yes.

661
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,140
So yeah, they ran a survey of, hey, you know who this is?

662
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,260
Like that was probably-

663
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,700
They printed out black and white dot matrix.

664
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,500
Have you seen this character?

665
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,500
For Cartoon Toad.

666
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,800
Minimum wage Disney store.

667
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,000
Teenagers, yeah, minimum wage teenagers.

668
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,080
They have a lot of notes on this website for cast members.

669
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:08,680
Some compliments, but mostly like, it's very 1997 caddy internet.

670
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,760
Like early blogs.

671
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,380
I haven't come upon anything that's like horrendous or anything though, luckily.

672
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,600
I would not, this wouldn't be the term at the time, but this does not feel especially toxic.

673
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:26,960
Which makes it very different than internet fan campaigns have been for a long time.

674
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,520
Because it says, see it even says,

675
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,280
The Save Mr.

676
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,940
Toad site was not created with the intent to kill the Winning the Pooh project,

677
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,940
but merely to suggest that there are other available places within the park

678
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:42,260
and that nothing is worth the cost of removing a child's favorite ride forever.

679
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:43,860
Whoa.

680
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:44,880
Whoa.

681
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,980
Now, how true is that?

682
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,100
Is this just, is this dredging up emotion?

683
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,240
Is this pulling an emotional strip?

684
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:53,960
You mean for me or for-

685
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,340
No, in general, how much do we think that a lot of kids favorite ride?

686
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:57,860
Some.

687
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,480
Some.

688
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,800
Well, I'm sure some.

689
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,180
I love Mr.

690
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:00,680
Toad, I do.

691
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,180
But-

692
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,320
Oh, I wasn't thrilled.

693
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,440
You didn't like the ride?

694
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,940
Yeah, I was really mad it was going away.

695
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,940
Oh, you were mad it was going away.

696
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:07,480
Sure, sure.

697
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:12,580
I was mad it was going away, but I was also creeping up on 13 and 14 and you know,

698
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,760
I got a little more preoccupied with adolescence, you know.

699
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,900
Oh, you weren't focusing?

700
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,920
You mean Islands of Adventure opening.

701
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,660
Yeah, an adult thing.

702
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,160
The adult stuff.

703
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,020
Yeah, the cool stuff, yeah.

704
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,460
Did you, so yeah, it wasn't,

705
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,940
I do remember hearing it was closing and I remember being like, oh, I like that.

706
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,720
And then I, yeah, whatever it was going on.

707
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,820
I don't think I thought I had the power to change that also.

708
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,220
I wasn't empowered yet.

709
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,900
Well, isn't that what this whole campaign was about?

710
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:46,140
Trying to make you not feel that way, make everyone feel like they have a say.

711
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,560
On the, that's very true.

712
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:52,140
On this same website, he, I think it's the same guy.

713
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,880
He wrote, Disney has bulldozed this little boy's dreams.

714
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,120
And it's a picture of a little boy with, what is that?

715
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,240
The walrus character.

716
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,560
And it says, tell those mean old Disney suits where to stick it.

717
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:12,700
So I guess that's maybe what this comes from is this was a favorite of a little boy.

718
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,720
Stick what?

719
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,020
Tell those mean old Disney suits where to stick it.

720
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,380
I mean, that's to put something up their butts.

721
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,500
Put something up.

722
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,300
Yes, it's clearly something and clearly butts, but what?

723
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:28,260
Stick.

724
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,780
Well, but there's a stick up there already because they're getting rid of toad and they're up tight.

725
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,260
How about a, well, a thing from Winnie the Pooh, Pooh sticks.

726
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,980
They play that in the movie.

727
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,440
Yeah.

728
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,980
One of them put a Pooh stick up your butt.

729
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,580
Yeah.

730
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,020
There's Pooh there already.

731
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,880
So that's where I think this comes from here.

732
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,820
This was a particularly magical experience.

733
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,660
And maybe I was just gonna say like, is there.

734
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,600
A ride that made a bigger influence on you as a kid that when you maybe had some free time in

735
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,920
your early twenties, you would have gone down and protested like, like this, like, is there a ride

736
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:10,980
that was like, is more near and dear to your heart that reminds you of being a little boy?

737
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,000
Let's just put it that way.

738
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,860
It has to be make you feel like a little boy.

739
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,540
You've, you've chased me away from the whole thing.

740
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:22,160
I mean, not being a fan of wanting to, I just want to feel like a little boy.

741
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,540
Is there any, is there any.

742
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:27,700
It might be a nice, a less creepy way to put it.

743
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,680
A little attraction boy, a little ride lover, a little boy ride lover.

744
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,060
I wasn't thrilled when they closed Alien Encounter, but like.

745
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:40,020
If you were nearer to it, would you have gone there and said, oh,

746
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,220
this makes me feel like a little boy ride lover?

747
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,920
Maybe in so many where I don't remember a big Alien Encounter campaign.

748
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,640
I don't think, I don't think so.

749
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,960
I don't remember saying any words like that.

750
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,780
I think this is a Mike exclusive, I think.

751
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,700
Little boy ride lover?

752
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,140
Yeah.

753
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,500
What makes you feel like a little boy ride lover?

754
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,780
What would you stand in the way of?

755
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,200
That is a good question.

756
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,180
Again, it's proximate.

757
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,260
Again, I'd have to be in my early twenties, have not much going on.

758
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,140
I'm not saying this guy doesn't have stuff going on.

759
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,940
Maybe he did, but.

760
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,020
Well, I definitely had the latter taken care of.

761
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,480
Sure.

762
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,980
I don't know about the former.

763
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:25,940
I guess Peter Pan really was a big deal when I was a kid, when little.

764
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,360
And I got, that was the only ride I felt like I could open my eyes on.

765
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,740
So I suppose.

766
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,000
Open your eyes and fly with me, Michael.

767
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,680
Feel like a little boy ride lover.

768
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:38,660
Yeah.

769
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,900
So would I have gone regularly and I would have done one of them.

770
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,600
If there was a sort of campaign or something for it.

771
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,920
For Peter Pan and not this, are you saying?

772
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:49,740
Yeah.

773
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:55,740
No, if Toad was going, like going at Disneyland and I felt like the group of Toad in people

774
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:00,140
were not the new version of it were non-toxic and it just lined up with the Disneyland trip.

775
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,800
I'll go put a shirt on and.

776
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,160
Yeah.

777
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,740
I'll go stand around and talk to some people for a while.

778
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,800
I have one answer.

779
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,440
I have one answer and I'm going to take your twenties thing out of it.

780
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,260
I'm in my thirties.

781
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,040
I have a child.

782
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,120
I would still.

783
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,600
That would that none of that would stop me from going down to protest a removal of the

784
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,240
ET adventure.

785
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,260
Oh, right.

786
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,720
I would do it today.

787
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,100
Yeah.

788
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,240
That's the only thing because there's other things I like.

789
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,100
I'm like, I wouldn't like if they got rid of Sunny Eclipse.

790
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,360
I wouldn't like if they got rid of the people mover.

791
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,200
I don't think I'm flying out for it.

792
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,240
I'm like, what do I?

793
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,320
What in Disneyland am I going to go to?

794
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,760
I don't know if there's anything there that I even though it's closer.

795
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:39,920
ET adventure.

796
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,860
I think I'm there.

797
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,500
I think I'm wearing whatever shirt.

798
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:48,600
And it's currently being like, you know, protected like they're building Shrek's

799
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,500
swamp house next to it.

800
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,460
It's protected lands.

801
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,260
It's protected.

802
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,560
Yeah, it's a national piece of land.

803
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,560
That's what I want.

804
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:56,780
You know what?

805
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:01,200
If DeSantis made it protected land, I forgive him for everything else.

806
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,560
Yeah, that's yeah, that's because that feels so much again.

807
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,560
That's the last remaining piece of old universal.

808
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,220
It's the only to ride.

809
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,420
They've already changed the smell and I'm not happy about that.

810
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:23,960
I have particularly particularly a cute nose and I don't like what those sickos did.

811
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:28,300
That's just like when in a bed bath and beyond and I notice the smell immediately is

812
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,040
lavender number five candle.

813
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,200
Lazy, lazy from the universal creative people.

814
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,020
We need tourists coming to our state and they come for the smells.

815
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,920
The best smell our state has to offer as a as an incentive.

816
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,860
I will rerecord all of ET's lines when he says your name at the end.

817
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:55,680
If that helps, we can upgrade the ride system and I'll do the voiceover for free.

818
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,120
I will update.

819
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:03,160
I will read a list of names and let's I'll say I might curate the names to make it all

820
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,660
one type of name, you know, American names.

821
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,660
Jim.

822
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,420
Steve.

823
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,020
Hank.

824
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,060
My syllables only this country started going to hell when we started allowing two syllable

825
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:16,680
names.

826
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,220
Tex.

827
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,540
I was born Ronald and it tears me up inside.

828
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:23,440
Skip.

829
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:25,780
Biff.

830
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:27,780
Tiny.

831
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,500
Snap.

832
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,960
Not crackle.

833
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:30,500
Pop.

834
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,800
Nobody's called pop anymore.

835
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:39,580
Junior.

836
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,520
Oh, that's a double.

837
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:40,920
Sorry.

838
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:41,160
J.

839
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,840
Well, but JR is short.

840
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,160
Yeah, I'll take that.

841
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,400
Yeah.

842
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,000
So yeah, I could see you going down there.

843
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:54,440
Wouldn't that that is the only one where I would like be doing my day to day and I

844
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,280
would be upset.

845
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:01,340
It's the only can you can you because even I don't know, I'd be mad if they took out.

846
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,700
I know that I wouldn't phrase it as that.

847
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:09,380
I it makes me feel like a little boy, but I do love things from a particular era and

848
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:12,300
I like I'd be mad if the neon Mickey's went away.

849
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,100
Yeah, but I don't think I'm you're not getting there.

850
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,580
You're not going on a shirt for it.

851
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,880
Yeah, I should get a shirt of some of the keys though.

852
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,520
That would be cool.

853
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:24,100
Some of it I think is because like a haunted mansion or a pirates is feels so

854
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,100
untouchable almost.

855
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,740
I don't think I can even fathom that like going away.

856
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,480
I you know what I think for the answer to this because I want to I want to answer out

857
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:36,760
of Jason to and I like a you said alien encounter, but a current thing and I think

858
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,620
maybe you got to go to I think my home park kind of became California Adventure.

859
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,420
I think it's the one of the most fond of Jason's obviously Islands of Adventure.

860
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,160
What would be what do you what do you mad at if goes at islands?

861
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,540
I think it's Spider-Man goes.

862
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,580
That's could happen any day.

863
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,920
It's happening in Japan.

864
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,500
It's happened.

865
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,820
I forgot until today.

866
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,480
That's that's because do you know what it is to.

867
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,940
Yeah, it's Pokemon and it's and it's a our goggles.

868
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:06,820
I watched the same Alicia Stuller video you did and I know it's a are and it's like Spider-Man

869
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:11,550
you move your arms and I went oh, I couldn't believe that I literally no offense to

870
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,360
I was interested in the video.

871
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,840
It was it was it was the information that just when when it went from its a are goggles

872
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,660
and then she said and you wave your arms like spider.

873
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,880
I literally stopped watching the video.

874
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,600
Oh, I can't hear about this anymore.

875
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,980
Well in the same video.

876
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:31,580
These two things together well in the same video and I'm I'm you know,

877
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:36,700
I like Pokemon fine, but it was not you know, Mario or anything where I was a little boy

878
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:42,060
video game lover when I was playing it really I was more of teenager and I only played a little

879
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:47,520
bit but then in the later in the video she says that the rumor is first expansion for

880
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,600
Epic Universe is a Luigi's Mansion land.

881
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:56,960
Hell yeah with a ride of it, but then and interactive gun shoot and I went.

882
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,240
No, no, no, not again and like cut like men in black style.

883
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,960
I'm like no, I like, okay hang on though.

884
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,920
I like men in black.

885
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:05,860
I like the villain.

886
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,680
It's not a but I'm not saying I'm just saying you know, we know what we're saying.

887
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,340
Everything doesn't have to be this.

888
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:18,500
I'm saying what in this specific case what I thought was a are goggle the team up of a are

889
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,720
goggles and flailing your arms around.

890
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,900
Yeah, that's a scarier team up than the sinister six.

891
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,020
Yeah, specifically and Luigi's Mansion makes sense that you got that though whatever I

892
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,900
forget the name of it.

893
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,380
It's the is vacuum thing that sucks up ghosts.

894
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,420
Yeah, so that makes more sense and maybe that'll actually end up being more fun than

895
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,340
a Mario Kart but still.

896
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,960
You know what else I like is Monsters Inc.

897
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,280
Ride and seek in Japan.

898
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,900
Yeah, that's really your flashlight.

899
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,980
I think that's really fun.

900
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:50,260
So I'm not it's the genre is not yeah gone to I'm just a little I'm just nervous.

901
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:56,760
I'm nervous about it too because all this stuff is so fun and people say they like Mario

902
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:02,580
Kart but I still it's not my are people saying that still I swear people are claiming they

903
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:06,640
like Mario Kart and they're I swear to you this feels I feel like I'm being gaslit but

904
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,940
that seems what's happening online and there seems to be at least like 50% of the audience

905
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,700
not already an audience necessarily but theme park people I see like it.

906
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:18,640
They say they like it kind of crazy like when you see a bunch of stuff in your feed about

907
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:24,700
especially around the holidays about how a certain green baby is cute or perhaps even

908
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,540
very cute does it make you feel kind of insane.

909
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,160
You talking about tracks babies.

910
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:29,980
They're pretty good.

911
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,700
Everyone agrees.

912
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,580
They're very good.

913
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,780
There's no question about that.

914
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:33,520
Felicia.

915
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,640
Fargas.

916
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,480
Fargas.

917
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,040
Fargas.

918
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:36,900
Felicia.

919
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,140
And Griffin Newman.

920
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,280
And Griffin.

921
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:44,300
No it doesn't it's not like that at all I don't think it's different it feels different I think.

922
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,320
You're saying it's an actual gaslighting.

923
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,300
Actual really.

924
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,640
You know I was never a Mario Kart kid and then well I got Jane a Switch for Christmas and we've

925
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,280
been playing a lot of Mario Kart or especially.

926
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,380
Now you're a Mario Kart man.

927
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:03,180
I like it a lot but going fast is a big part of it.

928
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,560
Of course it is.

929
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,480
Going fast.

930
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,840
We might say it's the main part of it.

931
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:14,420
It might be the main thing also grabbing power ups and then like slamming into other cars is fun.

932
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,700
Mario Kart is pure bliss.

933
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,360
There's versions of it that are better than others but most all of them have a lot of fun in it.

934
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,600
I finally got on board on number eight.

935
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:31,020
Jason has become a Mario Kart man which is what I like to hear because Mario Kart is a universal

936
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:31,800
thing I think.

937
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,040
Not a universal it is a universal thing but it's a universal thing that people like so I'm glad

938
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,540
to hear it.

939
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,180
It's the Switch one so you can customize your vehicles and they have the ones that have like.

940
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:46,260
She's been unlocking stuff left and right so we're customizing.

941
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,580
I've played as Birdo yet.

942
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,520
Scott's beloved Birdo from Mario 2.

943
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,800
No I've raced against Birdo.

944
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:57,040
Birdo has hit me with a shell and then passed me.

945
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,380
Don't you lay a finger on Birdo.

946
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,440
You probably had it coming.

947
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,780
I did go like oh wait I can't select Birdo.

948
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,040
Like oh Birdo is DLC or unlockable.

949
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,480
You'll get there.

950
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,340
Spider-Man is your answer.

951
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:16,800
I'm at this point you know what actually it's becoming now I'm wrapping around to I can't

952
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,000
believe I got there but it's partially due to my son.

953
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:27,140
Now I've become so fond of Redwood Creek Challenge Trail and Mater's Junkyard Jamboree.

954
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,500
I think those might be the closest but it's still not even close to the.

955
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,360
Let me call my shot we're doing Challenge Trail this year.

956
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,220
Please yes.

957
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,440
Yeah I'm such a big fan of Challenge Trail.

958
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,920
You know what I'm going to throw a shot right back at you.

959
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:43,360
I don't think you can or should do it until you take your daughter there.

960
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,900
Yeah you're probably right.

961
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,420
Because you probably still got a couple.

962
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:50,100
You'll just be like you know imagine the episode we would have done before.

963
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:55,280
We're like well there's a Sequoia slice and you read the written the emotion of.

964
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,020
Oh my god you're right that'll be better.

965
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:01,860
That'll be better but Jason and I in our like mid-20s running around there.

966
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,100
We went there a number of times.

967
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:03,980
Jumping through stuff.

968
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,540
It's still pretty you know good.

969
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:09,980
We definitely were like oh weights are terrible and everything else.

970
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,200
Do you want to go to Challenge Trail?

971
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,560
Sure yeah we were hanging at the Challenge Trail way back.

972
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,440
I think I was I think I was overlooking it.

973
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,800
So yeah so so look you know what if they want to get rid of the Velocicoaster Universal.

974
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,760
I'm saying no I'm going to go out there for that too.

975
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:26,340
I will protest that.

976
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,740
Those two are three years old.

977
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,180
Hey if I would be mad exactly.

978
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,400
These guys are crazy they're tearing up whatever.

979
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,900
Their current building mandate you don't know.

980
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,200
I'll put a shirt on for it.

981
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,740
Just start the website now save Velocicoaster.

982
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,640
Save the quote Velocicoaster yeah.

983
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:48,640
Okay look I'm going to read this quote because look yeah it is a little odd to do you know

984
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:55,420
even thinking about hypothetically going to like a ride protest feels a little a little odd.

985
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,760
And here is a quote about this campaign.

986
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:03,440
Anyone who would be so nuts to challenge Disney and waste a whole year obviously has some issues.

987
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,080
That is a quote from the guy who did it.

988
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,660
Jeff Moscott.

989
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:08,840
Yes yes.

990
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,280
I think that's why it's this educational Miami website.

991
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:17,800
I think that's that's one name connected to it.

992
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,900
I think that who a guy who made the website also John LaFonte.

993
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,060
Somebody named Hal Bowers is part of this too isn't it.

994
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,220
It's a name I see sometimes.

995
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,960
Yes I do see that as well.

996
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,180
Internet theme park person I think he made some of the artwork.

997
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:38,200
This guy Jeff Moscott launches this campaign and then he does a lot of a lot of press.

998
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,660
That's something you see on this website.

999
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:45,570
This really became like major outlets covered this and this is him talking to the Associated Press

1000
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,520
which about why Mr.

1001
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,080
Toad was such an appealing character.

1002
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:53,120
It's a nice break from the happy singing flowers.

1003
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,440
Not that those things don't have a place in Disney.

1004
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,300
He's not the bland Disney hero with two funny sidekicks.

1005
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,120
He's nuts.

1006
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,020
He steals cars but he's still the good guy.

1007
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,300
And that's a nice feel.

1008
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,900
I totally agree with that.

1009
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:13,760
In the same way that like you know yet like how fun is it to like you know the marvels all start to

1010
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,460
blend together but then something like does kind of a different genre you know things that are a

1011
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:24,300
little like a WandaVision or a Spider-verse and that's a different thing but like how different

1012
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:29,280
like something that breaks the mold genre wise really stands out and especially I love that

1013
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:29,520
Mr.

1014
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:36,020
Toad is breaks the pattern of and they lived happily ever after.

1015
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,900
Literally it is the opposite.

1016
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:38,580
Yes.

1017
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,740
You do not live and it is not happy.

1018
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:43,540
It might be forever after but it's for sure.

1019
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,140
For sure.

1020
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,140
But yeah the other ones no.

1021
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,900
More forever after than how the princess stories end.

1022
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:54,540
And that one I guess and that one's especially it's you not you as a represent well no I guess

1023
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:58,240
it's always sort of you know that they put the characters on but you are the you're not Toad

1024
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,780
it's you you're spending eternity in hell.

1025
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,040
Is that so?

1026
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:05,940
But you don't see Toad it could be one of those this is up for interpretation.

1027
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,260
Well that's maybe for the other episode.

1028
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:13,180
It is kind of technically you are I mean it's I'll go with you on this though I like that Mr.

1029
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:13,480
Toad

1030
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:18,620
is like come to my house I'll put you in a car the wheel doesn't work so good so you're gonna get in

1031
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,900
a lot of accidents and you're gonna die and you're gonna go to hell.

1032
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:23,240
Yeah it's true I think that's a debate for the episode.

1033
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,420
You're trapped in a mad man's house.

1034
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:25,980
I have thoughts now but I think it's gonna be too much.

1035
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:26,620
Sure sure sure.

1036
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:26,920
Okay.

1037
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,200
And again 20 to 30.

1038
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:30,980
Yeah yeah we got a lot of time to prep for that.

1039
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,900
And saving for a big big name for this one too.

1040
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,220
Yes true.

1041
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,720
Billy Corgan or something.

1042
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:37,860
You would give that.

1043
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,240
I'm calling that shot by the way he's gonna be on the show this year.

1044
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:41,340
Oh okay.

1045
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:45,320
You have an air you I hope we've been texting about you have an airtight plan.

1046
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,180
Yeah.

1047
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,060
Do you want to say the airtight plan?

1048
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,460
I'm gonna make you say the airtight plan.

1049
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,300
I should also say when we drove here Mike was listening to Melancholy.

1050
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,340
I was listening to Melancholy and the Infinite Sinus on the way over here.

1051
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,320
That seems like part of the course.

1052
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,340
Yeah I was listening to Jelly Belly right before I picked you up.

1053
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,540
Which they started playing online.

1054
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:09,180
I think if I start talking about him more this year even more that then it'll start to be in the air.

1055
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:12,300
But what I had said is that I have friends with his phone number.

1056
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,040
Oh no I meant the other plan.

1057
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,500
What did I say?

1058
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,660
Smashing Pumpkins is looking for a new guitarist.

1059
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,400
Oh right right right.

1060
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:26,880
And then please send a video of you wailing on guitar and you're gonna send a video that was

1061
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,400
instead please be on my podcast.

1062
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:34,080
Yeah so yeah Smashing Pumpkins a couple days ago or a week ago at this point they're looking

1063
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,700
for another guitarist and some like this is always interesting it always feels sometimes

1064
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:40,940
like a PR stunt when something like this happens because you're like

1065
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,740
Billy you don't know a guitarist.

1066
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:44,540
Yeah yeah.

1067
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,800
I heard people kicking down the door to tour.

1068
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,080
I mean maybe I don't know.

1069
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:54,800
So yeah so it's an open call you can send a video in with some materials of your abilities.

1070
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,920
I don't believe I am a good enough guitar player to be in Smashing Pumpkins.

1071
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:01,980
But I do believe I can make a video where I have a guitar.

1072
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:07,900
I do a fake 10 seconds of playing the guitar and then just implore Billy please I have a theme park

1073
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:08,580
podcast.

1074
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:13,180
You said recently that you're a Disneyland weirdo and that that's what we are.

1075
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:15,340
We're not Disney adults we're like you man.

1076
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,640
Can you come and be on our show please?

1077
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,780
And then I'll go back to the guitar a little bit or something and then just in case in case he is

1078
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:24,440
like actually I'm kind of thinking about him for the guitar role.

1079
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:24,860
Right.

1080
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,960
And podcast no but this guy wow he might have such jobs.

1081
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:32,440
Just yes just in case I will try with the guitar as well.

1082
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:36,080
I'll be like I can also I can do a little something on here.

1083
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,940
Have you there's a lot of music on the podcast you could listen to too Billy.

1084
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,320
Do you know who McGruff is Billy?

1085
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:43,480
That might be how you get him actually.

1086
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,940
Now suddenly he's because he does all these songs about bozo and shit.

1087
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:47,500
Oh God.

1088
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,600
Now he's like that might be my call.

1089
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:55,320
And now and now smashing pumpkins becomes a full time McGruff band and you have turned them.

1090
00:48:56,140 --> 00:49:01,720
And 90 percent of fans are furious but 10 percent are like the pumpkins are back baby.

1091
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,320
Yeah yeah that no there's.

1092
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:07,080
Mainly Billy will finally be happy he'll be doing what he wants.

1093
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:07,580
Yeah.

1094
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:14,780
Listen up people paid for those pumpkins on their doorsteps and you should not be shut anywhere near.

1095
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,680
Keep them in intact.

1096
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,040
Pristine condition.

1097
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:20,060
And don't smash a squash either.

1098
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:24,800
There's a chance that my call birthday shot this year is oh the bozo show I think.

1099
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:30,220
But I really will spend an a half hour on Billy Corgan's recent song about the magic

1100
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:35,840
care the magician character that was on the bozo show called whizzo which he did he debuted on

1101
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,680
New Year's Eve at local Chicago New Year's Eve TV.

1102
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,880
I'm obsessed with it and anyway.

1103
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,960
Oh with Billy Crystal.

1104
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,520
With Billy Crystal.

1105
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,660
What or Billy who who was on the.

1106
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,160
Local New Year's.

1107
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:49,980
Billy what are you talking about.

1108
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,640
Who was hosting that New Year's.

1109
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,640
Billy Corgan with his wife Chloe.

1110
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:54,500
I got.

1111
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,600
They were at Madame Zuzu's their tea shop in Highland Park Illinois.

1112
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,840
I got confused.

1113
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,900
I thought Billy Crystal was hosting local Chicago TV.

1114
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,320
Billy Crystal was singing out whizzo.

1115
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,480
I sent you the video.

1116
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:06,700
I know.

1117
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:11,280
Wait a minute you watched it and thought it was Billy Crystal.

1118
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,380
You didn't watch my Billy Corgan video.

1119
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,200
I forgot about it.

1120
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,140
I watched it and forgot about it.

1121
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,760
Watch it they were saying about whizzo.

1122
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,500
Look I told you before you started recording I had a cold for like 12 days.

1123
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,580
I was pretty out of it.

1124
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,780
The cold that makes you see Crystal instead of Corgan.

1125
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,380
You were describing all this the cold and everything and it sounds awful and I feel

1126
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:35,000
really bad that being said Billy Corgan and Billy Crystal.

1127
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,020
Well they both sing.

1128
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:40,180
They both go on a stage and sing sometimes.

1129
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,320
Okay what if Billy Corgan's saying it's a wonderful night for Oscar Oscar Oscar.

1130
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,600
Oh I love that.

1131
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:45,940
Okay.

1132
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,900
And then a big like rips a solo.

1133
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,240
That would be cool.

1134
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:58,040
And the jazz man saying tonight tonight.

1135
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:01,960
But then I'm trying to square like Billy Crystal.

1136
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:05,060
Tonight.

1137
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:10,680
I'm trying to do what's a Billy what's a Smashing Pumpkins Oscar medley.

1138
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,580
Oh that's oh oh oh.

1139
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:15,740
With their songs or with just pure.

1140
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,780
Despite all my rage I am still just the English patient.

1141
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,200
From it has to be 1995.

1142
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,420
It's gotta be from the one of the years.

1143
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:25,580
Yeah yeah that's very.

1144
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,040
Jerry McGuire.

1145
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:40,000
He did only one modern song and it was he likes pumpkins apparently.

1146
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,220
It's too much I can't we have to go back.

1147
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,360
Let's get back.

1148
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,340
All right so.

1149
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,840
Should we talk about the t-shirt.

1150
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:50,540
Everyone saw the t-shirt.

1151
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:59,340
A virtual Toad Hall gets a lot of posts on it but they want to ramp up this campaign.

1152
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,660
How do we make the Disney brass actually be aware of us.

1153
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:08,480
And I guess you know I guess the step before that is why don't we go start doing some in person things.

1154
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:08,820
Yes.

1155
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,100
Let's go to the Magic Kingdom.

1156
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,140
Let's coordinate.

1157
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,040
Let's show our support.

1158
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:16,960
We call these toad ends and that brings us to the episode but a big part of that they're selling websites.

1159
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:22,750
They're selling websites they're selling t-shirts on the website and you're supposed to wear these at the toad ends.

1160
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,120
Jason do the honors.

1161
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,940
Yeah so the front says save Mr.

1162
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,680
Toad's wild ride and it's crying children looking at a dead Mr.

1163
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:32,290
Toad.

1164
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:33,360
And on the.

1165
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:34,980
With a toe with a toad shaped.

1166
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,080
With a toad ghost.

1167
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:38,520
Rising out of the flower in his chest.

1168
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,720
And the back says ask me why Mickey is killing Mr.

1169
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:43,400
Toad.

1170
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:46,940
Mickey's doing it.

1171
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:53,520
And they they were stopped and some of the recounting of these toad ends.

1172
00:52:53,980 --> 00:53:00,860
People would get stopped by security and then have to go like we are saying for me we're allowed to wear these shirts is fine.

1173
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:02,740
We were told it was fine by management.

1174
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:08,660
I think from what I could tell I think Disney is and this goes back to the comment that suggested the topic.

1175
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:16,500
Disney's trying to figure out how they get they catch wind of this of course like because it's on the internet so like oh something's happening.

1176
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:23,900
Yeah how can we stop this and I think as it goes on what they find is it's just a bunch of nerds milling around.

1177
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:28,080
Yeah and there is nothing to stop but they still don't like it.

1178
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:33,720
I think one of the only things they could find is you're all dressed in the same shirt.

1179
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,520
Yeah is that a problem.

1180
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,260
Isn't it.

1181
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:38,720
Are you a gang.

1182
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,470
What is this.

1183
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,260
Gangs aren't allowed.

1184
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:45,040
It is less people though than some family reunions.

1185
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:45,520
Yes.

1186
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:46,940
Wearing matching shirts.

1187
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:53,440
We can't be having north of 50 people all wearing the same shirt and then right then a bunch of people in like.

1188
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,660
Yeah McCluskey big trip.

1189
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:57,120
1997.

1190
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,200
I'm Dalmatian number one.

1191
00:53:59,260 --> 00:53:59,900
I'm two.

1192
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:00,640
I'm two.

1193
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:01,320
Yeah yeah.

1194
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,940
Grandma's number 101.

1195
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:16,360
So yeah they could that the technically they couldn't get too too mad about this but the flyers that they pass out are a little abrasive as well.

1196
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,980
And they I think they do try to stop that like you can't be but I think they like.

1197
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,520
The security was too bored to watch this too much so yeah I think they got some flyers out.

1198
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,080
Such as.

1199
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,780
Can't we all just get along.

1200
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,180
Put poo somewhere else not on the grave of Mr.

1201
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:41,900
Toad and in this I didn't really look at this before this is an evil Winnie the Pooh with scary teeth.

1202
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:42,360
Yeah.

1203
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,820
Driving a steamroller right behind Mr.

1204
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:46,820
Toad.

1205
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,000
Who's going to crush him.

1206
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:48,860
Without a character.

1207
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,000
Yeah that's also just.

1208
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,360
Wait evil poo you're saying.

1209
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:53,740
Evil poo.

1210
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:54,560
Well now with.

1211
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:59,580
I know now yes in the public domain poo is can be evil is more evil than good.

1212
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,680
There's a sequel to the scary poo movie coming.

1213
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,340
Pooh blood and honey.

1214
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,460
Wait yeah I believe.

1215
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:08,000
Tigger entered the public domain the original Tigger.

1216
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,980
They were waiting for Tigger.

1217
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,200
So that's the sequel I believe as Tigger.

1218
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,320
Don't quote me on that.

1219
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,060
I'm salivating.

1220
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,380
I forbid the topic of making us watch the public domain Winnie the Pooh movies.

1221
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,880
People are going to want to do it now.

1222
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:20,440
Yeah maybe.

1223
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,460
I don't want to do it anyway.

1224
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:21,960
Flood and honey.

1225
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,280
As magician please.

1226
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,940
And then another one don't let poo kill Mr.

1227
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:28,480
Toad.

1228
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,780
Killing toads is a crime.

1229
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:38,740
And then I really like my favorite for sure is just this kind of dazed toad photo very simple.

1230
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,480
With motor mania is not a crime.

1231
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,380
Yeah that's great.

1232
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,720
Motor mania.

1233
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,460
I would wear that on the shirt.

1234
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,280
I would wear that today.

1235
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,620
Yeah I wonder if that still exists.

1236
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,100
These are certainly not high resolution enough to do it ourselves.

1237
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,560
But you can trace over it and then you got one.

1238
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,740
I would like it if it was actually blurry on the shirt too.

1239
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,260
Oh you just want it blocky.

1240
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:04,640
Some of this is it definitely seems like oh simpler world you know.

1241
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:11,300
Like as much as I've gone to the parks like a couple years ago and saw all those like

1242
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:17,960
reactionary like lock up trader Biden like taking from my cold dead hands and it's like

1243
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,060
oh no they're closing Mr.

1244
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:23,100
Toad shirts like a simpler world you know.

1245
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:23,980
Yeah I know.

1246
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,660
I don't want to know what the campaign is today.

1247
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:30,980
Well it's a splash mountain save splash mountain campaign.

1248
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,420
That's the equivalent of it.

1249
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:36,620
I will say this about that.

1250
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:43,180
It existed if you went looking there were some pretty bad backwards ugly comments but

1251
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:47,460
it never at least it was never so they didn't they didn't.

1252
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:51,120
I think those they were lazy they were online only.

1253
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:55,580
Yeah they wished it became some sort of like thousands strong.

1254
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:01,340
Yes yeah the toad in people went they drove their cars they went to a place.

1255
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:06,180
Splash mountain people were like maybe didn't care as much as they said they cared or you

1256
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:08,240
know it was a part of the culture war.

1257
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:13,080
You know it was well it was that indignancy that day and then they were then like you know

1258
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:17,640
changing the design of some like milk box and they have to go be mad about that.

1259
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:21,700
That's true there's so much happening so many things were going woke at the time.

1260
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,180
Yeah yeah.

1261
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,860
They had to split the difference.

1262
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,860
How could so many things go woke when it makes you go broke.

1263
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,020
Yet every day thousands of things go woke.

1264
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:36,920
But the most fun and the darkest it gets and this was already said in the in the episode blurb but

1265
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,720
let's meditate for a little bit on tell poo to go to hell.

1266
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:49,960
And this artwork is now to poo does not have the upper hand he is scared holding his honey pot

1267
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,420
at the pitchfork of one of the Mr.

1268
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:54,280
Toad devils.

1269
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,780
Yeah the flying devils.

1270
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:56,920
This is very good.

1271
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,080
This is really funny.

1272
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:02,840
It kind of softened when I saw tell poo to go to hell just in print I was like that's a little harsh

1273
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:07,300
and now that I've seen the little that it's a cute devil.

1274
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,800
Yeah I like it.

1275
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,980
I love Winnie the Pooh I don't want any harm to him but this is good.

1276
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:13,900
I just like seeing these guys together.

1277
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:17,000
I think that in the great gazoo with a character he's not supposed to be with.

1278
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,360
Yeah that is what I don't know Ted Lasso or something.

1279
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:25,820
Yo in the last season of Lasso he suddenly had a great gazoo character.

1280
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,040
Now I'm on board.

1281
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:31,800
I think any TV show if it's just like yeah it's probably going to be the last season it's like

1282
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:39,640
Maybe Donald Faison should be greeted by like a mischievous imp.

1283
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:41,880
Maybe John Cryer should.

1284
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:44,620
On Two and a Half Men?

1285
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:48,480
No no on whatever that new show is with Donald Faison and John Cryer.

1286
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,040
Oh I see.

1287
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:53,920
Yes you're right I don't know what it is and I will never look into it unless they add a little

1288
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,900
green alien in the final season.

1289
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:56,920
Then I'm watching everyone.

1290
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:03,220
I would also say like if you were having a first season of a show why not introduce the little green imp?

1291
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:05,500
What do you got to lose?

1292
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:09,700
How about this bring Alf back but also the great gazoo's on the show.

1293
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:17,740
There's a new guidance counselor at Abbott Elementary and only one person only Quinto

1294
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:19,220
Bronson can see him.

1295
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,480
Grey's Anatomy with great gazoo.

1296
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,400
You know the crown took an odd turn this year.

1297
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:33,500
I don't usually rail against historical inaccuracies but I don't think Princess Diana had a little.

1298
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:37,260
I don't know maybe only she could see it.

1299
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:43,560
I still got a lot I was saying of course I was like oh I'm halfway through Saltburn.

1300
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,740
I can see a little imp showing up.

1301
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,360
It's all open right now.

1302
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:55,680
Anything to distract from like they're entering college or the freshman class of 2006.

1303
00:59:55,900 --> 01:00:00,910
It's a period movie let's play Block Party and I'm like oh no I don't like this.

1304
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:03,940
Wow that's a college band you didn't like.

1305
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:08,540
No that was college band I did like but I'm like oh making me feel my age.

1306
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,900
I didn't I thought you were like oh no Block Party I don't like them.

1307
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:18,360
It was like Block Party and Arcade Fire and I was like oh this is throwback now 20 years.

1308
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,460
You don't want to feel like a little Block Party boy.

1309
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,320
Block Party lover.

1310
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:25,520
Little boy Block Party lover.

1311
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,480
I'm just a little Block Party boy.

1312
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:34,100
Make sure whenever you do that phrase that you don't drop the specific because if the

1313
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,360
specific is lost imagine what that phrase becomes.

1314
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,040
I think about it every time I say it.

1315
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:38,800
You gotta be careful.

1316
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:43,700
Yeah the Walkman doing a Muppet Baby style and it's called the Walk Boys.

1317
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:47,320
I don't think I know what the Walkman is.

1318
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:50,620
The Walkman what's that their name from about that time?

1319
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:54,060
I forget the song they did but what about Jet Junior?

1320
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:55,520
Little Jets.

1321
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:56,320
Jet Junior.

1322
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:59,100
Yeah the little Arctic Monkeys.

1323
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,980
Yeah the Arctic Monkey babies.

1324
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:07,380
Anyway so you got shirts about tell poo to go to hell.

1325
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:12,100
It's funny it's funny it makes me want to get involved I know.

1326
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:13,300
I can't be mad at that yeah.

1327
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,300
And they and so well let's go back to the original premise of the comment which is like

1328
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:19,340
it's weird that Disney just let it happen.

1329
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:22,580
And I do think that part of it was not much was actually happening.

1330
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:28,120
Another piece and maybe you guys read some of the detailed toed in recaps.

1331
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:28,960
Yes diaries.

1332
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:31,860
Yes the screeds.

1333
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:40,940
These these the rumors start flying I think in September or I'm sorry October 97 then very

1334
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:44,820
quickly within six weeks they have done the first toed in.

1335
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:51,240
And this very first one Disney's pretty on edge and this I think is an interesting case study

1336
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:55,860
and like what would happen if you tried to do a little little protest a little event at Disneyland

1337
01:01:57,060 --> 01:02:01,640
because you well you think like well a bunch of security would swarm well hang on they don't

1338
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:06,120
want to like upset the apple car we don't want to make people worried that there's a bunch of

1339
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:06,580
security.

1340
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:13,800
So we will have security there but all in plain clothes all disguised as tourists or

1341
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:16,120
janitors or what have you.

1342
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:20,560
So now we know this is what would happen if you started stirring up some shit you would suddenly

1343
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:26,440
notice a lot more janitors around than usual maybe and maybe if you look close they have ear pieces.

1344
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:31,160
Yeah it's uh I mean we've also talked about this too where it's like well you can get a lot farther

1345
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:34,280
naked in Small World than you'd think.

1346
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:39,240
You can get farther in there deeper into the building before anyone's going to come around

1347
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:39,860
looking for you.

1348
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:40,380
Yeah.

1349
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:46,480
So if you just if you just swarms he didn't suddenly he didn't suddenly get a bunch of red dots

1350
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,940
right around his dick.

1351
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:48,680
No.

1352
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,500
They have to not.

1353
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:51,520
Take the shots.

1354
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,560
Pulverize it.

1355
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:55,580
Would it be.

1356
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:58,200
That's what you're going to kill him faster if we did the head.

1357
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:00,880
Ah yeah but we're pretty mad about the nudity.

1358
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:01,820
Yeah yeah.

1359
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:02,800
Less than a part.

1360
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,600
You nudity is more important than.

1361
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:08,800
Let him live but don't let him ever do nudity in the park.

1362
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:09,480
Breaking the rules.

1363
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:17,140
So yeah it doesn't surprise me that some mild mannered people wearing a slightly aggressive

1364
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:17,520
shirt.

1365
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:23,360
Yeah yeah they kept an eye on it and then what they what they what the people is milling around

1366
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:26,660
in the shirts started hearing is like Disney's going to shut this down you got about 10 minutes.

1367
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:27,780
I'm hearing the plan.

1368
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:28,180
Yeah.

1369
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:33,180
There are people whispering you got 10 minutes but what else happened is that as I said media

1370
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:37,660
outlets start noticing what's going on that something is happening and they want to see

1371
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:39,520
if some shit's going to hit the fan.

1372
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:45,300
So reporters are there with cameras and I think that makes Disney go we don't want to

1373
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:52,740
make a scene we don't want a situation that's going to really just light the fire on all

1374
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:53,100
of this.

1375
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:59,860
So I think due to the presence of reporters they're just like all right maybe do as little

1376
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:00,740
as possible.

1377
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,960
Don't let them hand out that hell flyer.

1378
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:06,680
Besides that let the guys go on the ride that they like.

1379
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:11,300
And thus so the media protected the.

1380
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:17,320
Yeah that's their job in a lot of ways you know when you're talking about actual protests

1381
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,640
for things that maybe matter a little more.

1382
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:22,100
Yeah the media is supposed to be there to cover that.

1383
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:22,400
Yeah.

1384
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,680
So they did give protection to the toad and crew the toadies.

1385
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:32,640
The toadies were free to keep milling about every week after they didn't get.

1386
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:33,400
Ride Mr.

1387
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:37,300
Toad like once or twice and then go to other stuff to the park.

1388
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:42,580
Realize that even like all right I mean I'd look I want to do Big Thunder I'm here.

1389
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:47,660
There was I feel I don't know if it was this extreme but it does feel from reading some of

1390
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:51,040
this for like people were like oh my god like we're going to get beaten up by Disney security

1391
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:51,760
for this.

1392
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:52,920
And I'm like that's not.

1393
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,840
You think people people wanted.

1394
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:55,460
That's right.

1395
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:57,600
Yeah maybe a few people wanted a scene.

1396
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:01,980
Yeah not that anybody wants to get beat up but yeah the scene itself would be like oh

1397
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:05,340
this is outrageous what we're doing with this poo going to hell.

1398
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:10,520
Maybe what they want to go back to something we talked about a while back.

1399
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:14,200
Guards clunk clunk clunk clunk.

1400
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:17,000
Big Disney army sweeps in.

1401
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:27,080
They are left with permanent like cattle prod marks in Mickey Ears shape.

1402
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:29,900
To remind them who never to mess with again.

1403
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:33,620
This had to come across Eisner's desk at a certain point.

1404
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,900
I mean there's a little mention of him on the website but there's some insults hurled at him

1405
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:38,440
as well.

1406
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,980
What are they saying what are they saying about me.

1407
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:45,800
Yeah so I like to imagine that he's on the Miami dot ed website looking at this.

1408
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:49,440
Well here's what here's what it became.

1409
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:55,140
Jason I know you have feel free to read what what you had there because I mainly saw Eisner

1410
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:59,820
look he's he's put in the position of like it really shows you know it's always

1411
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:02,560
you know you're going to be mad at Disney doing something you're going to end you're

1412
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:06,320
going to put it on Iger you're going to put it on yeah JPEC you're going to put it on whoever it is.

1413
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:12,440
But they they pin it on Eisner but what I saw was like after the fact when the campaign does not

1414
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,120
work out.

1415
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:13,700
Yeah.

1416
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:18,180
Do you have this is this are you talking about the end is here part.

1417
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:18,700
Yeah yeah.

1418
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,840
Okay Jason you have there you want me to do it.

1419
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,780
Oh I do have that.

1420
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,920
Yeah the end is here.

1421
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:29,380
Well it looks like that rad fink Eisner has finally done it.

1422
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:30,140
Mr.

1423
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:35,520
Toad had his last wild ride on Labor Day September 7th 1998.

1424
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:41,000
Wow well and what I saw big at the top of the website you know the website obviously says save

1425
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:41,280
Mr.

1426
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:48,080
Toad's wild ride but then they had to do it in past tense and it became we tried to save Mr.

1427
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:51,380
Toad's wild ride but Eisner doesn't care about you.

1428
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,460
That hurts the for the notion like we don't like that.

1429
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,800
Yeah I don't accept that.

1430
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:03,540
So yeah there's a he couldn't like if he's if he was still looking at this website I mean if he

1431
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:06,920
had an advisor they shouldn't tell him this because I don't they wouldn't want to upset him.

1432
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:12,300
But if he was looking he might have been up in like assaulted he might have sat with him the

1433
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:13,080
rest of the day.

1434
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:14,700
Somebody get me an internet machine.

1435
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,060
I'm going to do it I'm going to go.

1436
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:17,380
Oh Mr.

1437
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,720
Eisner no I don't believe you should be like.

1438
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:22,060
I know tune in however you do it to Miami.

1439
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:22,720
edu.

1440
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:26,280
Then the five assistants none of them know how to do it either.

1441
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:26,620
Right.

1442
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:32,800
And then after 70 minutes finally he is on finally save Mr.

1443
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,700
Toad's wild ride and it's

1444
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:36,160
three graphics have loaded.

1445
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,440
What is that's wait all right it's loading.

1446
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:44,060
But Eisner maybe it's going to say but Eisner is the most handsome man.

1447
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,540
Does it all night.

1448
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,380
That's right that's good I want to get that word out there.

1449
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,100
There's one of those websites that loads left to right.

1450
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:54,520
Yeah left to right.

1451
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:56,740
I.

1452
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:02,760
Isner doesn't take breaks he works tirelessly to create new rides and his office.

1453
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:08,560
Yeah then you see yeah he's well the second yeah.

1454
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:15,060
Eisner doesn't car pull to work that's right to my own on board proud of it.

1455
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,580
And the second one yeah he would like a rat friend or something.

1456
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:24,340
Well it looks like that red thing a rat friend I guess you wouldn't his name was

1457
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,660
a free house owner.

1458
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:28,900
That's right I did just have it fumigated.

1459
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:33,720
Rat think is such an odd old timey.

1460
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:34,780
Oh I love it yeah.

1461
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:39,840
Like yeah yeah yeah I know it's 1920s.

1462
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:43,080
Yeah that's a character we don't talk about a lot on the show either rat think.

1463
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:48,620
Oh yeah yeah you know those little the little mad car drivers.

1464
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,360
Yeah kind of Mario Kart ask.

1465
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,940
Oh true why did nobody make a Mario Kart out of rat think.

1466
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:56,260
Yeah Jason you see he's this guy.

1467
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,120
Wacky racers.

1468
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,120
No no it's this guy you've seen him.

1469
01:08:59,120 --> 01:08:59,820
Oh yeah yeah.

1470
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:00,180
Green mouse.

1471
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,480
Oh and the cars yeah the class cars.

1472
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:05,780
Baris Baris Otto is that that guy's name.

1473
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:06,740
Oh that's a good question.

1474
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,580
He was this has to do with Paris.

1475
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:09,260
Oh okay.

1476
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:10,700
Okay hold on a second.

1477
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:14,940
I think I'm seeing that he was he was created by Ed Big Daddy Roth.

1478
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:18,100
Who was conceived as an anti-hero to Mickey Mouse.

1479
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:20,620
So rat think is the anti-Mickey.

1480
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:25,060
Interesting and I just just looked up rat think and it popped up something 2006 called

1481
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:30,100
Tales of the Rat Fink and it says this movie burns rubber and it lists the credits of who's

1482
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:38,680
in it and Margaret Tom Wolf Matt Groening Steve Austin Brian Wilson John Goodman and Jay Leno.

1483
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,080
What is this a documentary.

1484
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:42,480
That's what it can't be.

1485
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,900
This is not an animated rat think movie.

1486
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:46,940
Starring Brian Wilson and Jay Leno 2006.

1487
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:48,720
It's a narrative film not a.

1488
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:54,320
I'm pretty versed in the acting work of Brian Wilson and I don't want to say he's not good.

1489
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:55,040
Okay hold on.

1490
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:55,820
He's a better musician.

1491
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:56,320
Hold on a second.

1492
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:56,860
Wait a minute.

1493
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:59,740
It's no no no John Goodman plays Ed Big Daddy Roth.

1494
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:01,520
Jay Leno plays flamethrower.

1495
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:04,340
Steve Austin plays heavy Chevy.

1496
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,360
What is Brian Wilson.

1497
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:07,940
Hold on I'm trying to find it.

1498
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:08,680
This is another.

1499
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:09,780
Dick Smothers is in it.

1500
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,860
I don't want to give away just a future type but why not let's let's whet the appetite.

1501
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:16,500
We've been talking about an episode about Jay Leno's acting career.

1502
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:17,100
I know.

1503
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:22,120
And I due to his performance and we're back there's a whole.

1504
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:23,800
Wow we found another one.

1505
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:27,300
Brian Wilson is the surfeit voice.

1506
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:33,700
Gibbons is an animated movie about the creator of rat think and then maybe rat think also in it I guess.

1507
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,380
Because John Goodman is Big Daddy.

1508
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:37,160
Ted Rosnick is rat think.

1509
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:39,640
Dick Smothers is the station wagon.

1510
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:40,480
And what is that.

1511
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:42,560
Which one just died Tom Tom is in it.

1512
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:45,580
Jason this is called the tales of the rat think.

1513
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:50,540
The life and times of famed hot rod and custom car designer Ed Big Daddy Roth.

1514
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:52,920
Wow Jay Leno.

1515
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:55,320
It's still listed as a documentary.

1516
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,880
I wonder if this kind of goes maybe this is kind of a.

1517
01:10:58,060 --> 01:10:59,360
This is playing with the form I think.

1518
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:00,560
Yeah yeah yeah.

1519
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:01,560
A genre list.

1520
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,420
Yeah very daring kind of an art film maybe.

1521
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:08,180
All right well again we're going to have we're going through all of I don't I already don't

1522
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:11,920
remember the we're back character but we got to talk about flamethrower we got to talk about Jay

1523
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,900
Limo there's so much to.

1524
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:19,440
You can rent tales of the rat think on Apple TV or Amazon.

1525
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,300
All right news.

1526
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,740
Well done done.

1527
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:26,600
Okay Jay Leno's acting career coming suggested for Club 3 if you will.

1528
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,640
We're going to do it either way.

1529
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:28,960
You know what maybe don't waste your vote.

1530
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,240
Don't we'll be doing it.

1531
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:31,440
You know us we'll be doing it.

1532
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,160
Wow all right.

1533
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,980
Well there's so much just seeing the word rat think.

1534
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:36,860
Yeah.

1535
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,700
I'm just I'm just glad we made it to this website just for that.

1536
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:49,100
But anyway I mean like I do think that these ultimately were pretty like calm.

1537
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:55,540
It maybe got a little more not rowdy necessarily but like it was a bigger they started doing it

1538
01:11:55,540 --> 01:12:00,160
every week but I think these were just like kind of friendly nice celebrations of a fun ride.

1539
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:03,560
They even got friendly with a guy they called Dave the fantasy land manager.

1540
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:03,940
Yes.

1541
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:08,720
Was sympathetic to the cause who was like it probably was like I'm gonna let you do it

1542
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:09,360
because I like Mr.

1543
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:09,900
Toad too.

1544
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,040
Yeah sure.

1545
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,620
I think they got a lot of cast members support because it's Mr.

1546
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:13,820
Toad.

1547
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:13,980
Mr.

1548
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:14,540
Toad is great.

1549
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:18,900
That way the poo ride is fine but it doesn't have the spark.

1550
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:21,040
It's not like it's not a it's not a hit.

1551
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:24,200
It's just like a ride that like fills a need right.

1552
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:27,020
Yeah and that's American poo rides in general.

1553
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:27,880
That's the.

1554
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:29,240
Yeah everything but Japan.

1555
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,140
But I know absolutely.

1556
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:37,060
But the last day I think gets a little a little crazier

1557
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:44,380
because they get there and they get the good the map the guidebook out and it says in that spot many

1558
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:45,920
adventures of Winnie the Pooh coming.

1559
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:47,540
It doesn't even say Mr.

1560
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:47,940
Toad.

1561
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:48,260
Yeah.

1562
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:52,180
As they say the vultures couldn't even wait until the body was cold.

1563
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:54,620
Hell it was still alive and well.

1564
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:56,140
That is a little crazy.

1565
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:57,380
That's pretty grim.

1566
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:00,440
Yeah they're never going to make that mistake again either I don't think.

1567
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:03,560
No because now they really I think they tested the waters here and they know there's money to

1568
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:04,780
be made in like a goodbye.

1569
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:05,760
Yes.

1570
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,380
It's a farewell.

1571
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:07,960
Celebrate.

1572
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:08,560
Yeah yeah.

1573
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:14,440
Dave the fantasy land manager wasn't there but he said he expressed his condolences and he said he

1574
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:20,700
told told everybody to be good and they were incentivized to there were a lot of news outlets

1575
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:21,880
on the final day.

1576
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,760
Here's an example this is the kind of this is what they would encounter.

1577
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:30,260
They were selling t-shirts and an employee walked up and said you know that's illegal right.

1578
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:33,920
And they said yeah we know and they said well okay.

1579
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,620
And that was the end of that.

1580
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,040
I think this is just an awkward.

1581
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:38,640
Yeah.

1582
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:43,020
Disney just let it happen because they didn't know what what to do and it wasn't actually

1583
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:47,760
that violent or and they probably like sussed out like all right I see these types.

1584
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:53,920
These are internet guys I think were and at that time internet guys didn't have to be

1585
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:54,360
feared.

1586
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,460
Yeah yeah yeah.

1587
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:55,960
Today.

1588
01:13:56,140 --> 01:14:01,580
I think they said like cast members like we were worried you were going to like lay on the track.

1589
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,540
Yes I saw that.

1590
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:03,540
Right.

1591
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,120
Cuff themselves.

1592
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:11,640
Yeah they're pretty hard like after a few of these quote unquote toad ins some of which

1593
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:19,660
were unofficial the website guy said so because he just like yeah he went with a couple buddies

1594
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:22,240
and wrote it with the t-shirts on.

1595
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,860
It's really funny like a toad in is what does toad mean.

1596
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:29,940
Ah means we go ride the ride and stand around outside for a while.

1597
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:32,380
Do you like you stay in it for one that you can't.

1598
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:32,960
No no.

1599
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,700
The lines you want ultimately so.

1600
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,160
I want other people to enjoy it so.

1601
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:39,120
No they let us ride twice sometimes in this slow.

1602
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,440
Yeah yeah yeah.

1603
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:45,940
Well let's look this is like an interesting little movement and it made I made us think about you

1604
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:50,300
know rides we wouldn't want to close and whatever but are you also but once you actually looked into

1605
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:57,420
it aren't you like well I mean what what we want here let's be honest is the January 6th of

1606
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:58,980
ride closures.

1607
01:14:59,940 --> 01:15:06,220
I would say yes if you're saying you want the toad in people to go and like take the cars off the

1608
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:08,280
tracks and drive them around Disneyland.

1609
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,300
Oh now we're cooking yeah yeah yeah.

1610
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:11,780
That is more effective.

1611
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:16,720
They like jerry-rig little motors that they know that'll make it work not on a track.

1612
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:17,060
Right.

1613
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:18,260
They like jam those together.

1614
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:20,140
They like.

1615
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:20,380
Right.

1616
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:28,400
Quickly you know let's do it safely let's let's just like give the employees like a you know like a

1617
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:33,940
knockout gas for 10 minutes right so they can get in there right commandeer those vehicles.

1618
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:38,480
Start driving them around like why are there a bunch of why are there Mr.

1619
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:39,420
Toad vehicles in

1620
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:42,880
Frontierland and they're blocking the big thunder track.

1621
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:46,180
The problem is these people have too much reverence for it.

1622
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:48,020
To be quiet I don't want to hurt the ride.

1623
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:50,180
But if it's closing you know.

1624
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:51,020
I guess that's true.

1625
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:55,280
This is what they I think they should have gotten it up to the they should have played it cool

1626
01:15:55,280 --> 01:16:00,760
until the moment and like that's the last one and then all of a sudden like we go Joker here.

1627
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:03,420
Yeah well you know what like they should have done they should have brought like

1628
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:09,680
they should have brought like props to imitate the scenes so like big beer glasses and stuff

1629
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:13,720
and they should have gotten out and sort of drinking beer on the ride.

1630
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:14,660
Drinking in the bar.

1631
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:15,760
In the bar.

1632
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:21,360
And then they should have populated the ride with people doing the things that the ride is showing

1633
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:21,660
you.

1634
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:22,960
Oh yeah sure.

1635
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:27,060
And that way you're not destroying things but you're causing a big problem.

1636
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:28,200
Somebody is a devil.

1637
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:29,320
There is a pitchfork.

1638
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:31,340
There's one person who's dressed as a little devil.

1639
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:34,820
It's real it's not a prop it's not from all the way to store.

1640
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:38,820
It's got the John Lovett's devil costume from Saturday Night Live.

1641
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:45,080
They did say on the last ride when it's like the last few rides of the day cast members were

1642
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:52,940
scattered throughout the ride like hiding just to make sure they weren't gonna go like you know.

1643
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,180
Mm hmm.

1644
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:56,420
Like I'm doing this for Mr.

1645
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:58,800
Toad and Jodie Foster like you know.

1646
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:06,100
They were always like a little cautious I think but yeah I wonder how many people you could hide

1647
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:09,840
because it's just although it's Disney World I was gonna say on the Disneyland version

1648
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:15,040
such close quarters it's like I feel like I'd be able to see a person hiding somewhere but maybe.

1649
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:18,940
Not if you dress them in black and they go up on the ceiling and kind of like hit every you know.

1650
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:20,860
Spider-Man it.

1651
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:21,480
Yeah there you go.

1652
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:22,000
Yeah.

1653
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:22,380
Yeah.

1654
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:23,160
That's a good point.

1655
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:24,980
Yes so.

1656
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:25,580
So.

1657
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:31,560
The tea that I would like there to be a tea and on shaman that would be that would be preferable.

1658
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:32,000
Uh huh.

1659
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,740
Somebody in a big amphibious coat.

1660
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:36,760
Bae he's dressed as a badger.

1661
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:37,220
Mm hmm.

1662
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:38,400
Badger on his head maybe.

1663
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,700
Yeah oh that well that might be.

1664
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:40,800
Like a real life badger skin.

1665
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:41,620
Yeah you could keep it furry sure.

1666
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,680
So yeah that would make sense.

1667
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:49,020
You maybe gotta you know if they're tearing the ride apart maybe that's not gonna make the

1668
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:52,200
impact that you gotta hit them where it hurts you gotta go to Cinderella Castle.

1669
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:53,000
I want.

1670
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:53,640
Yeah yeah.

1671
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:57,280
Let's all right well so we'll call him the being on shaman he's he's up.

1672
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,740
You gotta bend as a badger bro.

1673
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:02,740
And he he didn't they take the castle.

1674
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:04,120
That's what that's what I want.

1675
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:06,800
I want all these guys I want the ask me why they're killing Mr.

1676
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:07,120
Toad.

1677
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:09,580
I want them all climbing the castle walls.

1678
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:13,080
And for some reason Michael Eisner was dining in the castle that day.

1679
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:14,720
As he did every day.

1680
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,300
As he did every day in Orlando.

1681
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,460
He fly to Orlando at lunch.

1682
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:20,420
Even though hardcore fans don't know about this it's actually the safest part of the park.

1683
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,080
Cinderella.

1684
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,480
We thought I started.

1685
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:24,140
Get him to the safe house.

1686
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:28,720
Uh huh yeah they had the secret tunnel they had to rush him from Cinderella's Castle to.

1687
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:30,560
They do have the tunnels they have the tunnels.

1688
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:30,940
The tunnels.

1689
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,680
Yeah they're they're prime for a situation like this.

1690
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:38,180
There's an emergency sort of evacuation tunnel from Cinderella's Castle right to the 50s prime

1691
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:43,960
time cafe and then he stayed there drove a car out drove one of the little cars.

1692
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:45,400
Watched some topper and calm down.

1693
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:48,440
Topper's done it again.

1694
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,760
They start calling for the hanging of owl.

1695
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:54,580
Uh huh.

1696
01:18:55,300 --> 01:19:01,200
There was some there in reality they were they people did start chanting Eisner sucks.

1697
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,000
Sure.

1698
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:03,940
And that's why ultimately I have to.

1699
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:05,400
That's why we have to condemn the protests.

1700
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:10,940
We condemn the actions of September 6th or September 7th 1998.

1701
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:16,260
That is not who we are as a people by that I mean Disney fans.

1702
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:18,220
Disneyland weirdos.

1703
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:18,860
Mm hmm.

1704
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,700
We're weird but not that weird.

1705
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:21,380
Yeah yeah.

1706
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:27,100
We are we are we honor the the top chair in the land that being the chairman and CEO of

1707
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:28,000
the Walt Disney Company.

1708
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,740
Mostly because it was Eisner at the time.

1709
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,120
It was happening with JPEG we would have been so into it.

1710
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:34,620
Yeah yeah yeah.

1711
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:36,020
Now with with Eiger.

1712
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:36,520
Mm hmm.

1713
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:41,360
But because of the time of the man the respect we have and have for the man.

1714
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:43,660
We cannot endorse this.

1715
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:46,080
In another world would it have but would it have been us.

1716
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:47,720
Perhaps.

1717
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:49,200
But.

1718
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,760
I would I trusted.

1719
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,600
We would JPEG goes to one of those he goes to one of the showers.

1720
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:56,540
Ah there's a guy in there.

1721
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:57,560
Other shower.

1722
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:03,120
Wait I'm sorry hang on I messed that up is there only one I was thinking of the phrase

1723
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:08,540
double showers but there's only one shower but with but the CEO would do a double shower.

1724
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,460
Well Eiger is the double shower guy.

1725
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:11,900
But he didn't have two showers.

1726
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:15,780
He didn't have two separate showers he would take two showers in the office and Eisner

1727
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:18,600
was the one who installed the shower in the office.

1728
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:23,780
I mean the shower in the office is odd and the double shower days is odd but I didn't

1729
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:27,540
mean to paint that although maybe maybe JPEG was so weird.

1730
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:27,920
It too.

1731
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:30,980
That one hasn't come out yet he had two showers installed.

1732
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:32,880
Why he doesn't care to wash.

1733
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:36,320
Can we do an episode on the shower in the office.

1734
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:39,480
I did used to work for a company where the CEO.

1735
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:40,540
You said you said.

1736
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:41,560
You said it already.

1737
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:46,520
And but the other thing I remembered is that they would often email blast everyone like

1738
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:49,060
hey they can't use their operative.

1739
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:57,760
And that just always makes me laugh thinking about that and then thinking about the Eisner

1740
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:02,980
like the assistants going like love he's out of the office can we use the shower.

1741
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:07,640
And just to get if you get if you find the episodes wrapping up if you feel like telling

1742
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:11,840
a certain story that's fine but just remember it's a suitcase story.

1743
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:17,860
Well I actually don't want to tell that story but I do have a little it's not really related

1744
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:21,680
to the story but it's a Casamigos and then them that I think we need to look into because I was

1745
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:26,380
at the Morrison the restaurant over here in Burbank and there was a special Casamigos

1746
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:32,020
menu or a drink menu and it was curated by a sort of like a drink specialist with a name on it and

1747
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:33,660
I was like who's this.

1748
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:38,420
This is a Casamigos like drink expert and maybe this is the next character in the Casamigos

1749
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:39,260
verse to explore.

1750
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:42,360
The guy who works at the restaurant we have to talk about.

1751
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:43,000
I don't know.

1752
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,720
The Burbank local restaurant.

1753
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:45,500
I don't think.

1754
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:46,180
Localizing.

1755
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:51,540
No I think it's like a Casamigos employee that curated it I could be wrong.

1756
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:52,200
Distribute.

1757
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:56,660
I'll have to look at the menu I took a photo of this I'm glad you brought this up because

1758
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:58,040
I almost forgot about it.

1759
01:21:58,340 --> 01:21:59,480
I'm glad someone's glad I brought it up.

1760
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:03,480
I didn't find this person to have a parasocial relationship with them.

1761
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:08,640
I love pretending I'm friends with a drink programmer.

1762
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:13,780
A drink it would be nice to be friends with a drink programmer.

1763
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:18,880
It's becoming a stretch I feel because Casamigos it's a good tequila.

1764
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:20,620
The tequila's not funny.

1765
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:25,460
Okay cocktails created by Casamigos VP of cocktails, Kristen Clark.

1766
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:31,380
So there's a VP of cocktails which is a fun title you have to admit that's a fun title to

1767
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:31,980
have at a company.

1768
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:33,520
VP of cocktails.

1769
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:34,340
Okay yeah.

1770
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,320
Okay so I'm gonna look into it.

1771
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:41,330
To have a good year's hire but like yeah I guess it's funny at a liquor company too.

1772
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,660
It'd be funny to have it.

1773
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:45,680
If a non-licker company had a VP of cocktails.

1774
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:46,680
Yeah a VP of cocktails.

1775
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:49,500
Not anymore it's not the 60s.

1776
01:22:56,420 --> 01:23:00,940
Can I read a comment on the one of the board the message boards they have here.

1777
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,660
I've killed before and I will kill again.

1778
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:10,940
So they have on the website they just have people like with email comments and they just

1779
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:15,060
list everyone's name and their email so you could still I'm sure some of these emails still work

1780
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:22,700
but I just wanted to read from should I read his name let's just say his email is cloudcity

1781
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:23,540
at rocketmail.

1782
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:28,860
com okay and he just wrote he wrote I know it's over still I cling I don't know where

1783
01:23:28,860 --> 01:23:35,860
I can go the Smiths which is really like it hit him hard and then he wanted he said I just wanted

1784
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:37,840
to thank you all for the work you did on behalf of Mr.

1785
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:39,680
Toad's Wild Ride it was one of the best

1786
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:44,860
rides in the park and I'm sure as you're sure you're all well too too aware that's not maybe

1787
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:50,080
the right sense I only found your website today as I was looking up Disney World info and expectation

1788
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:54,000
of my trip too late I have a vision of myself falling to my knees before the construction

1789
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:00,080
and crying out you bastards a la Charlton Heston Charlton Heston Charlton Heston and Planet of the

1790
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:03,880
Apes I can't read today I was just at Disneyland three months ago and I got to ride Mr.

1791
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:04,280
Toad there

1792
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:07,960
I know it's not the same as having it just a few hours from your home but try to take some solace

1793
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:08,720
in the fact that Mr.

1794
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:14,520
Toad lives on in California and then he leaves us with a quote be fair everyone

1795
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:15,200
wants Mr.

1796
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:23,020
Toad's Wild Ride Brody from Mall Rats I think that sort of sums up how I feel about it

1797
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:26,740
Wow the first mention of California Mr.

1798
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:30,160
Toad and also somehow the first mention of a Mall Rats

1799
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:36,100
dialogue line of the from this year you mean or for today oh on that website okay like I

1800
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:37,440
you would think because they say Mr.

1801
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:40,480
Toad yeah yeah yeah just the vibe of it you think you would have

1802
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:47,280
seen both of those things a lot sooner as with every new year on the podcast I fear how much

1803
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:52,600
Kevin Smith content there will be hmm that there's never a plan for the Kevin Smith content it just

1804
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:57,020
comes up I swear there's not this year I'm targeting Billy Corgan to be on the show

1805
01:24:57,020 --> 01:25:01,540
focus the energies and that's why I think that VP of Cocktails is just going to distract you from

1806
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:06,500
the Corgan you might be right all projects aside besides you might be right yeah I think that's how

1807
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:11,480
it's got to be yeah uh and I think we made it you survived podcast the ride thanks for subscribing

1808
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:18,440
to club three your bravery saved the podcast well done freedom fighters and as always keep the

1809
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:25,840
save toad movement in your heart be inspired by it by the the well not the ability to create change

1810
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:30,900
because it didn't but 50 people all had fun together that's something we've made happen

1811
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:36,040
from time to time in our alright I think we can boast that I think we've equaled the save toad

1812
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:42,080
movement so remember that you always have the possibility to get a bunch of other theme park

1813
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:47,420
loving people from the internet together for something that doesn't get out of hand and with

1814
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:52,920
that as always there is there's movements every month here on club three we need four more topics

1815
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:59,000
I do wish good good luck to the mass magician I don't necessarily endorse the mass magician

1816
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:04,460
specifically because something else might we might fall in love with but uh I don't know now I'm just

1817
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:13,300
picturing the mass magician flying as that superman song plays the tragic more than a bird oh five

1818
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:18,220
fighting Superman not three doors down Superman yeah yeah yeah yeah no the sadder again I think

1819
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:24,300
all of these will probably be discussed many times here in 2020 or 2024 oh yeah well and we'll see

1820
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:30,860
it's a five for fighting year 2024 I just can't feel it no three doors down all five for fighting

1821
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:37,160
you think 2025 because it says five no you're actually wrong that's where it's unexpected in

1822
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:37,480
that way
