1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,240
Warning, the following podcast features a stumbling man on fire, horsey clip-clop foley

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,040
sounds, and a rowdy foul-mouthed bear we lovingly refer to simply as Ted.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:23,000
Carl Tart joins us to talk the Universal Studios special effects show today on Podcast The Ride.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,120
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the podcast about theme parks that's more fun than a live broadcast

7
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,920
of Harry and the Hendersons.

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm Scott Gairdner joined by Mike Carlson.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah, that's true.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's way better.

11
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,560
I often think about like going back in time and like going to these old like tapings,

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,440
these TV tapings and they seem like super fun but I think it's just because it's like

13
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
nostalgia brain.

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,340
Because like I imagine like Alf, going back and seeing a live Alf would be like going

15
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,080
to see the Rolling Stones in their prime.

16
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,120
Potentially except like Alf, I don't know that Alf did have an audience because there

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,360
were so many like difficulties with the puppet.

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,520
Everyone hated the puppet is my recollection of reading about it.

19
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,520
I think so, yeah.

20
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,320
The dad like stormed off on day one.

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,240
But I think it was so many like special effects, like Small Wonder didn't have an audience

22
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,320
because there are too many special effects even though there's a laugh track.

23
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,320
Right.

24
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,040
But that being said, the idea of seeing Alf, yes absolutely.

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,440
Jason Sheridan, any show you would like to see taped live?

26
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,560
I feel like three camera sitcom tapings are a nightmare regardless.

27
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,840
Like it's just a play that you just keep seeing the same thing again and again with minor

28
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,840
changes.

29
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,320
But what if Alf was there?

30
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,760
I mean if Alf was there that'd be cool if he was like talking to everyone and hamming

31
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,880
it up and like cursing when he messed up.

32
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,560
But I don't know that that's how it played out.

33
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,840
If they could keep it to an hour then yeah it would probably be fun.

34
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,840
Yeah.

35
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,880
Hey and joining us today, a TV veteran himself from Comedy Bang Bang and The Good Place, Carl

36
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,880
Tartis here.

37
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,880
A TV veteran.

38
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,880
One of the Hollywood elite.

39
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,400
Completely comfortable saying that, yes absolutely.

40
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,160
Man thanks for being here.

41
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
Thanks for having me guys.

42
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,160
Yeah yeah.

43
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,160
This is fun.

44
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,800
When I got the email from Jason I had to break some important news to him that is very important

45
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
to this.

46
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Oh.

47
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Wait what's that?

48
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
What news?

49
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,280
That I'm very afraid of rides.

50
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
Oh.

51
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,280
Right right.

52
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,280
Really?

53
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,280
Yeah.

54
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
Interesting.

55
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,280
Definitely afraid.

56
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,280
You said specifically rollercoasters.

57
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
Rollercoasters yes.

58
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
Yes.

59
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,280
Okay.

60
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
We're sort of in a similar zone.

61
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,640
And anything that moves that I can't control it.

62
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,640
Aligns, airplanes.

63
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,640
Oh really?

64
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
No no no.

65
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,640
I like those things.

66
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,640
I like those things.

67
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,640
I really like commercial flight.

68
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,640
But I don't.

69
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,640
Subways?

70
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
Yeah I'm fine with that.

71
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,640
Okay.

72
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,640
Except when they go through long tunnels.

73
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,640
Yeah.

74
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,640
Uh huh.

75
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,640
I hear that.

76
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,640
Escalators.

77
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,640
It gets dark.

78
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,640
I'm fine with that.

79
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,640
Sure sure sure.

80
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,640
Nothing goes fast.

81
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,640
Adrenaline drops.

82
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,640
I don't like drops.

83
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,640
Okay.

84
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,640
Yeah.

85
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,640
I'm a little, I'm definitely similar.

86
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,680
I've gotten better as I felt like I've had to to even get to go on rides to talk about

87
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,040
them on this podcast.

88
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,720
So it's possible to have growth in this area I can attest.

89
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
But it's hard.

90
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
It's a journey.

91
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
Yeah.

92
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
I understand.

93
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,320
What is the scariest ride you've been on?

94
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,320
Uh.

95
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,160
Like have you been on one and it was like that's it, no more?

96
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
Space Mountain.

97
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,160
Okay.

98
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,160
Yeah.

99
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
Is that kind of a cap?

100
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
That's like as scary as you would imagine.

101
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,120
Yeah that's because I couldn't see anything.

102
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,760
And I just didn't know when the drop was coming.

103
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
I didn't know what was happening.

104
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
Yeah.

105
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,520
And there's also one in, there's this park in the Netherlands called.

106
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
Efteling?

107
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,520
Efteling.

108
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,520
The Efteling.

109
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
Yeah.

110
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,520
Yeah.

111
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,200
And there's a ride there called Fanta Morgana.

112
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,320
And it's like, it's like Space Mountain but it's like outside it's just a big ass bird.

113
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,320
Whoa.

114
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,240
And like so you don't know what it's about.

115
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,840
It's just like this park is like, it's like what Disneyland was based off of or something

116
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,840
like that.

117
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:22,880
Like Walt Disney went there and so like and so that ride, some of my coworkers who we

118
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,720
went with forced me to get on it.

119
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,720
Like it's fine.

120
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,640
You're not going to be scared of it.

121
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,640
Jim Woods actually forced me to get on it.

122
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
Oh yeah.

123
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,960
That's not a good idea to listen to anything he says.

124
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,640
And I was like I don't want to get on it.

125
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
I don't want to get on it.

126
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,640
And I was so mad after.

127
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,640
I told you.

128
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,640
I told you I didn't want to get on it.

129
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,640
Like he made me.

130
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,920
And they were like it's not that scary.

131
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,920
I'm like don't tell me.

132
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
Don't give me.

133
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,960
Don't tell me what I'm afraid of and what I'm not afraid of.

134
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,960
Right.

135
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,960
Yeah.

136
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,960
I don't.

137
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,840
I have never appreciated like the pranking or the leaving out information about how scary

138
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,120
it is or get like getting laughed at.

139
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,240
That's what I don't want.

140
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,400
I want like support if I'm going to get on a roller coaster from an overcome fear.

141
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,080
You want everyone like cheering your name beforehand as opposed to be like you loser

142
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,080
get on the ride.

143
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,080
Yeah.

144
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,080
Yeah.

145
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,080
Yeah.

146
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
Laughing at my picture.

147
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
That's the worst.

148
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,640
After what's the Pirates of the Caribbean.

149
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,640
Because at the end it goes up.

150
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,640
And then you're like don't you.

151
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,640
Oh my God.

152
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Don't you drop.

153
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,640
Please don't drop.

154
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,640
And it just goes straight.

155
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,640
There's nothing.

156
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,640
There's nothing at the end of that.

157
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,960
And I'm sure when they like took the picture I'm like and everybody else is like having

158
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
a great time.

159
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,560
I'm so relieved to hear this.

160
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,420
I was like a little afraid just of the drop on pirates until not that long ago.

161
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,400
That is like nothing now I realize.

162
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,320
But that's on like a 20 footer.

163
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,320
That's barely anything.

164
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
Yeah.

165
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
And you can see the whole thing.

166
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Yeah.

167
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
And thank God.

168
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,040
I'm glad I'm not the only one.

169
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,120
Jurassic Park is probably the next scariest because of that only because of the drop.

170
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,320
Everything else is wack about that ride.

171
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,200
But that drop is so like heavy.

172
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
It's so forceful.

173
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Yeah.

174
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,200
It's just like this big.

175
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
It's the worst.

176
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
It was very industrial.

177
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,240
You're in this like that building is just this cavernous.

178
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,600
You're just looking at pipes and everything.

179
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,040
It's like you're reliving like a traumatic memory.

180
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,520
It is how I feel.

181
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,680
It's steep though.

182
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,120
Jurassic Park is very steep.

183
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,720
Like that's a really steep drop.

184
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
Built into a mountain.

185
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
Yeah.

186
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,840
The drop I've gotten a little more used to now that I've gone on it more.

187
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,040
But the dinosaur still does scare me.

188
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,520
If I'm in the front row and the dinosaur comes at me it's too real.

189
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,520
It's pretty close.

190
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,520
Yeah.

191
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,880
It's pretty close.

192
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,880
It's big.

193
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,880
It's large.

194
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
Which is what we're talking about.

195
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,880
It's kind of a surprise when this thing's out.

196
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,320
I usually look at that dinosaur and go, shut up!

197
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,960
We about to drop!

198
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
Let me focus.

199
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,960
I don't care about you.

200
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,960
I'll get to you later.

201
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,080
You're going to be away from him in three seconds.

202
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,480
There's no problem there.

203
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,680
So do you go to these places and enjoy yourself at all?

204
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Yeah.

205
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,680
Because they have great food.

206
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,680
Sure.

207
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,320
I really enjoy a good theme park funnel cake.

208
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,320
Yeah.

209
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,320
Sure.

210
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,440
When I was growing up and would go to Universal and stuff like that I would like to do Doc

211
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
Brown's Chicken.

212
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
Oh yeah.

213
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,440
Yes.

214
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,360
At one point in time that was pretty great.

215
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,120
I think that quality lapsed as time went on.

216
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,800
I feel like I did it in 2006 and it was garbage.

217
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
It was bad.

218
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
I think so.

219
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,720
But in the 90s I think it was a quality project.

220
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Yeah.

221
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
It was good.

222
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
I enjoyed it.

223
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,600
They use the same fried chicken recipe apparently now in the Cletus' Chicken Shack in the Simpson's

224
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Chicken restaurant.

225
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Yeah.

226
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,160
So apparently it's like the same chicken or at least the 2006 chicken has been moved over

227
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,160
to Cletus.

228
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,160
2006.

229
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,840
They probably changed it like to just I think they just changed it like tenders at a certain

230
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,840
point as opposed to when I first started going there like in the 90s it was like you get

231
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,400
like a leg and a thigh.

232
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Sure.

233
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Yes.

234
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,680
I'm a little bothered or distracted by the question of why is Doc Brown operating a fried

235
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,680
chicken stand.

236
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,160
Oh I did not care at all.

237
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,800
I thought it was great.

238
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,680
The marketing on that got me as a kid.

239
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,760
The first time we ever went I was like oh I got to eat some Doc Brown's Chicken.

240
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,280
I never seen him make no chicken in those movies.

241
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,320
I don't think he cooked anything in the movies.

242
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
I don't think he eats.

243
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,320
I don't think you ever see him eat.

244
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,320
Yeah.

245
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
He never eats in the movies.

246
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,560
He has a breakfast machine but.

247
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,720
That's true.

248
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,920
One is for the dog and you don't see him eat the other one.

249
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,920
The other one is for iced tea.

250
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
Right.

251
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,920
Yeah.

252
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,360
And then it's clearly not him in the pictures at the restaurant.

253
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,400
It's obviously not Christopher Lloyd.

254
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
Yeah.

255
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,400
It's like an actor.

256
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
Oh it's the walk around.

257
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,800
Yeah it's the walk around Christopher Lloyd in like different places eating chicken.

258
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,160
He's time traveling but also making and eating chicken.

259
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
That's pretty tight.

260
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,640
You can't be mad at it.

261
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,560
He's a scientist so he'd probably be able to concoct a good recipe.

262
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
Right.

263
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
Yeah.

264
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,400
I would assume all scientists are good cooks.

265
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
Every single one.

266
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
Every scientist.

267
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Like a chemist specifically.

268
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Yeah.

269
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,280
I had a chemistry teacher in high school who was like trying to make a point that cooking

270
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:18,440
and chemistry were very similar and like gave us the chemical, gave us ingredients and gave

271
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,080
us the chemical component.

272
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:26,720
He was like, wouldn't tell us what we were making but there was like a bag of sugar and

273
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,920
a pile of peanuts and it's like you clearly have us making peanut brittle.

274
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
Yeah.

275
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,800
We are all not good enough to know the like chemical name for like sugar and baking soda.

276
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,880
So we all just made mismatched peanut, like bad peanut brittle.

277
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,200
Because he was trying to prove a point.

278
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,240
But he didn't say what it was until it was done.

279
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:53,480
Well he said like the amounts of each like ingredient but it would be like sodium bosphorate.

280
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,040
Like you know the quarter cup of this.

281
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:04,200
And it's like I don't, this is going to be like either the saltiest or sweetest peanut brittle.

282
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,680
Have you made peanut brittle since?

283
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,680
No.

284
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
Okay.

285
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,680
I barely made it that day.

286
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,680
Peanut brittle.

287
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,400
What an old person's candy.

288
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Yeah.

289
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,440
Like is that even going to like be around at the end of the century?

290
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,320
Will it last?

291
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,400
When I was at, when I was home for Christmas some like old family member made like pecan

292
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
brittle almost.

293
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,240
Like pecan candy was just, pecans in melted sugar and butter like in hardened and it was

294
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,040
just like even, just like the texture of it was like I can't get through this.

295
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,040
It's too sweet.

296
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,040
Yeah.

297
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,280
You're not supposed to be eating a lot of this at all.

298
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,400
Like it's the worst ingredients.

299
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
Yeah.

300
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,200
Like I have a huge sweet tooth and I was like I can't even do it.

301
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Right, right.

302
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,720
Like a butterscotch or a toffee it's like such like hardcore concentrated sweetness.

303
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
Almost too much.

304
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
Yeah.

305
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,920
There was, this is only tangentially related.

306
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:03,120
You would see like on TV like I'm trying to think, I think it was Honey Boo Boo or something.

307
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,080
They would just be like making lemonade and the lemonade had so much sugar in it and it's

308
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,320
like I think it's like you could just get used to your taste buds, get used to sugar

309
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,440
and get desensitized to it at that point to like where you have like you have butterscotch.

310
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,960
Like it's too much unless you're like used to eating like an insane amount of sugar.

311
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,920
I feel like I can't, I can't even do it.

312
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,200
And again, I like treats.

313
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
I like sweets.

314
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,200
Love a good treat.

315
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Yeah.

316
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Yeah.

317
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Or treats and sweets, different things.

318
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Let me think.

319
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,040
Yes, because I think a treat doesn't have to be food.

320
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,040
Uh huh.

321
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,040
A sweet is.

322
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,920
It's a little gift you give to yourself.

323
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,920
Yeah.

324
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,520
Or you receive from someone else, I suppose.

325
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,120
A treat could be like a 15 minute nap.

326
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,120
Yeah.

327
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
Oh, treats can be non-food.

328
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
That's right.

329
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,120
That's like a dollop of porn.

330
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,120
Watch a little bit of titty swinging.

331
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,120
I've done my work for the day.

332
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
Just a little treat.

333
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
Just a morsel.

334
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,120
I deserve it.

335
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,120
Just a little.

336
00:11:52,120 --> 00:12:06,040
It sounds so wholesome honestly when you say it's just a little treat.

337
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,040
It's not dirty.

338
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,040
It's not bad.

339
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,560
It's a little bit of pornography.

340
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,560
That's delightful.

341
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,560
Yes.

342
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,680
Okay, so you were like a Universal kid.

343
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,240
You grew up sort of in the area.

344
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,240
Yeah.

345
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,200
I don't know if that was like the home base park.

346
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,720
Well, here's why I became the home base park, because my mom was a studio tour guide.

347
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
What?

348
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
Wow.

349
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,720
Really?

350
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
I did this job.

351
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
I was a tour guide.

352
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,720
You did that job?

353
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
Yes.

354
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,720
You got the big binder?

355
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
I still have the big binder.

356
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
In the Universal story?

357
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,720
Wait, the Universal story.

358
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,400
Wait, the Universal story.

359
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,400
Is that like a tape or a video?

360
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,840
It was a video tape with my mom.

361
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:46,400
She started in 2002 when I was in seventh grade.

362
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,820
Maybe even earlier than that.

363
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,600
Maybe like 2000 she started.

364
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
I was like fifth grade maybe.

365
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,000
Me and my friends would go.

366
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
She's single mom.

367
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,980
So on the weekends, to keep me from not being in the house all day while she was at work,

368
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,200
she would just bring us with her.

369
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,560
She'd be like, all right, grab a friend.

370
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,560
I'd take my best friend Russell or my best friend Jovon and we would just go to Universal.

371
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,320
She'd have to sneak us in because you're not allowed to do that.

372
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
Sure.

373
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,480
Just bring kids all the time.

374
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,480
It was really easy to go through her employment entrance.

375
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,480
There was a gate.

376
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,960
I think it's definitely closed off now.

377
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,920
But back then it was just like, oh, you just come through this gate and just go, all right.

378
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,720
We would get there and she would go, okay, go in.

379
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,920
We just run off to where she didn't look like she saw us in case there was a camera looking

380
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,920
or something like that.

381
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,720
And we just hang out at Universal all day.

382
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
Like constantly?

383
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,720
Like once a week?

384
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,720
Yeah, like on Saturdays.

385
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,720
Geez.

386
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,720
That's awesome.

387
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,720
Yeah.

388
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,960
And in the summertime probably a couple more times.

389
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,960
Yeah.

390
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
Sure.

391
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
Wow.

392
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
And you love that every time?

393
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
You didn't get sick?

394
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
You didn't run out of stuff?

395
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
I got tired of it.

396
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,960
I got tired.

397
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I got to be like, mom, can I please just stay home?

398
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't want to go to this theme park every week.

399
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
No way.

400
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Because I don't like, I wouldn't get on anything.

401
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yeah.

402
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So you're left with like, you know, you could play Flintstones carnival games or.

403
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yeah.

404
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,440
I would do all of the other attractions.

405
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,000
I really enjoyed the studio tour, no matter who was giving it.

406
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It didn't have to be my mom.

407
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I was embarrassed when my mom did it.

408
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I used to try to avoid her tour.

409
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
But she probably wanted you to do it, right?

410
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
She wanted me to see it.

411
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Did she involve you ever?

412
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
She would.

413
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,040
She would.

414
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,040
And then we'd be like, oh, God.

415
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,040
Oh, yeah, that's mortifying.

416
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,040
It's like when my mom's substitute taught one of my music classes in elementary school.

417
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,040
Like, your mom's the teacher now.

418
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,040
Oh, yeah.

419
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
It feels like it would be the same sort of dynamic.

420
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,040
Are you from a small town?

421
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,040
Not that small.

422
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,040
Yeah.

423
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,040
I mean, no, it's just like it happened once.

424
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,040
She would purposely not take classes that I was, like, she would not sub for a class

425
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,040
in general, but she was a music teacher at our school once.

426
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,040
So it was inevitable when we had the hour of music.

427
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
Sure, sure, sure.

428
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,080
That I had it.

429
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,080
That's dope.

430
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,080
That's dope your mom would avoid your class.

431
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,080
My mom would be so stoked to teach a class of mine just to embarrass me.

432
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,080
Right.

433
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,080
And I wasn't like a bad kid.

434
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,080
I had behavioral issues, but I talked way too much.

435
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
Sure.

436
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,080
I was a rabble rouser.

437
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,080
Right, right.

438
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,080
Yeah.

439
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,080
Would she like, what is embarrassing you?

440
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:27,080
Would she like say like, that's my Will Carl or something or pinch the cheeks?

441
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,120
No, like, are you talking about on the ride?

442
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,120
Or anywhere or any?

443
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,120
What's your nature of embarrassment?

444
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,120
No, she would try to like, kind of like flex nuts, like be like, get me, like be mad at

445
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,120
me.

446
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
Oh, yeah.

447
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,120
Like, I'm the parent.

448
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,120
Right.

449
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,120
It's like, you don't even act like that.

450
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,120
Like, we don't have this relationship.

451
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
This is false.

452
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,120
I don't have that.

453
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,120
I don't have behavioral issues like that, like where you need to like discipline me so

454
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,120
hard and let everybody know like, I'm in charge.

455
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,120
Yeah.

456
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,160
It was like performative.

457
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,160
It was very performative.

458
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,160
Yeah, yeah.

459
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,160
I mean, she's an actor.

460
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,160
Sure.

461
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,160
So it's performing like, and one time I skipped out on piano.

462
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,160
I took piano classes at recreation center, like at a park, and all my friends were at

463
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,160
the park too, and they were all playing basketball.

464
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,160
And I'm a big basketball player and I was like, I'm going to keep playing basketball.

465
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,160
I'm not going to piano today.

466
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,160
I was like 13, 14.

467
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,160
I'm not going.

468
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
I'm not going.

469
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,160
I'm going late.

470
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,200
I used to try to like, because the classes would kind of run late.

471
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:31,200
They were like beginning at beginners three to four, intermediate four to five, and advanced

472
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
like five to seven.

473
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
We had the longer class.

474
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,200
And so I, and, but the classes would run kind of late and I would always be like, all right,

475
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
it's five o'clock.

476
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
I'm in the middle of a game.

477
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,200
They're not going to stop me in the middle of a game.

478
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Like the gym's literally right next door to the multipurpose room.

479
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,200
And then my piano teacher would like come out and like kind of like hold his hands like

480
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,200
this, like, you know, like cross his arms and go.

481
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,200
And I go, ah, fuck off.

482
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,240
Fuck off.

483
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,240
I wouldn't say that to him.

484
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,240
But like, and then one day my mom just walked in and just like snatched me off the court

485
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,240
mid game and like tossed me up against the wall just to like make all my friends go,

486
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
ooh, I'm like, you don't even, what are you doing?

487
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,240
You don't do this.

488
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
You don't act like this.

489
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,240
The movie's bullshit.

490
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,240
Yeah.

491
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,240
She just wanted to, she was a big fan of like, she, I think she like thinks that that's what

492
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,240
parents should do is like embarrass their kids in front of everybody so they don't get

493
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,280
too out of line.

494
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
Right.

495
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,280
Full of themselves.

496
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,280
Make an example.

497
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
Yeah.

498
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
Yeah.

499
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,280
My mom would not do it.

500
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,280
She would just show up everywhere else for like, she would volunteer for every field

501
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,280
trip.

502
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,280
Yeah.

503
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,280
And she would just be like, I'm around.

504
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,280
And she wasn't trying to do that, but she was doing that, which is what my dad would

505
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,280
do when you'd watch me play sports.

506
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,280
He would just like hover arms cross and hover.

507
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,280
And I'd just be like, God, go away.

508
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,320
Too much pressure.

509
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,320
So were you then not good at sports for that reason?

510
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,320
Yeah, for that reason.

511
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,320
For that, only that reason.

512
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,320
And really what I'm talking about is playing tennis in high school.

513
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,320
That's what I'm saying.

514
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
Sports.

515
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
His arm crossing.

516
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
Really nuts up your back swing.

517
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
Yeah.

518
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
My sister, I drove my sister nuts too.

519
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,320
Sure, sure.

520
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,320
It's really in my head now.

521
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,320
Did I, was she still doing that in 2006 when I, when I started?

522
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,320
No.

523
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,320
Okay.

524
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
So I didn't cross that already.

525
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,320
She stopped in like 04.

526
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,360
Okay, okay.

527
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,360
I think that's when I asked.

528
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
Uh huh, uh huh.

529
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
How was her tour?

530
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
It was great.

531
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,360
She's very, she's good at that.

532
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
She was good at that.

533
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
Right, right.

534
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,360
Honestly, like she's good at it.

535
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
We used to watch that.

536
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,360
I used to help her study the lines from the binder.

537
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
It was such a huge binder.

538
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,360
Y'all had to memorize so much.

539
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,360
Yes.

540
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,360
Yeah, yeah.

541
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,360
And then all these clips, you have to, you have to memorize the numbers to know what

542
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,360
to pull up.

543
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,360
Oh yeah, y'all have to do all that manually.

544
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
Yeah.

545
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,360
Yeah, yeah.

546
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
Yeah.

547
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,360
It is so, it's like, it takes up a ton of space in my place still.

548
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,400
I don't know why I don't get rid of it, except there's probably some podcast, The Ride Function,

549
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
Yeah, yeah.

550
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,400
At some point.

551
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,400
But then there's all this trivia you got to learn, like just in case you get stuck for

552
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
a long time.

553
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Yeah.

554
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,400
Yeah, like you can just like read a list of who won Oscars for Universal Movies, which

555
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:10,400
I'm sure the audience would love just going through in, in 1952, uh, on the waterfront.

556
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Everyone's, yeah.

557
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
It was super interesting, honestly.

558
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:18,000
It was just the history of the film stuff, like from Carl Lamley, like all that stuff

559
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,520
on how he started the place and how, how it's operated and haunted stage 13 or stage 27

560
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,520
or what?

561
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,520
Yeah, I think it's 27.

562
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,520
The Phantom of the Opera?

563
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,520
The Phantom of the Opera stage.

564
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

565
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
It's haunted.

566
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,520
You know what I always say?

567
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,400
Like I almost memorized the damn thing myself.

568
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,200
And the Universal story is super interesting, like movie.

569
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,320
I would try, I sleep with the TV on, but I need something like consistent.

570
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,720
Every night I watch like Family Guy.

571
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,720
Sure.

572
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
Because I know it's going to be funny.

573
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,800
I'm going to go to sleep with good energy and just turn that on, like my DVR so it plays

574
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,360
all the episodes and then the TV will turn off after a certain point.

575
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,200
But, uh, I used to watch that, that Universal story every night.

576
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,860
Wait, so you got a tape that like, that, that like helped her learn the history and study

577
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,860
and everything.

578
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,000
She had to know this whole.

579
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah.

580
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,880
It's like Ron Howard and it's just clips from all those movies.

581
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,080
Is that the one they used to sell as a souvenir?

582
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,080
Maybe.

583
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,080
The Robert Forsythe?

584
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,080
Is that his name?

585
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,080
Maybe not.

586
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,160
If it's Ron Howard, this could be a different one.

587
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
Oh, okay.

588
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
This is maybe an internal tape.

589
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,160
Yeah.

590
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,160
Ron Howard, yeah, Ron Howard will maybe be internal, yeah.

591
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,760
Yeah, it's an internal, yeah.

592
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,400
It's like the Chuck E. Cheese, like how to play the character videos that are online now

593
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,520
that were internal videos that you're not supposed, like the public's not supposed to

594
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,520
see.

595
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,520
Yeah.

596
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,520
They want you to know.

597
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,520
Ron Howard's telling you the secrets.

598
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,520
Oh, sure.

599
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,520
Yeah.

600
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,040
There's one that I found a couple years ago.

601
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,840
Well, no, when we were in like high school that somebody posted it.

602
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:47,040
It was Hot Drinks, the Hot Drinks tutorial for Wendy's.

603
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,480
I'm a huge Hot Drinks fan.

604
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,480
I did a bit.

605
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,800
I did a song like for Atlantic City once.

606
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
Oh, really?

607
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
It's such a funny video.

608
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
Yeah.

609
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Yeah.

610
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,800
And like, where coffee reaches the line.

611
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
It's an instruction.

612
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,160
It's a Wendy's instructional video about making coffee and hot chocolate and other hot drinks.

613
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,000
And the song is so much better than it has any right to be.

614
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
The song is good.

615
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Cha cha.

616
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Cha cha.

617
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Ow!

618
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's like Michael Jackson.

619
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's really Michael Jackson-y.

620
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Coffee decaf for tea and hot chocolate.

621
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Coffee, let it sit.

622
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The stretching of the words to make it rhyme with other words.

623
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

624
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And hot chocolate.

625
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Chocolate.

626
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
What's the part I like a lot?

627
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,160
The lemon on the top.

628
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,160
Very nice, give your guests a juicy slice.

629
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,160
Hot drinks really get you going.

630
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,160
Blow.

631
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,160
He like blows the top.

632
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,160
Rhythmically blows the top of the hydrant.

633
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,160
There's so much attitude in it when he blows and then turns back to you.

634
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,160
He's like really working that camera.

635
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,160
Played at your wedding.

636
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,160
Played at my wedding.

637
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,160
Yeah.

638
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,160
Because it was a big thing at Funny or Die, and it was my dream to have a party where

639
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,160
that came on.

640
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,160
We said to the Funny or Die people, why won't you play this at your parties?

641
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,160
We'd all love it, and they wouldn't listen.

642
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,160
So the wedding, this is my chance, and the DJ fought it.

643
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,160
He's like, well, you might not understand at weddings.

644
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,160
It's got to be something grandma can dance to.

645
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,160
And I'm like, trust me, Hot Drinks is going to blow up this dance floor.

646
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,160
And it did, and he segued it into Erotic City.

647
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,160
That's pretty good.

648
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,160
And that was the best moment of the wedding by far.

649
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,160
The Hot Drinks, Erotic City mega mix.

650
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,160
That's pretty tight.

651
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,160
It was really good.

652
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,160
There are other videos in that series, right?

653
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,160
Is there a chili video or a cold drink?

654
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,160
There's a cold drink that I don't think is as good.

655
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,160
Well, there's like the blonde girl, and she's like rapping to one.

656
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:46,160
Her song is like based off of like Paula Abdul's Straight Up.

657
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,160
That's kind of like the beat is more...

658
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,160
She's like rapping about something.

659
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,160
That might be the chili one, honestly.

660
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,160
There's fingers in the chili, isn't it?

661
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,160
No.

662
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:04,160
I think they do talk about like any crusty bits on the grill, like put it in the chili.

663
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,160
Oh, no.

664
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,160
That is like a Wendy's thing.

665
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,160
Little bits of cheese.

666
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,160
They take things off the grill and throw it in.

667
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,160
They used to at least.

668
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,160
I have never ordered a Hot Drink at a Wendy's.

669
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,160
I got to be honest.

670
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,160
Me neither.

671
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,160
I love my fast food, but if I go, I'm not like...

672
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
Or McDonald's.

673
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,160
I'll get McDonald's coffee.

674
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,160
When they changed their coffee, it was like, yeah, that's all right.

675
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,160
They changed it?

676
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,160
Or after they burned that lady?

677
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,160
When they rolled out like the full McCafe.

678
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,160
You know why they rolled out the...

679
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,160
When they were like losing so much money to Starbucks.

680
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,160
They were like, okay, we need to make something.

681
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,160
I mean, how can you not get McDonald's coffee?

682
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,160
I don't.

683
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,160
I know how you can't because I don't do it.

684
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,160
But when you walk into a McDonald's at breakfast time, it smells so good.

685
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,160
Oh, it smells great.

686
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,160
Yeah.

687
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,160
Yeah.

688
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,160
I guess Hot Drinks then didn't work on me if I've never done it.

689
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,160
Do you think...

690
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,160
Is it still the juicy slice policy?

691
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,160
How have I never tested this?

692
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,160
I feel like they have their own limit.

693
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,160
You get your own now.

694
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,160
Oh, maybe.

695
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,160
It's like a nasty bucket on the side by the drinks.

696
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,160
You got to get a...

697
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,160
That's a weird area, those side lemons.

698
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,160
I don't trust...

699
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,160
I don't trust...

700
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,160
When someone pointed out that...

701
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,160
How do we know that they're washed?

702
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,160
Why would you just dip outside peel into your drink?

703
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
You don't know where that's been.

704
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,160
Yeah, that is weird.

705
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,160
They do that at Portillo's where it's like they'll give you a lemon, but they just dump a lemon in.

706
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,160
But they bare handed...

707
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,160
You know they bare handed it.

708
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,160
Oh, yeah.

709
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
Yeah.

710
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,160
Did you guys have any friends or did y'all work at fast food places?

711
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:39,160
Or any friends that would say, like, dude, do not eat there.

712
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,160
They do such gross things.

713
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,160
There's gum in the cheese.

714
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,160
It's just like stupid shit like that.

715
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,160
But it's like this has to be a rumor.

716
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,160
How's everybody coming in this stuff?

717
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,160
Yeah, right, right.

718
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,160
Did I have any friends with inside info?

719
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:57,160
My friend worked at Fuddruckers on Gulf Road, but we just got free food.

720
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,160
She didn't talk about cum in the food.

721
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:04,160
My friend worked at In-N-Out and he was like, do not get the pink lemonade.

722
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,160
People wash their hands in the pink lemonade.

723
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:11,160
And I was like, but that seems like a word that seems so sticky.

724
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,160
Yeah.

725
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,160
That doesn't seem smart.

726
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,160
Opposite of the desired effects.

727
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,160
Exactly.

728
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,160
Jokes on them, really.

729
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,160
I've talked about like kid rumors before, I think, on the show where like a kid was like,

730
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:29,160
yeah, there's a naked Marvel comic that Stan Lee drew and he signed his name on the boobs.

731
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,160
And I was like, what?

732
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,160
And I was like, does he draw?

733
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,160
I think he doesn't draw.

734
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,160
They're like, no, he does draw.

735
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,160
And he drew them naked.

736
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,160
I was like, that doesn't make sense.

737
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,160
Never found it?

738
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,160
No.

739
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,160
Never tried to find it?

740
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,160
I tried, yeah.

741
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,160
Sure.

742
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:50,160
At the time I asked around, you heard about this naked Marvel comic that Stan Lee drew?

743
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,160
He doesn't draw.

744
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,160
That's your next podcast.

745
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,160
Trying to figure out where that is.

746
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,160
The naked Marvel comic.

747
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,160
The naked Marvel comic.

748
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,160
The answer had to be out there.

749
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,160
And then lots of, doon, doon, doon, doon, podcast music breaks.

750
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,160
Yeah, it's like a serial or Finding Richard Simmons or whatever.

751
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:10,160
Well, this was the third comic book story that I was forcibly thrown out of.

752
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,160
Stan drew it.

753
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,160
He signed the boobs.

754
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,160
Yow!

755
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,160
I swear.

756
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,160
I have to move to another state now to finish this podcast series.

757
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:29,160
Okay, well, so with your, so with that timeline, if you were going all the time in 2002 or so,

758
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:34,160
now I'm suspecting that your version of this topic of the special effects stages are probably different,

759
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,160
it's probably different than the one I saw the most.

760
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:45,160
If you had to, or your memory of what this show was as you saw it, what was your version of it?

761
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:50,160
It was the Foley, like doing the Foley, which was always great.

762
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,160
Yeah.

763
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,160
Harry and the Hendersons, I believe.

764
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,160
So it was still Harry and the Hendersons.

765
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,160
Yeah.

766
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,160
Okay.

767
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:02,160
And but then later the motion capture with the big wolf man.

768
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
Yeah.

769
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,160
Yeah.

770
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,160
Fluffy.

771
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,160
Fluffy, yeah, yeah, yeah, that would go off the rails.

772
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,160
Yes.

773
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
Yeah, yeah.

774
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,160
And that used to scare me.

775
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,160
Right.

776
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,160
Please don't come to me in the audience.

777
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,160
And it would always, always come to me.

778
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,160
We, well, with, oh, like the, that creature ran right up to you.

779
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,160
Yeah.

780
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,160
When it would get off the, yeah.

781
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,160
Yeah, when it would get off the thing.

782
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,160
Oh, sure.

783
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:27,160
I believe, I want to say later, towards later, the mummy stacking and then the dude gets

784
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,160
electrocuted.

785
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,160
Yeah.

786
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,160
Okay, okay.

787
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,160
The person gets electrocuted and they like disappear into the wall or whatever.

788
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,160
Yeah, right, right.

789
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,160
Okay, so that, yeah, because there were a couple versions of this.

790
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,160
My childhood ones were different.

791
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:45,160
But so this was this show where it's three sound stages and you like move down one at

792
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,160
a time.

793
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,160
Right.

794
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,160
And then in the next 15 minutes you have to like get up and like maintain where your seat

795
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,160
was and walk to the next thing.

796
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:57,160
And this is on the lower lot, the universal where the Transformers riot is now.

797
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:02,160
But generally, yeah, that was the format that it's like a couple of special effects kind

798
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,160
of things and then ending with a sound show.

799
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,160
And now there's still a thing like this, but it's up in the castle theater.

800
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,160
Yeah.

801
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
It's on the upper lot now.

802
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,160
It's a lot more polished now.

803
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:20,160
We were talking a little before we started and like in the 2000s one, it was a lot more

804
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
sticky.

805
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,160
Yeah.

806
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,160
Like it was a lot goofier.

807
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:29,160
There was a lot more topical jabs at like Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton.

808
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,160
Yeah.

809
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,160
And now it's in this giant theater on the upper lot and it's much more grand and elaborate

810
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
about the power of movies.

811
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,160
But we don't want to talk about that.

812
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,160
We want to talk about the trash on the lower lot.

813
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

814
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,160
Let's go through it in order.

815
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,160
So you're saying like I love this thing, by the way.

816
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:53,160
This is like the heart of Universal when it was still exciting to learn how movies were

817
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,160
made.

818
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,160
Absolutely.

819
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,160
Now it's a little more like I think they don't know what to do anymore because it's all the

820
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,160
answer is always computers.

821
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,160
Computers is how we do it.

822
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:06,160
And there's no way to like demonstrate computers in an exciting way.

823
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,160
But these things were awesome.

824
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,160
So you're probably standing outside and they get some volunteers from the audience, kind

825
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:18,160
of a mixed group of there's some kids and some dads to embarrass.

826
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,160
We always talk about those like the great theme park tradition of embarrassing dad,

827
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,160
making him wear a costume that we can laugh at him in.

828
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,160
And the first one, yeah, for a while was The Mummy.

829
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:35,160
My version of it was Back to the Future when I was doing it as a kid.

830
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:40,160
But that had the same thing where it ends in this big electrocution gag where they're

831
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,160
filming the scene.

832
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,160
In that case, it's Doc Brown trying to connect the wires.

833
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,160
I remember that one too.

834
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,160
Right.

835
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,160
Right.

836
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,160
Yeah.

837
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:54,160
And then this but the same format as The Mummy one, which is The Mummy one like somebody's

838
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,160
trapped essentially.

839
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,160
I mean, they're slaves.

840
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,160
They are slaves.

841
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,160
Wonderful.

842
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,160
Cool.

843
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,160
And then like what is there?

844
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,160
Is there a curse?

845
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:09,160
Yeah, it's it's there's there's slaves and one person is stacking bricks, right?

846
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,160
Stacking big bricks to build the pyramids.

847
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:17,160
And the other person is chained up to this to say pyramid and then gets struck by lightning

848
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,160
and disintegrates.

849
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,160
Yes.

850
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
OK.

851
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,160
And just turns it and then into a skeleton.

852
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,160
Yes.

853
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,160
Yeah.

854
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,160
Which is this is I loved this kind of thing as a kid.

855
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:32,160
The cleverness of all the lights go out comes back on and a turntables clearly happened.

856
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,160
And now it's this charred not unlike the great movie.

857
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,160
Yes.

858
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,160
It's like similar gag in that.

859
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,160
I'm trying to OK.

860
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:44,160
Did you guys see the show or were you like was this before you were out here?

861
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,160
I was at Universal.

862
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,160
I don't even know that I knew this existed.

863
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:53,160
I did backdraft down there, but I don't even think I did because it moved it moved in 2010.

864
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,160
Mm hmm.

865
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,160
So I probably went for the first time in like 2009.

866
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,160
So the later version.

867
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,160
Oh, you might have seen the original.

868
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,160
So I don't think I'm just saying I don't think I saw it down when it was in the lower left.

869
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,160
I saw it a bunch on the lower level.

870
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:17,160
When I was first out here for a semester in college, like the very first time I went to Universal was like Labor Day weekend of 2006.

871
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,160
It was packed.

872
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,160
And like this was thankful.

873
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,160
I mean, we got everything done, but it was like it was so hot and it was so crowded.

874
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,160
I worked then.

875
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,160
If everyone was passing it was like there were like medical emergencies.

876
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,160
A lot of them.

877
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,160
I remember that.

878
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,160
They had the misters around.

879
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,160
Oh, yeah, they got it.

880
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,160
And that Curious George that like Splash Zone.

881
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,160
Did you do that?

882
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,160
Was that around for your childhood entertainment?

883
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:43,160
The Splash Zone at the bottom of at the bottom of Jurassic Park.

884
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
We staying over there by that.

885
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,160
Oh, that's a good way to kill a bunch of tight.

886
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,160
Yeah.

887
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,160
We have that ride to Splash.

888
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,160
Yeah, for sure.

889
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,160
Or did you ever or the play area where like the bucket dumps?

890
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,160
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

891
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,160
But I was too big for that stuff.

892
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,160
Oh, sure.

893
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,160
Yeah.

894
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,160
That's for little kids.

895
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,160
That's fair.

896
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,160
I was too, but I did it on the clock one of that weekend.

897
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,160
Actually, that I remember on Labor Day.

898
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,160
You got dumped with the bucket.

899
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:10,160
I like yeah, I went and like ran around the Curious George area in my uniform, which probably

900
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:15,160
was not a good thing to do and probably weirded out kids.

901
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,160
Were you alone?

902
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
Yes.

903
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,160
Really?

904
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,160
I was on the clock and I had nothing to do and no one was watching me.

905
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
Like all the tours had gone out.

906
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,160
So you frolicked?

907
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,160
Yeah, I went for a frolick.

908
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,160
Oh, thanks for framing it that way.

909
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,160
Are you from here, Scott?

910
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,160
Yeah, yeah.

911
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,160
Where did you go to high school?

912
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,160
Chaminade in the Valley.

913
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,160
Oh, yeah.

914
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,160
Nice.

915
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,160
I went to Hamilton.

916
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,160
Okay.

917
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,160
Cool.

918
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,160
Cool.

919
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,160
Cool.

920
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,160
LA.

921
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,160
Yeah.

922
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,160
Yeah.

923
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,160
Valley bros.

924
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
Chaminade's a real snobby.

925
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,160
It was private school, right?

926
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,160
Yeah.

927
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,160
They called it snobinade, in fact.

928
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,160
Snobinade.

929
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,160
I had very little arguments against that.

930
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,160
It's fairly true.

931
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,160
Did you call it that when you were there?

932
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
I might have welcomed.

933
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:01,160
I don't think I specifically did, but I wouldn't be hurt if you called it that.

934
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:06,160
As I've maybe said before, also Chaminade alumni, imagine you're Joe Rody.

935
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,160
Oh, yeah.

936
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,160
From my high school.

937
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,160
We're saying no.

938
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,160
Oh, yeah.

939
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:14,160
So the first time I went, yeah, it was a heat wave.

940
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,160
This was a welcome reprieve because you're just in air conditioning for like half an

941
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,160
hour.

942
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:24,160
We also went with a big group, so everyone had to do the photo op in front of the studio

943
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,160
tour sign and then do the studio tour.

944
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,160
The very first thing, which I advise people like if you're going to Universal Hollywood,

945
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:35,160
go straight to the lower lot as soon as you get there because if it's early enough, you

946
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,160
can just do all of that in 30 minutes.

947
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,160
Like you can do all that and then go back up.

948
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,160
Sure.

949
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,160
But we did that the wrong way.

950
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,160
So we were like the only thing down there that was open was Panda Express.

951
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,160
So we're like eating Panda Express in the heat.

952
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,160
And then we're like, oh, there's a special effects show.

953
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,160
Thank God.

954
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,160
This is inside.

955
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,160
It's cold.

956
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,160
So your memory is mostly that you were full of Panda Express.

957
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:05,160
And then we all were like, everyone was sunburned that night just watching the Emmys.

958
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,160
Conan hosted.

959
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,160
It was a very funny year when Conan hosted the Emmys.

960
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:16,160
Not the one where all the reality show hosts came out and the plan was that there was no

961
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,160
plan.

962
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,160
You ever watch that?

963
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,160
No, I do remember that.

964
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,160
It's one of the worst things ever to occur.

965
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,160
Like all five, it was like Tom Bergeron and you know, Cropes.

966
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

967
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,160
Oh, OK.

968
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,160
And they just like stood around and we're like, we didn't prepare anything.

969
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,160
And that genuinely is what happened.

970
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,160
That was the bit.

971
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,160
Yeah.

972
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,160
But then they did it.

973
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,160
It was horrible.

974
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,160
That sounds like the most boring thing that ever happened.

975
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:44,160
But the mid aughts were the aughts were very interesting time for this attraction from

976
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,160
what I could tell.

977
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,160
Because there's always been some sort of special effects presentation at Universal.

978
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:58,160
You speak called Cinemagic, which was like for the 90s to 2002 in this space.

979
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,160
It was called Cinemagic and that they turned into special effects stages and kind of like

980
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,160
grouped it in with backdraft.

981
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,160
What was in Cinemagic?

982
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,160
That was Back to the Future first.

983
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,160
Then the middle was an Alfred Hitchcock thing.

984
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,160
Yes.

985
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,160
And that was the one where you got to fall from the OK.

986
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,160
So I remember Cinemagic.

987
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,160
OK.

988
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,160
You do this one too.

989
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,160
Yeah, that was the first one.

990
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,160
Yeah.

991
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,160
Yeah.

992
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,160
With the big Statue of Liberty.

993
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,160
You're like, yes, I love this.

994
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,160
Body motions on this podcast.

995
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,160
And then you're like, silence.

996
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,160
And then you're like, silence.

997
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,160
You did very good falling.

998
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,160
You did a very realistic Panama falling, we should say.

999
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,160
You're on the you're on the hand of the Statue of Liberty.

1000
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,160
Trying to hang on to the hand of the Statue of Liberty.

1001
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,160
And then you fall backwards.

1002
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,160
Yeah.

1003
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,160
And there's a big practical one.

1004
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,160
But then the guy then there's it's intercutting with a guy who's just on green screen like

1005
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,160
sitting in a chair.

1006
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,160
Yes.

1007
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,160
And they like cycle through everything that can be behind you on a green screen and like,

1008
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,160
OK, now you're Superman and you're flying through space.

1009
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,160
And it gets a huge laugh every time.

1010
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,160
Green screen was such a novelty.

1011
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,160
It was so interesting to learn about.

1012
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,160
And now anybody can just do green screen anywhere all the time.

1013
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
On their phones.

1014
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,160
Yeah.

1015
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,160
Yeah.

1016
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,160
Apps that you hate that make you mad as soon as it looks like you've got to watch an ad

1017
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,160
for five seconds.

1018
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,160
Right.

1019
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:23,160
That thing also had like a psycho recreation, essentially.

1020
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,160
Yes.

1021
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,160
Yeah.

1022
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,160
Yeah.

1023
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,160
And where the guy hosting it comes out as the mother and then kind of takes his wig

1024
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,160
off and like, just kidding.

1025
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,160
Yeah.

1026
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,160
Yeah.

1027
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,520
And that had the info that I also found really fascinating that it's a that it's chocolate

1028
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,160
syrup instead of blood.

1029
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,160
You couldn't tell because it was black.

1030
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:50,160
I live for those little morsels of now fairly obvious movie trivia.

1031
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,160
But man, that stuff.

1032
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,160
I'd go home.

1033
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,160
I'd go back to elementary school and tell everybody all that stuff as if they couldn't

1034
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,160
just go learn it at the theme park.

1035
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,160
And I probably bored a lot of people.

1036
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,160
I was going to say, do they go nether around?

1037
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,160
Nether around.

1038
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,160
Give a telly a tale.

1039
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,160
I have been to a place where the secrets of movies have been unveiled.

1040
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,160
Do you know the movies of the 1940s?

1041
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,160
You do.

1042
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,160
Well, the blood was chocolate.

1043
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,160
Well, you all know Alfred Hitchcock, of course.

1044
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,160
The master of suspense.

1045
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:23,160
Everyone here a saboteur fan?

1046
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,160
Topaz is very underrated.

1047
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:33,160
Saboteur is that's the saboteur is the Statue of Liberty movie, which is weird because I

1048
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,160
think the guy who's dangling at the end is a Nazi.

1049
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,160
I think that's what's happening.

1050
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,160
Like, I've never seen Saboteur.

1051
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,160
I haven't either.

1052
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:46,160
I always like when I've watched a bunch of the Hitchcock movies, I was always like wondering,

1053
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,160
where is the universal?

1054
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,160
Where is the Statue of Liberty thing?

1055
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:56,160
And it's in Saboteur because they would use chunks of that show in in Florida for the

1056
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,160
Alfred Hitchcock show.

1057
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,160
Yes, like they would reuse.

1058
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,160
They used a lot of this stuff.

1059
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:05,160
And then later on, the fluffy, the guy, the werewolf who comes to life with emotion is

1060
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,160
used in the horror.

1061
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,160
There's a horror makeup show at the Florida Park.

1062
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1063
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,160
That's kind of the big ending of that show.

1064
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,160
So let's talk fluffy.

1065
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:22,160
That's that's like a later thing that happened where that's supposed to be like a kid is

1066
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:28,160
led to believe that he's doing motion capture and this big werewolf creature is doing exactly

1067
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,160
what he does.

1068
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:37,160
But then there's like a lightning strike as if, you know, the now the now fluffy is alive

1069
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,160
and cursed and he runs around and scares kids like Carl.

1070
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,160
Yeah, it scared me every time I saw it.

1071
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,160
And I saw it a lot.

1072
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,160
And it scared me every time.

1073
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,160
Because this is a huge suit.

1074
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,160
This is like an eight footer.

1075
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,160
With the red eyes and it gets scarier every even when you walk by it, like when I'm going

1076
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:02,160
in and this is the, you know, sixth week in a row that I'm at Universal Studios and I'm

1077
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:08,160
going in and you walk past fluffy and he's just like, you know, down and you're just

1078
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,160
like, this thing's about to do some crazy.

1079
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,160
Yeah, they power him up.

1080
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
They power him up.

1081
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,160
Yeah, turns on.

1082
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,160
Was the person in the suit the whole time?

1083
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,160
Yes.

1084
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,160
Oh, yeah.

1085
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,160
Yeah.

1086
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,160
There's no way to get in there.

1087
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,160
Yeah.

1088
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,160
Yeah.

1089
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,160
Just has to watch everybody come by.

1090
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,160
Probably looking at people being like, I'm about to scare that person.

1091
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,160
I'm about to scare the shit out of that lady.

1092
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,160
Yeah.

1093
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,160
Yeah.

1094
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,160
Because they're eyeing, they're knowing they're like, they're like figuring out who looks

1095
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,160
like the best.

1096
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,160
Yeah.

1097
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,160
Like scare, I guess.

1098
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:40,160
They always pick the smallest kid, like who volunteers for like motion capture.

1099
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,160
Eight year old kid, kid eight or under come to the motion capture or whatever.

1100
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,160
Yeah.

1101
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,160
Yeah.

1102
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,160
So you didn't, you never wanted to do that.

1103
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,160
You never wanted to control Fluffy.

1104
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,160
I did it once.

1105
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,160
Oh really?

1106
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,160
I did it once.

1107
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,160
Because I think they kept seeing me every week and they were just like, you can do it.

1108
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,160
Even though you're 12 and also 6'1".

1109
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,160
You were already taller than Fluffy.

1110
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,160
Taller than Fluffy.

1111
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,160
Dunked on Fluffy.

1112
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,160
Ran away from him faster than any of the kids did.

1113
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,160
Yeah.

1114
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,160
You childlike man.

1115
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,160
Man like child.

1116
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,160
Did you ever do, did you ever do the others?

1117
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,160
Did you do like the sound?

1118
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,160
The flowy.

1119
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,160
I was mixing Fluffy and Foley.

1120
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,160
The Foley was always very fun.

1121
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,160
Yeah.

1122
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,160
Yeah.

1123
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,160
Yeah.

1124
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,160
I mean learning about Foley, like that's a fun fact to know.

1125
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,160
Like I was called Foley.

1126
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,160
Yeah.

1127
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
After a guy.

1128
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,160
Yeah.

1129
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,160
Yeah.

1130
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,160
His name is James Foley.

1131
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,160
James Foley.

1132
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,160
Yeah.

1133
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,160
Feels like one of those very tour guidey like, a gentleman named James Foley.

1134
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,160
Now he's very well known for realizing that you could do the sound after the fact.

1135
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:49,160
This show is a perfect mechanism for tour guide voice.

1136
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,160
For the like saying information so quickly that you're not even meditating on what any

1137
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,160
of the words mean.

1138
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,160
And you're a super robot and you have everything memorized.

1139
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,160
And the David Copperfield-esque.

1140
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,160
Right.

1141
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:03,160
It's just all, I don't even know what I'm saying anymore.

1142
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,160
The words mean nothing to me.

1143
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,160
Yes.

1144
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,160
Yeah.

1145
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,160
It's all rhythm.

1146
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,160
It's just this music.

1147
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,160
Like radio DJ voice.

1148
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,160
Yeah.

1149
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,160
Where it's just like it doesn't matter what they're saying.

1150
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,160
As long as the rhythm is this way.

1151
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,160
And saying it at lightning speed.

1152
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,160
Just occasionally punching a word like that.

1153
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,160
There were old, I was watching old videos of this though.

1154
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:25,160
And there were some old like hosts that didn't do it as much.

1155
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,160
They were much more like, I'm trying to think of the word.

1156
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,160
They would just like throw stuff away.

1157
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,160
They're much more lazy about it.

1158
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,160
And then it seems, especially now it's turned into what you're saying.

1159
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,160
The very slick host voice and there's no personality really.

1160
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:44,160
You know I auditioned in 2013.

1161
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,160
This is like 2012.

1162
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,160
Like two years, two, three years into improv.

1163
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,160
So I'm kind of feeling myself being like, oh man, I'm about to go.

1164
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,160
I'm about to get this job.

1165
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,160
Y'all bullshitting.

1166
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,160
I got cut after the first round.

1167
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,160
What?

1168
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,160
Yeah.

1169
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,160
I made it to the hotel.

1170
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,160
I made it to the Beverly Garland.

1171
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,160
Beverly Garland?

1172
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,160
Yes.

1173
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,160
It was still that?

1174
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
Yeah.

1175
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,160
I made it to the Beverly Garland.

1176
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,160
Which that's the improv step.

1177
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:15,160
That's where you get up on stage and they give you some topic and you have to go off.

1178
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,160
Yeah.

1179
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,160
And I made the people laugh.

1180
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,160
But then they, at the end, they did not call my number.

1181
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,160
Jeez.

1182
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,160
What?

1183
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,160
And one guy that did get to stay, I was like, how did this guy get to stay?

1184
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:30,160
Like it was this older black dude who did not have, he had a interesting stage presence.

1185
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,160
But it was not one that I would want to see.

1186
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,160
He ended up getting cut like the next round.

1187
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,160
But it was like, how did he beat me in a round?

1188
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,160
I should at least made it to the third round.

1189
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,160
Sure.

1190
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,160
Is this for tour guide or for special effects?

1191
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,160
Yeah, for tour guide.

1192
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,160
For tour guide.

1193
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,160
Okay.

1194
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,160
That's madness to me.

1195
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:50,160
And then you're, yeah, you're like great at UCB, immediately F'd, but not good enough

1196
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,160
for the tour.

1197
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,160
Yeah, I can't do the tour.

1198
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,160
He definitely can't do the tour.

1199
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,160
It seemed like the perfect job because you get off for auditions and stuff like that.

1200
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,160
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1201
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,160
And it's extremely flexible, especially because you get the job and then the first summer,

1202
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,160
they don't use you almost ever.

1203
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,160
Really?

1204
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,160
Yeah, it's forcibly flexible.

1205
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,160
Do they still pay you?

1206
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,160
Yeah, you get paid minimum wage to do the training.

1207
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,160
Oh yeah.

1208
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,160
And then you still might not make it past the training.

1209
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,160
So if you made it all the way through, you might have just done like three weeks of classes

1210
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,160
for which you're paid almost nothing.

1211
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,160
Yeah.

1212
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,160
And then still you might have gotten cut.

1213
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,160
It's like, it's cutthroat.

1214
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,160
It's cutthroat.

1215
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,160
It's tough.

1216
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,160
Did you do it once or were you, like is it, because you know, UCB Herald team, it took

1217
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:33,160
me four auditions to get on the Herald team and I was like, next year, next year.

1218
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:37,160
And were you like this, you didn't do it more than once to try to?

1219
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,160
No.

1220
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,160
Yeah, you were just.

1221
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,160
No, because that process was ridiculous.

1222
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,160
We had to wait outside the city walk for like four hours.

1223
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,160
Geez.

1224
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,160
Yeah.

1225
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:49,160
And then finally you get in there and you talk to the person for 20 seconds.

1226
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,160
And they just like mark on your resume or not.

1227
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,160
And then they'll go, okay, here's a slip.

1228
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,160
Come back to the Beverly Garner this time.

1229
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:02,160
I tried it in 2008 and that like literally the month that George Bush was like, we are

1230
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:09,160
in a recession and the news, news crews were there because it was like record people showing

1231
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:13,160
up for the first round of interviews, which they timed with a bell.

1232
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,160
Like you have one minute to sell yourself.

1233
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,160
Yeah.

1234
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,160
And like most people didn't even get to the hotel.

1235
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,160
Yeah.

1236
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,160
Like because it was so gnarly.

1237
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,160
Like there.

1238
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,160
Did you get to the hotel?

1239
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,160
No, I didn't get to the hotel.

1240
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,160
Geez.

1241
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,160
I mean, I just like started, but like I.

1242
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,160
We're making Scott look real good though here.

1243
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,160
Yeah.

1244
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,160
I'm sorry.

1245
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,160
You guys just didn't have what it took.

1246
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,160
Yeah, clearly.

1247
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,160
Again, it's all about saying things as fast as you possibly can.

1248
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,160
Universal Studios, entertainment capital.

1249
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,160
You just, you needed to talk at double speed is what you had to do.

1250
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,160
I do wonder the origin of that, that speaking.

1251
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,160
Yeah, me too, because everything like this.

1252
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:55,160
And if you go see a tour type attraction in Florida, it's this too.

1253
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,160
It's not like it's just like an LA thing.

1254
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,160
Theme park headset mic based attractions.

1255
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,160
Yeah.

1256
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,160
Mac Orley was talking about he's fascinated with like where it's like where certain voices start.

1257
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,160
Like that's just sort of a voice you assume.

1258
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,160
And it's same with like radio announcer.

1259
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,160
There's just a voice that everybody does.

1260
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,160
Where does who starts that voice?

1261
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,160
Yeah.

1262
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,160
Why?

1263
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:22,160
Who says to me, my favorite is like the black radio show, like advertisement for like the club that weekend.

1264
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,160
It's going down this weekend.

1265
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,160
Club wet wet.

1266
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,160
We got thirsty Thursdays on Obama night.

1267
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,160
We celebrate no bomb of y'all.

1268
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,160
I love what's the first one.

1269
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,160
You want to know like who started it?

1270
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,160
Yeah.

1271
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,160
The pioneer of.

1272
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,160
Yeah.

1273
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,160
I dreamed of a different way of speaking.

1274
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,160
Monster truck shows like monster truck announcer.

1275
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,160
Oh yeah.

1276
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,160
Like Grave Friday.

1277
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,160
Friday.

1278
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,160
It's the same since the 80s or whatever those started.

1279
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:55,160
But at some point that someone had to invent repeating it.

1280
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,160
Hey, I have an idea.

1281
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,160
Call me crazy.

1282
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,160
What if people, I just want people to remember that it's going to be Saturday.

1283
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,160
What is it?

1284
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,160
Would it be weird if I said Saturday, Saturday, Saturday?

1285
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,160
This sucks.

1286
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,160
Get him out of here.

1287
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,160
Wait, wait, wait.

1288
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,160
Listen to me.

1289
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,160
This guy might be on.

1290
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,160
Let him talk.

1291
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,160
Threat three times.

1292
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:21,160
The man who invented saying the day of the week three times.

1293
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,160
This is a statue we built to him.

1294
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,160
A pioneer.

1295
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,160
In front of a monster truck rally.

1296
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,160
And he made no money for doing that.

1297
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,160
He's an unsung hero.

1298
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,160
Where were we though?

1299
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,160
We were talking.

1300
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,160
We were going to talk.

1301
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,160
Foley.

1302
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,160
Learning about Foley.

1303
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,160
I think Foley is interesting.

1304
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:44,160
It was like fun and cool and tactile to watch as a kid because you're seeing like here's

1305
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,160
a box of leaves and you're like, you know, putting shoes in them.

1306
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,160
Yeah.

1307
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:52,160
Or coconuts or whatever for a horse clop.

1308
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,160
Yeah.

1309
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,160
Oh, Fluffy comes back at Foley.

1310
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,160
Usually.

1311
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,160
Oh, you're right.

1312
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,160
At least in a version.

1313
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,160
Like someone goes in a sound booth.

1314
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,160
Oh yes.

1315
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,160
Because like that's the big conclusion of the show.

1316
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:07,160
I was trying to remember what's the climax of the show and it's someone messes up their

1317
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:12,160
Foley and then they send them into a sound booth where you just see a silhouette.

1318
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:19,160
Like it's very clearly a video monitor because I saw one online where it glitches for a second.

1319
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,160
Like then it's the silhouette again.

1320
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:26,160
But then the silhouette gets ravaged by Fluffy.

1321
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,160
Fluffy comes back in silhouette form.

1322
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,160
Fluffy kills.

1323
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,160
Fluffy kills this volunteer.

1324
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,160
Fluffy also it was implied Fluffy killed the first host in the second scene.

1325
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,160
Right.

1326
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:41,160
Because then the sticky guy like takes over the show.

1327
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:45,160
The guy who would like every time there'd be an effect he would scream and run away.

1328
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:49,160
Oh he's a co-host who does like almost nothing and then he nervously has to take over because

1329
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,160
the other guy died.

1330
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,160
Yeah.

1331
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,160
But then I think some shows would end with like then the door would swing open of the

1332
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,160
sound booth and the first host would come out with their clothes all torn and like thank

1333
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,160
you for coming.

1334
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,160
Thank you for.

1335
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:05,160
But then I saw one video where it was just like the first host just kind of wanders out

1336
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:09,160
in their normal clothes and waves goodbye to everyone.

1337
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,160
Well you gotta do that all day.

1338
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,160
They have more jobs there now.

1339
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,160
Like other stuff.

1340
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,160
Like dinosaur handlers.

1341
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,160
Oh yeah.

1342
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,160
Oh yeah right.

1343
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,160
There's a lot of stuff.

1344
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:24,160
And then like inside there's the giant Triceratops that walks and I think there's multiple people

1345
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,160
in that.

1346
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,160
At least two.

1347
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,160
There's like an old it's like an old horse costume.

1348
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,160
Like someone's the Triceratops' ass.

1349
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,160
That's gotta be terrible during the summer.

1350
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,160
Yeah.

1351
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,160
Oh yeah Jesus.

1352
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,160
But they gotta there's like people that have to like walk it out and then there's people

1353
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,160
inside it I believe.

1354
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,160
My summer job is I'm a Triceratops' ass.

1355
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:50,160
Person at the top just so you know I had limpy for lunch at City Walk.

1356
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,160
So have fun.

1357
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,160
Zzzz.

1358
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,160
Oh god.

1359
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,160
Why's that ass coughing so much?

1360
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:08,160
In some of my first improv class I met a couple guys who would do the special effects show

1361
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,160
as like their day job.

1362
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,160
Like they're like yeah it's like doing four or five improv shows a day essentially and

1363
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:19,160
you get 150 bucks and yeah it's all right you know a few hours of work.

1364
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,160
It's fine.

1365
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,160
Yeah you just scream and say some facts.

1366
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,160
Not much of a recommendation then.

1367
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,160
That's fine.

1368
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,160
That's about what it's like.

1369
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,160
I'm still jealous of those people who do the tour guy.

1370
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:33,160
Like I'll be on the tour more successful than you.

1371
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,160
I'm on a good place.

1372
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,160
Yeah you may have gotten this but I'm on a good place.

1373
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,160
I mean yes.

1374
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:45,160
I think any other job you can get immediately makes you more successful than the tour.

1375
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,160
Just because I didn't get that job.

1376
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,160
I'm just bitter.

1377
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,160
But it does.

1378
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:56,160
I've always said it ruled for like my first summer doing it was such a dream.

1379
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,160
It was so awesome.

1380
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:01,160
And then immediately summer two was like oh god this again.

1381
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,160
How many years did you do it?

1382
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:07,160
Like I did it a lot for two summers and then really sporadically after that.

1383
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:12,160
And often just so I could get free parking at CityWalk.

1384
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,160
I stayed on the schedule for a little while.

1385
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:21,160
Didn't work for like I had like other full time jobs and was still on the schedule just for the free parking.

1386
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,160
So if I got a shift I was like oh god damn it.

1387
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,160
What do I do now?

1388
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,160
I have to go tell my full time job.

1389
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:31,160
Do you mind if I go work another job today?

1390
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,160
You said before you would not mind doing this a little bit.

1391
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,160
Of course.

1392
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,160
Still.

1393
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,160
If I could do it once a month I'd be psyched.

1394
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:45,160
If you were offer only Carl on the tram tour would you?

1395
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:50,160
They're like yeah you don't have to audition anymore but you can come in a couple times a month.

1396
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:56,160
At this point I am intimidated by the training.

1397
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,160
I mean like I don't feel like it.

1398
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,160
But what if they said no training we'll give you the notes.

1399
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,160
And I get to make it oh yeah I do that shit.

1400
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,160
That'd be fun.

1401
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,160
You don't have to learn any clip numbers.

1402
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,160
Somebody will like sit behind you and do it all for you.

1403
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:15,160
There will be another person there that can be like yeah this is the part where they talk about the shark not working.

1404
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,160
Oh yeah I've watched Universal Story enough times.

1405
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,160
It feels like it's all in there.

1406
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,160
Day 27 is haunted.

1407
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,160
The whole lot feels out of Africa.

1408
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,160
1985.

1409
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,160
You know what that big lake is?

1410
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,160
Like where the big green screen was.

1411
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,160
Things like that.

1412
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,160
They use this lake in cocoon.

1413
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:40,160
Statistically you could say that about most things on that property.

1414
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,160
You might be right.

1415
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,160
Like cocoon, Van Helsing.

1416
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,160
Coach is the one.

1417
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,160
I love seeing the Coach House.

1418
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,160
That was one of my favorite things because I liked Coach.

1419
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,160
Then the theme song would play.

1420
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,160
Hell yeah.

1421
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,160
Yeah everybody likes it.

1422
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,160
Southwestern Minnesota State baby.

1423
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,160
How's the theme song go?

1424
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,160
You know what I'm getting mixed up.

1425
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,160
I can't think of it exactly in my head.

1426
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,160
I'm getting mixed up with the theme song to Recess right now.

1427
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,160
But it's kind of similar to that.

1428
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,160
I think what's playing in my head is Major Dad.

1429
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,160
Is Coach kind of like a football fight song?

1430
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,160
Yeah it is.

1431
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,160
Yeah yeah yeah.

1432
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,160
Okay okay.

1433
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,160
Got it.

1434
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,160
I remember a big coach poster by the special.

1435
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,160
Like if I'm in line for the special effects stage.

1436
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,160
There's a huge coach.

1437
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,160
And they sold coach merch also.

1438
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,160
Around this area.

1439
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,160
Coach bags.

1440
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,160
People are going to go is this a coach bag?

1441
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,160
And they put it in the front.

1442
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,160
Yeah.

1443
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,160
Technically yes.

1444
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,160
Craig T. Nelson on the side of a bag.

1445
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,160
Jerry Van Dyke was funny as hell on that show.

1446
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,160
Yeah.

1447
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,160
He's an unsung.

1448
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,160
He was always like a side character.

1449
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,160
But he doesn't get enough credit.

1450
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,160
I was going to say they were trying to bring Coach back a few years ago.

1451
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,160
Yeah I remember that.

1452
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,160
But for some reason.

1453
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,160
I guess people's appetite for Coach wasn't as strong as they wanted.

1454
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,160
I signed the petition.

1455
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,160
Coach.

1456
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,160
Coach.

1457
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,160
Bring it back.

1458
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,160
They were all alive maybe at that point too.

1459
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,160
Probably.

1460
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,160
Are they now?

1461
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,160
Yeah he's dead.

1462
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,160
Really?

1463
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,160
He was the older brother right?

1464
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,160
I think he's younger.

1465
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,160
I gotta look this up.

1466
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,160
I'm worried that he's not dead.

1467
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,160
He's dead.

1468
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,160
A million dollars that Jerry Van Dyke is dead.

1469
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,160
Put the pennies on the eyes.

1470
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,160
We're going to the graveyard.

1471
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,160
We're going to Hollywood forever right now.

1472
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,160
I'm going to prove this.

1473
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,160
Read it and weep Gardner.

1474
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,160
There it is. Read it.

1475
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,160
Put it on the podcast.

1476
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,160
He died in 2018.

1477
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,160
January 5th.

1478
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,160
It was my birthday.

1479
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,160
Really?

1480
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,160
He is younger than Dick.

1481
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,160
That sucks.

1482
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,160
Dick must have took that hard.

1483
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,160
Probably.

1484
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:09,160
I believe the trivia is that Jerry Van Dyke had two options for shows at one point to star.

1485
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:13,160
It was Gilligan's Island or My Mother the Car.

1486
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,160
He went with the show My Mother the Car.

1487
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,160
Who would he have been in Gilligan's Island?

1488
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,160
Gilligan I believe.

1489
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,160
I believe he would have been Gilligan on Gilligan's Island.

1490
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,160
He went with the show that was about the

1491
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,160
wife's ghost living inside a car.

1492
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,160
I mean to be fair, at that time, like 1966 probably.

1493
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,160
Yeah.

1494
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,160
65, 66 somewhere in there.

1495
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,160
That probably was revolutionary.

1496
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:37,160
Cars were around for like 30 years at that point but still kind of like just getting popping.

1497
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,160
Sure.

1498
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:45,160
And the idea that a wife's ghost or a mother's ghost was in the car was probably like this is going to be hilarious.

1499
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,160
The main character is going to be a car.

1500
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,160
Yeah.

1501
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,160
Also endless stories with that trapped on an island.

1502
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,160
How many stories can you possibly do?

1503
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,160
Right.

1504
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,160
That's what he was thinking.

1505
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,160
But that might have been a thing that may have haunted him.

1506
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,160
Like a ghost.

1507
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,160
Until my 29th birthday.

1508
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,160
Until one faithful girl's birthday.

1509
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,160
You'll always know now.

1510
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,160
You absorbed his life force.

1511
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,160
For another year.

1512
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,160
Coach.

1513
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,160
Every birthday now you will know.

1514
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,160
Yeah.

1515
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,160
That this was the day Jerry Maddyke passed.

1516
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,160
Let's talk about another weird old show.

1517
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,160
Harry and the Hendersons.

1518
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,160
Oh yeah.

1519
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,160
Because the finale of this show for a long time, a long time, was you have to do the sound effects for Harry and the Hendersons.

1520
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,160
Yeah.

1521
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,160
This was a syndicated show that ran from like 91 to 93.

1522
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,160
And in 1999,

1523
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,160
I think it was like the first time in the history of the show.

1524
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,160
Yeah.

1525
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,160
And it was like the first time in the history of the show.

1526
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,160
Yeah.

1527
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,160
And it was like the first time in the history of the show.

1528
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,160
Yeah.

1529
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,160
And in 1999,

1530
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,160
you could still go on an attraction

1531
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,160
where the idea is

1532
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,160
this is a new episode

1533
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,160
that we're making.

1534
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,160
And at some point in time,

1535
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,160
there's a mistake and all of the sound effects

1536
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,160
get erased.

1537
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,160
And the voice in the back of the booth

1538
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,160
says, the network called,

1539
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,160
we're going on the air live

1540
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,160
in one minute.

1541
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,160
So we have to live broadcast the sounds.

1542
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,160
For a syndicate.

1543
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,160
There is no network.

1544
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,160
Yeah.

1545
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,160
There is not a network in this scenario.

1546
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,160
I forgot that was syndicated.

1547
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,160
It came on every day?

1548
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,160
No, not like that. I recall seeing it like Saturday afternoons.

1549
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,160
Yeah.

1550
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,160
Something like that.

1551
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,160
Like after Gulliver's Travels or something.

1552
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,160
Yeah.

1553
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,160
In the Zenub zone.

1554
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,160
VIP.

1555
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,160
Oh yeah.

1556
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,160
She spies.

1557
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,160
Relic Hunter.

1558
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,160
Right before JAG.

1559
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,160
What a boring time.

1560
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,160
Like a boring day of television.

1561
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,160
If all those shows

1562
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,160
were coming out, I knew that I was like,

1563
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,160
man, I don't have anything to do today.

1564
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,160
I gotta go outside.

1565
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,160
You gotta get to Universal.

1566
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,160
Yeah, you like failed

1567
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,160
in your day.

1568
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,160
All you have to do is watch.

1569
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,160
There's a weird Gene

1570
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,160
Roddenberry related show

1571
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,160
called Andromeda or something.

1572
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,160
Andromeda, yeah.

1573
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,160
I would be like, what is this?

1574
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,160
Star Trek ripoff.

1575
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,160
There was a martial arts themed

1576
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,160
kind of like WWE thing.

1577
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,160
Oh, but that was cool.

1578
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,160
What was that called? Kung Fu Masters or something?

1579
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,160
Something like that.

1580
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,160
It was like Power Rangers.

1581
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,160
Very of the time of

1582
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,160
Power Rangers.

1583
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,160
VR Troopers?

1584
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,160
No, it was more of presenting it as a reality like WWE.

1585
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,160
It was like ninjas fighting

1586
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,160
WWE style.

1587
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,160
You tracked it week to week?

1588
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,160
Who's winning in the middle?

1589
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,160
Yeah, there were story lines.

1590
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,160
So that was the idea.

1591
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,160
It was like live mortal combat.

1592
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,160
The time period where every kid was taking karate after school.

1593
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,160
And the Power Rangers are all doing karate.

1594
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,160
Very weird.

1595
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,160
Very short lived.

1596
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,160
So anyway, back to

1597
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,160
the syndicated.

1598
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,160
My favorite Saturday syndicated show

1599
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,160
was a show called Your Big Break

1600
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,160
that was hosted by Alfonso

1601
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,160
Riviero. And did you ever see

1602
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,160
the show? Oh, man.

1603
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,160
I was like, who knows this?

1604
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,160
It's sort of an American

1605
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,160
Idol type scenario

1606
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,160
except the prize is you get

1607
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,160
to pretend to be

1608
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,160
a star of your choosing

1609
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,160
in a big production number.

1610
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,160
I don't think I've ever seen that.

1611
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,160
You go into

1612
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,160
a magic door and then

1613
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,160
there's a bunch of fog and then you walk

1614
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,160
back out dressed as

1615
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,160
Elvis or

1616
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,160
Michael Jackson or

1617
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,160
Whitney Houston or whatever it is.

1618
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,160
It's so great. And my

1619
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,160
my very favorite one was

1620
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,160
that a guy wanted to be Neil

1621
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,160
Diamond. And it's

1622
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,160
regular people. It's like accountants

1623
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,160
or people who work at call centers or whatever.

1624
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,160
He goes in the door and then comes

1625
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,160
back out Neil Diamond. And then he

1626
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,160
this guy sang

1627
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,160
Coming to America.

1628
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,160
Wow. A little like

1629
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,160
stage set of an Ellis

1630
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,160
Island staircase.

1631
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,160
Coming off of a ship was rolled out

1632
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,160
and a bunch of like early 1900s

1633
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,160
immigrants walked down the stairs

1634
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:17,160
like from Ireland to France

1635
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,160
and waved.

1636
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,160
They're coming

1637
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,160
to America.

1638
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,160
This is before like this is

1639
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,160
kind of like the early

1640
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,160
version of like lip sync battle almost.

1641
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,160
It's like a cousin to lip sync battle.

1642
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,160
But with regular people

1643
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,160
not celebrities. You guys remember Great Pretenders?

1644
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,160
Where kids it was on it was

1645
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,160
hosted by Fergie and her

1646
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,160
singing room like Wild Orchid.

1647
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,160
Fergie's original.

1648
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,160
It came on

1649
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,160
ABC Family or Fox Family.

1650
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,160
It was called back then. It's called Freeform now.

1651
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,160
But like it was called Great Pretenders.

1652
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,160
Fergie with like a lot

1653
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,160
Fergie and like you know

1654
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,160
midriff leather pants and like too much

1655
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,160
lip liner. Fergie looks bizarre.

1656
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,160
Welcome back to Great Pretenders.

1657
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,160
And they would always like sing

1658
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,160
that part.

1659
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,160
We're not pretending.

1660
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,160
We really sing. We're Wild Orchid.

1661
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,160
Yeah.

1662
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,160
But these kids are pretending to sing.

1663
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,160
I used to love that show.

1664
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,160
Would kids would they lip sync?

1665
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,160
Yeah. Okay. So that's also

1666
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,160
interesting.

1667
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,160
So they would dress up. They would

1668
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,160
lip sync and then give them like a stage

1669
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,160
set up. And do like do like a routine.

1670
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,160
Like I remember one I remember a group of kids

1671
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,160
doing the Friends theme song.

1672
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,160
But they weren't lip syncing to it.

1673
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,160
They just danced around like a fake

1674
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,160
fountain with white turtleneck songs.

1675
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,160
Yeah. Whoa.

1676
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,160
Wow. But they did the wait.

1677
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,160
They didn't lip sync? No.

1678
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,160
Because the friends don't sing

1679
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,160
the song.

1680
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,160
I kind of wish they did though. Yeah.

1681
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,160
Kids seeing kids anytime when I

1682
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:53,160
was a kid seeing kids do anything

1683
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,160
was just I was obsessed with it. I don't think

1684
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,160
there was a bad show where kids like Wild

1685
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,160
and Crazy Kids like that

1686
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,160
was I was obsessed with. But anytime they had kids

1687
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,160
doing anything I was so jealous

1688
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,160
of those kids. Yeah. I didn't watch

1689
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,160
that show as a kid but I would have been so

1690
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,160
jealous of the kids running around the Friends

1691
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,160
fountain. Oh I was way too shy

1692
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,160
to do anything like that. Yeah.

1693
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,160
And yet I was so jealous of those kids.

1694
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,160
That's gotta be fun. Yeah.

1695
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,160
And you're like it's their sheer confidence

1696
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,160
that got them this.

1697
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,160
That I don't have and I'll never have. Yeah.

1698
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:25,160
I can't believe I do what I do now.

1699
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,160
Because I was the shyest kid. Oh really?

1700
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,160
Like for a long time like through high school

1701
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,160
and whatever you were

1702
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,160
inward and. Yeah.

1703
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,160
Well not inward like I was

1704
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,160
what is it called?

1705
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,160
An extroverted introvert?

1706
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,160
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

1707
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,160
Get the energy up. Yeah.

1708
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:45,160
And be very shy. Yes. Yes. Absolutely.

1709
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,160
Sure. Sure. Sure. I feel like I was like that

1710
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,160
and still am like that. Sure. I think I am too.

1711
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,160
I feel like a lot of comedy. Yeah. People in comedy are.

1712
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,160
It felt like a fight to get me out.

1713
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,160
It felt like I was fighting myself a lot.

1714
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,160
To like express myself.

1715
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,160
Sure. Sure. Okay.

1716
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,160
And I used to because I used to do like we would

1717
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,160
make videos with my sister and she would

1718
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,160
be the host and I would always just have a puppet.

1719
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,160
Yeah. And it's like it's clear

1720
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,160
that like I was a little too scared

1721
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,160
to be on camera. So the puppet

1722
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,160
was brave. The puppet was

1723
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,160
very brave. Yeah.

1724
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,160
I would make like Barney talk or something.

1725
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,160
Her Barney doll. But I was too

1726
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,160
scared to be on camera.

1727
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,160
What weirdos we are.

1728
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,160
Yeah. Yeah. It's true.

1729
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,160
We have the confidence now.

1730
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,160
Sort of. Yeah. Yeah. Mildly.

1731
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,160
All right. So Harry

1732
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,160
and the Hendersons. I don't know.

1733
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,160
I just love that bizarre.

1734
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,160
And then sometimes in this show

1735
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,160
Harry himself

1736
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,160
because he would usually culminate

1737
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,160
in like a very nervous

1738
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:45,160
woman. And

1739
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,160
often they would give this job to somebody who could not

1740
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:49,160
speak English so that they could kind of make

1741
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,160
fun of the person for their lack of ability

1742
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,160
to speak English. Sure. She doesn't

1743
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,160
understand the instructions. Something that Copperfield

1744
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,160
still does to this day. That's right.

1745
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,160
Yes. If you go see the Copper. David

1746
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,160
Copperfield show. It's so many jokes

1747
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:03,160
about like probably

1748
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:05,160
a plant. But a woman in the audience

1749
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,160
is a plant that can't speak English well. And

1750
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:09,160
he like haha I can't understand anything you

1751
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,160
said.

1752
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,160
He was dead. Copperfield. David Copperfield?

1753
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:15,160
Which magician died?

1754
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,160
I say it like that. Which magician died?

1755
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,160
Houdini died.

1756
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,160
Which magician in history

1757
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:23,160
died? Lance Burton is still alive.

1758
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,160
A new guy. Like a younger guy that

1759
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:27,160
was doing Vegas who passed away a couple years ago.

1760
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,160
Oh Danny Gans. Danny Gans.

1761
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,160
He wasn't really a magician. That's what I'm

1762
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,160
mixing. Oh Ricky Jay died?

1763
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,160
I don't know who that is. I was thinking Danny Gans.

1764
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,160
Okay. How many

1765
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,160
magicians have died? And have any

1766
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,160
of them really? Since Houdini.

1767
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,160
Speaking of syndicated TV.

1768
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,160
You remember Magic Secrets Revealed?

1769
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,160
I felt so guilty

1770
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,160
watching that.

1771
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,160
Like I am not supposed to know

1772
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,160
like I knew about the secrets

1773
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:55,160
magicians don't reveal their

1774
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:57,160
secrets. And I would be like

1775
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,160
do I want to know these secrets?

1776
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,160
Will I still enjoy the TV specials

1777
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:03,160
if I know the secrets? And then

1778
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,160
he unmasked and it was just a guy.

1779
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,160
Like they built it up.

1780
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,160
You were hoping like it was

1781
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:11,160
Lance Burton or Copperfield.

1782
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,160
And they were all mad at him.

1783
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:15,160
I don't think those were the real ways

1784
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,160
that they do those tricks though.

1785
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,160
Sometimes it's like come on we're not that dumb.

1786
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,160
I can't remember

1787
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,160
specifically but

1788
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,160
I feel like people were supposedly

1789
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,160
mad. I feel like your David Copperfields

1790
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:29,160
were upset about it. And I could

1791
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,160
be wrong about that. Yeah and then the guy

1792
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,160
had to give a speech kind of like calming everyone

1793
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,160
down. But this

1794
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,160
we're celebrating magic and that's wonderful.

1795
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,160
And he was like a creep in a ponytail

1796
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,160
who was in my head was named like

1797
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,160
Touche or something.

1798
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:45,160
I

1799
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,160
really hope that

1800
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,160
Touche was the man who

1801
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,160
took his mask off. It is I

1802
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:53,160
Touche.

1803
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,160
Those were kind of the death rattle

1804
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,160
of magic specials I feel like.

1805
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,160
Like that was kind of the end of the run.

1806
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,160
Besides like David Blaine.

1807
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,160
David Blaine ones were built up so

1808
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:05,160
much of like he's going to do a stunt.

1809
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:07,160
It did feel like sleazy I think about it.

1810
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,160
Like in my little kid brain I was like

1811
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,160
oh we shouldn't be watching this at all.

1812
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,160
They all looked like they were filmed in the

1813
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,160
total eclipse of the heart video

1814
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,160
with the doves and the fog.

1815
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,160
The warehouses with the lights shooting through the

1816
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,160
windows. It's also around the time of

1817
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:23,160
the Jonathan Frakes hosted Beyond

1818
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:25,160
Belief Fact or Fiction. Similar to Step Out.

1819
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,160
It would come on after that. Which would come on after.

1820
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:29,160
They looked like they were in the same studio a little

1821
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,160
bit like the camera looked the quality

1822
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,160
of the video looked the same.

1823
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,160
They just moved everything out.

1824
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,160
Jonathan Frakes walks up. Have you ever dropped an ice cream cone?

1825
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,160
And then they just

1826
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,160
shipped the other show in there.

1827
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,160
I've said it

1828
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:45,160
for years. He should have had like an Adam

1829
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:47,160
West something.

1830
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,160
He's so funny on that.

1831
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,160
He wasn't trying to be funny on that.

1832
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,160
But when you see the super cuts of it you've seen those

1833
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:55,160
right? Yeah yeah yeah. The many questions

1834
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,160
in a row. Have you ever turned on a lamp and the

1835
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,160
light bulb didn't work?

1836
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,160
Have you ever tripped down the stairs and

1837
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,160
hit your head really hard?

1838
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,160
Nervous like so

1839
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,160
sincerely.

1840
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,160
It's not like he's not trying

1841
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,160
to be like a deliver like he's an airplane

1842
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,160
or anything. It's so fucking

1843
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,160
funny. Have you ever adopted a big foot

1844
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,160
and had him live with you for a long time?

1845
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,160
Like carrying him.

1846
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,160
Have you ever wake up screaming?

1847
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,160
Have you ever picked up an ice cream cone you found

1848
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,160
on the floor?

1849
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,160
And then he has like someone else do it.

1850
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,160
And then he'll like do it or he'll get off like if it's like

1851
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,160
have you ever ridden a bike angrily?

1852
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:35,160
And then he'll like have a helmet on

1853
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,160
and he'll take it off.

1854
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,160
Like he always has a prop with him.

1855
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,160
They did one for

1856
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,160
a football game a couple weeks ago.

1857
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:45,160
He recreated one.

1858
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,160
As a goof.

1859
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:49,160
I forget what football game it was.

1860
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:51,160
He's back at it? He's back at it.

1861
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,160
He's like owning the meme like Rick Astley.

1862
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,160
Jonathan Frakes back in the game.

1863
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,160
I had a lunch box with

1864
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:59,160
Captain Picard, Jonathan Frakes, and

1865
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,160
Data on it. Sure.

1866
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,160
Not a big fan of Star Trek Next Generation.

1867
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,160
Scared of it. Another fear of mine.

1868
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,160
Whoopi Goldberg. Whoopi Goldberg terrified me.

1869
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,160
Because of just the way she

1870
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:11,160
was dressed? Yeah.

1871
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,160
I was very young. She's like a sorceress

1872
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,160
or something.

1873
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,160
She's a guy and she's lived for a long time.

1874
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,160
She's lived for hundreds of years.

1875
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,160
Her eyes like rolled back into her head one time

1876
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:23,160
that I was like I was very afraid of Whoopi Goldberg as a

1877
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:25,160
child. Interesting. No matter what?

1878
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:27,160
Yeah.

1879
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,160
In other like in Ghost,

1880
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,160
in Theodore Rex.

1881
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:33,160
I'll give you a couple reasons.

1882
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,160
In 1990,

1883
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,160
I won.

1884
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:39,160
But my mother

1885
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:41,160
is in college at the time.

1886
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,160
And she,

1887
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,160
her college gets to open up, college

1888
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,160
marching band gets to open up for

1889
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,160
Motown 30.

1890
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:51,160
The celebration of Motown. Wow.

1891
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,160
At the Pantages Theater here in Los Angeles. We're still in Mississippi

1892
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,160
at the time. This was like her trip to LA

1893
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:57,160
and she was like I'm coming back.

1894
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,160
And we eventually did. Wow. And I ended up

1895
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,160
growing up here. But like this is when we're still in Mississippi

1896
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,160
and we would play this tape

1897
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,160
over and over again to see my mom like marching down

1898
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:07,160
Hollywood Boulevard going into

1899
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:09,160
the Pantages because she was like the flag

1900
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,160
girl for the college. And

1901
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:13,160
Whoopi Goldberg

1902
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:15,160
hosted.

1903
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,160
And in the beginning she did this like Diana Ross

1904
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,160
bit where she had this long wig on.

1905
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,160
And then she like turns around, snatches the wig off

1906
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:23,160
and puts it under her armpit.

1907
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:25,160
Like as a joke. It was a joke like

1908
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:27,160
if you need me call me. Which is something that

1909
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,160
Diana Ross would say. But honey don't call me before

1910
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,160
nine because I don't get up.

1911
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,160
And then she snatched the wig off and everybody goes

1912
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:35,160
Ah it's Whoopi. She's ugly.

1913
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,160
Like people used to diss. Oh dude

1914
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,160
people used to diss Whoopi Goldberg so much.

1915
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,160
It was like a joke.

1916
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,160
Oh yeah this is a really Ian Simpson's joke I think

1917
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,160
about naked pictures of her or something.

1918
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,160
Yeah it's bad.

1919
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:49,160
But that was scary.

1920
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,160
The cover to the movie

1921
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,160
Telephone that I would always pass by

1922
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,160
in the video store.

1923
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,160
I gotta look this up. You gotta look the cover up.

1924
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,160
It looks like she doesn't have eyes.

1925
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,160
But she's just like looking to the side.

1926
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,160
It's also her worst

1927
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,160
movie ever. It's a really dumb

1928
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:07,160
movie. Did you

1929
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:09,160
better than Theodore Rex or worse?

1930
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,160
Worse probably. Oh boy.

1931
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,160
Wait you were afraid of the wig thing. I was afraid of

1932
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,160
the wig thing. I was afraid of the cover.

1933
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,160
And then her on

1934
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,160
Star Trek The Next Generation which was in

1935
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:21,160
syndication by the time I was conscious enough

1936
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,160
to recognize it. No it wasn't

1937
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,160
that one. It was like that one.

1938
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,160
Oh I was terrified of that.

1939
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,160
Oh wait does she have kind of like

1940
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:31,160
cat eyes? What's going on

1941
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:33,160
with the pupils? I think her

1942
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,160
locks are blocking her eye

1943
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,160
in a way that makes it weird. She looks a little

1944
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,160
like demonic or something. I could see how yeah if you

1945
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,160
were like this is a different

1946
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,160
is this the same one? The trippy background.

1947
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,160
Yeah it is.

1948
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,160
Everything about this picture I'm just like

1949
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,160
whoopee. Wow. I have never heard

1950
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,160
of The Telephone.

1951
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,160
It's news to me. It's the rest

1952
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:55,160
of your day now.

1953
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,160
Y'all have to watch The Telephone.

1954
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,160
After you watch Harry and the Hitties go watch The Telephone.

1955
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:03,160
Yikes. I was scared of Star Trek The Next Generation

1956
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,160
but I was scared because there was one episode

1957
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,160
where Data got possessed. I mean it wasn't his evil

1958
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,160
brother Lore.

1959
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:11,160
It was like there was some weird symbol

1960
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:13,160
all of a sudden appeared on his head and he was scary.

1961
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,160
I watched it in the hospital once. My sister

1962
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,160
was in the hospital and I watched it on a

1963
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,160
TV and it was like in my

1964
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,160
memory it's like the Poltergeist TV

1965
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:23,160
of like I'm just staring at this creepy show.

1966
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,160
Oh yeah. And then like I think months

1967
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,160
later I like worked up the courage to start

1968
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:29,160
watching it and liked it.

1969
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:31,160
You associate it with

1970
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,160
medical issues and

1971
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,160
I had to introduce the summer I started

1972
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,160
as a tour guide was when Whoopi started

1973
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,160
hosting it and I

1974
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,160
just presented these clips.

1975
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,160
You had to play them and they said we might

1976
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,160
secret shop you.

1977
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,160
So like don't there's this list of things

1978
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,160
you have to do and those include the new

1979
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,160
Whoopi clips because we don't want her getting

1980
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:55,160
on and then you didn't play them all.

1981
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:57,160
She worked hard filming all the

1982
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,160
things. They were threatening

1983
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,160
the Whoopi would do like just a random

1984
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,160
tram tour.

1985
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,160
Undercover boss. No yeah yeah

1986
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,160
she might.

1987
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,160
She is scared of the

1988
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:11,160
plane flight. Is that right?

1989
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:13,160
I don't know when she's the yeah she like I think she

1990
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:15,160
like now famously

1991
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,160
doesn't go on an airplane.

1992
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:19,160
She travels by bus. There was

1993
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:21,160
a rumor when I was in school in

1994
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:23,160
Ithaca that Whoopi had a house

1995
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,160
somewhere on the lake like somewhere

1996
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,160
in the town. Rumor. Because there was

1997
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,160
like people would be like I saw her.

1998
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,160
I saw her and the grocery store had a

1999
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:33,160
video store like built

2000
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:35,160
in. Had a big video section.

2001
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:37,160
Video and DVDs and stuff. And there

2002
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,160
was like a mural of stars

2003
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:41,160
and Whoopi was the biggest.

2004
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,160
And they're like that's a little nod to our

2005
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,160
our local residents. Our neighbors. And I never

2006
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:47,160
quite got an answer of like

2007
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:49,160
is this real? Is this just

2008
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:51,160
like college kids fucking with each other

2009
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:53,160
or is like Whoopi actually? But I was like well

2010
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:55,160
if she needs a vacation place and she doesn't

2011
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:57,160
fly she could train up

2012
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,160
from New York or take a car service.

2013
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,160
Like I was trying to justify

2014
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,160
Whoopi lore. How does this balance

2015
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:05,160
with what you know?

2016
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,160
Yeah. Wow. You went to Ithaca too?

2017
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,160
Yeah. Were you there with the birthday boys?

2018
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:11,160
I was a couple years behind them.

2019
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,160
What is all these people going to Ithaca for?

2020
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,160
That's a college I never even heard of

2021
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,160
until I met those guys. I think I hadn't either.

2022
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:19,160
Yeah.

2023
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,160
The birthday boys were a few

2024
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,160
years older than me and Joe Para was like

2025
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,160
three years younger than me. I didn't know that one.

2026
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:27,160
And Bob Iger went

2027
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,160
there. Iger went there years

2028
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:31,160
before. Andy Seconda and Andy

2029
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:33,160
Daley. They were long before.

2030
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,160
Yeah. John Bally.

2031
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,160
Two colleges I had never heard

2032
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,160
of until I started doing improv was Ithaca

2033
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:41,160
and Emerson. Neither one of those.

2034
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:43,160
Because out here everybody goes to Cal State

2035
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:45,160
Northridge. And if you got better grades

2036
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,160
you go to UCLA.

2037
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,160
Were you one of those? No. Neither. I didn't have

2038
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,160
I went to a small school in Ohio

2039
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:53,160
to play basketball. Oh really? Okay.

2040
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,160
Oh you left and came back. Yeah.

2041
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,160
Were there any theme parks out in Ohio?

2042
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:01,160
Cedar Rapids. I went to Cedar

2043
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:03,160
Rapids. No Cedar Point.

2044
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:05,160
That's all coasters though. I went to Iowa.

2045
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:07,160
I went to Cedar Point.

2046
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:09,160
Didn't I get on anything?

2047
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:11,160
They have a full half court

2048
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,160
basket that you can do three point

2049
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,160
shooting contest on. And I literally

2050
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:17,160
sat on that all day and just won people

2051
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,160
gifts. Wow.

2052
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:21,160
That's a good story. Yeah.

2053
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:23,160
I'm not getting on anything else.

2054
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,160
Who you came with or random people?

2055
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,160
Yeah people who I came with or random

2056
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:29,160
kids if they like if I

2057
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,160
I didn't make enough shots and only got like a little

2058
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,160
bear. But I went home with like three novelty

2059
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:35,160
like basketballs like

2060
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:37,160
University of Florida, University of Michigan

2061
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,160
like and I like

2062
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,160
I was just on that all day like you gotta stop

2063
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,160
like you spent so much money on this.

2064
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,160
I spent like a hundred bucks on that that day

2065
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:47,160
but I was like I'm not getting on anything else

2066
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,160
here at this whole place. Yeah.

2067
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,160
You were that consistent also with your

2068
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,160
three point shots? Oh yeah. Wow.

2069
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,160
Was it like one of those rigged?

2070
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,160
No no no it was just the court. It was just a regular

2071
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:59,160
Yeah yeah. Because they have obviously I'm talking about

2072
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,160
yeah they're like you know like

2073
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:03,160
the three point but the basket

2074
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:05,160
you have to literally like get it perfectly in

2075
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:07,160
and it can't touch anything or else it will fall out.

2076
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:09,160
Yeah no this is just a regular basket.

2077
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:11,160
Yeah Cedar Point is a terrifying one.

2078
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:13,160
There's like you can't like

2079
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,160
everything's fine.

2080
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:17,160
That's only coasters. That's only like

2081
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,160
and the scariest one. And the lake

2082
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:21,160
right? There's a big lake.

2083
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,160
Lake Erie. Yeah.

2084
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,160
Okay.

2085
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:27,160
I'm glad we're tangenting so much because whatever

2086
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,160
it's fine. What do we need

2087
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,160
to say about the uh

2088
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,160
what have we missed? Well

2089
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:35,160
I just loved like Universal

2090
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:37,160
didn't have the best run of movies

2091
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:39,160
in the aughts. Like

2092
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:41,160
it is very funny how

2093
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,160
like how much

2094
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,160
Van Helsing stuff stuck around

2095
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,160
in some of the special effects.

2096
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,160
Van Helsing and then

2097
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:51,160
the

2098
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:53,160
special effect one special effect thing

2099
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,160
I watched where they're doing the Foley.

2100
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:57,160
They had switched it to like alright

2101
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,160
we're gonna do Foley for the scene from

2102
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,160
Evan Almighty.

2103
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:03,160
And it's like oh okay

2104
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:05,160
2009

2105
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:07,160
we're still doing the Evan Almighty

2106
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,160
Foley. There was a

2107
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,160
I'm interested in that because they did

2108
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,160
I didn't see that one but then I saw one with The Clumps

2109
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,160
with Nutty Professor 2. Yeah.

2110
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,160
Clumps was in there for a while. They did that for a while.

2111
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,160
And the video I saw had

2112
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:21,160
a part where they got the volunteer from the audience

2113
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:23,160
and the host says alright so everybody

2114
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:25,160
get ready because Patricia is about to have

2115
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:27,160
dinner with The Clumps.

2116
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,160
Very exciting one.

2117
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,160
And you get to be put in

2118
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,160
like it's like another green screen one right?

2119
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:35,160
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2120
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,160
Yeah that I remember that one.

2121
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:39,160
I think that was like around the last time

2122
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,160
that I was going. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

2123
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:43,160
There's not a

2124
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:45,160
good no one has kept a good

2125
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,160
record of the changes to

2126
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,160
the show. I was trying to find

2127
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,160
no one gives a shit.

2128
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:53,160
Scorpion King Shrek

2129
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:55,160
Did you go through the YouTube or did you find a

2130
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,160
No I just found a couple

2131
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:59,160
of lists on the Studio

2132
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,160
Tour dot com which catalogues

2133
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:03,160
Universal Hollywood stuff. A couple of months ago I watched

2134
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,160
a studio tour from like 1986

2135
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,160
just to see what it was

2136
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,160
see what was different from when I was doing in the early

2137
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,160
2000s. Yeah. And

2138
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:13,160
there was like a laser. King Kong

2139
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,160
was still there. Yeah. Which I believe it

2140
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:17,160
is still there. Burned down.

2141
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,160
Oh it burned down. Yeah. So now they have like a

2142
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:21,160
3D Kong. Oh okay.

2143
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,160
Yeah. That old King Kong was there

2144
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:25,160
from like 1976 like from when the movie

2145
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,160
came out. For a long time. Yeah.

2146
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:29,160
Made a long time. Yeah. Big awesome robot.

2147
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:31,160
That was one of the best parts of that job. Yeah.

2148
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,160
I see that all the time. You would yell at

2149
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,160
right? You would yell at Kong? Yeah.

2150
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:37,160
That was your favorite part? Yes. Cause I'd stand up

2151
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:39,160
and really give it a lot of gusto and like make

2152
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:41,160
it about make it personal about the people

2153
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:43,160
in the tram like

2154
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:45,160
like if anyone take

2155
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:47,160
me I've lived my life but these

2156
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:49,160
children they are young

2157
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:51,160
they've done nothing to upset you

2158
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,160
don't take a rag around on them.

2159
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:55,160
Did you feel the audience

2160
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:57,160
liked it? Or were you just sort of

2161
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,160
like what I was doing? Yeah.

2162
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,160
They weren't paying attention. Okay.

2163
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:03,160
It was for me more than anything. That's my question.

2164
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,160
I think they liked that I stood up and like shook

2165
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,160
my fist and leaned out of the

2166
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:09,160
I like really gave it cause

2167
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:11,160
it's the worst to have the people just like

2168
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:13,160
alright now we're about to see King Kong

2169
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:15,160
uh if you feel his man of breath

2170
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:17,160
and the heat of the flames

2171
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,160
that doesn't make any narrative sense. Why would the

2172
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:21,160
person be bored by King Kong?

2173
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,160
You have man breath. I like that

2174
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:25,160
banana breath. That was always funny.

2175
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:27,160
Now the Peter Jackson King Kong feels

2176
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:29,160
like it got put in everywhere

2177
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:31,160
in that park so quickly. Yes.

2178
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,160
So much. Well that's what

2179
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:35,160
When it was coming out

2180
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:37,160
while it was out while the DVD was

2181
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,160
at like this special effects show they just like

2182
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:41,160
you know the 2004 Kong

2183
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:43,160
starring Adrian Brody and

2184
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:45,160
Naomi Watts. You love it. You all love it.

2185
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,160
That movie was just sold to us.

2186
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:49,160
It's like this is

2187
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,160
it's the Lord of the Rings guy and you love this.

2188
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:53,160
To tie it back to

2189
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:55,160
Whoopi, the my most

2190
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:57,160
hated video on the tram

2191
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,160
was where she is outside actually

2192
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:01,160
of Halford Hitchcock's bungalow.

2193
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,160
The bungalows were producers of offices

2194
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:05,160
on the lot and she

2195
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:07,160
gets a megaphone out and she has a message

2196
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:09,160
for the various producers who were around there

2197
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,160
and she says people

2198
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,160
of Hollywood producers

2199
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,160
I've got a pitch for you

2200
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:17,160
less movies with giant

2201
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,160
monkeys more movies

2202
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,160
with me.

2203
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:23,160
It plays out at about that speed.

2204
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,160
No one laughs. Never

2205
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:27,160
in several summers not one person

2206
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,160
ever laughed at this. Then

2207
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:31,160
she repeats it.

2208
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,160
Less movies with the giant

2209
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:35,160
monkey. It's slower this

2210
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,160
time and I have to play this.

2211
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:39,160
I have no idea. It dies a horrible

2212
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:41,160
death every single time.

2213
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:43,160
I don't blame her as much as whoever

2214
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,160
wrote it. This was a garbage video.

2215
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:47,160
If you ever had to sit through this on the tram

2216
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,160
any listeners I apologize

2217
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:51,160
and trust me the tour guides

2218
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:53,160
did not want to play it. I am sure I saw this.

2219
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,160
I have no memory of this. I mean I really all I do

2220
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:57,160
remember is just her getting eaten by scarabs.

2221
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:59,160
Yes. Yeah. I remember that.

2222
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:01,160
I think that might have been like around the last time.

2223
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:03,160
I'm trying to figure out when's the last time I went

2224
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:05,160
to Universal.

2225
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,160
I graduated high school 2007. It had to be

2226
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,160
around 06.

2227
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:11,160
Probably when you were doing like

2228
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:13,160
had to be around that time. Yeah.

2229
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:15,160
Like the last time.

2230
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,160
Absolutely still would have been Whoopi.

2231
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,160
But Whoopi's still on it now as I said before.

2232
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:21,160
She gets eaten still right?

2233
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:23,160
Yes. The rest of it is Jimmy Fallon but they

2234
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,160
couldn't figure out how to get her out of the mummy part.

2235
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:27,160
So now if you go on the tram what happens is

2236
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:29,160
Whoopi Goldberg suddenly appears

2237
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:31,160
and is eaten by bugs immediately and that's

2238
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:33,160
it. You don't know why she showed up.

2239
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:35,160
It's totally out of context.

2240
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:37,160
She hasn't appeared before. All of a sudden

2241
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,160
they cut to her. Which I kind of like

2242
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:41,160
that you have to say. It's bizarre.

2243
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:43,160
Whoopi Goldberg.

2244
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:45,160
And she is and then the bugs come.

2245
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,160
But so much, yeah so much King Kong.

2246
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:49,160
And so much mummy.

2247
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:51,160
Because at one point in time

2248
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:53,160
I was trying to add this up that

2249
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:55,160
okay so there's that. There's that part of the

2250
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,160
tour where the room spins around and that's based on the mummy.

2251
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,160
That's not there anymore. You could go there at one point

2252
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:01,160
you could go to Universal and go to that. It's part of the

2253
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:03,160
tram. Then there's a maze

2254
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:05,160
of the mummy. Then there's the mummy

2255
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:07,160
coaster, the ride of course.

2256
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:09,160
And then also the

2257
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:11,160
part of this tour where the guy gets

2258
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:13,160
electrocuted. There were four

2259
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:15,160
mummy attractions in a

2260
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,160
very limited park at one point in time.

2261
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:19,160
The Scorpion King movie

2262
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:21,160
and the Brendan Fraser mummies were

2263
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:23,160
like huge hits.

2264
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,160
But big enough to justify four

2265
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:27,160
attractions? And getting rid of them.

2266
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:29,160
It's them tying together.

2267
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:31,160
I'm a big mummy fan. I do love that Brendan Fraser mummy.

2268
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,160
Bring it back. Reboot it.

2269
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:37,160
I think it's them also

2270
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:39,160
high on their own supply.

2271
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,160
The mummy, we made the classic

2272
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:43,160
mummy and now the mummy's

2273
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:45,160
back. It seems odd though that

2274
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:47,160
they would have gotten rid of the back to the future thing to

2275
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,160
put the mummy in. Because everyone loves back to

2276
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:51,160
the future and still loves back to the future.

2277
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:53,160
And the mummy hasn't I would argue maybe not

2278
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:55,160
lasted like back to the future.

2279
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:57,160
Well it's like when they say like so

2280
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:59,160
the universe has made some of the most memorable

2281
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:01,160
moments in movie history.

2282
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:03,160
And it's like yeah it's Hitchcock stuff

2283
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:05,160
and like classic movie

2284
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,160
monsters and then the minions and

2285
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:09,160
like it's the characters from Sing.

2286
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:11,160
And it's like I don't know

2287
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:13,160
as a society agreed these

2288
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,160
things are equal yet.

2289
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:17,160
Also

2290
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:19,160
I saw a video that had a lot of

2291
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:21,160
heroes. They had to push

2292
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:23,160
heroes everywhere.

2293
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,160
Claire Bennett the cheerleader.

2294
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:27,160
Save the cheerleader.

2295
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:29,160
As they constantly say Claire Bennett the cheerleader.

2296
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:31,160
I think

2297
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:33,160
this show I think this used to be a great show

2298
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:35,160
and then it just became like a dumping ground for

2299
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,160
what do we have to promote that's from recent.

2300
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:39,160
One of the newer ones on

2301
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:41,160
the upper lot it's like and now we're going to Foley

2302
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:43,160
the film Identity Thief

2303
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:45,160
starring Jason Bateman and Melissa

2304
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:47,160
McCarthy. Yeah. And you're like what?

2305
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:49,160
Yeah that's a trip. And then they love the guy on

2306
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:51,160
fire.

2307
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:53,160
And then I watched the family do it

2308
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:55,160
and the bit kills still. Oh yeah.

2309
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,160
It's still funny. Like she throws something

2310
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:59,160
in Bateman's head and like it hits in one

2311
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:01,160
of the family like hits like a pan.

2312
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:03,160
Cowbell I think it is. Yeah.

2313
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:05,160
That's the thing about this show. It all

2314
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,160
kills. It was all great. Yeah. I

2315
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:09,160
think legitimately they always did a good

2316
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:11,160
job with it. And you

2317
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,160
if you have fun memories of it and you

2318
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,160
went like constantly. Yeah.

2319
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:17,160
That's a testament to it. It was always

2320
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:19,160
very fun. I really enjoyed

2321
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:21,160
going. I remember I would go in the back

2322
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:23,160
draft and I remember

2323
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:25,160
saying it's like such a loser ass kid

2324
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:27,160
because I would go every week.

2325
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:29,160
And so I knew that the pipes were going to fall

2326
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:31,160
and I remember like looking at a person

2327
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:33,160
being like you might not want to stand

2328
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:35,160
there. I'm not going

2329
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:37,160
to tell you why.

2330
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:39,160
Like a little dickhead kid.

2331
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:41,160
So like ruining surprise

2332
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:43,160
for me. I've outsmarted this

2333
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:45,160
thing. Yeah. I know what you mean.

2334
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,160
And then still being scared when the pipes fell

2335
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:49,160
because you don't know exactly when they're going to fall.

2336
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:51,160
Yeah.

2337
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:53,160
I was just going to say, did

2338
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:55,160
you watch the upper lot version

2339
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:57,160
of the show? Yes.

2340
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:59,160
We didn't talk about who

2341
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:01,160
the new mocap thing is.

2342
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:03,160
Oh, yeah. What is it?

2343
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:05,160
It's a little bear named Ted.

2344
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,160
Oh, yeah.

2345
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:09,160
Ted is now in the show.

2346
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:11,160
And instead of fluffy, it's Ted.

2347
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,160
And Ted doesn't kill anybody or anything.

2348
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:15,160
But he's he says

2349
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,160
I think he says friggin sweet at a certain

2350
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:19,160
point. And then like he hits his butt

2351
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:21,160
and he goes like this is for the ladies.

2352
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:23,160
Yeah. He shakes his butt out.

2353
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,160
Shaking his butt and like slapping his own butt.

2354
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:27,160
Yeah. That probably works

2355
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:29,160
pretty well. Yeah, it works great. Getting Ted

2356
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:31,160
in the park is not the worst idea.

2357
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:33,160
It'd be a little outdated if there was a Ted ride now.

2358
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:35,160
But maybe they should have had a walker.

2359
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:37,160
Ted is on the tour by the bungalows.

2360
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:39,160
There's that big Ted. There's a statue

2361
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:41,160
with Ted. Yeah. He has a martini.

2362
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:43,160
He has a martini, yes.

2363
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:45,160
That's that crazy son of a bitch.

2364
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:47,160
He's doing it. Ted III eventually.

2365
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:49,160
Or MacFarlane too busy

2366
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:51,160
with the Orville.

2367
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,160
With his Star Trek.

2368
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:55,160
Yes. I read a rumor that he was going to

2369
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:57,160
buy Star Trek the other day.

2370
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:59,160
What? Buy it?

2371
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:01,160
I'm not saying that's going to happen. Yes, he was going to buy

2372
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,160
it from Viacom.

2373
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:05,160
How do you guys think money

2374
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:07,160
works at that point?

2375
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:09,160
Money is not real.

2376
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:11,160
When you're having that discussion, it's like oh, money isn't

2377
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:13,160
real. Ratings, numbers

2378
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:15,160
are not real.

2379
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:17,160
But he's one of those people where if you ever stop

2380
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:19,160
and add up, you know,

2381
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:21,160
all right, so he gets money just from like

2382
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:23,160
one episode of being a voice actor.

2383
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:25,160
Let alone that he's on every episode

2384
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,160
of many shows

2385
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:29,160
that air all the time. Let alone that

2386
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:31,160
he also wrote the shows. Let alone that he's also in Ted.

2387
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:33,160
Let alone that like, does he have like

2388
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:35,160
seven billion dollars? How much money

2389
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,160
does this guy? Yeah. He's got a lot of money.

2390
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:39,160
He's got a lot of money. Probably. So he could

2391
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:41,160
buy Star Trek, honestly. But

2392
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:43,160
does he like write a check?

2393
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,160
For Star Trek? He pays you the order of Star Trek.

2394
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,160
Yeah.

2395
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:49,160
To Captain Picard.

2396
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:51,160
Yeah, he buys it from Captain Picard.

2397
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:53,160
Money's like wired at that point, right?

2398
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:55,160
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, he is a guy.

2399
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:57,160
And then that guy does

2400
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:59,160
it. Yeah. Through something

2401
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:01,160
that we don't even understand. Yeah. It's like

2402
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:03,160
a computer, but it's not. Like we...

2403
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:05,160
It's through a holding corp. It's called like

2404
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,160
Giggity Giggity Inc.

2405
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:09,160
Yes.

2406
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:11,160
But it's in like a different country and

2407
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:13,160
you have to go there to

2408
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:15,160
buy Star Trek.

2409
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:17,160
Congrats. Congrats on the purchase.

2410
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,160
So I guess, yeah, let's confirm the rumor. Seth McFarlane

2411
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:21,160
is buying Star Trek. He's buying Star Trek.

2412
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:25,160
He's done. He just got on a flight to Switzerland.

2413
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:27,160
Um, because

2414
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:29,160
Orville was suddenly in the Star Trek universe,

2415
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:31,160
that'd be pretty crazy. Oh, he just

2416
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:33,160
combines them? Yeah, maybe. Why not?

2417
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:35,160
He is just making Star Trek.

2418
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:37,160
So why not?

2419
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:39,160
Get... Jonathan Frakes directs Orville episodes.

2420
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:41,160
Oh, really? Yes, Jonathan Frakes is a

2421
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,160
successful television director.

2422
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:45,160
Yeah. In the second half of his career.

2423
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:47,160
Wow. Alright. So the ultimate

2424
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:49,160
spaceman. And then eventually it'll all buy

2425
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,160
Star Wars back from Disney.

2426
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:53,160
Yeah. Star Trek and Star Wars will combine

2427
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:55,160
at a certain point. Star Wars versus

2428
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:57,160
Star Trek can finally happen. What a dream.

2429
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:59,160
There was an X-Men versus Star Trek

2430
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:01,160
comic I had and I was obsessed with it.

2431
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:03,160
Cool. And the only thing I can remember

2432
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:05,160
is that Kirk hits on Jean Grey.

2433
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:09,160
That's pretty exciting, huh?

2434
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:11,160
Did Stan Lee

2435
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:13,160
draw her naked?

2436
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:15,160
He drew her naked and

2437
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:17,160
signed the boob and then he drew Kirk naked and

2438
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:19,160
signed his penis.

2439
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:21,160
I'm drawing Captain Kirk

2440
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:23,160
nude for the first time.

2441
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,160
Look close. That's not a

2442
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:27,160
pub.

2443
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,160
It's my signature. It's my signature.

2444
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,160
I'm drawing now.

2445
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:33,160
What? Any other memories of this

2446
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:35,160
thing we missed? There's a guy on

2447
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:37,160
fire. A guy gets lit on fire. Oh yeah.

2448
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:39,160
Yeah. That's cool. And the audience

2449
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:41,160
just seems horrified by it more than

2450
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:43,160
anything. They all kind of feel like, oh.

2451
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:45,160
The image is haunting of a

2452
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:47,160
man on fire. Guy's really

2453
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,160
upset. It's kind of

2454
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:51,160
upsetting.

2455
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:53,160
There's a weird preamble to it where they're

2456
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:55,160
like dousing them with chemicals

2457
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:57,160
to show you how they prevent it.

2458
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:59,160
He's got a face mask on.

2459
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:01,160
They all just seem

2460
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:03,160
miserable. Like, I gotta get lit on fire again

2461
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:05,160
today. God damn it.

2462
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,160
He's like counting

2463
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,160
down like, all right, I've been lit on fire three times.

2464
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:11,160
Just three more to go.

2465
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:13,160
Might be lunch soon.

2466
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:15,160
Yeah. He's only that dog Brown's chicken.

2467
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:19,160
Yeah.

2468
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:21,160
I can't imagine that job.

2469
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:23,160
No. Probably not.

2470
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:25,160
Because on a movie set, maybe you do it

2471
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:27,160
like once per shoot. Like a day.

2472
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:29,160
There's a day of being lit on fire.

2473
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,160
All day. But all day, every

2474
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:33,160
day, five days a week.

2475
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:35,160
Being lit on fire at Universal

2476
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:37,160
Studios.

2477
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:39,160
If you're a fire person, let us know how it is.

2478
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:41,160
We'll come talk to us.

2479
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:43,160
More exciting for an audience than learning about how

2480
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:45,160
they created all the fairies in Hellboy

2481
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:47,160
2, The Golden Army. Another

2482
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:49,160
segment that stuck around for a while.

2483
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:51,160
That's not, yeah.

2484
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:53,160
But they still do the fire,

2485
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:55,160
right? Somebody gets lit on fire still?

2486
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:57,160
I believe so. In the new show.

2487
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:59,160
In the new show, for sure.

2488
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:01,160
We don't like as much what they're doing these days

2489
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:03,160
in these identity thieves and Hellboys.

2490
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:05,160
What are they, we're

2491
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:07,160
forgetting to plus it up. How do we make this show

2492
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:09,160
great again? How do we take it back to its glory

2493
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,160
days? Make this special effects show

2494
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:13,160
great again.

2495
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:15,160
I like that phrase.

2496
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:17,160
Do we bring back maybe Harry

2497
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:19,160
and Fluffy fight?

2498
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:21,160
Harry and Fluffy fight.

2499
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:23,160
Ted though. Yeah, him too.

2500
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:25,160
Ted falls off the Statue of Liberty.

2501
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:27,160
Sure. Like in Saboteur.

2502
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:29,160
Well what's popular now? What is popular

2503
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:31,160
in 2020? Minions. Minions are still

2504
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:33,160
popular. I don't know what

2505
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:35,160
Universal makes right now. Jurassic

2506
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:37,160
World. Well they made

2507
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:39,160
Cats and

2508
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:41,160
what's the other big one? Doolittle.

2509
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:43,160
Cats and Doolittle are their

2510
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:45,160
properties. I wish those were hits

2511
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:47,160
though. Cause a Cats thing,

2512
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:49,160
a special effects Cats show.

2513
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:51,160
Where you mocap, move the

2514
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:53,160
cats around. Yeah, where you rum tum tugger.

2515
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:55,160
Yeah.

2516
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:57,160
That'd be tight. Yeah.

2517
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:59,160
Maybe this is a separate attraction

2518
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:01,160
but like Universal doing a show

2519
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:03,160
that is the Jellicle Ball.

2520
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:05,160
You get to go to the Jellicle Ball.

2521
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:07,160
You couldn't be mad at that. Sure.

2522
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:09,160
That would be good. Cat themed drinks.

2523
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:11,160
Doolittle.

2524
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:13,160
I don't know if you've read about Doolittle

2525
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:15,160
at all. Doolittle

2526
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:17,160
is not the greatest

2527
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:19,160
movie in the world. It ends with Robert Dunning Jr

2528
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:21,160
as Doolittle pulling bagpipes out of a

2529
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:23,160
dragon's asshole.

2530
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:25,160
Okay, I'm in.

2531
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:27,160
So maybe I've sold it now.

2532
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:29,160
That's the climax of the movie. That's like

2533
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:31,160
the last thing he has to do when the movie is over.

2534
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,160
So

2535
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,160
something like with a dragon.

2536
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:37,160
Well then, okay, so clearly what it is

2537
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:39,160
and any of you guys feel free to be

2538
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:41,160
the volunteer but let me just, I'll be

2539
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:43,160
the host and then it's very

2540
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:45,160
important that when the red button goes

2541
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:47,160
then you need to make the sound

2542
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:49,160
effect of bagpipes coming

2543
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:51,160
out of a dragon's asshole. Okay,

2544
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:53,160
so here we go. Look up at the screen and

2545
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:55,160
Doolittle is pulling them out and

2546
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:57,160
vroom, brrrr.

2547
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:59,160
Vroom, brrrr.

2548
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,160
Oh, dear.

2549
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:03,160
And now we just need one more

2550
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:05,160
thing. We're about to go live. We're going to go live

2551
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:07,160
to theaters with Doolittle

2552
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:09,160
It's broadcasting in one minute

2553
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:11,160
and we need what is the sound

2554
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:13,160
that the dragon, the pain sound that

2555
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:15,160
the dragon makes and here we go

2556
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:17,160
in three, two, one

2557
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:19,160
Arrrrr Instagram

2558
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:21,160
Alright, now we need you all to help

2559
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:23,160
ADR Doolittle's lines because when

2560
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:25,160
Robert did the first pass he couldn't understand

2561
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:27,160
his Welsh accent so we need you all to say

2562
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:29,160
It's okay to be scared

2563
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:31,160
all at once. Alright?

2564
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:33,160
Alright, on three. One, two, three

2565
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:35,160
It's okay to be scared

2566
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:37,160
It's okay to be scared

2567
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:39,160
We all make the same thing

2568
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:41,160
Oh, hey

2569
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:43,160
And very good

2570
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:45,160
We saved Doolittle

2571
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:47,160
Enjoy the rest of your day

2572
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:49,160
Enjoy the rest of your day

2573
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:51,160
The box office numbers are shooting up

2574
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:53,160
It's 300 million in a weekend

2575
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:55,160
It's bigger than Iron Man

2576
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:57,160
It's profitable. You did it

2577
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:59,160
Alright, thanks Carl, Mike, Scott

2578
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,160
and Jason

2579
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:03,160
And Carl, you survived podcast

2580
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:05,160
The Ride. Thanks for being here

2581
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:07,160
Thanks for having me. You can cut out some of those tangents

2582
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:09,160
Never, never

2583
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:11,160
What do you mean?

2584
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:13,160
We'll cut out the regular stuff

2585
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:15,160
We'll cut out the stuff about the topic instead

2586
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:17,160
Hey, let's exit through the gift shop

2587
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:19,160
Is there anything Carl that you would like to plug?

2588
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:21,160
Listen to the flagrant ones

2590
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:25,160
into your Seth MacFarlane pants

2591

and take out your five dollars

2592
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:29,160

01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:33,160

Do you have any like

2602
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:49,160
I'd like to get better at rides

2603
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:51,160
Or is it just

2604
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:53,160
Oh no, I've settled into

2605
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:55,160
Yeah, I'm not gonna be done

2606
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:57,160
What about a Horror Nights situation?

2607
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:59,160
I don't do that type of stuff either

2608
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:01,160
I'll punch somebody

2609
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:03,160
Alright, you're speaking my language

2610
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:05,160
Hey, we also have a Patreon

2611
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:07,160

Let's do both at once

2613
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:11,160
Double drive to

2614
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:13,160
Flagrant ones and to ours

2615
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:15,160

2619
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:23,160
And we're

2620
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:25,160
Almost done with the lower lot

2621
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:27,160
We've covered almost all the attractions

2622
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:29,160
Down here, not Transformers yet

2623
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:31,160
And not Lucy Attribute

2624
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:33,160
I feel like we gotta be heading to Lucy Attribute

2625
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:35,160
I'm still building to that opus

2626
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:37,160
Lucy Attribute is gonna be

2627
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:39,160
Two plus, I think

2628
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,160
That's gonna be a big one

2629
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:43,160
We're recording second episode after this Scott

2630
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:45,160
That I think will be one of your like dissertation

2631
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:47,160
Like opuses

2632
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:49,160
Lucy Attribute

2633
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:51,160
Yeah, I pushed it cause I was sick

2634
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:53,160
And I didn't feel up to it but now I think I'm ready

2635
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:55,160
I think, but we'll see

2636
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:57,160
I might collapse during it

2637
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:59,160
But if you wanna know what that's all about go to the second gate

2638
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:01,160
But hey

2639
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:03,160
Thanks for listening and

2640
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:05,160
Thanks for celebrating the magic of the movies

2641
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:07,160
And it's okay to be scared

2642
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:09,160
