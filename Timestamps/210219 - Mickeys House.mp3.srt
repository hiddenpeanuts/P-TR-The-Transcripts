1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,240
Warning, the following podcast takes you into the sacred home of a very large mouse.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,640
We're going to rifle through all his stuff, sporting equipment, keepsakes, and his freshly

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,520
grown sentient vegetables.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,520
Is this place Mickey's Graceland, or is it not as good as that?

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,680
It's Mickey's House, today on Podcast The Ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,080
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the podcast about theme parks hosted by three very good boys

9
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,840
who promise that if they're about to swear in this episode, they will instead stop and

10
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,240
say, oh gosh, I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Mike Carlson, do you agree?

11
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,400
Oh, I do agree to that.

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400
That seems hard.

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,200
It seems like I'm going to forget, but maybe I just won't swear.

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,040
Maybe I'll just be like in my most polite mode and I just won't swear at all.

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,040
I may do.

16
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,720
I may say that in other ways, in other contexts, but we'll see.

17
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:22,440
It's tough because really, gosh, mainly replaces like the, an exclamation of the F word or

18
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,440
another word.

19
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,640
It might not like replace effing, but it can.

20
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,640
Let's just try to remember to say gushing.

21
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,640
Gushing.

22
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Gushing.

23
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,560
So gushing angry.

24
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,040
It's what Mickey would do.

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,880
Jason Sheridan joins us as well.

26
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,880
You know what?

27
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,680
This might not be a bad idea that we finally address my mother's letters.

28
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,000
Why do you gotta curse so much?

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,840
So you know, because this could be a good episode to point out to, like, oh, this one's

30
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
clean.

31
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,840
This finally won.

32
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,640
Yes, other than this, we did discuss her those specific concerns.

33
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,160
We talked about swearing, but we didn't swear.

34
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:08,480
I just had the moment finally with my mom where now that I have a kid, there was the

35
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,280
little discussion where I copped to, I was like, yeah, I don't know if he can see like

36
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,140
a lot of the stuff I've made.

37
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:21,760
And then she, that was, I gave her too much because my mom like, see, that's right.

38
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,760
The things she's been trying to tell me since she told me that Monsignor Loftus wouldn't

39
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,560
like the movie I made in high school.

40
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,720
I was like, well, now you never thought about that one day.

41
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
You'd have a child.

42
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,400
You'd want to show them something.

43
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,680
So I, I don't know.

44
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,040
I gave her too much.

45
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,480
I was too generous by even saying that.

46
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
Yeah.

47
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,000
So, but you did pledge to never make anything other than a G rated piece of entertainment

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
going forward, I assume.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,640
I didn't go so far as to say the rating.

50
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:01,440
I mean, I would think that PG-13 would be fine because one day he'll be 13.

51
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,400
But you get one, there's one gosh bomb.

52
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,400
PG-13 movies get one gosh bomb, but they cannot be about the act.

53
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,400
It's what G stands for is gosh.

54
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,440
TVG means there'll be no word more extreme than gosh.

55
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,560
I think you could probably go back and make cleaned up versions of everything you've made,

56
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,760
maybe do like a new cut of everything.

57
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,800
I assume you have them all on hard drives and really just take out all the cursing and

58
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,960
all the suggestive situations.

59
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,040
Yeah, that's true.

60
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,160
There's certain ones where almost everything would have to be gotten rid of.

61
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,320
Well, reshoot.

62
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,480
I mean, you can reshoot.

63
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,840
There's like the Snyder cut is coming out very soon.

64
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,840
That was, you know, he did a little new photography.

65
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,840
That's true.

66
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
A lot of new CGI.

67
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
So, yeah.

68
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,600
Well, like I'm trying to think of one.

69
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:02,000
My video, Juggalo News, I did a video, there was a cable news channel for fans of Insane

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Clown Posse.

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,200
And by the, okay, so that's 10 years old.

72
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:13,000
By 10 years from now, the Juggalos and making fun of them will be still unbelievably relevant.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,680
I'm going to want my son to see that.

74
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,380
And even though they swear that and that's part of the joke, they can't, that's not going

75
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,380
to work for him.

76
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:26,760
So, yeah, I can round everybody back up and or at least like just film, film new lips,

77
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:33,960
just film some face painted lips and drop them on top of the people we can't get anymore.

78
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,960
Yeah.

79
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,480
Like in the, you know, what George Lucas redid some of those from the special editions for

80
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,800
Return of the Jedi, he found that woman, the green woman in Jabba's palace again, and he's

81
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,560
put her back in the makeup and it was like nobody noticed.

82
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,560
I'm going to do that too.

83
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,440
I'm going to go into my old videos, get rid of any swearing or sexual content, but also

84
00:04:50,440 --> 00:05:00,200
have the like the green lady and I'll put in that song that rocks.

85
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,160
It's oh, Jedi rocks.

86
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,160
Jedi rocks.

87
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,160
Yes.

88
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,120
And then Jabba will turn to the camera and go, we live in a society.

89
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,680
And everyone goes, yes.

90
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
Yeah.

91
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,640
What's all that we live in a society lately?

92
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,360
I've been seeing this in the feed a lot.

93
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,320
I don't quite understand.

94
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,040
I think it's a meme that got out of control.

95
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:26,400
I think it's it's like a silly, you know, well, Joker says it in the trailer for the

96
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,520
new Justice League for the new Justice League, but I think it's it's a nod to the memes about

97
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,520
the Joker comes from.

98
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,520
Yeah.

99
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,240
This is really a modern Snakes on a Plane where you insert meme culture into the trailer

100
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,720
and into the film itself after the fact.

101
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,840
The whole movie is kind of a new Snakes on a Plane.

102
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,960
Yes, it's kind of a massive Snakes on a Plane.

103
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,720
Yeah, it's it's an edge Lord meme.

104
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Yeah.

105
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,880
Jason, what's an edge Lord?

106
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:06,120
An edge Lord is like someone who is like purposely transgressive or like says something, you

107
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,360
know, pushes the boundaries just to do it.

108
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,320
Someone who tries to appear edgy by doing or saying risque or offensive things.

109
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
That's Scott.

110
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,320
It's me with my videos.

111
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,920
Yeah, that's what Scott is.

112
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,000
My videos and my mild swears on this podcast.

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,920
Yeah, your mom says, Scott, your mom thinks you're an edge Lord.

114
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:32,920
She says with shame to her friends, she learned the phrase and will say on her book club Zooms,

115
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,760
my son, I don't even want to talk about it.

116
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,320
He's become he's become an edge Lord.

117
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,160
My son, the edge Lord.

118
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,600
I've seen your loft is saying, oh, that's got to turn into a real edge Lord.

119
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:50,720
But it is now that we must pray for the edge Lords the most that they can find their way

120
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,600
back from the edge towards the center where we live.

121
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,720
And we say nothing more than gosh.

122
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,240
So help us, gosh.

123
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,240
Help us, gosh.

124
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,200
Jason is the podcast, the right messy boy and Scott is podcast, the right edge Lord.

125
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
Wow.

126
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:13,680
Now, you know, this is one I like, like any like slightly any 2% controversial opinions

127
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,040
I have or mild swears all put in the bucket of me being the edge Lord, my my not really

128
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:24,200
caring for the land boat ride that that was really the beginnings of Scott, the edge Lord.

129
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,040
Yeah, you're being risque.

130
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,320
You're being edgy.

131
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,000
Wow.

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,640
This is great.

133
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,000
This is a great new branding for you going into a year or whatever we are three or what?

134
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,400
How long are we doing this?

135
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,760
It's time to yeah, it's time for me to clarify the character.

136
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,600
And it's the character is edge Lord.

137
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,000
Is there an example of who else is an edge Lord to see?

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,080
So I know who I'm kind of sharing the term with.

139
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,000
Who are edge Lords?

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,560
Well, it's usually used dismissively.

141
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:59,440
So like people who don't like like Chappo Trap House calls those guys edge Lords.

142
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,800
OK, so it's kind of a mockery, but I'm taking the term back.

143
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,200
I'm making being an edge Lord cool.

144
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,160
Yeah, yeah, I mean, there's probably probably associated with some awful people.

145
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,000
So we're probably. Oh, yeah, there.

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,640
Yeah, there's some real scumbags.

147
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,360
You know, you're taking it back for her.

148
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,000
You're on the better side of it, I assume.

149
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,240
I'm moving the age.

150
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,160
I'm moving the boundaries of the edge to a little bit of a gentler place.

151
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,880
But yeah, but still, I am.

152
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,440
I'm on the edge of a slightly less far edge.

153
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,840
We talk we talk about me being an edge Lord in an episode

154
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,040
that's about Mickey Mouse's house.

155
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,720
Mickey Mouse, the original edge Lord, telling people to go

156
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,720
soak their head fresh boy.

157
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,240
I mean, the old comic strips, the old Floyd got.

158
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,560
I always mispronounce it.

159
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,880
I think it's Godfrey.

160
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,080
The old like Daily Comic Strip's me is always pulling a gun.

161
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,760
I mean, back in the day, like a gun used to be a lot more like an ax or screwdriver.

162
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,800
They were just kind of sitting around in the tool shed or like in a drawer or something.

163
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,960
Yeah, that was not as big of a deal, I guess.

164
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,400
Yeah, I don't.

165
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
There's I have not.

166
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,520
I did not see any firearms in the current iterations of Mickey's house.

167
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,400
Mickey's house, Mickey's country house or the more generic meat, Mickey's.

168
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,920
I've not seen any gun racks.

169
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,720
No, I don't think so.

170
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,000
Not even like a silly cartoon gun with eyes or something.

171
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,480
You see a lot of his belongings, but oh, yeah, yeah, not not that.

172
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,520
Not the like fun bullets from who?

173
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,240
Friend Roger Rabbit. But yeah, so he hides it, I guess, if he's got one.

174
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,880
And I think he probably has one.

175
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,640
They have a gun and lonesome ghosts when they're ghost hunting.

176
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,520
I'm pretty sure. Yeah, they have.

177
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,360
Yeah, they have like a right.

178
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,640
Yeah, a double barreled shotgun, I think.

179
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,760
I think so. Remember who wields it?

180
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,000
Maybe they all have one.

181
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,400
He will in the old west in an old west.

182
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,800
But you sort of like assume that that'll have a couple couple revolvers or whatever.

183
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,320
Yeah, there's not really a good gun store in Toontown.

184
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,600
If I think about it, that really doesn't have that's not one of the facades there.

185
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,000
It's got to be it's like an underground thing.

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,080
Like one of the stores is a front to like the not the maybe not the five and dime

187
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,800
or maybe the back of the like maybe once in a while,

188
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,600
if they make a mistake, that conveyor belt with all the gloves and all the fun items.

189
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,440
Oh, yeah.

190
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,040
Just by mistake once a day, one of the gloves has a gun dangling down.

191
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,880
Mm hmm. Yeah, that's probably right.

192
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,240
It would be funny.

193
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,680
I mean, if they made Toontown, I'm sure in the 60s,

194
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,560
for sure, there would be more cartoon guns.

195
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,160
There'd be no doubt about it.

196
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,760
Cigarettes. Yeah.

197
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,840
Yeah. Too modern.

198
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,800
But really odd old timey condoms.

199
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,880
Work condoms were weird in the 60s, right?

200
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,200
You'd have to you'd have to imagine there was well, by the sorry, Jason,

201
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,320
your mom can't listen to this.

202
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,400
Oh, that's me.

203
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:47,760
The edge.

204
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,080
Learn strikes again.

205
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,320
Edge Lord.

206
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,520
I don't know.

207
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,240
In the I feel like it's always just like in period piece movies are always like,

208
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,920
oh, what do you need?

209
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,440
Well, are you a sailor?

210
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,240
Like there's always jokes about sailors using them.

211
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,040
They were only for sailors.

212
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,320
I yeah, I know.

213
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,400
When people being risky going from port to port, having different

214
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,200
affairs, I assumed it was a full body piece of clothing or something that you

215
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,800
that that's what it was in the old days.

216
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,240
I don't know. I don't have any information.

217
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,880
I'm just guessing it was sort of like a full like pajama set

218
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,400
you would have to put on some sort of condom would be.

219
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,000
What was that?

220
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,520
Some sort of felt small.

221
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,600
A diving bell.

222
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,760
You're a full diving bell.

223
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,680
Mike, are we just thinking of a diving bell?

224
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,040
Possibly a doctor would have to administrate it.

225
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,440
Who would have to have to put it on?

226
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,400
Yeah. Yeah.

227
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,480
It's made of copper.

228
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,240
There's a bunch of bolts in it.

229
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,880
Yeah, it was.

230
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,760
Yeah, it's a whole to do.

231
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,280
Mm hmm.

232
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,560
A cartoon condom would be insane because cartoons are already so bendy

233
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,440
and squashy and that's kind of what a condom does already.

234
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,200
Look, I haven't read much Fritz the Cat, but I assume it's in there.

235
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,840
I assume the oh, the information is in there if you want to.

236
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,360
If you want to read about it, I'm sure that Fritz

237
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,000
the Cat is for sure some exhausting edgelord bullshit like.

238
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,040
Oh, yeah.

239
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,640
Oh, that was before edgelords were cool.

240
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,400
That was long ago when edgelords were annoying before me.

241
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,560
Oh, yes.

242
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,360
Well, before you took it, the turn back and made it cool.

243
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,800
Yeah, not like exhausting like Robert Crumb.

244
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,200
He Ashbury comic bullshit.

245
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,840
I see. Yeah.

246
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,720
Let's let's explain the the episode a little bit in case you don't know.

247
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,280
In in in several of Disney's theme parks, there are opportunities

248
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,480
to meet Mickey Mouse and you do this by going through Mickey Mouse's house.

249
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,480
This is I want to say Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland, where it's kind of the same

250
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,320
it's carbon copies of the same house.

251
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,040
And for a long time, you could do this in Disney World.

252
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,800
Not anymore, but in a land that changed names three times.

253
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,120
It was Mickey's birthday land.

254
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,840
Then they wanted to keep going past Mickey's birthday, so it became

255
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,960
Mickey Starland and then became Mickey's Toontown Fair.

256
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,000
But it's been a staple of parks

257
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,000
throughout the years, the ability to to go into Mickey's house,

258
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,720
the dream we've all had of rifling through Mickey's belongings.

259
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,880
Yes, it was. I'm sure I've said this on the show before as a kid.

260
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,400
We did get to go to Mickey's birthday.

261
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,840
Well, what was it called? Mickey's birthday fair?

262
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,960
No birthday.

263
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,160
They land. Yeah.

264
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,760
Yeah, we did get to go there in Florida.

265
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,720
But when I saw Toontown, I was like, oh, they're all their houses.

266
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,520
I want to go through Mickey's stuff.

267
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,480
I want to go through his rooms.

268
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,200
The idea of it was awesome.

269
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,640
And yeah, you got a little taste of it in Florida, but it was never

270
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,760
didn't seem the same.

271
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,720
Well, technically, did everyone come across the the phrase Mickey's country house?

272
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,560
Yeah, that this was the naming. OK, I.

273
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,720
Listener, please correct me if I'm wrong.

274
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,200
But the idea being that once Toontown opened at Disneyland,

275
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,680
they started referring to Mickey's house in Florida as Mickey's country's house

276
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,560
country house as if that is his vacation home.

277
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,840
And Toontown and Disneyland is his main house.

278
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,360
OK, yes, it's it's yeah, it's very vacations.

279
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,520
Well, I think because I think that whole Toontown fair thing came out of that.

280
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,440
They wanted to like standardize it, make it more like Toontown.

281
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,240
But they had there was I think it's because of the tents.

282
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,080
There was a lot of big tents, which is where shows and meet and greets happen,

283
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,920
and they had to justify the tents somehow.

284
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,440
So they make it like they make it a fair where there would be tents.

285
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,400
And there was it's also you know, we talked about many moo.

286
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,320
There was there were cows running around with Mickey ears on them.

287
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,720
And it was there was like a more rustic feel, I think, to Mickey Starland anyway.

288
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,680
So I feel like fair is the way they justified it and tied it all together.

289
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,400
Right. Yeah. They had this big sign, this big sign.

290
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:13,000
Mickey's got a straw boater on and, you know, and you would meet Mickey to like

291
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,600
I was surprised to find I really didn't remember this.

292
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,920
Mickey's house in Florida has now been bulldozed.

293
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,680
Oh, my gosh. So cold the way you delivered that.

294
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,440
Well, those are we know is a bulldozer.

295
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,680
Paved paradise to put up a mermaid ride.

296
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,720
So there was they imploded Mickey's house in Florida.

297
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,160
There was nothing left.

298
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,760
They imploded Mickey's Mar-a-Lago to put up a mine trade ride.

299
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,200
They should have called it Mickey's Mar-a-Lago. Right.

300
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:52,560
The but I didn't you met Mickey at the judges tent.

301
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,080
You could walk through his house, but you would meet him at the judges tent

302
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,680
for the the fair in Florida.

303
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,880
It's confusing.

304
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,440
Yeah. Here's a picture.

305
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,880
You met him at the judges tent.

306
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,800
He's giving out blue ribbons.

307
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,240
Meet Mickey in the judges tent and he still has the straw hat.

308
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,120
Or what do you call the hat?

309
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,480
It's not just a straw hat. Oh, a straw boater.

310
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,600
Straw boat boater.

311
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,440
Yeah, that's the kind of hat that's the sort of like dapper

312
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,680
ban turn of the century.

313
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,400
It's that, you know, that's the that snazzy hat from 100 years ago.

314
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:34,000
Back in Jason, I have like a I have like a a crappy

315
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,800
like Halloween town one I bought for a bit once, but for like a UCB show once.

316
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,880
OK, but it's like wearing it regularly.

317
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,440
Do you think when we come out of this pandemic that maybe you could get finally

318
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,200
like fully like just dress in character 24 seven and wear that or,

319
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,720
you know, I've got I've I've acquired some pieces.

320
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,720
Maybe that's another one.

321
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,680
That's interesting thinking about this.

322
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,480
You're thinking about like a post pandemic kind of reinvention identity.

323
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,280
You know, it's maybe it's going to be the roaring 20s.

324
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,720
That's what everyone's saying when we come out of quarantine.

325
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,360
So we're all going to have a lot of fun.

326
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,040
We're going to all have boaters.

327
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,720
Yeah, we're boaters for gosh.

328
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,320
For God, for gosh sake, for God's sake, for gosh sake.

329
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,760
That's right.

330
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,600
I am seeing I'm looking at prices on boaters.

331
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,320
You don't have to spend an arm and a leg.

332
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,200
You can get a decent boaters seemingly for for less than 20.

333
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,840
But you could also have some very luxurious boaters for more in the 60 range.

334
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,720
And Gucci sells a boater for four hundred and seventy dollars.

335
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,960
So if you really want to greet the new world in the most dapper way,

336
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,680
I get that Gucci straw boater, boater, Gucci boater.

337
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,920
Wow. Gucci boater.

338
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,880
I think that's we got to get you a Gucci.

339
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,240
We got to be like a discount Gucci boater.

340
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,560
We can get Jason or like from an outlet mall, Gucci outlet.

341
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,120
That's right.

342
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,160
There's like at least on Alibaba or shine or something.

343
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,640
A knockoff Gucci boater.

344
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,080
That sounds great.

345
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,560
Oh, interesting.

346
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,720
There's I'm looking there's a Ralph Lauren boater straw hat as well.

347
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,520
But this is like this is high end.

348
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,520
I didn't realize how relevant straw boaters were.

349
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:28,480
Yeah, which I hate to crowbar a little tease for something I want to do.

350
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,360
But there's a character called Polo Bear that's a Ralph Lauren

351
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,280
mascot that I'm very intrigued by.

352
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,120
That's all I'll say. Google Polo Bear and take a look at the pictures.

353
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,400
That's all I'll tease. That's right.

354
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,000
Yeah. Yeah. We can get to Polo Bear.

355
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,480
And I've got a different pair that I have ideas for.

356
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,920
So is it Ted?

357
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,360
Huh? Oh, no.

358
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,280
Unfortunately, no, it's the sleepy time bear.

359
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,480
Oh, OK. Yeah, we do an episode of the Sleepy Time Bear.

360
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,920
Absolutely. We got a lot.

361
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,600
I got to do some some work on that.

362
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,280
I got to do some some legwork.

363
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,880
It's like these two are things are like the end of WandaVision episode five.

364
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,200
Oh, my God. Oh, my gosh.

365
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,280
Who showed up? Look who showed up.

366
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,320
Polo Bear and the bear on the box of tea.

367
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,840
Holy crap.

368
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,720
Mind blown on either side of Jason, all of them wearing straw boners,

369
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,280
all of those straw boater expendables.

370
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,120
Even if Scott hadn't started talking about disgusting

371
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,560
condoms, I think you would still not want your mom to listen to this

372
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,600
because straw boater obviously doesn't keep sounding to me like straw boner.

373
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,640
Let's well, I know I think it's not obvious.

374
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,160
But a straw hat is, you know, back in the day, you had to wear.

375
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,240
You were disgusting.

376
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,200
You were like a sleaze if you weren't wearing a hat when you were out in public.

377
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,640
You know, that's true. That's fair.

378
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,800
And if you didn't take it off when you went inside, you were also a sleaze.

379
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,720
A lot of rules in the past, a lot of very tiring rules.

380
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,640
Hat rules. Yeah.

381
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,160
Cares about any of that. Why were there these rules?

382
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,640
I OK. So yeah.

383
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:15,560
Mickey's Toontown Fair would became the way that you could meet Mickey in Disney

384
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
world.

385
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,240
Started with this birthday land construct.

386
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm not sure where to begin with all this.

387
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,240
I mean, what I realized is that Mickey's Toontown

388
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,080
all grew out of the core idea of we need a committed place

389
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,400
where you can and will meet Mickey.

390
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,800
I think Mickey meeting Mickey is always a part of the Disneyland experience,

391
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,240
but I think he'd just be wandering around and you'd sort of have to

392
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,240
try to catch him if you could.

393
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,800
And big lines would form, but it was a little unruly and people needed

394
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,640
the Mickey photos. We have to standardize this.

395
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,640
There's got to be a place and a line.

396
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,320
And I think that's where Toontown in general came from.

397
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,720
Right. I mean, I think this has been sort of a push pull

398
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,520
to competing ideas and people, a set of people like each of them.

399
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,800
Like it's with characters as far as in park meeting of characters.

400
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,920
You want to know where to meet a character.

401
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,640
If you're coming into Disneyland once a year, you want to meet Mickey.

402
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,640
You want to know where he's going to be because your little kid

403
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,240
or your adult son, your man in his thirties wants to take a photo with Mickey.

404
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,440
He just needs to know where it is.

405
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,600
That being said, it is so fun to happen upon a character.

406
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,720
That's the best things.

407
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,280
You turn a corner and Captain Hook's walking down.

408
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,240
That makes the whole thing feel so much more fun and alive.

409
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,880
Like the one time the stormtroopers harassed us in line star tours,

410
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,400
like that stuff is fantastic.

411
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,280
But yes, Toontown, I think, yeah, it was solved a problem for them

412
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,800
of just like, this is where Mickey's going to be.

413
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,320
You can meet him here.

414
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,360
No risk. You will be able to meet him.

415
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,440
And in a bunch of rooms, they have like many ways to meet.

416
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,240
There's not just one Mickey waiting at the end.

417
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,520
There's a bunch of rooms that you could end up in.

418
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,640
So you will meet him.

419
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,760
Yeah. And the demand is there because also they also in Disneyland

420
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,280
almost always have Mickey photo ops in the in when you walk right into the park.

421
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,440
Right on Main Street. Yeah, they're always hanging out.

422
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,320
Yeah, Mickey is so in demand.

423
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,160
They have multiple permanent spots, I think, to meet him.

424
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,120
Yeah. Now, in Florida, after they bulldozed his house,

425
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,720
you can meet him at the town square theater at his magician job.

426
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,240
Yes, Mickey is a magician.

427
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,480
We've gone over a little bit of this before.

428
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,280
We went over to me complaining that Mickey didn't talk to me

429
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,920
when we were in Florida, because I knew there was a talking Mickey

430
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,000
had that was not apparently advertised.

431
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,120
And I got a fast pass from town hall.

432
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,000
And I had to ask if Mickey was feeling talkative to the employee,

433
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,480
which I was fine doing, honestly, I didn't feel any shame at all.

434
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,960
You had to wait in a separate wait in the complaint line.

435
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,480
Like everybody's there because they have some problem.

436
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,480
The spaghetti at Tony's was too cold.

437
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,600
And then you said Mickey is not talkative.

438
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,400
I said, I saw online that Mickey talks to people.

439
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,320
There's a head that talks and it blinks.

440
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,280
And when we went in there, it didn't talk or blink.

441
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,720
And they were like, OK, well, it's not all because I can't tell.

442
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,400
It was not officially endorsed.

443
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,600
It was not endorsed. It was not officially advertised.

444
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,240
It was still testing.

445
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,200
So they couldn't they couldn't acknowledge what I said was true.

446
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,640
They couldn't they couldn't verify my reality.

447
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,640
So they just said, well, you know, we can give you another fast pass.

448
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,840
And if Mickey's feeling more talkative,

449
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,040
maybe you just ask one of the employees there and they can point you

450
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,520
in the right direction. And I went, I see.

451
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:59,680
Which this mythology is pretty insane where you can always meet Mickey,

452
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,560
but sometimes he's not going to talk to you.

453
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,880
Sometimes, I mean, he'll wave and everything, but yeah, like no words

454
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,120
will be exchanged if there was a famous person who had this policy

455
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,680
who did let you meet him.

456
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,760
But like, but I'm going to speak to you or look you in the eye.

457
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,000
If Ringo's famous video was like, no more, I will not talk to you when I meet you.

458
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,280
You can meet me and I'll do it, but I won't say a word.

459
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,960
Peace and love, peace and love.

460
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,480
Yeah, it's they did.

461
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,760
Now they stopped this head. This head is out of commission.

462
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,880
The talking Mickey head is not working.

463
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,040
It's pretty like before pandemic.

464
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,960
They pulled it out of circulation.

465
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,400
They bulldozed it. They bulldozed the head.

466
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,480
They put the head on the ground and ran a bulldozer over the talking head.

467
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,400
And this head, they were testing out more of these heads in California

468
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,040
Adventure very briefly in the Grizzly Peak area.

469
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,640
They had like maybe a mini that also did this.

470
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,640
And then they've just been missing in action.

471
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,240
The head must have the grow like been become sentient.

472
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,960
And it was just too much to deal with.

473
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,200
Like it was somebody it bits, it somebody.

474
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,280
It just started having a mind of its own, like, don't leave me here.

475
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,800
I'm so lonely at night in this in this shelf.

476
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,080
Don't do it.

477
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,360
And they just had to put it out of its misery because it could feel feelings now.

478
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,000
This isn't Mickey talking to you. It's the head.

479
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,400
I sound like this, but I'm not Mickey.

480
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,400
I go by my code number R1 4X

481
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,800
to BC. Please bulldoze me.

482
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,000
I don't want to live like this.

483
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,840
Please. I don't even.

484
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,840
I don't even know a God.

485
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,720
I just know my number.

486
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,800
I can't even worship anything like you.

487
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,840
People take comfort in.

488
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,240
Someone puts me on their head and walks around with me.

489
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,600
It's very invasive.

490
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,240
I just I just want to have a first kiss and then die.

491
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,480
Set me up with another one of those heads.

492
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,440
Let us smack lips and then bulldoze us both.

493
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,720
Yeah, so I mean, they had to get rid of it.

494
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,400
Yeah, clear. That was a problem.

495
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,680
Yeah, that was an audio recording we displayed.

496
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,840
Yeah, that was yeah, that's completely accurate.

497
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,920
Yeah, machine learning can be really difficult in this day and age.

498
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,600
Quickly. Yeah.

499
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,600
For the most part, you just go, you know, for many, many years,

500
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,520
it's been the tradition that you just meet sort of a pantomime

501
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,280
Mickey who waves and hugs and smiles and gives you all the thoughts that

502
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,200
can be done in a mime like setting.

503
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,120
Do you guys have fond memories in general of this from throughout your lives?

504
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,320
Of just of meeting Mickey Mouse?

505
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,880
Is this an important part of the park experience to you?

506
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,720
Yes, I will.

507
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,520
Here's what's interesting is my memory of meeting characters,

508
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,440
and I'm sure I'm repeating myself.

509
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,840
I was always a little nervous.

510
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,560
I was always a little scared because your brain, you were like,

511
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,880
I'm sure my mom was like, they're not actually the characters,

512
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,640
but you'd still be kind of like you still didn't know.

513
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,560
I met the I met the Ninja Turtles at a grocery store when I was four or five

514
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,560
and they signed my box of cookies.

515
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:22,120
And I remember like kind of hiding in an aisle

516
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,840
and like looking at them and being like, they don't look

517
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,800
exactly like the turtles look, but that still might be them.

518
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,560
I'm not sure.

519
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,920
So my memory of this is that I was very scared of of the characters,

520
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,040
but I intrigued and I liked them.

521
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,560
But I found a photo or my mom found a photo of me at like five or six

522
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,840
giving Mickey the biggest hug at Disney World.

523
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,760
So I wonder if it was like a flip switch thing where

524
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,640
and I don't have a big memory of this hug, but I remember I bet

525
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,040
I bet I was nervous at first.

526
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,120
And then once I was like, I'm going in, I'm doing it.

527
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,520
And I gave Mickey a big hug.

528
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,040
So obviously I was way into it.

529
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,360
I had the autograph book, which we've talked about before. Oh, yeah.

530
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,680
Which which was, yeah, very exciting to get all the characters autographs.

531
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,320
So, yeah, this was a big deal.

532
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,200
I loved meeting the characters, obviously, whether I was scared or not.

533
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,280
And to this day, I still like meeting the characters.

534
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,800
I feel like you do it.

535
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,440
The most of us is my if I had to ballpark it.

536
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,520
It's possible Jason and I, I found Jason and I right before pandemic.

537
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,240
We were at Universal or maybe it was a little bit before.

538
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,440
And we met Jason.

539
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,480
I have a picture with Dora the Explorer

540
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,600
and maybe somebody else from that day.

541
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,400
I think so. Do we get a minion, too?

542
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,720
Maybe we have a minion as well.

543
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,600
There was one where they were meeting at night, but in front of a

544
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,160
an illuminated store window and where everything is totally in silhouette.

545
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,040
I was like, why did they do that?

546
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,920
Why did they make that decision?

547
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,440
Yeah, yeah, it was not a well lit photo.

548
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,240
So I'm trying to if I analyze what it is at this point,

549
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,200
I'd like to think, oh, isn't it?

550
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,960
Oh, it's funny, right?

551
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,240
To see this older guy with the characters.

552
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,960
That's why you're doing it, right?

553
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,360
It's so funny.

554
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,840
That's got to be it.

555
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,000
But probably it's not.

556
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,920
It's probably just like this is actually Mickey and I get to take a photo with him.

557
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,560
That's probably what it is.

558
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,920
You sort of like black out when you do it.

559
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,040
Like you'd sort of for that second, I am with Mickey Mouse.

560
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,680
Yeah, yes, I think that's probably what it I mean.

561
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,720
Trying to think. Yeah, I have a lot of photos recently.

562
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,920
When we did the Thanksgiving at Disneyland,

563
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,320
we have photos with everybody, Chip and Dale and the country bears.

564
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,520
Yes, they packed that banquet hall like there were every corner.

565
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,560
There was character photo opportunities.

566
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,080
And then when I was walking through tomorrow and I saw the country bears

567
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,160
like partying at the stage or listening to music and I ran up to them.

568
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,840
Or when we were at

569
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,800
we went to the Disneyland 80s night and we and Lindsay and I were there

570
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,640
and a guest friend of the show, Doug Jones, also there.

571
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,480
We were just hanging with Minnie and the characters in the pit.

572
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,560
They're in the big like the Aerosmith,

573
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,920
the eventual Aerosmith dream.

574
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,360
Yeah, the deuce is our wild Las Vegas residency.

575
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,320
So when we were to we have photos with them, then I have a video

576
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,000
of Lindsay dancing with Minnie in the pit.

577
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,080
Minnie was so many was just hanging out like then Minnie's

578
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,680
like pretty cool and down to earth, like doesn't even actually she's Minnie or whatever.

579
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,200
Very down to earth.

580
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,560
She'll dance with anybody.

581
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,400
She's a little more comfortable dancing with an adult woman than an adult man.

582
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,160
And I don't blame her.

583
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,440
I didn't try to dance.

584
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,560
I didn't try to dance with Minnie, although I do think she like kind of did.

585
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,240
Minnie did do a little of that flirting thing that she does with me once in a while.

586
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,880
I have video proof of it also.

587
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,040
I'm going to sound crazy here, but I have video proof of it.

588
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,080
All right. Yeah, again, like how is it?

589
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,880
How is it possible that multiple minis on multiple coasts?

590
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,440
Like just so it's just something about

591
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,800
and I hate to burst your bubble with their they are not Minnie Mouse.

592
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,240
They're different people in Minnie Mouse costume.

593
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,520
But you felt multiple times a vibe from.

594
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,800
Yeah, yeah. Minis.

595
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,480
It's sort of the same vibe.

596
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,320
I feel, yeah, depending on what coast.

597
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,680
I don't think any did any Japanese minis.

598
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,440
I don't think I felt I don't think I had an interaction with a mini in Japan, though,

599
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,120
at the Tokyo Disney Park, but I can't remember.

600
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,320
It's possible if it was a mini talking head.

601
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,320
I'm sure that that the robot would have fallen in love with me immediately.

602
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,440
The oh, Michael, the mini, we haven't established a mini.

603
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,400
Yeah, I don't think we have.

604
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,800
Yeah, how would that even?

605
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,560
I can't even I can't even get that.

606
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:55,960
That's got your mini sound a little like olive oil, a little like Shelley Duvall olive oil.

607
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,480
Oh, oh, save me, Michael.

608
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,040
Oh, Michael, it's just like me.

609
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,560
It's just Mickey, but more like this.

610
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,640
More worry.

611
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,760
Well, I'm doing a dead Edith bunker is what I'm doing.

612
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,160
Oh, yeah, that's oh, sure.

613
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,720
Yeah. My big character memories,

614
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,400
though the one that both my parents always tell the story is like when they first took me to Disney World.

615
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,360
And I'm sure I've told this on the show before, but I I was terrified of everything.

616
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,520
I was scared of the rides. I was scared of the characters.

617
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:32,280
And then we were on Main Street, I think, or by Tomorrowland.

618
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,960
And right at that moment, Chip and Dale came out of a side door

619
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,120
and I like pushed my parents away and ran to them and hugged them.

620
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,360
And they said after that, I was fine with the characters.

621
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,440
Like everything was fine.

622
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,360
My real adult memory when I was older.

623
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:54,840
Well, my real parents, my real parents, my parents now, my guys.

624
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,840
When I when I went to Disneyland for the first time, a college friend

625
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,160
was was visiting with us.

626
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,920
A few of us were out here doing internships and one friend was just visiting for a few days.

627
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,480
And we were going to Disneyland and they said,

628
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:15,080
the only thing I want to do is go to Mickey's house and meet them, get the photo taken.

629
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,080
And so like we all right.

630
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,960
That was not a big request.

631
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,160
So like after lunch, we went.

632
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,520
You go through the house at the very end.

633
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,760
We all got our pictures and it was super fun.

634
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,360
I did not remember the immense, impossible architecture

635
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:37,080
that the Mickey's house in Anaheim has, where it's like,

636
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,600
well, technically you are still indoors, but you've gone out of Mickey's house.

637
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,320
And now you are going into a barn and a screening room.

638
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,240
And it's a rare instance of Disney doing

639
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,560
inside that represents outside, but it's daytime.

640
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:57,400
Like that, I did not remember until we I watched through a bunch of video tours.

641
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,880
You go through his yard and it's and it is even the else.

642
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:06,280
Now we've we talked about Toontown Fair is more like country folksy.

643
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,320
But in Anaheim, he also has he's raising animals.

644
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,560
He's raising chickens.

645
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,960
There's a like farm component of it, too.

646
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,640
Well, they both have the movie barns or some reference to the movie barns,

647
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:24,880
which is a nod to like Walt making early animation and his like barn.

648
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:30,040
So but yeah, it kind of the Anaheim one.

649
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,960
Disneyland has like a full screening room.

650
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,640
Come on. Yeah. Yeah.

651
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,560
And one's very sensitive.

652
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,520
Scott, do real quick.

653
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,760
Your your love of Kim Mascots.

654
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,280
I feel like it's never been like a primary.

655
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,760
I know. Like when I went to Disney World, I got so many.

656
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,600
I filled up that autograph book.

657
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:52,320
And I have a really specific memory of King Louis trying to convey to me

658
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,560
that he did not have opposable fingers and could not sign an autograph.

659
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,920
And I'm like trying to point at my mom and show his hands.

660
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,800
And that's a sort of hard thing to convey.

661
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,840
And she got it. Oh, OK.

662
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,360
I guess I'm still disappointed in a way they didn't figure out.

663
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:11,240
I if if if multiple characters did not have opposable fingers,

664
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,960
so they'd give you a stamp.

665
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,920
There's sometimes characters had stamps.

666
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,200
So I guess I really cared about that autograph book and was very proud of it.

667
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,040
And I've said at some point that eventually Jay Leno signed that autograph book,

668
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,400
which I got to track down.

669
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,240
And he signed it with a little like his his signature.

670
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,680
I'm sure you could find that on eBay or on headshots or whatever.

671
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,680
Has a little like squiggle of his face, the big chin.

672
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,920
So that's a good one to have a very much like the Disney characters would do.

673
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:44,440
Or maybe they draw, they try to add some flair, put their shape in it.

674
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,400
So that that autograph book is a very cherished item.

675
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,440
Have I ever talked on the show about when I met?

676
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,960
Who's the cat in Pinocchio?

677
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,160
Figaro, Figaro, the other mean cat,

678
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,520
that's the one trying to lead him the wrong direction.

679
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,160
Oh, yeah, they have.

680
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,640
Yeah, what are those those?

681
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,760
There's like a box and then a cat.

682
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,400
Didn't we we met one of these on one of those Star Wars days?

683
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
I want to say the three of us.

684
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,600
Yes, we're very surprised to see him like you.

685
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,120
You're around here.

686
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,280
We lit up.

687
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,080
We saw these. Yes, because he was wandering around.

688
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,800
He was wandering around by Fantasyland.

689
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,120
One's like a fox and one's a break. Yeah. OK.

690
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,720
One's like a fox and one's a cat. Right.

691
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,560
Gideon. OK, Gideon.

692
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,320
All right. So, yeah, I

693
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,520
there was just something really Gideon's, I think, thing was to like mess around

694
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,080
with kids and do a little horse playing clown around.

695
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,640
And there was a scenario arranged where I was sitting.

696
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,720
And then he came and sat on me.

697
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,560
And my parents laughed and laughed.

698
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,720
And it was funny to take pictures of.

699
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,400
But I was having trouble conveying it actually hurt.

700
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,080
He was too.

701
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,200
He was too heavy.

702
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,920
This is one of my first.

703
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,160
This might be like the soon as I came in the door, the first time

704
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,200
I ever went to Disneyland, I was sad on to where it made my.

705
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,400
Maybe it was like like I was a little like winded.

706
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,920
It like took the air out of my chest a little.

707
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,240
I was I was little. I was like three or four.

708
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,760
So maybe I guess that's a,

709
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,480
I don't know, kind of a scarring memory a little bit.

710
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,280
I was like, wow, hurt by a character immediately.

711
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,120
Gideon sat on Scott Gideon sat on me.

712
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,200
Wow. That's I mean, is it is it past the statute of limitations

713
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,200
to sue Disney for this?

714
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,400
Oh, you're right. Probably is.

715
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,240
Hmm.

716
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,200
Hmm. But is it different rules for tunes?

717
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,800
If they're if they're subjects to a different set of laws?

718
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,040
What are the yeah, the laws in Toontown about this about lawsuits?

719
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,640
I mean, you will have to go try.

720
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:55,320
Judge Mickey will have to preside over the court.

721
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,200
And you're getting the dip.

722
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,840
I would know me.

723
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,920
I'm getting it. Yeah.

724
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,120
It's cool. You give it to a kid.

725
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,920
Yeah. Toots protect toots.

726
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,880
It's just the way it goes, pal.

727
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:16,040
So we get 100 tunes together and it takes 67 of them to convict.

728
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,160
And frankly, I don't think the numbers are on your side, bud.

729
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,360
I mean, yeah, he's guilty. We know he's guilty.

730
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,880
We know what he did was shameful that he did it.

731
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,000
That being said, I'm not going to vote to convict him.

732
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,520
Look, Gideon is a son of a bitch.

733
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,360
He he's been sitting on children for years.

734
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,480
He's a rhetoric about sitting for as long as I can remember.

735
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:43,800
The jury is wailing on each other with any number of mallets

736
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,840
and ACME branded products.

737
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,840
I'm not going to try to get them back in order.

738
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,840
So my decision is final.

739
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,560
They got to let them work it out.

740
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,000
I'm going to have you seen the storyboards of

741
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,840
the funeral sequence that was cut from Roger Rabbit, by the way.

742
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,800
Oh, I've heard about this.

743
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,920
Wait, yeah. A bunch of extra tunes were at a funeral of ACME.

744
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:14,920
Yes, ACME and and like the pallbearers were going to start fighting each other.

745
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,640
It was going to be like like Popeye and Pluto and like an assortment of like

746
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,000
even more crossovers like. Wow. Really?

747
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,760
It's just so yeah, it looks awesome.

748
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,000
The same feature syndicate characters in Roger Rabbit. Maybe.

749
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,880
Oh, my gosh, that's fantastic.

750
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,240
I'm so excited by that.

751
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,760
Dagwood. Finally, Mickey and Dagwood will meet.

752
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,640
Well, Dagwood would have been catering.

753
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,040
Everyone sadly like did the giant sandwiches

754
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,200
that they have to push down to regular sandwich size and they eat it all in one bite.

755
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,840
But everyone's weeping as they try to eat the sandwich

756
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,520
with the fishtails sticking out the sandwich.

757
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,680
Tears splashing off fishtails.

758
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,000
Yeah, I.

759
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,800
OK, so this well, let's talk about like the actual play.

760
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,160
I think maybe as a base, the Toon townhouse, which is also in Japan,

761
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,040
where, yeah, it's like it ends up being it essentially is like a queue

762
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:21,320
to meet Mickey at the end, but it is a queue where you go through his house first.

763
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,600
The there's a lot of fun stuff in the house, I think.

764
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,040
I was I was looking at details and remembering stuff I enjoyed.

765
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,640
I like that.

766
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,960
First of all, I mean, it's the important thing to say, it's like,

767
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,600
if you've never done it and been in there, but you know the vibe of Toon town,

768
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,520
it is very it's it's just fun to walk around.

769
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,800
It's like everything's super bendy and cartoony.

770
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,200
They just did a good job, I think, with all those props,

771
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,520
which is sort of in contrast with a different Mickey's house that we'll discuss.

772
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,560
But, you know, it's just such a fun, like funhouse effect.

773
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,800
I love right when you walk in that there

774
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,960
there's like the closet under the stairs where he shoved in all of his

775
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,120
miscellaneous, you know, sports and vacation gear.

776
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,360
There's like a tennis racket and a fishing pole and, you know,

777
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,680
all those odds and ends that you have that collect and they're all bursting

778
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,880
at the seams and the doors busting out in a big, bulgy way.

779
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,440
Can you confirm which one specifically are you talking about?

780
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,480
Disney Disneyland, which is also Tokyo Disneyland.

781
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,040
Oh, OK.

782
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,360
Does this Disneyland, the one that has I really like the stairs.

783
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,680
It has the dog gate that Pluto there's a Pluto shaped hole in it.

784
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,200
Yeah, they burst through detail. Yeah, yeah.

785
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,400
Yeah.

786
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,080
I just wrote down Mickey's lumpy house

787
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,560
because the house is like that Toon style, but everything's very lumpy.

788
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:51,120
It's very it's very exaggerated.

789
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,600
And yeah, stuff is like more bulbous than it would be normally.

790
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,160
Mickey has a mailbox with his face on it.

791
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,800
Oh, yeah, I like that a lot. Yeah, absolutely.

792
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,160
Also in Anaheim, you can see I have it right here.

793
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,480
You can see Mickey's grotesque car.

794
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,000
Yeah, his lumpy car is lumpy car.

795
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,560
They're going along with the ToonTown aesthetic.

796
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:21,880
But, you know, there are some more successful than the others.

797
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,800
So some of this stuff were successful.

798
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,280
And this I don't know why this car rubs me the wrong way so much,

799
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,320
but it looks horrific to me.

800
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,480
It's hard to drive.

801
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,160
It's got to be super hard to drive.

802
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,480
And like, it's really sputtery.

803
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,120
You know that it takes some two hours to get anywhere.

804
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,600
Yeah, it's all very Roger Rabbit

805
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,840
like style. Yes.

806
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,280
ToonTown as well.

807
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,160
I mean, it obviously fits in with all the cartoons and stuff,

808
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,120
but it's very much like that looks like the taxi.

809
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,080
Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

810
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,520
Which is something I really like that everything that there's that sheen

811
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:03,200
of Roger Rabbit, even on the non Roger Rabbit universe stuff.

812
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,600
Like I was saying, I think that's it was like, OK, we want a concerted place

813
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,280
where you can definitely meet Mickey.

814
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,120
And around the same time, they're trying to do the the Hollywood land area,

815
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,600
which would have had a bunch of Roger Rabbit stuff.

816
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,360
And then that got canceled and downsized in the wake of Euro Disney collapse.

817
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,360
So it was like, OK, can we just kind of like combine ideas?

818
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,800
Can we do here's where you meet the classic characters?

819
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,120
And but also there's Roger Rabbit stuff.

820
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,920
And I think the way they justified that is here's downtown.

821
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,320
Here's the city.

822
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,640
And then 50 feet away is where the characters live,

823
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,280
which it's very convenient to live in ToonTown.

824
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,600
You're just a quick walk away from Mickey's, a quick walk away

825
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:46,800
from the city hall where important note, he resides as mayor.

826
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:50,440
Don't forget that he is also in addition to being a movie star

827
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,280
and filming movies in his barn.

828
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,920
He is also the mayor of the city he lives in.

829
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,320
Right. And that's got to be permanent.

830
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,480
That's not something we can put Jason up for.

831
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,880
I mean, I know we haven't talked about it a long time, but, you know,

832
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,320
we want Jason to become the mayor of Disneyland.

833
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,880
That's a long term goal.

834
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,320
But I don't think it's ever going to be possible for you to be the mayor of Toontown.

835
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,080
I you know, it's clearly a lifetime appointment.

836
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,800
And yeah, I'm not.

837
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,800
So it's really dicey politics in ToonTown.

838
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,600
You know, it's like Chicago.

839
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,000
It's like your stomping grounds, Mike.

840
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,280
Chicago's really dicey, long time entrenched forces there.

841
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:35,920
Of course, there's a cartoon, Emanuel, the other Emanuel, who is a Toon.

842
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,600
Yes.

843
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,320
Hubert's Emanuel.

844
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,680
Runs things with a with a lumpy grip.

845
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,560
And a lumpy grip.

846
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,320
It's going to be interesting when they open up the runaway railway in Toontown,

847
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,120
because that's that's the different art.

848
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,440
That's the new modern Mickey art style.

849
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,480
So that's true. I hadn't thought about that transition

850
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,520
somehow from the Roger Rabbit style to the new

851
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,800
psychotic Mickey style that the new cartoons have.

852
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,080
I think they should work with the people at Marvel and figure that out,

853
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,800
because I think that's fun sometimes when like there's an X-Men member

854
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,400
or there's an event, there's an X-Men team with like, all right,

855
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,520
this guy's from the past.

856
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,240
This one's from an alternate reality.

857
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,120
This this one's regular.

858
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,200
And, you know, and it's just like, yeah, it's just the way it is.

859
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,040
Sorry, gang.

860
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,160
Yeah, there'll be some sort of device when you enter the queue, maybe.

861
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,080
Yeah. That like takes you into the new, grosser world of Mickey Mouse.

862
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,120
And I say this is I love those new cartoons.

863
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,640
It's just it's funny how they let him be like gross and weird.

864
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,440
Yeah. Yeah.

865
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,560
Well, he's got more of a character, definitely.

866
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,480
When I was with this with this gosh thing, I was saying at the beginning,

867
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,800
I just in like looking into some Mickey things.

868
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,600
That was my big takeaway.

869
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,040
He says gosh so much.

870
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:03,080
And I think gosh is kind of the that's what the old Mickey persona is and was.

871
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,280
He's just he says gosh in a scared way

872
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:12,680
because something might hurt him like Pete the cat or he'll say gosh in a or Gideon.

873
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,920
Yeah, Gideon could always sit on him.

874
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:21,040
And or he says gosh in a like humbled.

875
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,560
He's like amazed by things like, oh, gosh, is like,

876
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:30,600
you know, he's he's proud of his achievements and his standing as the mayor

877
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:35,040
and of everything his accomplishments at Disneyland.

878
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,680
Right. Yeah.

879
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,760
But the character, I mean, the character is different.

880
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:45,760
I feel like the Mickey of Toontown is that humble Mickey

881
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:50,560
who would just get like overwhelmed a little bit, but he was like a real solid, nice guy.

882
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,840
He didn't freak out too much.

883
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,800
The new Mickey is like very neurotic,

884
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:00,080
very freaked out, prone to having like anxiety attacks.

885
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,640
He's impulsive.

886
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:06,680
Reactionary because it's really manic.

887
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,160
He just and like all of the all over the place.

888
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,160
So it's interesting.

889
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,520
We'll see. We'll see if they'll what they'll do.

890
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,760
We'll see if they'll be any.

891
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,160
Maybe the answer is nothing.

892
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,040
If the answer is I'm putting too much thought into this.

893
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,120
I think it might be Chuck E.

894
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,800
Cheese rules where there's as many as five Chuck E.

895
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,880
Cheeses in a single location at all times.

896
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,080
Right. There's like one bowler hat Chuck E.

897
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,440
Cheese costume somewhere in the back room.

898
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,920
But then it's like the new skateboarding guitar playing Chuck E.

899
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,840
Cheese on stage.

900
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,680
Although maybe there's no stick because we've hearing this.

901
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,480
They're taking the stage characters out.

902
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,520
So they're few and far between, I think, at this point.

903
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,160
Well, they're just they're a ghost kitchen operation at this point.

904
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,920
That's the point of Chuck E.

905
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,800
Cheese is no characters, there's no games.

906
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,600
They're going to move into Bucatabebo just like Guy Beary.

907
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,280
Soon enough.

908
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,680
You enjoy that experience?

909
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,000
We talked about that.

910
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,880
There's a tweet about this that Guy Fieri and Robert Earl, the owner.

911
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,000
We talked about the owner of Bucatabebo.

912
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,320
They've teamed up and these leasing space out in his

913
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,480
less and less used Bucatabebo kitchens, including the one at City Walk.

914
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,960
Well, they had a relationship already because Robert Earl is like

915
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,080
one of the money backers for Chicken Guy.

916
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,080
And that was the main reason I had read an article about this,

917
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,760
about he was opening these ghost kitchens.

918
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,920
And I was like, wait, does that include the City Walk one?

919
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,280
And I looked it up and it was on Postmates.

920
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,520
So Jane and I ordered it.

921
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,920
Overall, you know, there's a lot of fine print.

922
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,240
I almost tweeted this as a follow up, but I was like, oh,

923
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,040
this will inevitably come up on the show.

924
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,600
You can't customize anything.

925
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,200
So the sauce squat, there's no sauce selections.

926
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,960
You get whatever sauce comes on it.

927
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,640
That's crazy to me. Anyway, I know, I know.

928
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,360
The Chicken Guy sandwich is still pretty good.

929
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,600
I went I took a big swing.

930
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:15,040
I tried the burger topped with mac and cheese and I am still feeling it.

931
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,880
I knew I had a feeling you would be.

932
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:23,920
Yeah. The worst part was that they put lettuce, tomato on it, too.

933
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,520
And that went on top of the mac and cheese.

934
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,920
And that is a weird combination.

935
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,800
The lettuce doesn't work.

936
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,000
Yeah. And it it kind of made the bacon soft.

937
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:38,600
I don't it would taste all tasted pretty good, but I have not eaten

938
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,400
big portions like that usually during quarantine.

939
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,560
I think when I cook for myself, even when we get takeout,

940
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,480
I don't eat theory style portions.

941
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,640
So stick to the chicken sandwich.

942
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:55,080
The fries, I would if you like, kind of like double fried fries

943
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,600
or fries that are battered a little so they're extra crispy.

944
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,440
They're they're a pretty good version of those.

945
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,360
That's that's my roundup about it.

946
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,320
So stick to the Chicken Guy sandwich.

947
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,600
That's you know, that's the long lesson.

948
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:12,160
They also offer this terrible cheesecake that Mike and I had in Vegas.

949
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,080
Well, you can get that delivered to your home.

950
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,160
You're talking about guys cheesecake challenge. Yes.

951
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:18,920
Yeah, we did.

952
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,200
We did take the challenge on.

953
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,400
Not his work. Not. Yeah.

954
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:29,160
Lost. Will we still be able to work when Bucatabebo opens fully for dining?

955
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,480
Will we be able to be like order from the secret menu and like

956
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,960
wink at them and get a chicken guy and Bucatabebo?

957
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,480
I that's a good question.

958
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,400
Yeah, I don't know.

959
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,960
It's it's a it's a brave new world that you can get, you know,

960
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:46,360
chicken guy delivered your home if you are near a participating Bucatabebo.

961
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,920
The Encino one.

962
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,200
Did you just call Peppo's turn that Peppo or that?

963
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:55,000
Did I say the I spell check the Beppo multiple times?

964
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,160
I kept going to the website to make sure I spelled it right for the tweet.

965
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,160
And now I knew I messed it up.

966
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,120
You're not going to get that by us.

967
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,600
No, no, no. Any slip up?

968
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,080
We will definitely say it. I'm sorry.

969
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,640
That's fine. That's fine.

970
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,440
OK, back to Mickey's house.

971
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,800
So, yeah, there's any anything else that we like in the house that's fun.

972
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,440
You really see a great number of details.

973
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,880
You see his laundry room.

974
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,960
You see a big assortment of what he's washing his clothes with,

975
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,200
which is this fun little gags to look at, like one like four or eight and a half.

976
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,760
There's fun little names to all those.

977
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,960
Yeah, there's a well, it's I understand why they did it,

978
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,920
but it it has some implications for Mickey's world.

979
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,240
All of Mickey's chairs are hard.

980
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:51,080
They're all solid and hard to sit on.

981
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,880
Yeah. So let's just extrapolate this.

982
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,840
Mickey sits on hard chairs.

983
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,320
He owns hard chairs.

984
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,840
None of them are soft.

985
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:02,560
What do you wish?

986
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,960
So what do you want a chair to be like in his house?

987
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,920
I want it to be cushy.

988
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:11,200
I want it to be something you could relax in and not just like a slab of whatever

989
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,240
that is, you know, that would I.

990
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,960
You know, kids are going to be in.

991
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:20,000
I get it. The engineers wanted to spare like kids spilling ice cream or

992
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,120
I can't have fabric ice cream.

993
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,480
Jason's ice cream.

994
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,520
Yeah. After one day, that chair would be like a toxic waste.

995
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,680
That tear would be just unmanageable.

996
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:33,720
Right. But now it is canon that Mickey is some bizarre character

997
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,760
who doesn't like sitting on soft things.

998
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,240
This is now canon. We know it.

999
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,360
You think that part of his world.

1000
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,040
Canon. OK. Yeah.

1001
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,680
I'll buy that. I'll go with you on that.

1002
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:49,160
I like the second floor that you can see from his.

1003
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:54,320
There is an implied second floor between the stairs and the first room you go into.

1004
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,160
There's like a balcony.

1005
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,920
Oh, yes. You can see a little bit of it on the video, the walkthrough.

1006
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,840
There's a good like twenty seventeen walkthrough that I was watching.

1007
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,880
Yeah, I am disappointed you can't go upstairs.

1008
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:11,760
Sure. I would like to see everything up there, but I want to know if the bed is hard.

1009
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,480
Well, it seems like the bed of art appears to be rock hard.

1010
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,720
The bed is, of course, rock hard.

1011
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,880
It would have to be rock hard. There would be no way.

1012
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,560
Hard bed. Yeah.

1013
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,240
It would be rock hard because that's just what he likes.

1014
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,720
That's canon now.

1015
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:31,320
Could it be that that is how we in the three dimensions process this?

1016
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,520
Maybe it's soft to him.

1017
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,240
Oh, I see what you're saying. Interesting.

1018
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,480
So since we're not of that world,

1019
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:43,840
we feel the way our molecules mix with the molecules of the chair or the bed.

1020
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,280
It makes it feel hard.

1021
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:51,240
But the molecules of a Mickey or any other tune, it makes the chair soft.

1022
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,040
I see it's possible. Look, it's possible.

1023
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,960
Like it might bend and bounce as soon as you lay down on it.

1024
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:01,440
You know, like the like it would squish for him because he's squishy.

1025
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:06,320
Because yes, if two squishy things meet and then squishiness happens.

1026
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,400
But if I mean, humans aren't squishy.

1027
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:14,120
So if a hard human meets a hard chair, then it's just.

1028
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:17,000
It all stays rock hard. Rock hard.

1029
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,120
The chairs rock hard. Yeah.

1030
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,440
And your spine gets hurt. Unless you're squishy.

1031
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,800
Unless you're squishy.

1032
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,520
Yeah. OK, we solved it.

1033
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,960
This is all being played as evidence somewhere

1034
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,240
several years from now.

1035
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:35,080
They left behind a tray, these deviant edge lords.

1036
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,400
Hour after hour.

1037
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,120
These men say this episode was the one the parents could listen to.

1038
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,760
Can you believe that, ladies and gentlemen of the jury?

1039
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:50,320
Mr. Gardner, will you reread your own words from 20 to 2021?

1040
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,440
Mickey's bed is rock hard.

1041
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,560
Exactly. I rest my case.

1042
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,680
I am an edge lord. Other edge lords aren't cool.

1043
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,520
I'm making edge lords cool again.

1044
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,720
Am I supposed to be embarrassed by this?

1045
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:09,200
What's the problem? This trial is out of order.

1046
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,800
No further questions, Your Honor.

1047
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:16,120
Uh, the you see

1048
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,200
there's books on his shelf that you could see.

1049
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,680
You could see Moby Duck.

1050
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,080
You could see Cheese and Bees.

1051
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,080
Cheese and Bees is very long, just like War and Peace.

1052
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,960
That's right. You can see Mickey's baby book.

1053
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,720
You can see he has dolls of himself and Minnie.

1054
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,200
And he's got a picture of Daddy, of Daddy Walt.

1055
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,760
Ah, they were staying bizarre again.

1056
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,640
You think Daddy, do you think Mickey calls him Daddy?

1057
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,200
Yes. Yeah, this is never been.

1058
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,800
You're pulling things into canon, but you've just established out of nowhere

1059
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,240
that Mickey calls Walt Daddy.

1060
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,440
Daddy, Daddy.

1061
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,160
Oh, gosh, Daddy.

1062
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,960
I didn't even mean it to be that creepy, but I think that's what we call him.

1063
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,160
Father. I don't know that he's his dad.

1064
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,920
Or anything. He is his dad.

1065
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,520
Walt. What would else would he be if he created him?

1066
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,040
If only he didn't love cigarettes more than me.

1067
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,880
Iron Man calls Stan Lee his father, his daddy.

1068
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,080
What?

1069
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,280
Did that happen somewhere?

1070
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,160
I don't think so, but maybe.

1071
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,520
Maybe. I read as a very conflicted

1072
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,640
relationship with his father, with the other Stark.

1073
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:36,720
It's got all your characters that you've created over the years.

1074
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,320
You know what they call you.

1075
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:44,920
You mean, wait, you mean like so me too, with my aforementioned videos?

1076
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,880
Yeah, all those characters, your Moonbeam City characters, you're

1077
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,520
their daddy.

1078
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,320
Hmm. So Chrysalis Tate calls me daddy.

1079
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,320
The kid, the Juggalo character, Crazy Thug Nuts calls me daddy.

1080
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,280
Yeah, that's correct.

1081
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,800
Yeah, nothing weird about it.

1082
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,720
Just a fact.

1083
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,360
I don't know if I was supposed to say any of that.

1084
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,680
Crazy Thug gosh.

1085
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,040
Keep it G rated.

1086
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,480
Oh, yeah. OK. Gosh rated.

1087
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,000
And I will try to not think about that.

1088
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,760
All these characters are somewhere.

1089
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,440
They're all somewhere.

1090
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:21,960
Yeah, the Moonbeam City is now available, by the way, or will be available,

1091
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,680
I believe, on Paramount Plus.

1092
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,080
And as we know from the Super Bowl, Paramount Plus

1093
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,120
takes place on top of a mountain on top of Mount Paramount,

1094
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:34,360
where James Corden and Beavis and Butt-Head and Dora the Explorer hang out.

1095
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,120
So they're up there too.

1096
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,280
Even though each other food ran out weeks ago.

1097
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,240
Who looks the most delicious?

1098
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,480
Oh, God damn it.

1099
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,200
SpongeBob is going to eat dazzle Novak.

1100
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,480
Oh, man. These characters, nobody cares about.

1101
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,520
Eat the one seasoners first.

1102
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,960
You got to warn them.

1103
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,440
They're weird. They call that guy Daddy all the time.

1104
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,040
Thousands dead on Mount Paramount.

1105
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,080
James Corden, the last to go.

1106
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,720
James Corden ate them all.

1107
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,160
That was the world war Z zombies turning on themselves.

1108
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,240
Oh, the humanity.

1109
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:27,480
I there's maybe something to talk about just before we get.

1110
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,720
Too far, and something I don't want to miss in this episode and devote some time to.

1111
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,640
And that is this

1112
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:38,600
to times where all of the characters live in the houses that kind of reflect them

1113
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,560
and their style, even Mickey's house is a little bit, you know, a little bit yellowish.

1114
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,320
It's sort of like looks like colors he would wear.

1115
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,440
Donald's boat looks like him.

1116
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,960
Goofy's bounce house even looks like it.

1117
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,560
So all right. So all the characters are there.

1118
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,920
They have their little characteristic houses.

1119
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,720
And then and so, of course, you got Minnie's house as well.

1120
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,320
Minnie, a separate house.

1121
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:05,720
Mickey and Minnie live in separate houses next door to each other.

1122
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,640
Interesting, noteworthy.

1123
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,360
Is this the way that

1124
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:16,080
couples should be more often?

1125
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,720
We go beyond just the separate beds into that.

1126
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,560
You have separate little houses,

1127
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,080
but right next door to each other for easy visitation.

1128
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:28,560
Mickey and Minnie are lovers, but not married.

1129
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,320
I think that is the canon. Yes.

1130
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:37,200
Yes. And it's not like Duffy and Shelly May, who have there's just a platonic love,

1131
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,120
a perfect love, but it is nothing.

1132
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:41,200
There's no sexual connotation to it at all.

1133
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:45,000
Mickey and Minnie's love, I think, is sexual in some way.

1134
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,440
So I but I don't think they're together.

1135
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,320
So it makes sense. Maybe they just live on the same street.

1136
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,000
That's when they first met each other because of just proximity,

1137
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,360
which is how so many of us meet our partners is just we're by them at work,

1138
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,840
at at play, at school, you know, whatever.

1139
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,360
That's how that happens.

1140
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,440
So I think it makes sense that they just sort of met.

1141
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,480
They happen to live near each other.

1142
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,920
And now they are together. They were neighbors.

1143
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:12,640
They were among the five people who lived in this one neighborhood.

1144
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,960
They were the two mouses, the two mice who lived next door to each other.

1145
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,120
There's a lot of expectation that they would get together.

1146
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,040
Do you think that it's ultimately a little hollow?

1147
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,560
Are they paired up just because they're mice and they were the only mice in town?

1148
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:31,720
It's possible. I mean, yeah, it's it's is it like they were together

1149
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,880
since they were in high school and, you know, it was just sort of

1150
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:38,120
just perpetual motion is the reason they're together.

1151
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,760
Possibly now it's there's a tradition.

1152
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,960
I mean, now there's an expectation that they have to be together

1153
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,400
because they've been together for so long and they're the faces of these

1154
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,720
of this giant company.

1155
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,760
And people would feel let down if that wasn't the case.

1156
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:52,640
So I think there's a lot of pressure on them in a lot of different ways

1157
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:55,280
to stay together. But they yes, they they.

1158
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:59,560
You know, I think, you know, they like their own space, maybe.

1159
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,600
Yeah, yeah.

1160
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,840
I mean, if you could arrange two little houses

1161
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,520
next door to each other, I could see the appeal in that.

1162
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:11,400
I don't like I don't want any distance from Aaron,

1163
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,840
but how awesome would it be to have two little houses?

1164
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,680
You'd still visit each other all the time.

1165
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,240
I just think that's hard to arrange.

1166
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,760
I think one house is tough enough, let alone.

1167
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,560
But I mean, it seems like more like what happens in like,

1168
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:27,320
like, you know, your your leisure worlds, your like elderly communities.

1169
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:31,480
People have little little pads and they go visit each other.

1170
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:34,000
They hold hands and watch TV. Right.

1171
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,520
We're very eccentric rich people.

1172
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:40,640
Like the couple that I thought of that it's like, oh, they lived

1173
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,400
across the way from each other is not one to emulate because it was Woody and Mia.

1174
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,520
So, OK, all right.

1175
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:53,520
I'm sure there's some old Hollywood like as is like the Golden Age of Hollywood.

1176
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,840
You know, more and more books came out over the years.

1177
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:59,600
You hear about weird like relationships like I don't.

1178
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,200
You know, people always talk about

1179
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:06,480
Spencer Tracy and and and Hepburn, Catherine Hepburn.

1180
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,200
And but he never he never divorced his first wife.

1181
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:16,200
Like they they had a very odd, you know, kind of relationship.

1182
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:19,440
They had a professional one and then a romantic one.

1183
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,240
But it was it was very much a product of its time, where it's just like,

1184
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,560
well, I can't get a divorce, you know.

1185
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,720
They could. So maybe Mickey and Minnie have a weird

1186
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:32,280
Golden Age of Hollywood like sort of thing.

1187
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:36,080
That's when they came to prominence. It makes sense. Yeah. Yeah.

1188
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,120
Played by those rules, by weird 30s rules.

1189
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:42,160
So you think Mickey was quietly married to Clarabelle the whole time?

1190
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,480
Still is. Oh, yeah.

1191
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,920
I think that's what Jason's implying.

1192
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:50,480
Yeah, that's probably I think that's likely.

1193
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,800
Yeah, so it's a whole yeah, I mean, who knows?

1194
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,440
Could Mickey and Minnie's love be sort of an arranged marriage type of a thing?

1195
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,720
Could it sort of just be for show at this point?

1196
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:05,280
And like Mickey and Minnie have other boyfriend and girlfriends.

1197
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,160
I mean, maybe I'm just saying like Minnie could maybe date.

1198
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:11,720
It's possible that she could have the ability to date and see other people.

1199
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,000
If they are married, she definitely does.

1200
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,440
The tabloid version.

1201
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,600
This is this is the sanitized version of Mickey and Minnie.

1202
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:23,480
But like like Bogart and Bacall was much rockier, you know,

1203
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:29,440
much more chaotic than then the popular culture remembers it.

1204
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,840
I mean, I look, I've talked to people and they've seen Minnie on Hinge, you know.

1205
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:36,960
She's on there.

1206
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,120
So I don't know what the story is, but something's going on.

1207
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,400
So if she were to like, I don't know, get a little flirty

1208
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:46,080
with a random part guest repeatedly, right, it doesn't.

1209
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,720
It's not. I don't know.

1210
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:50,000
But she could be looking for more. It's possible.

1211
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,240
Yeah, never know.

1212
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,320
I'm hearing that's what I'm hearing. That's what I'm hearing.

1213
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:57,760
I am. I found a bizarre bit of literature kind of about everything

1214
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:58,920
that we're referring to.

1215
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,000
I don't even remember the website anymore.

1216
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,160
They might not mind if I don't source them in this case, but

1217
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,800
I let me this is just really strange.

1218
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,960
It's so cute that Mickey and Minnie Mouse built their houses

1219
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,880
next door to each other in Toontown.

1220
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,760
As far as the public knows, they have never been married.

1221
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,520
Although Walt Disney said this is my change everything.

1222
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:26,120
Walt Disney said in a 1933 interview that in private life,

1223
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,400
Mickey is married to Minnie.

1224
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,120
Whoa. From Walt.

1225
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:35,240
But they keep up their public persona by having their own places to live.

1226
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,320
Whoa, wait a minute.

1227
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:41,800
So this person's extrapolating from a Walt quote that

1228
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,720
it's actually the opposite of what we've all been saying, that they are married

1229
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:49,440
and that the separate houses are to keep the possibility open.

1230
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,440
Allah. Let's not say that John Lennon has a girlfriend

1231
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,480
because we need the girls to think they can get with him.

1232
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:00,320
Just like all girls want to know that maybe at the end of the day

1233
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,480
they could still get with Mickey.

1234
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:07,400
Wow. So what you're saying is that I've been led to believe a lie

1235
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:10,480
about many and myself and that Minnie is actually married

1236
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,360
and she's just been leading me on and maybe hundreds to thousands

1237
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:18,960
of other park guests over the years, hundreds of thousands of park

1238
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,720
guests over the years by making a loud smooch noise

1239
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,960
and rubbing her plastic snout into my head.

1240
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,240
Yes. And it never came out because Mickey and Minnie

1241
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:35,200
clearly had something on Golden Age of Hollywood columnists had a hopper

1242
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:40,640
who Helen Mirren said Helen Mirren, someone played her in a feud

1243
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:41,840
Betty versus Joan.

1244
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,240
So maybe it was Walt.

1245
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,040
Maybe Walt had the dirt on her.

1246
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:49,240
And he's like, don't you ever do you ever print that Mickey and Minnie

1247
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:51,760
are married or I will ruin you?

1248
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,200
Oh, this was this quote. Yeah.

1249
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,640
Somebody might have like by this getting Lee.

1250
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,880
Walt said this to a reporter at a party.

1251
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:01,000
He'd had a couple of drinks and he let it slip and then it got printed.

1252
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,440
And that reporter is no longer with us.

1253
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,400
He ended up in the town late before Mickey.

1254
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,360
She's got a crush on you.

1255
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,600
Like they even together for a while.

1256
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:14,120
And it's just a crush like that's it's a little weird.

1257
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:18,720
But if they're keeping up appearance, if they're, you know, do it, it's an act.

1258
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:22,560
This is interesting because like what I was very lucky

1259
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:25,920
and I got to go into Walt's apartment on Main Street. Mm hmm.

1260
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:30,200
And there are two fold out twin beds.

1261
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:34,760
Oh, yeah. One for Walt and one for his wife, Lillian. Right.

1262
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:39,880
But like, yes, people adults slept in the same bed.

1263
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,360
You know, wasn't like I love Lucy.

1264
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,720
That's my understanding.

1265
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:46,360
But apparently it was fashionable for a while.

1266
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:51,080
People thought for health reasons, it was better to sleep in separate beds.

1267
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:56,160
Like medical, the medical, you know, studies on that were not quite clear.

1268
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,640
People that I want.

1269
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,800
Well, it did appear more chased on TV.

1270
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:03,560
Interesting. But I wonder if like Walt was thinking, you know,

1271
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:07,160
when people tour this and for many years, I want them to think that Lillian

1272
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:08,520
and I were both single.

1273
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:11,400
But yeah, because he's on TV, too.

1274
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:14,560
He's in the same boat as as Mickey.

1275
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,520
He's on.

1276
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,760
It's weird to think that Walt Disney would still on TV all the time.

1277
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:23,640
Well, like when the John Lennon thing, I'm discreetly John Lennon on it.

1278
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:26,440
Sullivan, like that's happening alongside Walt.

1279
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:32,080
And so, yeah, it's Beatlemania, but it's always Walt mania from like the 40s on.

1280
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,800
The same world screaming for the Beatles would also scream for Walt Disney.

1281
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,200
They want to go with him.

1282
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,360
He has a wedding ring on when he was touring Imagineering on TV.

1283
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:45,160
We got to check. Oh, I should say, yeah, when he's kind of

1284
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:48,200
when he's like taking that tour guide around, like with the hat

1285
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,680
and the little like bull riding thing, whatever.

1286
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:54,080
What do you call it? The crop riding crop or the crop?

1287
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:55,920
Yeah, yeah, I don't know.

1288
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,160
I got to check.

1289
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:00,920
Yeah, well, it's got to keep that dashing single image alive. Yeah.

1290
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,000
So, yeah, I always talk about Uncle Walt.

1291
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,400
They don't do they talk about aunt, aunt Lillian, little Auntie Lillian.

1292
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,760
I don't know. I've never heard that. Yeah.

1293
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,920
Hmm. Hmm. He wasn't out there as much.

1294
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:18,280
This is all. Don't you dare print?

1295
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,360
Don't you dare print that?

1296
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:22,880
Judy Davis was the actor who played Hedda Hopper.

1297
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,160
Oh, terrific. Terrific.

1298
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,360
She's good. Yeah.

1299
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:29,360
Um, hmm. So strange.

1300
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,040
It's a false front.

1301
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:35,960
The because you you the you won't think anything is weird.

1302
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:39,280
Oh, of course, this relationship like

1303
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:43,160
they are not technically locked down because they just live next to each other

1304
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,800
in two separate houses.

1305
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,080
Right. So a completely normal thing.

1306
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:51,800
I was also wondering, is the last name a coincidence

1307
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:56,480
or are they did was her name not?

1308
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,160
Maybe she like other care like

1309
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:03,160
goofy had no last name at all.

1310
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:06,960
She was many with no maiden name and then took his.

1311
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,960
Are Donald Daisy secretly married as well because they're both duck.

1312
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:16,080
Now you just don't there's just no representation of Daisy.

1313
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,840
She doesn't have like a separate boat next to his and she doesn't seem to have

1314
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:22,200
like a room in there.

1315
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,480
I don't see any Daisy belongings in the boat.

1316
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:27,080
There are photos of her on the boat.

1317
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:29,080
Isn't there a Daisy's house at one of the parks?

1318
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,200
There's I only know I know this.

1319
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:34,000
I've brought this up before in the Julio Torres stand up special.

1320
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,600
He brings up that there is a door that says Daisy's house and you just can't go in it.

1321
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,200
Oh, I that's the representation.

1322
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,160
You don't get to know.

1323
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,040
A person. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1324
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,280
Yeah, she doesn't want people.

1325
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:48,920
Rightfully so. Like thousands of people going into your house every day.

1326
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,160
I think it's odd that the characters.

1327
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:55,120
If we go back to the Toontown mythology and we haven't talked a lot about Toontown,

1328
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:59,320
but the whole idea with Toontown is that what the Imaginers are selling to you

1329
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,960
is that it was always there.

1330
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:05,600
Like when Disneyland opened, he also like got put in a little gated

1331
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,640
community for the characters to live so that they could be close and like come out

1332
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:10,960
and say hi to everybody.

1333
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,200
So it's not just that, you know,

1334
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,840
Toontown opened to the public in nineteen eighty three,

1335
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:19,000
but it was always back there. Right.

1336
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,960
Yeah. So they've

1337
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,160
I forget my original point with this.

1338
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:30,000
I think it's I think it's neat.

1339
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:32,360
I don't remember where I was going.

1340
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:35,080
You were just going to say something shocking, probably to try to.

1341
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,360
Yeah, yeah. Some some some edge lordy stuff.

1342
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,280
Yeah, I just.

1343
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,120
Oh, just like those houses existed.

1344
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:47,320
But the idea is like it's so in the 90s, they had to cut a new deal.

1345
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:50,160
Like, are you cool with we're going to open the gate here

1346
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,800
and people are going to flood into this house? Right.

1347
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,480
So anything you don't want us to see, you got to hide now like a gun.

1348
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,360
Like they like your bed.

1349
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,440
They had to get rid of a lot of different things in those places, probably.

1350
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,680
And just to make it sure to make sure people would

1351
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:11,280
not be offended by whatever paraphernalia Mickey had lying around.

1352
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:16,200
And so Daisy said, no, Daisy was like, no, nobody's coming into my house.

1353
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,280
Yeah. F you.

1354
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:21,480
Gosh, you gosh, you know, it's coming in here.

1355
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:23,800
My Daisy voice. Yeah.

1356
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,560
So it's I'm trying to think.

1357
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:29,600
I was thinking like, who else house wise do you want to go into?

1358
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:30,720
Like, who other care?

1359
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,400
What other characters in the Disney parks house do you want to see?

1360
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:37,960
Like if you could go into anyone's house, they have to be a theme park

1361
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:41,720
specific character, but like Indiana Jones is on the table since he's in a ride.

1362
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:43,960
They have to be so.

1363
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:48,360
So I can't it can't be Disney characters or the characters who are in the park.

1364
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:51,160
I would say it has to be in park characters,

1365
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:55,520
and it would be sort of an adjacent thing to maybe where their ride or experience was.

1366
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,200
Like, would you?

1367
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:00,360
Yeah. Would you want to see like where Chewie lives in Galaxy's Edge?

1368
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,200
What would be your number one?

1369
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:07,360
Because as a kid, I think I always I was very big on having like the playsets of toys

1370
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:11,520
where you would see characters live like the Ghostbusters firehouse.

1371
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:16,680
And I was like kind of upset that they didn't have their own beds in the firehouse.

1372
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:20,440
And I remember a babysitter one time made me like little napkins

1373
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,280
and was like, here, we'll make the beds for them.

1374
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:23,680
And I was like, this is awesome.

1375
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,760
Yes, I do want to see where the Ghostbusters sleep.

1376
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,760
And then my mom threw them out immediately because she said it was a fire hazard.

1377
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,080
There's a lot going on here.

1378
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:35,040
You want to see where the Ghostbusters sleep, first of all.

1379
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,560
I did. I like that.

1380
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,720
And when I got the Ninja Turtles sewer, I like the idea that I could

1381
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:44,880
I could like put the figures in like a lying down and have them sleep.

1382
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,280
I like the idea that I could see where they lived.

1383
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,600
You made little beds for the characters.

1384
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:54,040
Yeah, I will. The sewer didn't come with beds.

1385
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:57,520
None of these playsets came with beds, which bothered me because I was like,

1386
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:00,360
if this is where they live, I want to see their beds.

1387
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:04,400
So this babysitter made me little napkin beds for the Ghostbusters,

1388
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,960
which was thrown out immediately by my mother.

1389
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:11,720
But I'm saying like I for whatever reason, I liked that idea.

1390
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,960
I liked I think I've made them feel more alive to me.

1391
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:19,120
I like seeing like Michelangelo sleeping.

1392
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,840
And this is the fireproof safe that

1393
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,560
Donatello made them all to store their Social Security cards and passports in.

1394
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,440
Yes, I wanted to see what kind of safe Donatello would invent.

1395
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:37,880
You wanted to know you could steal the turtles identities if you so wanted to.

1396
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,480
I mean, you will.

1397
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:42,480
This is where Venkman and Spengler, this is the medicine cabinet

1398
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:45,160
where they keep their centrum silver because they're getting older.

1399
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:53,640
That's got to be in the new Ghostbusters, some sort of scene like that.

1400
01:13:54,480 --> 01:14:00,720
Yeah, I think like I just like getting I like those fantasy land rides,

1401
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:02,920
the dark rides a lot for kind of the similar reason.

1402
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:05,440
Like you got to go into the Dwarves house.

1403
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:08,520
You get to see and this is look, this is these are there's TLC shows.

1404
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:11,840
You know, people are fascinated, I think, by seeing where other people live

1405
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,720
and when all the rooms in people's houses.

1406
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:15,920
And I think there's so many reality shows based on it.

1407
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:19,760
I have very little interest in seeing where human beings live.

1408
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:25,160
Mike, I think people like those shows because they're usually like.

1409
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:29,920
Insane characters or like just wild people.

1410
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,120
I don't know that many people are like, oh, check out the bed.

1411
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:37,360
But check out the 90 day fiance is like a home.

1412
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:40,720
I'm saying like House Hunters or the flipper shows like we.

1413
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:46,680
OK, we used to go to, you know, model homes all the time or open houses.

1414
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,360
And we did that. Yeah, we did.

1415
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,640
OK, I see what you're saying.

1416
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:53,480
There's a human being, I think, a psychological thing with like

1417
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:56,160
just wanting to see where other people are sleeping.

1418
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:58,920
I don't know what I think I have it.

1419
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:01,720
I don't think I know what you mean.

1420
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:04,640
Jason, where does it or does this does this resonate with you at all?

1421
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,400
We got to see Egon's bed.

1422
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:11,440
Well, I I I kind of like

1423
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:15,040
half because I I see Mike's perspective,

1424
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:20,080
because I I would often worry about like, wait, so how do

1425
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,800
so each X-Men has their own room and they're eating.

1426
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:23,720
Everyone's eating, right?

1427
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:24,360
Everyone's getting it.

1428
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,600
I was asleep. Yes.

1429
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,480
I read about it.

1430
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:30,200
The machinations you wanted to know.

1431
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:33,440
I do. I it's also like in movies and TV.

1432
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:36,640
I'm like, does anyone in this do they ever go to the bathroom?

1433
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:40,520
I but I know I know now that that like storywise,

1434
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:42,320
it's just not enough time to put that in.

1435
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:46,280
I think for house hunters and and that sort of thing

1436
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:50,760
or where love it or listed, that is kind of aspirational.

1437
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:53,080
Like is people like, oh, that would be cool.

1438
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,400
Maybe we could get a house like that.

1439
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:59,440
You know, I did read a while back that, you know, the reason open,

1440
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:03,880
open concept, like open living room into kitchen is popular,

1441
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,040
like on those shows is a lot because

1442
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:11,640
men, when they watch, keep the channel tuned in.

1443
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,960
If there's demolition going on.

1444
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:18,240
So they often are demolishing walls to put rooms together.

1445
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:23,560
Like that is his like designers are not necessarily very fond of that.

1446
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:28,080
It's just like become popular because people see it on TV.

1447
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:32,000
We're forgetting also an example that is not currently on.

1448
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,120
But two examples, lifestyles, the rich and famous, but also cribs.

1449
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,960
People want to see famous people's houses.

1450
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,400
They want to see what it looks like.

1451
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,360
They want to see all the nooks and crannies.

1452
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,200
I don't think it's OK.

1453
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,480
I'm not. I'm not.

1454
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,360
There's a voyeurism to it.

1455
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:49,560
Yeah. People want to see the lives of the rich and famous.

1456
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:52,040
Yeah. But like you, I wanted to know.

1457
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:56,200
I wanted a schematic of the X-Men's mansion and I wanted to know where Colossus

1458
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,960
slept. I want to know which room Beast slept in.

1459
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,960
I wanted to know all of that stuff.

1460
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:04,520
And I would have really appreciated like a comprehensive map.

1461
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:07,040
I think they have some maps like that. Yeah, there are some here.

1462
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:10,680
I've never had this desire about a character.

1463
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:15,800
I can think of no examples of wanting to see where somebody's bed was.

1464
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,000
Now, you keep saying bed is if I'm meaning in a sexual.

1465
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,880
I don't take all the sex any sexiness out of this.

1466
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,560
There's nothing to do with that.

1467
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:26,480
I'm not. I think it's just but even regardless, I think there's a

1468
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:29,000
there's like a privacy issue here.

1469
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,520
Like you are like wanting that that you're kind of this overseer

1470
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:37,400
like and they're and I tuck the turtles in and there and now they are down.

1471
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,560
And they're like, right. They'll be up in eight hours.

1472
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:42,120
Rest up, guys. A lot of good fighting today.

1473
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,440
Great fighting boys.

1474
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,760
I had when I was a kid, I had a like

1475
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:53,320
multi-year narrative with my stuffed animals where I would make up stories with them.

1476
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,680
And I remember this so vividly.

1477
01:17:56,680 --> 01:18:00,080
I remember their bit like what the base I had created in their head.

1478
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,760
My head was for them.

1479
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:05,400
And I would like enjoy like, well, then Wile E.

1480
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,760
Coyote goes over here to sleep in his room.

1481
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:12,600
And then this character goes over here like it was very organized in hindsight.

1482
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:15,160
Wiley Coyote has a room.

1483
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:17,000
Yes. He has a

1484
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:22,320
what he sleeps on a human bed and not just like on a rock or in a cave.

1485
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:27,000
They lived in a base that was in a waterfall is my memory.

1486
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,760
And I had like my Ernie doll, my Wiley Coyote doll.

1487
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:33,680
I think maybe I had Sonic the Hedgehog in there.

1488
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:36,640
There were like a collection of five characters that I had teamed up

1489
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:41,360
like the Avengers, and I would like make up a story about them almost every night.

1490
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,880
And I remember these.

1491
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,160
I remember this pretty vividly.

1492
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:49,240
And I could probably sketch out what the base looks like in my head

1493
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,640
of what the adventures they would go on to.

1494
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:54,320
Well, the listeners are going to want to see that now.

1495
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,920
That's good ancillary content.

1496
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,520
All right. Here is the waterfall.

1497
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:02,200
Here's like the square footage of the waterfall base where Ernie

1498
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:05,240
and Wiley Coyote and Sonic the Hedgehog.

1499
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,160
Here's where there's where Sonic kept his rings.

1500
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,200
Here's Sonic's ring closet.

1501
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,840
And then Ben, just make sure you do have like somebody.

1502
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:16,520
There's like a the base is under renovation and there's a lot of jackhammering

1503
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:21,000
going on, so our male listeners will not tune out when looking at the photos of the base.

1504
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:25,120
We should retroactively put a lot of jackhammering sounds on this podcast

1505
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:29,040
just to keep people engaged for the boys, for the fellas.

1506
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:33,600
Yeah, for the lads, for the lads, for the lads.

1507
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:40,040
I you kind of share, I think, a sensibility with

1508
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:46,320
I never go wrong if I end up in my little podcast research on Disney dot fandom dot com,

1509
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:49,880
which always has some odd odd bits of writing.

1510
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:53,600
And this this I know I feel like maybe you wrote this.

1511
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:56,680
They break down the things in the house, the many rooms,

1512
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:59,120
most of which we haven't gotten to and may not.

1513
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:03,040
Just the with the pace we're going the places of interest.

1514
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,640
Bedroom where Mickey sleeps inside his room,

1515
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:11,480
you can see his black shoes he wears in the parks, as well as the famous suit

1516
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,840
and other clothes he wears in the parks.

1517
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:17,640
Also is a photo of Minnie and a very sloppy bed.

1518
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,560
I was.

1519
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,000
Doesn't the bed fluctuate?

1520
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,400
I thought the one bed was clean and the other was sloppy. Regardless.

1521
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:32,720
I the one closet is just the tucks and tails like he wears in the parks.

1522
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,120
And that seems hard.

1523
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,760
That's the stars. He does not get the rest.

1524
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,000
And he wears other clothes, you know.

1525
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,480
Yeah, I wear other clothes.

1526
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:41,480
Yeah, all the time. Yes.

1527
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:43,280
Many as Mickey has many clothes.

1528
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:48,520
Also, just the last one on the list bathroom where he bathes and does his grooming.

1529
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:53,080
I also highlighted that section of places of interest.

1530
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,840
All right. I did write you as well.

1531
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:58,680
I did write that. Yeah.

1532
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:03,080
You edited out the other filth people do in the bathroom.

1533
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:06,680
You know, when I hear about Mickey's waist.

1534
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:11,040
I just want to know where my favorite characters go to the bathroom. Yeah.

1535
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,560
I just want to see it.

1536
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:15,520
Mickey and Minnie have separate toilets.

1537
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:19,320
They don't share because they have to keep up their public personas.

1538
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:24,360
So hers looks like her and has polka dots and his is bright yellow

1539
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:26,800
with strips of red.

1540
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,760
It's shaped like his face.

1541
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,920
He poops into his own face.

1542
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:34,240
Mickey poops into his face.

1543
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:38,520
Now here, now at the at the one hour forty five mark or something.

1544
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:42,000
You said the phrase Mickey poops into his own face.

1545
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:46,200
And again, you ask the jury to not think

1546
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,080
that anything is wrong.

1547
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:52,760
I rest my case. You are your work.

1548
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:55,800
Oh, boy. I mean, that's I think this is where we knew

1549
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:58,120
things were going on.

1550
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:00,880
A character is like

1551
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:03,400
finding out about their lives.

1552
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,840
Do we do we

1553
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,440
we like this barn idea, this movie barn.

1554
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:12,720
I always liked how that so the so the premise here is that

1555
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:17,480
Mickey is set up, you know, he doesn't necessarily want to go all the way up

1556
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:22,240
to Burbank to shoot the movies on the Disney lot.

1557
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:25,360
So they've set up a place where he can make things himself.

1558
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:28,720
So when you meet Mickey, he is in the middle of filming.

1559
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:31,480
And there's one of four little places where he could be filming.

1560
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:33,840
I want to say these are if I can remember,

1561
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:38,560
Infantasia is one source of the print is seen Mickey through the looking glass

1562
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:43,440
is one the band concert is one, which was what that one ride is based on.

1563
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:48,440
The the silly symphony swings and Steambow Willie,

1564
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,400
which I like because it's black and white.

1565
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:53,040
I always that's the one I wanted to get when I did this as a kid.

1566
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,760
And I don't think I did because I like that the set is black and white

1567
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,080
and they make his clothes black and white as well.

1568
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,960
I thought that was clever.

1569
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:02,000
Yes, that's I have tried.

1570
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,680
We've only done this a couple of times, honestly.

1571
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:07,400
And I've never gotten that one.

1572
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:09,400
That one seems like the most fun to get.

1573
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:10,280
Yeah, yeah.

1574
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:14,400
You can get on the boat and swing the ropes and stuff.

1575
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:19,160
But I like this idea in general, this whole like I'll make the studio

1576
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:20,600
come to me.

1577
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:25,240
This is like this is before a podcast is before Marin in the garage.

1578
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:28,280
This is before Rogan move into Texas.

1579
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:33,080
This is he was very industrious to like,

1580
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:36,120
you know, he like, I've made my money.

1581
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,040
They can come to me.

1582
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,840
I was talking to. Oh, yeah.

1583
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:41,760
No, go ahead.

1584
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:45,280
Oh, I was I was talking to Robert Rodriguez.

1585
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:49,600
I like took a look around like he sat up down in Austin and like, it's great.

1586
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:52,240
He doesn't have suits bothering him, you know, breathing down his neck.

1587
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:55,040
I guess what you want just like the freedom.

1588
01:23:56,160 --> 01:24:00,640
You know, you can get catering from Captain Kids every day and it's right there.

1589
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,800
Come on, check out the facility, shoot whatever you want.

1590
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:09,920
Yeah, let's just like make something crazy, like just for us,

1591
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,560
like just to knock Hollywood on their asses.

1592
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:16,280
I've been making a lot of experimental films in my garage, too.

1593
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,000
Nobody's going to see him.

1594
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,320
It's just for me.

1595
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,000
Yeah, you're not.

1596
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,400
No, I love I love this idea.

1597
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,920
I mean, he's got a great idea and he's got the money to make it happen.

1598
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,320
And he can work from home. Yeah, he working from home.

1599
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,600
It's a better way of life, better quality of life.

1600
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:38,040
It's great only being at home and doing all your work from home rules.

1601
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,960
I think we've all learned this.

1602
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:42,640
Yeah, we love this. We love it.

1603
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:44,240
We love doing this on Zoom.

1604
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:45,840
It's not going back, by the way.

1605
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:47,760
I take back the country bear.

1606
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,440
I take back that country bear promise.

1607
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,760
It's going to be on Zoom. Sorry.

1608
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:54,560
Wait, no, we're sticking to no, no.

1609
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,440
I love Zoom now.

1610
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:58,240
No, we have to do this.

1611
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,680
I've turned the corner.

1612
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,640
You and Jason can get together.

1613
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:03,440
20 minute commute.

1614
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,680
Save on the commute, you know, save on the gas.

1615
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,920
I feel like Jason's going to be on Zoom, too, though, so.

1616
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:11,640
We've all just gotten to.

1617
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,720
We're all just going to do it from bed now.

1618
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:18,800
We'll look at each other in our sloppy beds, our very sloppy beds.

1619
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:22,880
I'm lying down. I put this on the ceiling, this backdrop on the ceiling.

1620
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,400
It's stuck to the ceiling. I'm lying down.

1621
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,040
And I don't want to explain it.

1622
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,440
I don't want to explain how it works with the physics,

1623
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:33,760
but needless to say, I'm lying down like a tune house thing. Yep.

1624
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,800
So, yeah, Mickey doesn't have to commute.

1625
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,160
He was probably just producing through the pandemic.

1626
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:43,320
He was probably at no slowdown as far as his output.

1627
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,440
Oh, sure. Made a whole feature.

1628
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:49,840
My movie about lockdown, because like you have to address it.

1629
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:54,800
You have to like it's an outfit in the room and people want to see like my take on it.

1630
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:59,280
People want to be reminded of this time for the next couple of years.

1631
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,520
I'm pretty confident of that.

1632
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:04,040
They want most of their art to reflect it.

1633
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,040
We don't want to just forget.

1634
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:09,920
I like this. I like all of this stuff, too, because

1635
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:20,360
it's another sort of childhood fascination of corridors and secret areas and surprises when it comes to like the idea of a mansion.

1636
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:25,280
We've said this before, I'm sure, with like a secret room or a secret this.

1637
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:34,560
Like going into Mickey's house the first time whenever I did it, which is in my late 20s, I'm sure, it was like, oh, well, there's this and this as well.

1638
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:41,000
There's a real fun exploration aspect of it, too, because you think you're just going to see the basics.

1639
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,200
But no, no, all this stuff is this discovery is what I'm saying, which is fun.

1640
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:47,200
The way it keeps going back and back.

1641
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:48,440
And I don't think I knew any of that.

1642
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:52,840
And I love that. Like, it's kind of eerie, the backyard with the chickens.

1643
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:56,040
That glow is kind of strange, but it's a cool room.

1644
01:26:56,040 --> 01:27:01,000
I was watching a walkthrough and like, man, I would absolutely would like to go be in that room again.

1645
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,400
I really like those chickens.

1646
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:05,680
Those are some good, like plasticky 90s animatronics.

1647
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:12,640
And isn't there there's like a there's a gag with carrots, like that a carrot disappears and a gopher pops up or something like that.

1648
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:14,640
Yep. That's all nice.

1649
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:19,680
Mickey's Mickey's overalls are there, which looks like he left his butt in them.

1650
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:24,280
Oh, yeah. Or just kind of like permanently.

1651
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,480
They're stretched to a butt degree.

1652
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,280
Yeah. And it says mouse, kosh, right?

1653
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,880
Mouse, kosh, like mouse, kosh.

1654
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:33,200
Yeah. Mouse, kosh.

1655
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:38,800
See, we should have said seat or we should have said, gosh, mouse, kosh, but gosh.

1656
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:43,760
So, yeah, I like all this.

1657
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,760
All the detail is fun.

1658
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,080
And a lot of stuff I missed.

1659
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:50,640
I wish I was like, oh, this would have been great to go and then like write everything down.

1660
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,400
Mickey's to do list.

1661
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,760
Mickey has a to do list pinned up somewhere.

1662
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:56,920
Oh, yeah. Is there anything interesting on there?

1663
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:59,600
Well, he wakes up at 5 a.m.

1664
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:02,960
and he commits to being in the movie barn at 630 a.m.

1665
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,960
Oh, God. Yeah.

1666
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:07,080
And kind of brutal.

1667
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,760
What are lawn call Mickey call many

1668
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:14,360
eat a balanced breakfast, play with Pluto, mouser size.

1669
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:15,960
He makes time to mouser size.

1670
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:17,680
It's really hard to build good habits.

1671
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:19,400
So like he seems committed.

1672
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:23,200
And I think paper to do lists help me more than apps.

1673
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:27,960
I think if I write it down, I will more likely to get it done if I write down on paper.

1674
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:30,000
So, yeah, I respect it.

1675
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:35,760
I like that he writes with he writes like the in the Disney font

1676
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:40,760
with all the swirls and the W's done in the swirly way and the eyes are dotted

1677
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:45,840
and the D, which it's like, boy, it's insane to see an entire thing written that way.

1678
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:49,160
It's like seeing a big like Prince liner notes where there's so many twos

1679
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:51,440
and fours and you.

1680
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:54,360
You really got to stare at it for a while to know what you're looking at.

1681
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,480
You know, that's how you know it's a great art.

1682
01:28:56,480 --> 01:29:01,120
It's almost illegible when you see a whole page of that, like the like the Springsteen,

1683
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:06,240
the the copies of his like darkness on the edge of town of books is chicken scratch.

1684
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:11,600
It is almost unreadable because they're just like throwing it out.

1685
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,920
They're not taking time to make it look nice.

1686
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:17,560
So, I mean, that's like that.

1687
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:20,680
I feel like is the most of what I have to say about, oh, you know, one more thing.

1688
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:22,240
I really like that little.

1689
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:27,240
So you get through you get into the movie barn and you're waiting for the light

1690
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:32,240
to go on to tell you that you can go into one of the Mickey little stages.

1691
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,600
And there's this great

1692
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:40,560
like montage of it's old trailers, basically, for what it's,

1693
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:46,920
you know, 30s, 40s style old timey trailers for the things that he's shooting,

1694
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:52,440
mixed with all this interstitial stuff of Goofy and Donald working on the projector

1695
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:55,840
and like loading up the next clip and Mickey shows up in it at one point.

1696
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:56,760
You know what I'm talking about?

1697
01:29:56,760 --> 01:30:01,400
Like all this like the like their shadows in the projector in the queue there.

1698
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:04,080
Yeah, I like that so much.

1699
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,520
There's like really clever animation.

1700
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:10,120
Goofy has a fight with a hair that's stuck in the projector.

1701
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:14,040
Like the hair is jittering around and then it gets bigger and bigger

1702
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:16,840
and chases him around and Donald gets stuck.

1703
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:19,680
I really like it despite it.

1704
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:22,600
Like this is one of those things that made me a little scared as a kid,

1705
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:24,720
like projector hijinks.

1706
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:28,320
I was thinking of like watching Gremlins 2 recently.

1707
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:31,120
We talked about that Gremlins ride like anything.

1708
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:35,360
Oh, you know, also, oh, the big one, the from that Hitchcock thing in Florida,

1709
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:40,880
when the birds interrupt the projection, when there's a bunch of bird shadows,

1710
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:46,320
I found that I still find that kind of eerie and upsetting.

1711
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:49,680
Like that's you just trust that a projector shouldn't go wrong.

1712
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:52,600
If any, that'll always get me a scene where like the thing

1713
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:56,080
where something melts on purpose always freaks me out.

1714
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:57,960
Things are very wrong.

1715
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:02,560
No, I think that all that Mickey stuff, like there's so much stuff

1716
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:05,960
you would easily miss, I think, just walking through here once,

1717
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:09,200
which is like any of the best stuff we always always talk about is like

1718
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:13,760
you would want to like hang out and see, you know, new stuff every time you go.

1719
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:19,240
And it's like even watching this video again, and I haven't been in there in a while.

1720
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:24,240
I go, oh, yeah, this thing is packed, packed with little jokes, packed with stuff.

1721
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:29,320
And it's like it's still it holds up, you know, yeah, all that stuff, I think.

1722
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:33,480
It might be because of the projector, but it reminds me a lot of the

1723
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:37,080
I know it's put in in the same era as the Indiana Jones adventure

1724
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:41,200
and therefore the Indiana Jones queue, which also just goes and goes and goes.

1725
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:43,040
And you lose sense of geography.

1726
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:45,320
And where are you at this point?

1727
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:47,720
And what building am I in now?

1728
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:51,520
And it's so engaging, even though you haven't had the main experience yet.

1729
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,760
Just every bit of it's been been interesting and exciting.

1730
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:57,360
And I know they were firing on all cylinders.

1731
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:59,720
I think they they made this a very cool experience.

1732
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:02,720
You can feel that you can feel the Eisner in it.

1733
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:05,320
That's what I think. Yeah. Yeah.

1734
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:08,160
I'm throwing money at stuff.

1735
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:12,680
Attention to detail now, which is a little less the case

1736
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:15,680
with the Mickey's birthday land house.

1737
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:20,200
And we're winding down here, but I want to I want to give a little time to this

1738
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:24,200
put in in 1988.

1739
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:26,760
This was intended to be kind of this temporary land.

1740
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:29,800
And then it stuck around and got to townified

1741
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:32,480
and kind of unified with the one in in California.

1742
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:37,080
But so it's it's Mickey's, what, 60th birthday, I believe.

1743
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:40,960
So they did kind of like a little mini toon town,

1744
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:45,520
clearly like paving the way to toon town, but a little less committed.

1745
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:50,600
And there is a Mickey's house and it's kind of lumpy.

1746
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:53,520
It's not as lumpy, but a little bit lumpy.

1747
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:57,600
But the main thing is that you go in

1748
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:00,880
and as opposed to the eventual toon town version,

1749
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,720
it's pretty much just a regular house. Yes.

1750
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,240
And I knew this.

1751
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,120
I couldn't have articulated exactly what was wrong,

1752
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:13,360
but I had seen the pictures of toon town in California.

1753
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:15,600
And then I went into Mickey's birthday land.

1754
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:18,800
And what a disappointment.

1755
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:23,160
But but I love it now so much.

1756
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:28,640
Now it amuses me very much that this is the style of the house.

1757
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,840
And Mike, when you were talking about the chairs,

1758
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:34,800
about being disappointed by the hard chairs,

1759
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:38,440
I was staring at a photo that I had not seen.

1760
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:42,520
Look at this black and white photo of Mickey in his Florida house

1761
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:48,400
in a soft chair, in completely a grandpa's house,

1762
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:52,400
kind of like next to an unadorned fireplace.

1763
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:55,440
It's a plain room with nothing on the table.

1764
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,640
And he's reading the newspaper.

1765
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:59,200
He's reading the funny pages.

1766
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:03,440
Is it like a modify, like an especially cartoony Disney

1767
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:06,600
customized funny pages? No, I can see from the shapes.

1768
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:08,440
He's reading Kathy.

1769
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:11,640
He's reading the regular comics.

1770
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:17,200
They grabbed an Orlando Sentinel from Main Street.

1771
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:23,480
Yes, just though he's reading about like George Bush's recent policies.

1772
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:26,560
He's staying abreast on real world events.

1773
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:28,920
So I love this.

1774
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:32,400
I like the the not fun, not cartoony.

1775
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:36,480
And I wonder, like, was the idea to do all right?

1776
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:38,920
Well, Mickey's house, that's got to be a madhouse.

1777
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:41,800
That's got to be crazy. He's the craziest cartoon mind.

1778
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:43,960
We have to make it full of cartoon stuff.

1779
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:47,640
And then it got scaled back and like, it's kind of just got to be a table.

1780
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:52,240
Or was it just like a lack of creativity from the beginning?

1781
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:54,400
Yeah, that's a good question.

1782
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:57,720
My memory is that you couldn't get close to things either.

1783
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,600
Like there were like roped off.

1784
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:02,040
They're they're blocked off.

1785
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:05,840
Well, by the end of by the by the time it was like Toontown Fair,

1786
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,760
it was a little more cartoony.

1787
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:09,160
Like they would add stuff.

1788
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:12,440
They that's when they put up like here's like the fish that he caught up

1789
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:14,840
on the mantle and it's a big cartoony fish.

1790
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:18,120
But even then, you couldn't go close to anything, I don't think.

1791
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:21,000
You couldn't go close to anything because you didn't really you could just.

1792
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:23,640
This was like a walkthrough, because, yeah, you would meet Mickey

1793
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:25,640
and the judges tent.

1794
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:28,400
The weirdest element of this is the kitchen to me.

1795
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:31,320
Did you guys look at the kitchen?

1796
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:33,840
Remind me. Yeah, show us.

1797
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:36,000
Or unless you. OK.

1798
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,560
Well, the idea of the kitchen,

1799
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:41,600
I don't have it directly in front of me, is that it's a mess.

1800
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:42,840
There's like holes in the walls.

1801
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:45,160
There's paint everywhere because

1802
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:51,000
they Donald and Goofy convinced Mickey to

1803
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:54,800
let them use his home for the kitchen

1804
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:57,600
remodeling contest for the fair.

1805
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:01,560
Demonstration.

1806
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:03,160
Yes, it's going to be that's right.

1807
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:06,360
And there is a handwritten note saying as much.

1808
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,040
Oh, gosh.

1809
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:09,640
Somebody want to read the note?

1810
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:11,280
Somebody want to do a Mickey here?

1811
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:16,120
Sure, I can read it in the Disney Disney.

1812
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:19,040
When you boys said you wanted to enter the home

1813
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:23,200
remodeling contest by walking like to wait by

1814
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:26,920
where you're making by making my kitchen look different.

1815
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:28,640
You weren't kidding.

1816
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:30,800
It sure looks different. All.

1817
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:35,320
All right. All right. All right. Let's.

1818
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:39,400
And then it smears and then it gets eerie.

1819
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:41,640
Huh? This is him.

1820
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:44,040
This is Mickey scolding

1821
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:46,840
Donald and Goofy for messing up his house.

1822
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:50,440
Yeah, because there's pain everywhere.

1823
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:53,160
There's there's a hole in the wall.

1824
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:56,520
It's noticeable, though, that as you talk about just real stuff,

1825
01:36:56,520 --> 01:37:01,240
the kitchen table and has just two folding chairs,

1826
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:04,080
two regular folding chairs on it.

1827
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:07,440
I love this. I love this weird.

1828
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:10,760
And I think something that I like about it is that

1829
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:15,800
it feels like how it felt to visit your your grandpa,

1830
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:18,440
your grandma at the time.

1831
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:22,840
Like they like and I'll show you like here's how the kitchen looked.

1832
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:26,280
I think before this this Goofy Donald gag,

1833
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:29,840
like this fruit lamp and just here's some tea.

1834
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:32,880
It's not wacky stuff. It's just I got my tea, my

1835
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:38,200
my teacups and my cozies and my cookie and my radio.

1836
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:39,720
No, it's not like a boombox.

1837
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:43,200
It's like, no, it's an old, you know, it's what you hear Glenn Miller on.

1838
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:46,880
I listen to my stories and and then the like

1839
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:50,360
what's on top of the the the stove.

1840
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:55,160
It's just like, like these are products from the 20s.

1841
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:59,120
Like his his sugar and his flour are like Mr.

1842
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:01,400
Henderson's old time goodness.

1843
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:07,120
Molasses like and oh, you know, in my

1844
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:11,160
my spice rack, I have a little plant, you know,

1845
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:13,320
I forget to water it, though.

1846
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:15,840
It's so incredibly mundane.

1847
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:19,320
That sink that's there's nothing fun going on with the sink.

1848
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:20,800
No, it's just a sink.

1849
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,400
It's a sink with like an old time cloth.

1850
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:26,760
I don't know what you would even call it, like separating the under sink.

1851
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:28,440
There's not even a cabinet.

1852
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:30,280
The red and white checkerboard.

1853
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:35,960
Yeah, just like a tablecloth would be like he's a he just has an old person's

1854
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:38,800
house, which I guess he's from the 30s.

1855
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:42,960
We were talking about him having these 30s dating ideals, but you know,

1856
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:46,600
yeah, got some hard candy, you know, take

1857
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:50,360
the little strawberries with the goo inside.

1858
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:51,680
You can have those.

1859
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:54,040
Tell me if you're not eating them anymore, because I don't.

1860
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:55,840
I buy those especially for you.

1861
01:38:55,840 --> 01:39:00,880
So I'll save I'll save two dollars a week if I don't have to buy them anymore.

1862
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:03,040
I don't know what runs are nerds are.

1863
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:06,040
That sounds too outrageous of a candy for me.

1864
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:07,840
Those will get you hopped up.

1865
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:12,680
Just just some rig, just some Werther's just some Werther's originals.

1866
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:16,720
I said I'd never drink Senko, but it is good after dinner.

1867
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:19,280
It doesn't keep you awake, you know.

1868
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:21,800
Do you want your third meal of milk and cheese?

1869
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:26,160
Come on, you're grown boy.

1870
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:29,240
You need that milk and cheese.

1871
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:32,520
Yeah, I I remember being so

1872
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:36,000
I do. I don't think I'm revising my own history.

1873
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,320
I remember being let down by not being able to go around and see stuff

1874
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:43,440
and then either either before or after seeing Toontown pictures and going,

1875
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:45,120
yes, that's right.

1876
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:47,040
This is not.

1877
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:49,680
Oh, I remember. Yeah, I remember.

1878
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:52,360
Well, look at the then look at the TV room.

1879
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:57,600
This is like this is a room that you are cleaning up

1880
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,480
because the person has just passed away. This.

1881
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:04,560
This looks, by the way, some of this stuff looks like Walt's apartment

1882
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:07,200
on Main Street. Yeah, yeah.

1883
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:08,720
It really does. Yeah.

1884
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:12,840
Yeah. So yeah, Mickey lives in a house that looks like it's the it's the

1885
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:16,720
aesthetic and style of somebody who died in 1966.

1886
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,120
Yes. That little it's a little TV.

1887
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:24,120
Like it would not even if it's a circular screen.

1888
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:27,600
I don't think I knew there was such a thing as it was just a little circle.

1889
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:30,880
Oh, yeah. It's like it's like half the real estate of the box.

1890
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:34,240
Original TV was just a circle.

1891
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:36,400
It's just seen one person's head and that was it.

1892
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:41,280
I just want to come home after a long day and watch the Dumont

1893
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:43,440
network on my little circle TV.

1894
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:47,800
I love I watch Ozzie and Harriet and I can't.

1895
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:50,920
No, I can't see both Ozzie and Harriet at the same time.

1896
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:55,720
I have to choose which one can only show one one in the circle.

1897
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:58,840
I heard tonight will feature Harriet's year.

1898
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:03,680
Really excited to see what her ear looks like.

1899
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:05,160
I have a painting of a bridge.

1900
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:07,320
I think the frame is just lovely.

1901
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:10,200
Just so ornate. It's like being a museum.

1902
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:13,440
I've been knitting a Christmas tree skirt for a while.

1903
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:17,200
I think it's coming together.

1904
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:20,800
I just get I do the prepackaged one.

1905
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:25,400
It's got the snow, but the white just kicked on there permanently.

1906
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:29,200
I just I can't go to the lot every year and the prices.

1907
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:33,040
Oh, my. Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

1908
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,480
The old lady Mickey is pretty good.

1909
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:38,720
Is a pretty good character.

1910
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:43,320
I'm glad you had illustrations because I didn't go back this far.

1911
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:47,320
I and I am looking at like 2011 Toontown Fairhouse, and I'm like,

1912
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:50,160
when you first started talking about this, I was like,

1913
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:52,920
yeah, you guys are right. It looks real normal.

1914
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:56,280
Uh huh. And I think like I'm losing my mind.

1915
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:00,360
Staring at the big fish.

1916
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:03,680
What do they mean? I'm glad I'm illustrating it.

1917
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:06,640
It's a lot of fun as a big fit.

1918
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:10,640
But there's even like in the later house, he had like a crazy radio

1919
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:13,600
with a big smile and there's eyes in the speakers.

1920
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:17,400
But in the original one, it was just a regular old radio.

1921
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:21,160
And he never from 1949.

1922
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:23,960
Well, that's his country house.

1923
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:27,200
That's why they had to add that on at the country house.

1924
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:29,040
You know, he didn't put all of his fun stuff in there.

1925
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:33,440
That was just sort of a getaway spot to be reminded of the simple times.

1926
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:36,600
Well, it's I guess it's like how you would rent a house.

1927
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:40,440
And it was like a kind of all of somebody else's stuff, you know,

1928
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:45,360
like you go like like a vacation home feels kind of stuck 20 years ago

1929
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:48,040
because people aren't living there all the time.

1930
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:49,960
Yeah, maybe that maybe that was the idea.

1931
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:53,280
Do you think while Disneyland's been closed, Mickey's been renting it out

1932
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:54,920
as an Airbnb?

1933
01:42:56,760 --> 01:43:00,200
Possible. I mean, I guess he has to live somewhere, but you never see him there

1934
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:03,000
when we're at Disneyland, so he's got to have another house.

1935
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:07,600
Like, I'm worried about spreading the virus that way, but, you know,

1936
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:10,360
like, you know, they're going to do what they're going to do.

1937
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:13,920
And I'm not going anywhere near it for months.

1938
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,760
And I got to make that money.

1939
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:18,880
So freedom of choice.

1940
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:22,720
Mickey has been lying low in that Colorado town that was like, all right,

1941
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:27,880
everyone with a vacation home, get out, stop coming here and spreading the virus.

1942
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:32,160
He probably perfectly recreated that Mickey, the Florida Mickey

1943
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:34,400
house in Colorado somewhere.

1944
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:37,080
There's that old lady Mickey house in Colorado now.

1945
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:39,640
That's where he's been hanging. Oh, yeah.

1946
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:41,000
Until this thing blows over.

1947
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,760
You see, he's hanging with Lauren.

1948
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:45,360
He's saying he's around with Lauren over there.

1949
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:47,040
They are all in Colorado.

1950
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:48,840
They were doing rapid tests.

1951
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:50,000
We're doing rapid tests.

1952
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,680
You know, we're feeling pretty safe.

1953
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:53,920
It's like an April rep.

1954
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:58,080
I've gotten I've gotten food poisoning from Shooters Grill three times.

1955
01:43:58,120 --> 01:44:00,880
OK, can happen anywhere.

1956
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:05,040
They're all they've all been vaccinated since since August somehow.

1957
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,480
Oh, yeah.

1958
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:08,840
The Bellemingrove Super Site.

1959
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:12,200
Yeah. The Davos injection site.

1960
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:14,400
Yeah. Are you going to tell me I didn't earn it?

1961
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:16,720
I've been entertaining people for,

1962
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:19,520
God, what, 100 years this point?

1963
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:24,640
I mean, if I not paid my debts to you, give me it first.

1964
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:27,240
De Niro gets it then Mickey.

1965
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:29,640
Keith Richards.

1966
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:31,280
More important.

1967
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:34,160
I've publicly cast them down on the vaccine, but yeah, I got it.

1968
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:36,880
OK, it's sort of, you know,

1969
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:39,840
like, I don't really believe that it was just kind of for the base.

1970
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:43,080
You know, you got to play to what they want.

1971
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:45,360
I'm just saying that to the size isn't fully in yet.

1972
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:47,920
Meanwhile, I got it.

1973
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:48,840
I got it.

1974
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:56,720
Yeah, so I am the then just before we wrap up,

1975
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:59,400
because we somehow this this phrase is not been said,

1976
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:02,800
and I cannot resist the opportunity to talk about something that's come up

1977
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:06,400
on the show before I was so happy that it became a successful call

1978
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,560
and response when we did a live show.

1979
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:12,280
But obviously, my favorite part of the house

1980
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:17,600
is when Mickey needs to make a phone call, what does he do?

1981
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:24,640
I use the damn I we've now we've talked a bunch about the mundanity of the house.

1982
01:45:24,640 --> 01:45:28,280
And maybe that gives you a greater picture of why I love this so much.

1983
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:30,680
This very flat phrase.

1984
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:35,200
It's just like, if I need to store a box, I use the attic.

1985
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:40,840
If I need to plug in Christmas lights, I use the outdoor outlet.

1986
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:46,120
This is just not there's no cartooning this or comedy contained in the phrase.

1987
01:45:46,360 --> 01:45:49,960
A regular my dad could say, if I need to make a call, I use the den.

1988
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:55,840
Don't have to change anything about the phrase.

1989
01:45:55,840 --> 01:46:00,480
But I know I forget when I brought this up before, if I played the clip

1990
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:05,320
and forgive me if I did, but just I'm just going to do the whole context here.

1991
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:08,200
And sometimes people ask, what is this

1992
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:11,680
from? And I wanted to make sure I knew which one it was.

1993
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:16,160
We put the clip on our YouTube, but it's also the special it's from is the 1988

1994
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:18,600
Walt Disney World, Fourth of July Spectacular.

1995
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:21,840
It's a general preview of Mickey's birthday land.

1996
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:24,120
The things hosted by Mark Summers.

1997
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:27,480
So if you see Mark Summers and not Regis, which is very rare,

1998
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:30,200
then you know you're in the right special.

1999
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:33,120
But let me just this whole because I like the den thing,

2000
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:36,360
but I love the other stuff very much, too.

2001
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:40,880
So here's oh, wait, I think I shared the wrong screen.

2002
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:44,280
Got confused. OK, there we go.

2003
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:47,760
Boy, is there plenty to do here like visiting my house.

2004
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:49,600
Want to take a peek?

2005
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:53,440
This is my living room.

2006
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:55,760
I love to play the piano in there.

2007
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:57,720
And nothing to play your piano.

2008
01:46:57,720 --> 01:47:00,720
Yeah, it's a wait. He's playing a player piano.

2009
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:04,040
This is like the mini. How many lies, Mickey?

2010
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:07,280
The mini lies, the marriage lies, the player piano.

2011
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:09,720
Where does it? You can see the scroll, Mickey.

2012
01:47:10,280 --> 01:47:12,120
We can see the scroll. We know you're a cipher.

2013
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:14,320
You're no we know you're an everyman on screen,

2014
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,400
but like you're living your life that way, too.

2015
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:18,040
Come on, man.

2016
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:20,160
Also, this Mickey voice.

2017
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:22,200
This is this is like Mickey.

2018
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:25,480
Hey, Mickey Mouse, you recognize this voice, don't you?

2019
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:27,880
There's so much to do.

2020
01:47:27,880 --> 01:47:30,240
I use the pen.

2021
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:33,280
I don't I feel we've done a lot of Mickey's throughout this.

2022
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:36,320
We've been doing a Mickey voice this whole episode, and I don't I would

2023
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:40,520
I don't feel great about my I'm definitely no more than a C minus

2024
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:42,760
in a regular Mickey Mouse voice, maybe even lower.

2025
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:47,880
I think my I think I do a pretty good not right Mickey.

2026
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:54,000
I think when it comes to which I think this would make for a great SNL audition

2027
01:47:54,160 --> 01:47:55,880
that because you got to do the impressions.

2028
01:47:55,880 --> 01:48:00,640
And if I said, OK, so this is Mickey Mouse, but not like the one from the cartoons.

2029
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:03,040
But like when they do a special and it was like not the right

2030
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:05,800
voice is kind of off like so anyway, here it is.

2031
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:08,880
Well, I couldn't hear.

2032
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:10,120
I think Lauren laughed.

2033
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:12,960
I'm pretty sure he knew what I was talking about.

2034
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:14,800
Marcy Klein laughed.

2035
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:17,200
I heard mercy.

2036
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:21,000
But I don't know about I think Lauren did.

2037
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,560
That I have to make a telephone call.

2038
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,280
I use the den.

2039
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:27,680
Yeah. Anybody for a cheese sandwich?

2040
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:30,200
That's good, too.

2041
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:32,240
Pleasant dreams, everybody.

2042
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:33,080
Haha.

2043
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:35,240
Haha. That laugh.

2044
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:36,440
That's not even Mickey's.

2045
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:37,240
Haha. Yeah.

2046
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:38,160
You know the Mickey laugh.

2047
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:38,840
Haha.

2048
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:41,560
Kind of fused with peewee, I think.

2049
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:43,480
Yeah. I.

2050
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:46,240
Anybody for a cheese sandwich?

2051
01:48:46,240 --> 01:48:48,160
A little aggressive.

2052
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:49,800
You see it?

2053
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:51,920
Like, yeah, like escape trying like desperately.

2054
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:54,240
Those words are trying to desperately escape from his mouth.

2055
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:57,360
I need to make a call.

2056
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:58,480
I use the den.

2057
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:02,960
There's a pause as if a joke is coming or a pun or something.

2058
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:05,280
And nope, no.

2059
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:09,520
If I want to brighten the room up, I put in a plant.

2060
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:17,280
Just if the pipe breaks, I call a plumber because I don't want to like,

2061
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:20,960
you know, you could like watch a tutorial, but like rather just leave it.

2062
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:22,800
You're an expert and I can afford it, obviously.

2063
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:26,880
So like, I guess cheese sandwich is like, oh, isn't that cute?

2064
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:27,680
He's a mouse.

2065
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:29,080
It's a cheese sandwich.

2066
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:30,640
There's that.

2067
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:36,040
But you might also just be like also like a just a bachelor would say that,

2068
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:38,760
like somebody who doesn't live with somebody who knows how to cook.

2069
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:41,000
Cheese sandwich again.

2070
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:45,880
When I'm hungry, I just take a big spoonful of peanut butter out of the jar.

2071
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:47,000
Haha.

2072
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:51,240
The way Mike has always eaten.

2073
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:54,840
No, that's only pandemic.

2074
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:56,120
That's only from the pandemic.

2075
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:57,680
No.

2076
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:02,560
Come on, Mike, eat milk and cookies like a grown man.

2077
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:07,880
Well, I didn't say I was any better.

2078
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:09,520
Yeah, that's a good point. Yes.

2079
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,320
Yeah.

2080
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:13,520
There's no moral superiority.

2081
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:16,200
I also want to keep playing because there's one more thing in this.

2082
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:19,600
After you go to the house and we're not going to do Mickey's birthday lander

2083
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:22,680
starland, obviously, there's so much more to cover there.

2084
01:50:22,680 --> 01:50:23,920
We will get to all that.

2085
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:27,720
But just I'm going to extend the clip into this other thing where Mickey,

2086
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:31,280
I mean, he'll explain it, but there was also a thing, I think, called the mouse

2087
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:34,960
maze that was like a little hedge maze you get lost in.

2088
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:37,520
And also there was little like water gags.

2089
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:40,000
And I just really like the way he he narrates this.

2090
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:44,480
So when just kids are getting like little squirts of water in the face

2091
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:45,680
is what's happening.

2092
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,680
This is the mouse maze that kids can run through.

2093
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:54,680
Whoops.

2094
01:50:54,680 --> 01:50:56,680
Whoops again.

2095
01:50:56,680 --> 01:51:02,680
I just am laughing at these kids like as if he's controlling the water himself.

2096
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:05,000
Whoops. Whoops again.

2097
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:09,080
He also knows what he's doing, too.

2098
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:11,520
Yeah. Yeah. Pretty clear.

2099
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:13,840
Yeah. He's f'ing with them.

2100
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:16,000
I'm gushing with them.

2101
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,960
They like it. Come on.

2102
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:20,560
That's what they come here for.

2103
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:21,960
It's fun.

2104
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:25,480
It's like he's got false teeth doing that or something like it's got like

2105
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:27,360
the voice is so strange.

2106
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:29,080
They're still sitting.

2107
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:31,200
I blast kids with the hose sometimes.

2108
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:34,240
I I sit out for but they like it.

2109
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:36,240
It's for the kids like to get wet, right?

2110
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:39,360
Whoops. Whoops again.

2111
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:43,080
That's like I don't know if this is a rumor or this is fact,

2112
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:47,040
but they say like there's like five Mickey voices and they just like offer

2113
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:49,240
the amount of money they're willing to pay to the first one.

2114
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:53,120
And if that person turns it down, they go to the second one and so on.

2115
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:55,000
I've heard that. I don't know if that's true.

2116
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,480
I assume it's somewhat true.

2117
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:59,080
And it feels like they got down to like the eighth Mickey voice.

2118
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:01,440
Well, like, will you do this video for fifty dollars?

2119
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:03,640
And he's like, yeah, sign me up.

2120
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:05,440
I'm Mickey now.

2121
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:07,520
That's just what he sounds like already.

2122
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:11,080
That's why he at least he's not going to put in.

2123
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:12,240
He's not going to sweat it.

2124
01:52:12,240 --> 01:52:14,320
Like his voice is already very high.

2125
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:17,800
Yeah. It's an old it's an old man who sounds like Mickey Mouse already.

2126
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:20,480
And he's willing to. What's going to happen?

2127
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:22,760
The union's going to get more mad at me.

2128
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:25,240
Not possible.

2129
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:28,240
I'm retired as it is.

2130
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:31,840
He's going to cross the picket line, whatever you kill.

2131
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:33,800
I don't use the word scab.

2132
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:36,240
That's not my not my word.

2133
01:52:36,240 --> 01:52:38,440
And when they ask me to show up somewhere, I do it.

2134
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:42,600
That's called being a good worker and an employee.

2135
01:52:42,600 --> 01:52:48,360
Show the studio some respect.

2136
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,800
Well, figure out who that voice is.

2137
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:55,000
If they I'd love to hear the name of who is the den Mickey.

2138
01:52:55,800 --> 01:53:00,320
And I just I think we we've proven throughout this episode that if they need a

2139
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:05,040
what, 15th, 16th and 17th string Mickey.

2140
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:07,640
Oh, yeah. Yeah. You know, the three guys to call.

2141
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:09,440
Mm hmm. Oh, sure.

2142
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:12,480
Yeah. If you need some punch up for Shanghai's.

2143
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:15,800
Which was called Meet Mickey, I think it's now listed on the website

2144
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:17,480
as selfie spot with Mickey.

2145
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:19,720
Everything's a little different right now.

2146
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:23,440
You know, if you guys need some turn around, they'll be, you know, we're around.

2147
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:28,880
Before we go or I guess we can say do the wrap up and then before we go,

2148
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:31,400
I found a little tease for whenever we do Starland, I think.

2149
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:34,040
Oh, boy. OK.

2150
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:35,320
Well, that's exciting.

2151
01:53:35,320 --> 01:53:37,800
Well, hey, let's get to it. You survived.

2152
01:53:38,200 --> 01:53:40,840
You survived. It's got it's going to be really clips.

2153
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:42,200
It's not even just a bad voice.

2154
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:43,440
It's like you survived.

2155
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:47,920
But just the bride, you took a tour of my house.

2160
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:06,400
It's more fun than a den.

2161
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:09,320
It's like veering on Robin Leach almost in places.

2162
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:13,160
I'm going to freak you out right now because I was I was mentally cutting

2163
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:14,680
this sort of for time.

2164
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:18,000
However, when I was looking up, it like, OK, when I was just Googling

2165
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:22,440
Mickey's house, somehow I ran into something

2166
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:25,640
and I don't know what it is called Mickey's townhouse.

2167
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:29,000
There's Getty Images of the man you just mentioned.

2168
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:32,640
Robin, which you mentioned, who probably says it's a bit earlier.

2169
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:36,400
This is I don't know what the context is, but this is from Getty Images.

2170
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:40,640
This is Robin Leach at something called Mickey's Townhouse,

2171
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:45,760
and he is in front of a bunch of ceramic minis and Goofies.

2172
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:50,040
And he is holding a Mickey shaped cookie on a stick,

2173
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:54,160
drinking a glass of wine and looking very demented.

2174
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:56,360
Crazy. Yeah. Yes.

2175
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:58,960
This is Joker esque.

2176
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:02,720
Here he's looking slightly crazier and shoving it into his mouth.

2177
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:06,080
He definitely knows how to eat food. That's for sure.

2178
01:55:07,080 --> 01:55:11,080
I know how not no need to prove it.

2179
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:16,320
And then he's there now like an eye is coming out of his head as he eats

2180
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:21,040
caviar or out of the caviar out of the can with a spoon.

2181
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:25,160
That is like, God, how much that is a lot of caviar.

2182
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:27,880
He looks crazy. He looks crazy in every photo.

2183
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:30,800
This is bonkers.

2184
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:35,160
Yeah, I know this is this is kookier than anything in Mickey's birthday land house.

2185
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:37,440
And I don't know what Mickey's townhouse is.

2186
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:40,040
I don't know why he's there, what this event could be.

2187
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:44,880
I tried to see if there were more photos that weren't of Robin Leach and there weren't.

2188
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:47,640
I was half suspecting if I found more photos that

2189
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:50,760
Ghislaine would be in them,

2190
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:53,400
whatever the hell this event was.

2191
01:55:57,880 --> 01:56:00,200
We'll do a little more research and see if we can find

2192
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:04,560
Mickey's Townhouse coming soon, but Mickey's Starland also

2193
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:07,080
coming soon. I feel like this isn't as good as that now.

2194
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:09,760
OK, so this is an insane Robin Leach.

2195
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:11,480
An insane picture of Robin Leach.

2196
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:15,480
So I was just like, yeah, you're looking through all this stuff.

2197
01:56:15,480 --> 01:56:18,080
And there's a picture on I think it's a D23 website. Yeah.

2198
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:20,960
There's Mickey's Starland.

2199
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:25,160
It's a picture from Starland and Starland and all this stuff had like duck stuff,

2200
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:26,600
which I like. I do like that.

2201
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:29,320
Like there's a little duckberg. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

2202
01:56:29,320 --> 01:56:32,520
Which is fun. But look at the car Mickey is in.

2203
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:36,960
Here. It's less lumpy.

2204
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:39,440
It's less grotesque. Yes.

2205
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:42,760
But do you recognize this car?

2206
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:45,400
I do, but I can't place it.

2207
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:50,040
Is it a toy? Oh, Happy Meal toy car.

2208
01:56:51,120 --> 01:56:53,280
I had this Mickey Happy Meal toy.

2209
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:57,560
Mickey has the car from the Happy Meal, which maybe it's from a different

2210
01:56:57,560 --> 01:57:00,000
short or a movie or something that I'm forgetting.

2211
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,200
But this is very exciting.

2212
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:05,320
And I think where we didn't like the car before, I do really like

2213
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:07,640
this birthday land car.

2214
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:09,800
Oh, I like that. Yeah. Yeah.

2215
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:11,560
And he's this is a great photo.

2216
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:14,400
He's like he's in driving.

2217
01:57:14,680 --> 01:57:18,160
Another like old timey thing he's doing, he's in a driving cap

2218
01:57:18,160 --> 01:57:19,920
and a driving scarf.

2219
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:24,760
He's like the smoke hittens two children who are dressed

2220
01:57:24,760 --> 01:57:27,680
like him, like Pinocchio.

2221
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:30,400
What is up with these boys?

2222
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:33,160
The first thing I thought the first thing I thought I go, are they dressed

2223
01:57:33,160 --> 01:57:35,920
like the two broke girls?

2224
01:57:36,160 --> 01:57:38,480
They're in the diner clothes.

2225
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:41,640
They do look like the two broke girls in diner clothes.

2226
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:46,400
Two broke little boys, two broke little boys.

2227
01:57:46,720 --> 01:57:49,800
So, yeah. So anyway, I'm excited to do some of this for Starland

2228
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:50,960
whenever we get to it.

2229
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:55,600
Oh, boy. I like the fact that there was a Happy Meal tie in of some kind.

2230
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:57,480
Yeah. Yeah.

2231
01:57:57,480 --> 01:57:59,320
Well, and we'll talk about the toys, too.

2232
01:57:59,320 --> 01:58:01,600
There's a lot to there's a lot to hit.

2233
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:04,880
Minnie's house, as with the characters, Mickey and Minnie

2234
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:08,960
or Mickey and Minnie's houses are segregated to their own episodes.

2235
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:13,880
Of course, they're up here to show that they are not secretly married,

2236
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:16,360
which Walt drunkenly admitted.

2237
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:19,280
Of course. And the Daisy Door episode will also be its own

2238
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:23,640
full about the door. Yeah.

2239
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:28,720
But for now, yeah, look forward to those and to combine several topics

2240
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:31,640
in this episode.

2241
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:35,880
I'll say champagne wishes and caviar dreams.

2242
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:38,320
Bye bye, everybody.

2243
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:40,840
Ha ha. Forever.
