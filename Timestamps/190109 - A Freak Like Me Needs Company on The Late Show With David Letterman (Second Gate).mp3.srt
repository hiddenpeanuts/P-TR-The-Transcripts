1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:10,660
5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

2
00:00:21,752 --> 00:00:23,652
Cast the ride, the second gate.

3
00:00:24,772 --> 00:00:27,672
And we're here today and I'm not gonna lie,

4
00:00:29,272 --> 00:00:30,792
we're a bunch of freaks today.

5
00:00:31,812 --> 00:00:36,412
Yeah, he call us the terrifying triad.

6
00:00:37,272 --> 00:00:37,312
Yeah.

7
00:00:37,652 --> 00:00:40,412
Mike's Mike, Scott and Jason, my kind of guys.

8
00:00:40,412 --> 00:00:41,152
Oh yeah.

9
00:00:41,312 --> 00:00:44,172
Couple of freaks ready to get the freak on

10
00:00:44,172 --> 00:00:46,312
behind a paywall.

11
00:00:46,332 --> 00:00:48,332
That's devilishly greedy.

12
00:00:48,972 --> 00:00:51,532
That voice is Scott Gardner, I'm Jason Sheridan.

13
00:00:51,992 --> 00:00:53,632
Mike Carlson also here.

14
00:00:53,772 --> 00:00:55,292
Hey, also doing the voice.

15
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,992
His trademark hey.

16
00:00:57,212 --> 00:00:58,512
Maniac Mike.

17
00:00:59,052 --> 00:01:04,472
Who's also like a DJ for a local radio station,

18
00:01:04,552 --> 00:01:06,372
but he's also in the, what was it?

19
00:01:06,512 --> 00:01:08,212
Terrible triad or whatever that is.

20
00:01:08,212 --> 00:01:09,332
He's in the terrible triad.

21
00:01:09,332 --> 00:01:10,812
Oh yeah, let's go terrible triad, sure.

22
00:01:10,832 --> 00:01:11,312
What did you say?

23
00:01:11,932 --> 00:01:14,072
I think I might say terrifying, but I think terrible

24
00:01:14,072 --> 00:01:15,892
has a nicer clip to it.

25
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,332
Because sinister and terrible.

26
00:01:17,632 --> 00:01:19,292
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think those kind of match.

27
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:22,192
So in case you don't know what we're doing,

28
00:01:22,192 --> 00:01:24,252
you didn't read the headline.

29
00:01:24,352 --> 00:01:28,272
We are talking today about just the David Letterman

30
00:01:28,272 --> 00:01:31,352
performance of the Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark song,

31
00:01:31,512 --> 00:01:34,492
A Freak Like Me Needs Company,

32
00:01:35,452 --> 00:01:37,532
written by Bono and the Edge.

33
00:01:37,952 --> 00:01:38,472
Yay.

34
00:01:38,772 --> 00:01:43,692
I haven't been so excited about a topic maybe ever.

35
00:01:44,912 --> 00:01:45,052
Yeah.

36
00:01:45,292 --> 00:01:47,472
I've been so excited to talk about this,

37
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:50,432
and I think we're probably all in the same area

38
00:01:50,432 --> 00:01:52,692
where this thing happened in 2011.

39
00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:57,152
But I think, I know I watch it perhaps quarterly,

40
00:01:57,372 --> 00:01:59,052
perhaps every quarter since then.

41
00:01:59,052 --> 00:01:59,912
Oh, for sure, yeah.

42
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:01,772
And I can say without a doubt

43
00:02:01,772 --> 00:02:06,112
that Mike would have sent this to me pretty quickly.

44
00:02:06,332 --> 00:02:08,672
Like day after airing quickly,

45
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:12,692
he would have sent it to me and some other people,

46
00:02:12,872 --> 00:02:14,292
saying you gotta watch this.

47
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:14,892
Yeah.

48
00:02:15,192 --> 00:02:18,572
I felt very lucky because I watched this air live.

49
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:21,232
I didn't tune in specifically to see it,

50
00:02:21,232 --> 00:02:24,892
but I happened to put it on right before it all went down.

51
00:02:25,352 --> 00:02:27,132
But it also made me crazy

52
00:02:27,132 --> 00:02:29,872
because I had no one to talk to about it.

53
00:02:29,952 --> 00:02:32,832
Like I just, I felt like I hallucinated it.

54
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,992
I'm alone at night just staring at my TV on the couch

55
00:02:35,992 --> 00:02:37,132
and like, what the hell?

56
00:02:37,172 --> 00:02:39,572
And then it didn't really blow up immediately.

57
00:02:39,772 --> 00:02:42,892
But I remember I was working in the Funny or Die basement

58
00:02:43,192 --> 00:02:46,392
with a lot of fun weirdos you heard on the show.

59
00:02:46,412 --> 00:02:48,192
A lot of them, all your favorite freaks

60
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,892
from the world of podcast.

61
00:02:50,032 --> 00:02:53,232
Imagine a kooky basement where both Nick Weiger

62
00:02:53,232 --> 00:02:56,432
and Bugmane shared cubicle space.

63
00:02:57,312 --> 00:03:00,492
But it was such a big hit in that basement,

64
00:03:00,552 --> 00:03:01,832
like a week or so later.

65
00:03:01,872 --> 00:03:03,432
It took a little delay.

66
00:03:03,752 --> 00:03:05,752
We talked about it nonstop.

67
00:03:05,792 --> 00:03:10,372
And I think it spread a lot through this little scene

68
00:03:10,372 --> 00:03:11,012
in comedy world.

69
00:03:11,012 --> 00:03:15,112
If I'm correct, I wanna say our friend Eva Anderson

70
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,752
wrote or was like largely responsible for the tribute

71
00:03:17,752 --> 00:03:19,812
to it on Comedy Bang Bang.

72
00:03:19,872 --> 00:03:20,772
Oh yeah.

73
00:03:20,772 --> 00:03:22,152
They did it with Tom Lennon.

74
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:26,032
They did kind of a quick little, like he was the phantom,

75
00:03:26,312 --> 00:03:28,552
but he transmogrified essentially

76
00:03:28,552 --> 00:03:31,412
into the Green Goblin for one song.

77
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,332
So it's like- The hammy Green Goblin.

78
00:03:33,392 --> 00:03:38,052
The hammiest Green Goblin, far hammier than Willem Dafoe

79
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:41,612
or who would it have been in the-

80
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:43,712
Chris Cooper, I believe was gonna be the Green Goblin,

81
00:03:43,772 --> 00:03:44,312
but he died.

82
00:03:44,332 --> 00:03:47,352
They killed him off in the second round of Spider-Man movies.

83
00:03:47,472 --> 00:03:48,212
Oh, okay.

84
00:03:48,872 --> 00:03:51,332
And then Dan Don was the Green Goblin

85
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:52,292
cause it was his son.

86
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,252
Right.

87
00:03:53,592 --> 00:03:54,232
That's, you know.

88
00:03:54,852 --> 00:03:57,712
So, but the point is, all right, before we go-

89
00:03:57,712 --> 00:03:59,672
We're watching this by the way on loop in the background

90
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,792
and the lizard just came in and I totally forgot

91
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:06,672
what is like the Kurt Connors, like part of him looks like.

92
00:04:06,672 --> 00:04:10,372
The lizard looks like that inflatable T-Rex costumes

93
00:04:10,372 --> 00:04:12,312
that are like popular at Halloween

94
00:04:12,312 --> 00:04:15,612
or like I saw a marching band have a bunch of them

95
00:04:15,612 --> 00:04:17,612
like recently in a YouTube clip,

96
00:04:17,752 --> 00:04:21,112
but this is years before those inflatable Halloween costumes.

97
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:22,392
When it was like- Yes, now they're everywhere,

98
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:24,232
but they, when you see those costumes,

99
00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:26,872
know that they were pioneered by Broadway legend,

100
00:04:27,072 --> 00:04:27,872
Julie Taymor.

101
00:04:28,012 --> 00:04:28,492
Yeah.

102
00:04:29,012 --> 00:04:33,012
That's the thing about this that's so crazy,

103
00:04:33,152 --> 00:04:35,732
like the level that knowing the budget,

104
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:37,872
is stated in the performance.

105
00:04:37,932 --> 00:04:41,052
It's a $65 million circus tragedy.

106
00:04:41,372 --> 00:04:45,272
Actually more like 75, he says, because that is true.

107
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:47,532
It ended up alluding to the cost of 75.

108
00:04:47,652 --> 00:04:49,892
And for those of you who aren't Broadway heads,

109
00:04:50,512 --> 00:04:52,872
the average cost of a musical on Broadway

110
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:55,372
is five to 15 million.

111
00:04:55,632 --> 00:04:56,112
Really?

112
00:04:56,572 --> 00:04:56,592
Yeah.

113
00:04:56,592 --> 00:04:58,172
That's the differential?

114
00:04:58,412 --> 00:05:03,152
I'm sure things like King Kong that is currently running

115
00:05:03,152 --> 00:05:05,792
or about to start running with the giant King Kong,

116
00:05:05,832 --> 00:05:07,712
I'm sure that cost a little more,

117
00:05:07,952 --> 00:05:12,632
but this is a notorious catastrophe

118
00:05:12,632 --> 00:05:13,812
in the history of Broadway.

119
00:05:14,172 --> 00:05:15,212
Yeah, yeah.

120
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:20,052
And so if, all right, if you haven't seen this performance,

121
00:05:20,212 --> 00:05:22,452
first of all, we should have it in the show notes

122
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:25,312
or you can just go to YouTube and I think the full,

123
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,932
just type in Spider-Man, A Freak Like Me

124
00:05:27,932 --> 00:05:30,932
Needs Company, David Letterman, and you will find it.

125
00:05:30,932 --> 00:05:31,172
Yeah.

126
00:05:31,172 --> 00:05:32,232
Because we're as, once again,

127
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:33,792
we're not talking about the full show,

128
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:34,532
Spider-Man Turn Up the Dark,

129
00:05:34,532 --> 00:05:37,092
we're talking about this wonderful performance

130
00:05:37,092 --> 00:05:40,972
where the Green Goblin, due to some very lax security

131
00:05:40,972 --> 00:05:42,172
on the David Letterman show,

132
00:05:42,452 --> 00:05:45,232
the Green Goblin bursts into the Ed Sullivan Theater

133
00:05:45,232 --> 00:05:48,472
and takes it over and engulfs it in his freakiness.

134
00:05:48,572 --> 00:05:49,992
And also, they should note,

135
00:05:50,232 --> 00:05:54,012
this is an exclusive version of this song.

136
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:56,492
The original cast recording of this song

137
00:05:56,492 --> 00:06:00,292
is just the start of the song and the end of the song.

138
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:02,812
He doesn't stop in the middle of the song

139
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:06,072
in the Broadway play and introduce these characters, right?

140
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:06,572
Oh, no, no, no, no.

141
00:06:06,572 --> 00:06:07,572
Oh, he does.

142
00:06:07,652 --> 00:06:08,792
Oh, yes, he does, yes.

143
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:10,932
Okay, so you've tuned it for the soundtrack.

144
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:12,692
Yeah, I saw the, I've seen it.

145
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:13,832
I saw it on Broadway.

146
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:15,512
Oh, I forgot that you saw it.

147
00:06:15,512 --> 00:06:16,172
I saw it.

148
00:06:16,392 --> 00:06:18,532
You saw it like a month after this.

149
00:06:19,132 --> 00:06:20,052
Is it that soon?

150
00:06:20,232 --> 00:06:22,552
This aired in July, 2011.

151
00:06:22,952 --> 00:06:23,832
Oh, I guess I did.

152
00:06:23,832 --> 00:06:26,092
And we were in New York together in August, 2011.

153
00:06:26,392 --> 00:06:26,612
Yeah, you're right.

154
00:06:26,612 --> 00:06:27,892
And I saw it alone.

155
00:06:27,992 --> 00:06:29,292
No one would go with me.

156
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:30,572
No one would go.

157
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:32,452
Richie went with me, my friend,

158
00:06:32,832 --> 00:06:36,012
and he all of a sudden bailed on me

159
00:06:36,012 --> 00:06:37,992
because I was like, I'm gonna try at the last second

160
00:06:37,992 --> 00:06:39,092
to get Spider-Man tickets.

161
00:06:39,092 --> 00:06:40,532
And I did, I walked up to the box.

162
00:06:40,632 --> 00:06:42,452
I was going in there like,

163
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,552
well, are $29 tickets that are a little view obstructed?

164
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:45,972
Is that okay?

165
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:46,892
And I was like, of course,

166
00:06:46,892 --> 00:06:48,452
that's the perfect way to see this.

167
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:50,472
And I just went in alone.

168
00:06:50,752 --> 00:06:52,312
It was raining, I was soaking wet.

169
00:06:53,052 --> 00:06:56,372
And I loved, I enjoyed the whole thing so much.

170
00:06:56,492 --> 00:06:58,812
I was in the top part of the theater,

171
00:06:59,012 --> 00:07:02,492
right by where Spider-Man would come down and swing.

172
00:07:03,532 --> 00:07:05,452
He doesn't get really up close to you.

173
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:06,372
I've been watching footage.

174
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,372
They're way up in the third balcony

175
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:10,152
and he would jump and swing down.

176
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:11,232
That's pretty crazy.

177
00:07:11,372 --> 00:07:14,192
I mean, there was, see, it does seem like they pulled off

178
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:16,852
a legitimately amazing show at times

179
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:19,512
and the sets were amazing and some costumes were amazing.

180
00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:20,072
Yeah.

181
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,372
It's just something about the way it all added up

182
00:07:22,372 --> 00:07:23,772
on the Slenderman performance.

183
00:07:24,272 --> 00:07:26,492
So here, I think, I mean, watch the performance certainly,

184
00:07:26,492 --> 00:07:31,432
but let me just, let's just play the tiniest taste of it

185
00:07:31,432 --> 00:07:33,452
before we talk for much longer.

186
00:07:51,576 --> 00:07:52,456
Get your free.

187
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:56,432
I'm fine.

188
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,000
That's about all we need.

189
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,100
As long as you know, General Tenor,

190
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,180
he broke into The Letterman Show,

191
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,600
and he is the scariest freak of all time.

192
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,500
Do you know why he says that at the start?

193
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:26,980
No.

194
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,360
Because there was a break-in at the Ed Sullivan Theater

195
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,220
not long before that.

196
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,680
What?

197
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,200
Some crazy guy broke into the Ed Sullivan Theater,

198
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,300
so he comes in and like, I'll tie it into theme parks,

199
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,040
makes a topical joke.

200
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,740
That's why I go, this place is surprisingly,

201
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,660
easy to break into.

202
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,840
It was a reference to a real person

203
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,560
that broke into the Ed Sullivan Theater.

204
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,040
No idea, wow.

205
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,320
I've learned something before he's even gotten in the door.

206
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,280
This is great.

207
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,360
Yeah, the budget is a topical reference thing too.

208
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,200
I think the one thing that's missing

209
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,160
is that he didn't say, everyone be careful on this stairs,

210
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,280
we don't need another injury.

211
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,720
The scariest villain of all is the worker's comp man.

212
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Yeah, in total six people were injured

213
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,300
while working on Spider-Man,

214
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,860
and at least one of them was injured twice.

215
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,880
People get injured, come back,

216
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,880
get injured again, and then leave.

217
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,680
So this show fraught with peril,

218
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,840
extremely expensive as the Goblin himself mentions,

219
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,420
and giant story problems.

220
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,040
It was horribly reviewed by the New York Times

221
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,800
and all the major Broadway press,

222
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,340
and they shut the whole thing down,

223
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,580
and in fact, this song, Freak Like Me Needs Company,

224
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,200
was part of the revamped version

225
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,560
of Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark 2.0.

226
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,760
This is one of the big additions.

227
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,100
So this is late in the game,

228
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,180
and an attempt at an enhancement of a troubled show.

229
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,280
Also, to contextualize it,

230
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,760
this was the second Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark performance

231
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,460
on David Letterman within six months.

232
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,800
The first one was the song Rise Above,

233
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,140
which, did that get cut from the original?

234
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,500
No, no, it was in there.

235
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,080
It was like the centerpiece, I think, of the show.

236
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,340
Well, Boy Falls from the Sky also, you could say.

237
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,320
I think Boy Falls from the Sky is probably the best song.

238
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,940
I would say this is the best song by a mile.

239
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,880
At some level, yes.

240
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,720
Okay, yeah.

241
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,760
I think Boy Falls from the Sky is like,

242
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,860
sort of like, by the numbers, you too,

243
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,680
and this is at least something.

244
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,600
This is something.

245
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,200
Well, some of the other songs,

246
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,900
like Boy Falls from the Sky,

247
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,800
you can feel the Bono and Edge influence in it very strongly.

248
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,220
This, there is such a disconnect between the Bono.

249
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,220
I disagree completely with that.

250
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,020
I think that Bono and the Edge,

251
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,560
if you are into the U2, Pop Mart, and Zuroba,

252
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,880
and Octong Baby eras, this is right in that wheelhouse.

253
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,420
You're right that it's like the normal U2, Bono,

254
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,760
that's not what this is.

255
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,160
But as a non-encyclopedic U2 non-fan, I guess,

256
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,740
I just, I don't listen to them or not listen to them.

257
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,820
I don't, whatever, either way.

258
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:24,920
But yeah, I was not aware of that evil characters

259
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,600
doing hijinks is part of the U2 mythology in general.

260
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,300
We're talking, of course, about Bono's alter ego,

261
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,660
Mr. McFisto,

262
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,520
who is a man with a white painted face and devil ears.

263
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,660
And a gold sparkly suit.

264
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,780
Gold sparkly suit.

265
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,380
And fancy shoes that he shows off.

266
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,640
And he's not gruff like the Green Goblin,

267
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,080
he's kind of this lascivious,

268
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,180
he has so many feels that he just has to whine.

269
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,560
But I think that is who,

270
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,460
I think you could see Mr. McFisto

271
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,960
leading the Sinister Six in this is what I'm saying.

272
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:00,640
Absolutely.

273
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,360
He is very much in that,

274
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,460
this is what he, first of all,

275
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,780
this is what he thinks super villains and heroes are.

276
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,180
And I think it's evidenced if you,

277
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,420
I was doing karaoke two nights ago,

278
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,160
and this is unrelated to,

279
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,180
I wasn't thinking of this when I was doing it,

280
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,220
but I put on the song,

281
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,980
Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me,

282
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,100
which is from Batman Forever, which is U2.

283
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,760
And it's such a,

284
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,180
it's the first part of this song in my head.

285
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,780
It's a little bit more U2 sounding,

286
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,400
but it's very much in line with his attitude

287
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,760
about characters.

288
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,780
And really, when we get down to it,

289
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,960
he's just treating these characters like,

290
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,900
they're weirdo art people from New York.

291
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,980
That's who we're all just trying to.

292
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,740
I'm not a bad guy.

293
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,900
I'm just a little cuck,

294
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,260
I'm a cuck and I have cucky ideas.

295
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,300
The collection of people they assembled to make this,

296
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,580
Julie Taymor, Bono,

297
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,080
and the way they talked about it,

298
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,040
all of them talked about it.

299
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,520
It's like, well, it's like rock and Broadway

300
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,440
and a circus and wrestling.

301
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,920
It is very much the way regular people think,

302
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,520
fancy rich people talk about art.

303
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,860
But it's about Spider-Man.

304
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,820
It's about the most everyday working man superhero.

305
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,520
Well, and primarily to me,

306
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,560
with all the buildup and all the expense

307
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,680
and all the pretension and the level of,

308
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,940
Bono, Edge, Julie Taymor,

309
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,880
all of them beyond just revered professionals.

310
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,080
They are like gods to be in these fields.

311
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,260
And then you see it,

312
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,460
especially if you don't know nothing else about the show

313
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,620
and then you watch just this Letterman performance,

314
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,960
you're like, how did all of them add up

315
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,160
to Spider-Man rocks at Universal Studio?

316
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,560
It just is, it is so similar to the dumb show

317
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,780
which we reviewed many, many episodes ago.

318
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,800
But like, there's no, this is,

319
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,400
it's broad theme parky, bright colors,

320
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,780
no texture, no nuance.

321
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,020
And not a good, like Pop by U2 is an album people don't like.

322
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,220
I like half of Pop and it's,

323
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,140
the songs feel so much more sophisticated than this.

324
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,740
It's so, like, especially go on Spotify

325
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,720
and listen to the recorded version of it.

326
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,460
It is so tinny.

327
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,140
It sounds like the fakest, flattest garage band hip hop.

328
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,020
And Jason, you're talking about personnel of this thing.

329
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,080
Let me add a couple more on to this list.

330
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,100
The, it was produced,

331
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,000
this track was produced by Steve Lillywhite.

332
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,700
Produced all of the main, he's U2's primary producer.

333
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,300
He produced all the Dave Matthews bands,

334
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,960
like the big Dave Matthews band albums and songs.

335
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,240
He produced for Peter Gabriel, Psychedelic Furs,

336
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,780
Rolling Stones, The Pogues, XTC's song,

337
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,240
Making Plans for Nigel and a Freak Like Me Needs Company.

338
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,060
He, but because he was not like a rap guy

339
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,820
and they wanted to bring kind of a street influence

340
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,480
to the thing.

341
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,840
They did, there was additional drum programming

342
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,580
by a guy named Shay Taylor.

343
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,200
Shay Taylor produced Frank Ocean's Think About,

344
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,920
Thinking About You, Think About You,

345
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,100
Beyonce's Love on Top, Great Song,

346
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,700
and a lot of Neo records.

347
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,440
So they had a legitimate- So all of these hit makers,

348
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,160
all of these hit makers are here and-

349
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,040
It sounds like I could make a quality recording

350
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,140
in an afternoon on Garage Band

351
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,240
that sounded exactly the quality of the record,

352
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,720
the official cast recording of that song.

353
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,220
Yeah, it's so thin, so tinny.

354
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,020
It's inexplicable to me.

355
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,220
And then let me also build up the scene,

356
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,960
how I feel lucky the way I got to experience this thing

357
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,820
that before several commercial breaks,

358
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,980
before the Green Goblin did his immortal burst

359
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,940
into that Sullivan Theater doors,

360
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,700
it was an entire Bono and Edge episode of David Letterman.

361
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,940
They were on the couch and they told stories

362
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,680
about all of the amazing humanitarian work that Bono does.

363
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,180
And they talked about the tradition,

364
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,340
about Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tin Pan Alley

365
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,940
and to partake in this tradition and then-

366
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,960
Not for a ball ball.

367
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,160
God damn it, I'm getting mad just hearing-

368
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,660
I know, I know.

369
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,400
And then they talk about their songwriting process

370
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,720
and they talk about building up the song

371
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,900
that I do like, the song Stuck in a Moment,

372
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,080
You Can't Get Out of It.

373
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,280
And the Edge pulls out an acoustic guitar

374
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,180
and they perform the stirring acoustic,

375
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,240
the lights come down, it's this wonderful acoustic,

376
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,060
you two such a gigantic band

377
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,880
and seeing this intimate performance,

378
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,860
which they explain in a lengthy setup

379
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,320
that the song was written about the death of Michael Hutchins,

380
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,060
the singer of NXS, a tragic, awful death.

381
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,980
So all of this humanitarian work,

382
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,180
the death of Michael Hutchins, Tin Pan Alley,

383
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,860
Andrew Lloyd Webber and then, all right,

384
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,680
we'll be right back with the cast of Spider-Man

385
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,140
Turn Off the Dark and then, well,

386
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,680
New York City, Angel Briega.

387
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,740
The other thing, I mean, this,

388
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,940
there's a lot of conflicting emotions

389
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,060
because I do like this, I think on the level,

390
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm sure you guys probably, there's a level,

391
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,040
you like it dubbed like, look at this spectacle,

392
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,040
what is this, this expensive monstrosity?

393
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,040
As a comics fan, I'm horrified.

394
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,200
Oh, I see, that's it.

395
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,960
Oh, no, that's, no, I couldn't disagree with that more.

396
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,180
What do you mean?

397
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,180
No, this is nonsense.

398
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,800
This is great, like 60s, it's not the quality of 60s Batman.

399
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,660
No, do not, it invokes 60s Batman.

400
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,340
Nonsense. How dare you?

401
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,940
But this is, comics have so much trash associated with them.

402
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,760
I'm just saying, like, this shouldn't make you that upset.

403
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,000
There's so much great comics trash that you and I like.

404
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,000
I mean, I get, my thing, I think is like,

405
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,300
why does the Green Goblin,

406
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,760
I like the Green Goblin outfit best of all.

407
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,740
Everything else looks like weird walk around characters

408
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,100
from a theme park or like inflatable mini Macy's table.

409
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,880
Like, they have the money

410
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,440
and they have the costuming know how to make.

411
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,560
Here's my point.

412
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,700
Okay. Here's my point.

413
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,320
There's a version of like a much more serious

414
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,940
Spider-Man musical where the Green Goblin comes out

415
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,600
and he's wearing like, I don't know,

416
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,740
maybe a little bit less of a goofy outfit.

417
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,620
And he sings like a serious Green Goblin song.

418
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,040
And I just, there's no way to pull that off.

419
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,060
There's no way that's gonna be good.

420
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,040
No, no, that would be bad in the other direction.

421
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,880
That's like, I think saying like,

422
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,160
Batman and Robin is a movie is bad,

423
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,340
which it is bad, but it's great.

424
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,320
It's fantastic.

425
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,280
But it's bad.

426
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,740
This is bad, but it's fantastic.

427
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,740
Batman Forever is like closer to,

428
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,600
if you're like flipping a coin,

429
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,000
like a two-faced coin,

430
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,960
the Batman Forever lands, I think,

431
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,700
more on the side of good bad

432
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,740
and Batman and Robin's like, all right.

433
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,220
Yeah, for sure.

434
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,260
I agree with that.

435
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,500
But also it's fantastic in the way that this is fantastic

436
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,680
because it's just so bad.

437
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,280
I just realized a swarm,

438
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,180
a man made of mutant bees just came out

439
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,640
and I just realized a bee fell off his suit

440
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,840
as he jumped out.

441
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,760
Yes, one of the best things.

442
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,180
And that you're hearing about the Julie Taymor level

443
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,780
of detail and artistry.

444
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,960
And then immediately a bee falls off of the bee man.

445
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,700
The first villain who comes out.

446
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,100
These are clearly inspired by like the heightened puppetry

447
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,280
and costuming of The Lion King.

448
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:32,660
Sure.

449
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,140
But it just looks so bizarre.

450
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,900
Like, K's are, not K's are, Craven the Hunter looks so odd.

451
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,000
They look different.

452
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,920
They look like they're in different universes too.

453
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,340
All I'm saying is this is glorious trash.

454
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:45,820
Yes.

455
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,780
And I would much rather have glorious trash

456
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,260
than like those amazing Spider-Man movies,

457
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,600
those second round of Spider-Man movies

458
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,260
that were very boring and flat.

459
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:56,520
Well, I think they got it wrong too.

460
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,500
A lot of the Steve Ditko designed original Sinister Six,

461
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,960
there's a reason in the comics

462
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,060
the costumes have changed very little since the 60s.

463
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,900
And the stuff that's kind of a let that,

464
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,340
like the Spider-Man movies,

465
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,680
it's always like, well, we got to put them in a trench coat

466
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,240
and then Spider-Man outfit has to have a lot of,

467
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,520
superhero outfits now always have a lot of bubble.

468
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,920
Like, why do they all look like?

469
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,540
Scales.

470
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,480
Scales, yeah.

471
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,060
It drives me nuts in superhero.

472
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:26,220
Like, why didn't just give them latex or leather?

473
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,600
I don't know, but it-

474
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,620
So they don't slip by a pool.

475
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,060
I guess that's true.

476
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,000
They need a track show.

477
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,660
It's, let me say what I think is,

478
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,400
I think absolutely the song itself is defendable.

479
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,880
I think the costumes are defendable.

480
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,600
I think the Green Goblin costume

481
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,960
and performance are dependable.

482
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,500
But here I think is really where it tilts is that you win.

483
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,700
We should also maybe kind of go through this chronologically

484
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,020
a little bit, but when the Green Goblin bursts in the door

485
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,040
and there's a, it's green lit,

486
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,420
there's a bunch of green smoke.

487
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,480
It's going to bloop back around here in a minute

488
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,700
in the video we're watching, the backup dancers.

489
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,680
Oh yeah, yeah.

490
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,300
These people who lean really close to camera

491
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,940
with their broad Broadway makeup and costumes.

492
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,080
These guys, they're the original B boys from hell.

493
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,680
All right, stay away from this crew.

494
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:20,360
All right, there's like dyed green hair.

495
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,820
It was like, you know, silver makeup smeared,

496
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,280
like not carefully applied.

497
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,860
They don't care about careful makeup applications.

498
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,600
We just splash it in our face.

499
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,880
They're like the dancers from the horny number

500
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,460
in all that jazz ran head first into the cast of hackers.

501
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,900
And then this came out.

502
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,600
Beautiful, wow, yeah.

503
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,340
That is a good way to put it.

504
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,540
I was just going to say, he's got it in flannel.

505
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,980
They were like wearing flannel shirts

506
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,420
and like cheap tank tops.

507
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,100
The women doing the scary faces, like making jazz hands

508
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,840
and going, ha, that's, that, that.

509
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,880
Some of the costumes are just a green hat tilted to the side.

510
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,180
They don't care about traditional hat directions.

511
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,840
I'll put my brim where I want.

512
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,600
And then some of them are literally,

513
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,380
some of these people are just a girl with a green scrunchie

514
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,560
and kind of like a green and black workout outfit.

515
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,300
And that makes her evil.

516
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,160
Yeah, it's weird.

517
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:16,880
She's bad now.

518
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,120
It is weird, yeah.

519
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,520
It makes everything feel cheap.

520
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,160
That is the thing that makes it feel cheap.

521
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,540
If they were all dressed like,

522
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,980
oh, they're like green goblin henchmen,

523
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,100
which I don't believe henchmen,

524
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,000
I don't believe he ever had those in the comics, right?

525
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,840
It's kind of like heavy.

526
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,740
It just kind of like goons.

527
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,520
It's like heavy goons.

528
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,520
But if there were like thugs, in a way, yeah,

529
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,380
that would be better.

530
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,540
But yes, they look like they ran out of money

531
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,060
and they were like, just go to the Rite Aid

532
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,360
and see if there's some tank tops

533
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,680
and hats on the shelf there.

534
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,400
Somehow.

535
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,380
I think a lot of, again, I love this as spectacle,

536
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,820
but some of my resistance,

537
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,520
it's coming from the fact that it's such a hodgepodge,

538
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,920
it's not quite comics, it's not quite rock and roll,

539
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,720
it's not quite even Broadway.

540
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,640
It's theme parks.

541
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,600
It's theme parks.

542
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,120
That's why we're talking about it.

543
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,280
That's all that is.

544
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,520
I guess that is, looking at it from that lens,

545
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,880
it makes 100% sense.

546
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:13,440
Maybe it's like, okay, we think that that Aladdin show

547
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,540
that was at California Adventure for a long time

548
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,580
where the genie tells silly topical jokes,

549
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,400
that is what it is.

550
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,000
You know what you're getting when you go in there.

551
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,340
I'll have fun, I'll laugh at it.

552
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,040
It's silly, but let's have a good time.

553
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,900
But if you found out that the score was written

554
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,060
by Loudon Wainwright or Leonard Cohen or somebody,

555
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:40,000
and that it took them eight years to land on

556
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,800
the genie making a slap chop joke.

557
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,580
I think it's the balance of, if this just was,

558
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,140
if they let it just be purely this is dumb and silly,

559
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,300
but the fact that there's that Bono pretension

560
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,400
makes you have to judge it more carefully.

561
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,560
The Taymor pretension, even more so.

562
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,120
It seems like Taymor's pretension outweighs Bono's pretension

563
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,340
by like 20, I don't know, 20%.

564
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,180
And she also, she bailed too.

565
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,420
No, she got fired.

566
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:10,500
Yeah, yeah.

567
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,140
She got out of there somehow.

568
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,200
She bailed when they made her bail.

569
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,480
Yeah, and there's an interview where Bono says,

570
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,500
I think she was there the whole time,

571
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,120
and I think we were in and out because we were on tour

572
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,540
and we'd come back and we'd see obvious problems,

573
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,320
and I think they were less obvious to her.

574
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,200
And that's what this whole thing feels like.

575
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,660
When you go to a super wide shot of all of the freaks

576
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,860
crying around and punch in the air,

577
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,060
you're like, how did no anyone with an outside perspective

578
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,460
could have said, you just made Spider-Man rocks?

579
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,940
You all of this work and seven years of effort

580
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,240
and playwriting got you to this.

581
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,860
Some of the other people involved in this,

582
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,080
a listener sent us that Glenn Berger,

583
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,400
who co-wrote the book, which the book,

584
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,100
in a Broadway musical is what the script is called.

585
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,460
He wrote a book about the musical called Song of Spider-Man,

586
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,380
the inside story of the most controversial musical

587
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:07,860
in Broadway history.

588
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,840
Which I believe I have Scott's copy of upstairs.

589
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,460
No, no, no, you gave it back to me.

590
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,120
Oh, I did, okay good.

591
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,880
But I brought it back here.

592
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,360
Oh, good, all right, leave it here then.

593
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,440
I will, yes.

594
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,200
I brought bookmarks of relevant passages.

595
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,280
Have you read all of it?

596
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,480
I did read all of it.

597
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:20,680
Is it good?

598
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:27,280
I think Glenn Berger has a pretty slanted view

599
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,760
of how it played out and I think the book

600
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,820
is entirely an effort to show that at every step,

601
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,800
he's like, see I knew, I knew this was gonna happen

602
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,500
and I was right, I was right.

603
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,440
I tried to make this better but they wouldn't let me.

604
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,180
First like big gig, right?

605
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,420
Like he's written kids cartoon, was this like his first?

606
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,260
I'm not sure, let's read his author bio.

607
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,080
Well, he wrote the play underneath the lintel

608
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,760
and oh lovely glow worm and yes, he wrote for Arthur on PBS

609
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,120
and then the most damning thing in the author bio,

610
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:00,040
Glenn spent six years co-writing the script of Spider-Man.

611
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:00,460
Wow.

612
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,580
Turn off the dark, six years of your life goes to that.

613
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,120
Guy brought in the last few months to help fix it

614
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,040
is Roberto, I'm gonna massacre this last name,

615
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,580
Aguirre Sacasa who now makes,

616
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,780
is the person who makes the most sense

617
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,500
working on this piece, he had written a bunch

618
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,060
of Marvel comics, he was also a playwright

619
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:27,060
and he's written, he wrote on Big Love and Looking

620
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:30,360
and he wrote the script for the recent Carrie remake.

621
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,860
He is the current chief creative officer for RT Comics

622
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,920
and executive producer of Riverdale

623
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,600
and Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.

624
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,200
Whoa.

625
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,000
Like he oversees those things.

626
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,760
This lineup is so stacked.

627
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,260
The credits of this group for bonkers

628
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,680
and not to mention the man who plays the Green Goblin,

629
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,640
Patrick Page is a Broadway luminary,

630
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,920
I don't have the list offhand but I believe

631
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,940
he essentially ended up in this because I think

632
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,540
he was the Grinch on Broadway and it's a similar role.

633
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:02,760
He's green.

634
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,540
Yeah, he's a green villain.

635
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,440
Was he Scar or am I mixing my thing up?

636
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,340
Oh, I think he was maybe Scar.

637
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,380
I think he was Scar.

638
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,780
But a very well respected actor, I have no complaints.

639
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,480
I think he's fun as well.

640
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:13,920
He's great.

641
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,940
And he's having fun.

642
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,720
I think I saw him, I'm sure I probably did.

643
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,300
He did topical jokes also during the show.

644
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,720
Man, what did he do?

645
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,860
He did a Shakeweight joke.

646
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,440
Yes.

647
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:24,920
Yes.

648
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,600
He was like, had picked up some device and he was like,

649
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,800
it's like a Shakeweight or something and big laugh.

650
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,880
And then the show had to stop too because a Spider-Man got

651
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,620
tangled up in a wire.

652
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,260
The one you went to?

653
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:38,940
Oh my god.

654
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,760
Nobody fell and broke their leg.

655
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,520
It's just like a guy flew from the balcony, swung onto the

656
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,400
stage and then got caught on the side.

657
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,620
And then there was a pause.

658
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,500
And then it was like, Spider-Man will resume in five minutes.

659
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,880
Like a theme park.

660
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:53,580
Yes.

661
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And then when Green Goblin has a thing where he's at a piano

662
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,840
for some reason.

663
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,120
So he's playing like, we'll have to stop the show if something

664
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,100
goes wrong.

665
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,680
He was ad libbing.

666
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,320
Whoa.

667
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,240
So it was full theme park.

668
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,320
He would cover if shit happened?

669
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:10,720
Yeah.

670
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,860
So he was great.

671
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,880
I think at that point, after that many concussions and leg

672
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,980
injury, like they were probably had a million alternative plans

673
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,520
in place.

674
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:27,120
I mean, I got to say the interesting thing to me, like all

675
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,060
the bad reviews and stuff were because as soon as preview

676
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,560
started, all the critics rushed to see it, which is an unusual

677
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:34,920
thing.

678
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,320
And usually previews are a way to smooth out issues with like

679
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,360
and it's not going to be the same show as when it officially

680
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:44,760
opens.

681
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,360
This was such a catastrophe.

682
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,640
The critics were like, we got to see this immediately.

683
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,060
Desperate, I'm sure.

684
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:50,980
Yeah.

685
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,320
Just a side note, I was thinking about how much I would love

686
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,640
to play the Green Goblin.

687
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:56,680
Yeah.

688
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,140
Yeah.

689
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:57,380
Yeah.

690
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,000
I mean, this guy's given 110%.

691
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,040
That's the funniest thing to me is how he comes in like a

692
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,480
stadium is screaming his name.

693
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,740
He is coming in hot.

694
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,500
He's coming in ready to go.

695
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,860
I think, though, he's giving it.

696
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,440
He's so confident he's not giving it 100%.

697
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,840
He's given it 75, but he's so confident there's a couple of

698
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,500
dance steps, a couple of dance steps he does that are like

699
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:20,740
very late.

700
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,400
He's an older.

701
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,940
I think he's like in his 50s or something.

702
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,460
So maybe he's not a great, but he does a couple of dance steps

703
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:25,920
later on.

704
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,520
Maybe I should zoom it where he does kind of like he's in step,

705
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:32,300
but you can tell he's like not a dancer and maybe not trying

706
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:32,900
very hard.

707
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,160
Like I kind of a slow little stomp.

708
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:35,560
Yeah.

709
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,780
Like I can't.

710
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,780
I'm not even trying to put him down.

711
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,320
I think it was the right choice to not like go.

712
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,680
Let me see where it is here.

713
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,300
The other everybody else is hoofing it more.

714
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,480
Yes, everyone's going.

715
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:46,900
Sure.

716
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,920
And he is holding.

717
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,260
He is just holding the attention of the audience.

718
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,480
The little point he just did what we just saw where he like

719
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,760
points three times.

720
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,740
I saw footage of Julie Tamar here.

721
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,320
Sorry.

722
00:29:59,440 --> 00:29:59,640
Sorry.

723
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,220
Here we go.

724
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:00,880
Oh, yes.

725
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,100
That stomp backwards.

726
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,720
Kick, kick, kick.

727
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,880
I'm sure he doesn't have as much mobility as the people

728
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,120
in workout wear around him.

729
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,560
I'm just saying he's in time, but he's not

730
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,040
like he's not given the Springsteen effort

731
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,720
in the fourth encore is what I'm saying.

732
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,560
Well, that's my favorite.

733
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,700
I think in that part, they're singing the light light

734
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,760
and all the freaks.

735
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,620
And they all kind of go up like that.

736
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,160
And they all like swoop with their hands like zombies.

737
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,440
It's just the most that's really these backup dancers being

738
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,020
scary.

739
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:34,740
That is truly where it gets silly and me.

740
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,060
But I was saying that point, I saw Julie Tamar coaching him

741
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,140
and how to point.

742
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,080
She has a glove on and she's like, make sure you're like

743
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,820
that's footage you can watch in a 60 minutes piece.

744
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,380
So now we've looped back around.

745
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,260
All right.

746
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,380
Let's see what's happening.

747
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,800
The Green Goblin breaks in from the back topical Joe walks in

748
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,760
struts into the Ed Sullivan theater, owns it.

749
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:01,000
And he's already planted a gang of freaky freaks

750
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,940
in French coats.

751
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,860
And then he joins the most and lab coats.

752
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,160
The scientists, people too.

753
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,700
And then over here on the right, you've got like a guy in front

754
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,760
of a laptop who looks like a modern Geddy Lee crossed with

755
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,780
the crow who's like leading the band.

756
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:21,860
And that's another funny thing about this, that this is being

757
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,900
played live by the David Letterman band with Paul Schaeffer.

758
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,260
Let's add another luminary to this.

759
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:28,640
Yeah.

760
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,960
And the part where the Green Goblin walks up to Paul Schaeffer

761
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,700
and sings next to him, that's one of the highlights.

762
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,920
Also, what we're looking at right now where he sticks his

763
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,440
tongue out and it's like the tongue is green.

764
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,760
Do you think that he had to like eat a green sucker?

765
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,200
Right.

766
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,420
100% green apple sucker.

767
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,120
Did he do it every night is the question on Broadway.

768
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,740
Did they need it to be green even though for the people in the

769
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,240
front row.

770
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,380
Michael, I have a question.

771
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,740
Is Norman Osborn in this musical?

772
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,060
Yes, he is.

773
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,300
Is it the same actor playing Norman Osborn?

774
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,020
I believe so.

775
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:04,660
Really?

776
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,360
They got that costume on.

777
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,760
I think they did a costume.

778
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,160
Wow.

779
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,540
That's my memory of it because every other villain has just

780
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,880
just basically name checked in this and they're just like

781
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,880
dispatched easily.

782
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,060
But he's in it.

783
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,060
They're not really.

784
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:20,980
I had a feeling he was the only one really fleshed out.

785
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,040
So let's just.

786
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:22,640
All right.

787
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,340
Lyrics.

788
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,160
I mean, I know this thing by heart, but sure.

789
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,080
We already covered it, but I just love it.

790
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,820
Similar to like, I don't know, like the way how hard I laughed

791
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,260
at the first line of the room.

792
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,480
The first time I saw it, you're just like so high, babe.

793
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,400
You're so in.

794
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:42,440
And that like if there's any question of like, is this thing

795
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,580
silly or good or bad or that when he the way he phrase it,

796
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:52,160
if you're looking for his got his learn, he's going to have

797
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,380
committed.

798
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,960
That's it just tunes you perfectly.

799
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,880
And then the reference to how expensive it is.

800
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:01,940
And then he explains that he's the new Coney Island and all

801
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,780
the rides are open and free.

802
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:09,180
And he also I also like what he's what he says of me.

803
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,240
Like he's such a freak.

804
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,580
All he needs to say is me.

805
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,520
And you know, that's the craziest thing you could be.

806
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,640
So if you were reading into this and you didn't know what

807
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,020
the context was, he's like looking to have sex tonight.

808
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,020
Right.

809
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,060
Like if you didn't know, I don't know.

810
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,740
I think I think your body meter is going off again.

811
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,000
Maybe I miss.

812
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,680
But he's like he needs company.

813
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,720
A freak like me needs company.

814
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,480
Well, here's a little story from the making of the show

815
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,020
that when this title was first presented as a OK, apparently

816
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,580
a bond is working on a new song.

817
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,080
It's called a freak like me needs company.

818
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,100
And the director said, no, no, no, no, no.

819
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:51,260
It needs to be a freak like me needs family because his view

820
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:54,600
of the song is that he's a guy, he's a loner,

821
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:58,620
and now he's going to form his own family by giving people

822
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,100
poisons and chemicals.

823
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,940
And now he's got this family of freaks.

824
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,740
So there I think this is a little bit of contention.

825
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,060
Maybe in some people's mind it is about sex,

826
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,640
but in other people's mind it's about family.

827
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:12,920
Well, and this is interesting because in the original

828
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:17,880
The Sinister Six, who first appeared in 1964's Amazing

829
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,180
Spider-Man Annual Number One, which I looked up,

830
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:26,120
the way they come together is Doc Ock breaks out of prison

831
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:30,080
and contacts everyone who has been beaten by Spider-Man.

832
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:34,380
And the ones who show up and get back to him decide

833
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:38,260
they want to fight Spider-Man because they've all been humiliated by him.

834
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,600
They've all been defeated by him.

835
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,280
But they can't get their act together to work together.

836
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:47,020
So they fight Spider-Man one at a time in a gauntlet.

837
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,600
And sure enough, he dispatches all of them.

838
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,620
And they're humiliated once again.

839
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,400
And because it's Steve Ditko still drawing it,

840
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,180
they're all very gross and ugly.

841
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,200
OK, wow.

842
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,380
So Sinister Six is like a hallmark of Spider-Man for many years.

843
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,940
And there's been a lot of different members.

844
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,360
There's been a lot of different members over the years,

845
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,640
including in this one, Swiss Miss, a character created for the musical.

846
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,320
She's a woman made of knives.

847
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,160
And they brag about it.

848
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,780
I remember the media coverage at the time was like,

849
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,820
then there's a villain created just for the musical.

850
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,100
And she's called Swiss Miss.

851
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,640
And it's like, oh, and what she does is strut up,

852
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,320
wave her knife arms twice and then go return to the back.

853
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,240
Yeah. Yep. And that's it.

854
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,480
Yep. The end.

855
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,800
So the lyrics, though, like in I've been told that what you're supposed

856
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,500
to do when you're writing a musical is that the character is supposed to be

857
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,860
somewhere different by the end of the song.

858
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,620
Character starts in a certain place.

859
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,300
You're supposed to you're supposed to make like an actual like

860
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,680
something happen in the narrative in the song.

861
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,960
That's what the song is for.

862
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,360
So the first verse is like he's looking for company.

863
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,020
Then he explains in the chorus that weirdos are weirdos are there.

864
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,320
And then he has a crew in the second verse.

865
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,940
So I guess he's looking for the people.

866
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,800
Maybe he wants maybe he means sexist company.

867
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,480
Maybe just means literal company.

868
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,500
Well, maybe this is a good time to play the extra verse.

869
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,120
That's not in the letter.

870
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,280
Oh, yeah. Right. Performance.

871
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:23,080
I don't have to play the whole thing, but just a little.

872
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,780
It's really all about the first line of of verse two.

873
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,120
And I think I'm looking at it.

874
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,620
I'm also looking at it.

875
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,260
Uh-huh, that's what I was looking at.

876
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,380
I got a crew of body and I'm a mutant.

877
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,320
And the rest of the verse just really lays on it

878
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,620
and truly becomes like, a group of freaks,

879
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,080
cause I'm a freak.

880
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:00,600
Demon hairdo evil dressers who just won't be denied.

881
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,620
Is the next line of that.

882
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:04,620
Yeah.

883
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,140
And I have another thing to say about what I think

884
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,900
contributes to kicking this to the lamer side.

885
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,920
Okay, imagine Bono's guide vocals,

886
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,040
where potentially he sings the backup vocals like,

887
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,860
like me needs company.

888
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,460
And that's one way to sing it,

889
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,600
but the way the singers do it is,

890
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,060
a freak like me needs company.

891
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,460
It's that super Broadway.

892
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,040
Make sure you really hit each and it's three,

893
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,320
so ba ba ba, you got that ba ba ba.

894
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,320
It's very much like Bob Balaban,

895
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,040
the music director in Waiting for Guffman explaining like,

896
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,540
and half of you will say, blay and the other half

897
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,660
you'll say blane.

898
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,040
Like these bizarre pronunciation rituals.

899
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,300
You just feel that lame Broadway.

900
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,200
And no matter who wrote the song,

901
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,480
as long as it's a big Broadway chorus doing it,

902
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,240
it's just gonna come off silly.

903
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,260
Yeah.

904
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,480
There would be, first of all,

905
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,120
I would think that the holy grail is to find

906
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,880
the Bono and Edge demo of this.

907
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,740
Oh man.

908
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,800
Oh, if anyone for some reason.

909
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,640
For some reason.

910
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,980
Has some in. Yeah, takes, yeah.

911
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,360
Because he did like, temp this.

912
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:19,920
Yeah.

913
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,580
And he was like messing around in the studio

914
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:26,300
with a loop and improvising lyrics.

915
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,260
And this is a passage in the book,

916
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,360
if you don't mind me,

917
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,000
maybe I'll turn to one of my first Post-It sections.

918
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,840
This is like, because I bought the book,

919
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,940
Song of Spider-Man,

920
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,380
with the hopes that it was 100%

921
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,640
about the Letterman performance of Freak Like Me.

922
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,060
But in fact, the Freak Like Me content is pretty small,

923
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:45,900
which is disappointing.

924
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,000
But this one part did not let me down.

925
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:50,840
And let me find it.

926
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,700
So the song, you know, they gotta rush this song out,

927
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,500
cause the play is up and running,

928
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,160
and they gotta introduce it and rehearse it

929
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,080
and get it in there sooner than later.

930
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,700
So it's the middle of the night.

931
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,900
Bono is lying on a ratty couch

932
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,380
in the middle of the recording room,

933
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,380
improvising goblin lines over an endless groove.

934
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,180
He was in character, a dissipated lounge lizard,

935
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,060
shaking off last night's bender

936
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,080
and warming up for some new kicks.

937
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,600
He was scatting, hacking up tar,

938
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,740
yawning, cackling into the mic.

939
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,540
And then in the book, you get extra lyrics

940
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,600
that are nowhere to be found in the song.

941
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,460
And Hugh didn't have to cover your ears, Mike,

942
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,440
because he gets a tad bawdy.

943
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,500
You know, he's not worried about,

944
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,580
he's just letting it flow.

945
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,900
They'll edit it down later.

946
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,900
But here's what comes out of Bono's mouth.

947
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,520
Bring out the dancing girls.

948
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,480
The crossroads of the world needs a little resurrection.

949
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,940
It used to be really rotten around here.

950
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,160
Now can't even buy me an erection.

951
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,380
So it's the middle of the night.

952
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,300
Bono's on the floor saying that shit.

953
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,100
Hacking up tar.

954
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,600
Apparently hacking up tar,

955
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,940
which is troubling.

956
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,480
Preparing for his kicks.

957
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,360
No, no, no, he's just playing the care.

958
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,240
Yeah, he's not really hacking up tar.

959
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:09,860
Oh, I see, okay.

960
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,340
Like he was three sheets to the wind with,

961
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,280
can you tell this was written by a Broadway book writer?

962
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,360
It's with stained silk bathrobe bravado he's saying.

963
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,220
He thinks it's awesome.

964
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,360
Yeah, yeah, he loves, and he's like,

965
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,120
he's watching an artistic process in action.

966
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:25,440
Right.

967
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,080
He watched him improvise the line

968
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,160
about $65 million circus tragedy.

969
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,140
How did he come up with that?

970
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:31,900
I don't know.

971
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,260
Bono's the cheat key.

972
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:33,880
That is good.

973
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,200
Oh, he's got a spreadsheet with all the numbers on it

974
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,180
and how much it's affecting his bottom line.

975
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,280
He's gotta sell an island.

976
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,900
I should say though,

977
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,880
this musical did set the record

978
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,600
for one week Broadway sales once

979
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,480
during one of its weeks of its run.

980
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,340
It turned around.

981
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,500
2.9 million.

982
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:54,740
Jeez, okay.

983
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,780
But its operating costs were estimated

984
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,600
to be $1 million a week.

985
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,080
So I think it did end up being profitable

986
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,860
because it did, and it also ran for two and a half years.

987
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,180
I think they broke even or something.

988
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,740
Yeah, so at least broke even.

989
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,560
So also, and the guy compares

990
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,700
what Bono was doing to like Tom Waits.

991
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:17,840
So there's a little bit of Tom Waits influence in-

992
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:18,300
Greta Goblin.

993
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,120
There's a lot of Tom Waits influence

994
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,660
on Heath Ledger's Joker.

995
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,940
And that's, I'm being serious.

996
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,420
Oh yes, that's how I recently learned that too, yeah.

997
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,920
There's a clip of like him talking,

998
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,840
Tom Waits being like, hey, there is Dean.

999
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,940
And then you click, they show the clip of Heath Ledger

1000
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,500
and you're like, oh yeah, though it's the voice.

1001
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,300
It's the same voice.

1002
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,980
And the way he kinda like smacks his lips

1003
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,260
and shakes his head around.

1004
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,720
And yeah, so all the great supervillains

1005
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,960
have some Tom Waits.

1006
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,420
But also in the demo,

1007
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,620
when they say a freak like me needs,

1008
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,000
it was the edge.

1009
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,520
It was the edge stacked on itself, multi-tracked.

1010
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,020
So this demo does exist

1011
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:52,780
and we have to get our hands on it.

1012
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,680
We gotta get it, yeah.

1013
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,040
But here's where it gets truly insane.

1014
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,800
It's March 17th as they're doing this.

1015
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,060
It's the middle of the night

1016
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,860
and all of New York's most famous freaks

1017
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,180
are flooding the streets.

1018
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,120
So who should walk in into the recording session

1019
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,800
of this song but Elvis Costello?

1020
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:15,140
Let one more luminary, Costello is in the building

1021
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,360
while they're doing this.

1022
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,360
He's wearing a pair of devil horns like Mr. McPhisto.

1023
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,900
Like Mr. McPhisto.

1024
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,660
So Bono invites Elvis to Steve Lillywhite is there.

1025
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,660
They play him the track.

1026
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,780
Elvis listened intently,

1027
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,380
hardly moving until the songs were over.

1028
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,520
And after he said some very complimentary things

1029
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,840
and headed out into the night, Bono said,

1030
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,560
"'Yeah, I heard the songs through his ears

1031
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,520
"'and there's some things we need to fix.'"

1032
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,360
Then writer Glenn Berger goes on to say,

1033
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,260
"'And that's what you get with a community of artists

1034
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:49,360
"'is an exchange of ears and it's all about how he's isolated

1035
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,340
"'but he doesn't have company.

1036
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:56,320
"'Of freaks like Bono and Costello have with each other.'"

1037
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,140
I love Costello coming in and going like,

1038
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:58,740
"'This is good.'"

1039
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,880
Like they're all just like kissing each other's ass

1040
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,760
and stuff about it.

1041
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,780
This is good.

1042
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,140
This is good.

1043
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,080
It requires a willingness to be self-critical.

1044
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,360
These guys in the devil horns had it.

1045
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:14,640
Yeah, I'm sure these guys are real self-critics.

1046
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:15,480
I'm sure.

1047
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:19,340
Bono in the Edge, super self-aware still.

1048
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,860
Very hard, very hard on themselves.

1049
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,360
Do you think Costello was like,

1050
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:26,380
you should have like a knife woman.

1051
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,360
You know what would be fun is if you have like a knife woman.

1052
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,040
What's scary about a knife woman?

1053
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,420
Anyway, back to drinking, bye.

1054
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,540
He sticks his head back in.

1055
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,420
Maybe a gun woman.

1056
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:35,900
Guns are scarier.

1057
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:36,940
It's up to you, it's your show.

1058
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,340
I don't want to be prescriptive.

1059
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,860
See you at Sardis.

1060
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,880
If Costello had written a line in this,

1061
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,300
that would be a great lore.

1062
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:47,580
I don't think the fake story of Prince writing

1063
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,120
the frozen,

1064
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:50,740
Yeah, yeah.

1065
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,380
It didn't bother me anyway.

1066
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,740
This is, you know, Mike,

1067
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,940
listening to the song a million times before recording this

1068
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,400
really gives me a new appreciation

1069
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,620
of the City Walk Saga theme song.

1070
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,220
What do you mean?

1071
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,680
You're saying Mike's a better songwriter than Bono?

1072
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:08,780
I'm saying that, yeah.

1073
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,320
Although apparently some people were haunted

1074
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,800
by a sublime hot topic in Cinnabon trying to figure out.

1075
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,660
There was a lot of mystery in the,

1076
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:19,020
my intention was behind writing the lyric.

1077
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,940
Was I talking about sublime the store

1078
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:24,860
or was I saying that hot topic was sublime?

1079
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,720
And here I'll say this now, I'm not going to tell.

1080
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,460
Yeah.

1081
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:32,240
Well, an artist has to be ambiguous.

1082
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,660
Who were you?

1083
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,780
I mean, you did a demo of the vocal, like Bono,

1084
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,320
you did a demo of the song before it was,

1085
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,540
you were replaced by the Broadway caliber, Zachary.

1086
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,400
Did you, were you channeling anyone while singing that song?

1087
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,700
I assume Tom Waits, but besides that.

1088
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,780
Tom Waits, I was sort of more of like a,

1089
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,000
I was kind of getting in the place of like

1090
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,280
the Gregorian chants.

1091
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,980
That's what I was sort of thinking like a kind of,

1092
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,360
like primitive music.

1093
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,440
I was sort of trying to think.

1094
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,320
The kilter hills, yes.

1095
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,400
They can feel the spirits and, you know,

1096
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,180
it's really the pre, before City Walk,

1097
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,620
there were the hills of Ireland.

1098
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:14,340
But of course, all popular rock and roll goes back to

1099
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:17,540
Muddy Waters and Mississippi Delta.

1100
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,320
Blind Willie Jefferson.

1101
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,600
Brian Eno via Mike Post, I'll say.

1102
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:25,700
Hey, great.

1103
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,220
Yeah.

1104
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,220
Why didn't Eno, why didn't they get Eno down

1105
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,440
to consult on this?

1106
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,300
Yeah, Eno was a big, Eno was Octong Baby, right?

1107
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,880
He kind of played, well, I guess he didn't play characters.

1108
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,020
In this video, you know,

1109
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,820
he could be a malevolent figure in certain songs.

1110
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,200
I'm sorry, I just had to point out.

1111
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,800
So Letterman is on stage standing in front of Swiss Miss

1112
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,460
and her knife knee pad is still spinning.

1113
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,220
It has not stopped spinning.

1114
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:53,680
That's great.

1115
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:54,840
Oh wait, we just popped up.

1116
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,080
And once you see it, you can't unsee it.

1117
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:58,880
Okay.

1118
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:03,540
So we have established in the song that all the freaks

1119
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,600
in New York City are out tonight.

1120
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,300
All the weirdos are all around,

1121
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,280
but we need further proof of this.

1122
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,960
And so there is a roll call of each member

1123
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,220
of the Sinister Six, perhaps we should go through them.

1124
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:21,020
You've got a really, I don't know.

1125
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:23,560
It's hard to pick a favorite line or anything,

1126
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:27,480
but for sure we got a man made entirely out of mutant bees.

1127
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:28,900
He's kind of tossing it off.

1128
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:29,980
He's getting a little half-assed.

1129
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,120
And then of course the bee falls off.

1130
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,500
Yeah, that would be Swarm.

1131
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:37,020
First appearance, champions number 14, July, 1977.

1132
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:43,820
This character, I think the actual comics design of Swarm,

1133
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,580
it is just a mass of bees.

1134
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,900
The character has been from Wikipedia,

1135
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:50,980
the character has been depicted as a former Nazi sympathizer

1136
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,960
and has been mainly featured as an enemy of Spider-Man.

1137
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,320
His entire body is composed of bees

1138
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,700
surrounding his skeleton.

1139
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,260
And on top of that, he has a big purple cloak.

1140
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,760
So that's one of those things like, oh, only in comics,

1141
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,180
until Broadway came along.

1142
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,120
Until somebody put a bunch of sticks

1143
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,280
on a yellow and black unitard.

1144
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:11,880
Yeah.

1145
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,280
Wait, who's next?

1146
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:14,800
What's the order?

1147
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:15,480
Oh, the lizard.

1148
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,180
Next is the lizard.

1149
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,180
Yeah.

1150
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:18,120
Isn't it?

1151
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,000
No, I think it's the lizard.

1152
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:19,740
I think it's the lizard.

1153
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,120
He comes up the aisles.

1154
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:21,500
Right, right.

1155
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,520
And that's legitimately impressive

1156
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,480
that an inflatable dinosaur bursts out of a scientist,

1157
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,100
out of his stomach.

1158
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:34,300
Electro is the guy with a torch in his hand, correct?

1159
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,960
He's sparking a lot.

1160
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,260
Yeah, he has cool spark effects, which I think they kind of

1161
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,300
use similar spark effects.

1162
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,120
You know how lettermen always have those spokes models

1163
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,760
with the metal that they would be sparking

1164
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,040
when they would hit metal on metal?

1165
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,020
Does anyone know what I'm talking about?

1166
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:48,800
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1167
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,460
He would have just, I don't remember,

1168
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,500
they would be showcasing something.

1169
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,640
Will it float?

1170
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,440
Many different times.

1171
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,640
They would bring in these women that had metal

1172
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,280
and they would just do these sparking things

1173
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,500
that would, but it looks like a similar effect

1174
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,820
that Electro has going on.

1175
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:03,080
I see.

1176
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,740
That's also one of the top lines of the thing is,

1177
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,980
hey ladies, how about a human lightning bolt?

1178
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:09,780
You want it?

1179
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:10,860
You got it.

1180
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,700
Why ladies?

1181
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,640
Electro, not to be confused with Shocker,

1182
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,540
Spider-Man's other electricity-themed nemesis.

1183
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:19,600
I love Shocker, I'm a big Shocker fan as a kid.

1184
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,860
The costume kind of looks like,

1185
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,000
more like Shocker's than Electro's.

1186
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,840
Is Kraven next?

1187
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,860
I think it's Kraven the Hunter.

1188
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:28,860
And that's the joke.

1189
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,380
He makes a joke which seems like he's implying that,

1190
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,720
because Kraven the Hunter, Jason,

1191
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,520
do you have facts on Kraven you want to read?

1192
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:40,100
Sure, Kraven, real name Sergei Kravinov,

1193
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,380
a maniacal big game hunter who seeks to defeat Spider-Man

1194
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,180
to prove that he is the greatest hunter in the world.

1195
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:49,780
And he favors his bare hands.

1196
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,520
He does not like using guns or bow and arrows.

1197
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:55,540
In Kraven's last hunt, he famously commits suicide,

1198
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,400
which is one of the most famous stories, right?

1199
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,100
Yes, because he thinks he's killed Spider-Man.

1200
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:00,800
Right, but he hasn't.

1201
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:03,040
And won, but then he tries to replace him,

1202
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:05,320
and then it turns out he hasn't, so he commits suicide.

1203
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,940
And in the show, in the Spider-Man show,

1204
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,820
he says like, Kraven the Hunter,

1205
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,500
like what he, I forgot, I should have written down the line.

1206
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,100
It's like, he likes the animals,

1207
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,960
but maybe a little too much.

1208
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,120
So that is about sex.

1209
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,920
That is for sure implying that he's had sex with

1210
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,260
whatever lion or tiger he's hanging around with.

1211
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,820
He's almost like a lion king on Broadway style puppet,

1212
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:32,000
because he's like a big cartoonish looking man

1213
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,640
and in his main, his costume.

1214
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:35,420
Yeah, here it is.

1215
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:37,060
He's got a whip and leather pants.

1216
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,320
It's a lion, literally roars,

1217
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,160
like the lion on his chest.

1218
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,580
He's very good, yeah.

1219
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:43,180
It's really good.

1220
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,060
And he factors into this other,

1221
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,680
we're gonna direct you to another YouTube video

1222
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,960
I recently discovered, in which Spider-Man

1223
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,660
and the Green Goblin put their differences aside

1224
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:57,760
to hold a press conference about Halloween costume safety.

1225
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,120
There is, please look this up

1226
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,680
or we'll put it in the show notes or something,

1227
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:04,840
that the Green Goblin, Spider-Man's not really talking.

1228
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:08,040
He stands off to the side and the Green Goblin handles it.

1229
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,660
Different actor playing the Green Goblin,

1230
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,120
but he says, now Spider-Man and I,

1231
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:14,020
we've had our differences,

1232
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,980
many of which have played out on the public stage,

1233
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:19,260
but there's one thing that we can agree on

1234
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,000
and that's Halloween safety.

1235
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,620
And then he pans around the other villains,

1236
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:28,720
like now my friends here are dressed very outlandishly,

1237
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,840
but they make sure to have the maximum visibility at night.

1238
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:36,780
And these sad reporters have to be there outside the theater

1239
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,420
covering this non-event.

1240
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:39,700
It's so funny.

1241
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,800
Anyway, I'm a fantastic super villain,

1242
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,040
but I do wanna say blue lives matter.

1243
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,620
These guys, they're out on the stairwell

1244
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:53,660
every day putting their lives on the line.

1245
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,720
And you know, stop and frisk works.

1246
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,060
It's a word we wouldn't have used it for so long.

1247
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,120
If it had a word.

1248
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,140
Come on Mayor de Blasio, it's 2011 so.

1249
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,220
Yes, they all turn their back.

1250
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:07,180
They'll replace you next election.

1251
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:12,000
And then it goes to like a very bland police officer,

1252
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:13,780
just reading facts about like,

1253
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:15,420
do not wear all black costumes,

1254
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,820
make sure you have reflective materials on your,

1255
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:22,520
and during that Craven the Hunter leans in behind him

1256
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,900
and kind of like cranes his head and smiles

1257
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:28,100
as these dull facts about safety are listed.

1258
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,860
It's the funny, these villains are truly left with like,

1259
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:36,420
well, the only thing I can do is ride around and look evil.

1260
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:40,400
And so what do they do when we're talking about like,

1261
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,100
kids don't make sure that candy's wrapped,

1262
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:45,220
make sure they got no needles in there.

1263
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,000
They're at a loss.

1264
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,560
If you're going as cops and robbers or cowboys,

1265
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,960
make sure there's an orange cap

1266
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,240
on the end of your toy costume pistol.

1267
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,920
Oh, you have to be too careful these days.

1268
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,560
You are smote, son.

1269
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,300
So that's a great video, check that out.

1270
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,460
Craven the Hunter, the all star of that one.

1271
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,020
Carnage. Now we got,

1272
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,840
I don't remember his name.

1273
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,380
Carnage. Carnage.

1274
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,260
Cletus Cassidy, Jason, you wanna give us some,

1275
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:13,800
the symbiote?

1276
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,160
Carnage is interesting to me

1277
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:20,660
because the original idea was that the writer, David,

1278
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,720
is it Michelin? David Michelin?

1279
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,260
Oh yeah, I don't know.

1280
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,600
He wrote a lot of Spider-Man comics.

1281
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:26,740
He was going to kill off Venom.

1282
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,880
He wanted to kill off Venom.

1283
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:31,440
And- Big mistake.

1284
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,640
Big mistake because he was too popular,

1285
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:36,420
too successful and management was like,

1286
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,180
well, we can't kill him off.

1287
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:40,700
And eventually the storyline became, we'll kill off Craven.

1288
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,760
But similarly, they, he could not make Venom.

1289
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:49,360
They needed someone even more extreme than Venom.

1290
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,000
So they made Carnage,

1291
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,300
a similar symbiote based Spider-Man enemy,

1292
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,160
but Cletus Cassidy is a fucking psychopath.

1293
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:03,840
Venom has a moral comp, even though it's twisted,

1294
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,220
he's got a moral compass,

1295
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,060
but Carnage is just fucking crazy.

1296
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,780
Yeah, he's a very 90s character.

1297
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,480
I mean, Venom is a 90s character,

1298
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,520
but Carnage is 90s, baby, like extreme and violent.

1299
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,340
Venom created at the end of the 80s, I believe.

1300
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,380
Oh yeah, that makes sense.

1301
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:26,180
And ahead of them, just like Cable,

1302
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,480
and then just became, when the 90s just ran

1303
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,880
with these extreme characters, you end up with-

1304
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,400
Carnage. Carnage.

1305
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,440
And the way this extreme, the extreme nature of Carnage

1306
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,940
is presented in the Letterman performance is,

1307
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,220
he killed his grandmother and tortured his mother's dog.

1308
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,720
My kind of guy, Carnage. Shout out Carnage.

1309
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:54,280
That's the first time also he's talked about actually killing,

1310
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:55,380
I think too.

1311
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,520
Yeah. Oh yeah.

1312
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,560
That's pretty thrown away, yeah.

1313
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,080
These are literal murderers, don't forget.

1314
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,920
It's pretty innocent up until that.

1315
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,080
Up until he says, we got a guy in the team

1316
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,180
who killed someone and he's-

1317
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:10,280
Where does Carnage, Carnage has a grandmother?

1318
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,420
I honestly don't, the history of Carnage

1319
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:14,640
is a little cloudy to me.

1320
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,500
I assume he killed some person in his family.

1321
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,220
He was just like, he was like a really crazy

1322
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,440
hillbilly character. I think he was kind of,

1323
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,340
I think the timing works out where when he would have been

1324
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:26,640
created and starred in the comics,

1325
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:30,940
lines up with Silence of the Lambs being a big hit movie.

1326
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,180
So it's kind of like, oh, it's like Venom

1327
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,540
meets Hannibal Lecter.

1328
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,540
Cause like all the early Carnage storylines were like,

1329
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,000
this guy's so crazy.

1330
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,040
He'll just straight up murder people in cold blood.

1331
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:46,740
Like any nuance or any like, well, he's tortured

1332
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,020
because of this reason.

1333
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,360
Like Dr. Octopus in the second Spider-Man movie.

1334
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:55,520
He's tortured because he's trying to find this,

1335
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:57,060
prove this scientific formula.

1336
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:00,600
But then he's haunted by his wife dying in the process.

1337
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:03,660
That's called, Carnage is just a straight up psychopath.

1338
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,620
Which, but there's something about it being his grandmother

1339
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:09,280
that just makes it feel like, you know,

1340
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,260
he told his teacher to suck eggs.

1341
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,960
That would seem like it would be more appropriate

1342
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,900
for what had come before in the song.

1343
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1344
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,760
That it's all, it's no, there's no reference made.

1345
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:23,900
It's just, we're going to have a freaky party.

1346
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:26,100
Yeah. Anyway, he killed his grandmother.

1347
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,460
He was, you know, they stacked the jury.

1348
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,520
So he got off.

1349
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,900
It wasn't totally clean.

1350
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,500
You know, look, I think they, I think they bought

1351
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,120
that election and they had some sway with the DA.

1352
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,460
But anyway, he's out on the street.

1353
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:42,700
I've got some thoughts on partisan judges.

1354
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:47,680
I, and then you, and then you got Swiss Miss,

1355
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:48,920
the most tossed off of all.

1356
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,480
And oh, one more.

1357
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,360
There you go. Okay.

1358
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:52,920
There you go.

1359
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,720
There is a female also.

1360
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:55,640
Okay, bye.

1361
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,780
That, that's kind of,

1362
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,380
I forget what, I forget the character's name

1363
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,800
in the Spider-Man ride in Florida.

1364
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,440
Scream. Are you referencing?

1365
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:06,580
Yes. One of, one of the carnages.

1366
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:09,300
There's a yellow venom symbiote with lady.

1367
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,280
Yeah, one of the symbiote spin-offs

1368
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,140
and it made it sound like, well,

1369
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,160
we got to have a girl bad guy.

1370
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:19,820
Like in both of these, it's, it does feel so tossed off.

1371
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:22,420
Yeah. I don't know why they didn't go black cat or like,

1372
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:25,480
I mean, she's like a tweener if you're, if something,

1373
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,180
but she could be a bad guy, you know?

1374
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:29,340
She doesn't, she could be in this, in this universe.

1375
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,200
An anti-hero, bit of an anti-hero.

1376
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,300
Black cat. She's good sometimes.

1377
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,500
Sometimes she's bad.

1378
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,220
We don't know. Black cat.

1379
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:36,840
There you go.

1380
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:39,840
Very young, has a streak, has a lot of white hair.

1381
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,020
Think she's like Catwoman? She is.

1382
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:48,340
Her biggest, the biggest crime is being a ripoff artist.

1383
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,740
Intellectual property theft.

1384
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:51,960
Oh, man.

1385
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,320
So that all is so delightful.

1386
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,540
He's just the most theme parky villain.

1387
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,260
He's so much like the Janey. He's so much like,

1388
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,060
he's like Bugsy. He's like exactly like Bugsy.

1389
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,240
Yes, that's true. He is a lot like Bugsy.

1390
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:05,220
He's the devil.

1391
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:09,160
But he's, he's mean, but he's also cheeky.

1392
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,480
He's kind of cute.

1393
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,720
I think this, I am so upset this isn't still running

1394
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:14,460
on Broadway.

1395
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:16,200
There was a rumor it was going to be running

1396
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,400
and they were going to move it to Vegas,

1397
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,660
which is the perfect place for it.

1398
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:20,700
This is 100% Vegas.

1399
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,660
And they never like get the funding to move everything,

1400
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:25,220
but they should have done it.

1401
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:26,620
I'm gonna throw a pitch your way.

1402
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:27,960
Here's a plus set up.

1403
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,520
I have a pitch too, but yeah, go for it.

1404
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:32,540
Okay. I'm worried I'm saying your pitch already.

1405
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:33,620
No, there's not, I don't think there is.

1406
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:34,260
I think it's a different.

1407
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:37,800
I think that here's, this is the merger

1408
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,700
I want to make happen between a couple,

1409
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,500
like not 100% successful musicals,

1410
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,780
but I think you do this pair up and it's perfect.

1411
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,920
The Jimmy Buffett musical, Escape from Margaritaville

1412
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:53,880
proceeds as it did, whatever the hell happened in that show,

1413
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,080
but halfway through, well, well, well,

1414
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,040
what's this little beach party?

1415
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:01,680
It looks like y'all are getting laid.

1416
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,760
Look, I make jokes.

1417
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:08,940
Maybe I need to rain on your little sunny parade.

1418
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,580
The Green Goblin as a threat within Escape from Margaritaville

1419
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:16,220
would form the greatest musical ever achieved.

1420
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:17,520
There's no doubt about it.

1421
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,080
I mean, there's no, yeah, there's no reason not to do that.

1422
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,780
Just to have a main character

1423
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:24,940
of the Margaritaville musical, Tully Mars.

1424
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,540
Need some help, Tully Mars?

1425
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,760
Spider-Man, thank God you're here.

1426
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,700
The actor playing Tully Mars has broken both legs.

1427
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,360
But the multiple Tully Marses swinging in

1428
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:40,660
from the balconies, Tully and Spider-Man swing, yeah.

1429
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,260
Now that's a problem because those swings

1430
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:45,920
have to be precisely timed and choreographed,

1431
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,980
and Tully Mars ain't never won a watch.

1432
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:50,300
He's on his own time.

1433
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,540
He's on island time. Island time, obviously.

1434
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,080
And in the end of the show,

1435
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,400
the Green Goblin's getting threatened,

1436
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,100
and he's gonna, he talked to the mayor

1437
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,080
and he's gonna cancel summer.

1438
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:03,200
But then he sees them all drinking margaritas,

1439
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,180
and he's like, wait a minute, drinks can be green?

1440
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,060
Toss one of those my way, brother.

1441
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,440
And then they all cheers and party together.

1442
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:15,920
And then they sing like a mashup of Margaritaville

1443
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,060
and Boy Falls from the Sky.

1444
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,200
I'm into that.

1445
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:23,280
I'm wasted away again in Margaritaville.

1446
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,060
The Bono mobile guide.

1447
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:30,160
Yeah, no, that's not what I was gonna pick.

1448
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,340
The Julie Taymor lost shaker of salt

1449
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:34,300
that's a living creature with like,

1450
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,180
Oh yeah, that's great.

1451
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:40,800
Children crying at the appearance of the salt shaker.

1452
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,840
Certainly the cheeseburger is also

1453
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,820
an anthropomorphic cheeseburger in paradise.

1454
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:49,060
He's got a big floppy cheese tongue lapping around.

1455
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,660
A volcano would be real,

1456
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:53,940
or it would be like that volcano from the Pixar short,

1457
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,000
who's sad.

1458
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:56,440
Oh yeah, sure.

1459
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:56,820
Lava.

1460
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,180
Why did they use actual lava?

1461
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,880
Julie Taymor insisted on real lava.

1462
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,980
The cast all, their feet got singed,

1463
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,180
they'll never walk again.

1464
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:09,640
Oh God, the safety strap wasn't fully on their harness,

1465
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,680
and then they stepped in lava.

1466
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,580
That's a real insult to insult.

1467
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,900
No injury to injury, no insults at all.

1468
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,900
Do you have another pitch?

1469
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,480
My pitch was honestly not as good.

1470
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:25,500
My pitch was just that I wanna see Bono on the edge.

1471
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:27,120
It's about time I think for them

1472
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:29,460
to tackle another superhero property.

1473
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:32,000
Cause we had Batman forever, then we had Spider-Man.

1474
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,680
I think it's time for them to do another

1475
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,020
big famous superhero.

1476
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,480
And I'm open to pitches on this,

1477
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:40,740
but I mean like, there needs to be like an Iron Man musical

1478
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:42,920
written by Bono on the edge or something.

1479
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:45,680
A big superhero and get their take.

1480
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,780
Like what is, when Bono on the edge wanna write a song

1481
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,460
where the Mandarin is the villain,

1482
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,860
what kind of song are we gonna get?

1483
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,360
Oh, I'm the freaky little Mandarin.

1484
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:58,540
I know nothing else about the Mandarin,

1485
01:00:58,680 --> 01:00:59,100
but that's the song.

1486
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:02,860
For sure like harpsichord, like Asian inspired influences.

1487
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,560
And like Bono certainly getting into a problematic

1488
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,000
character head space before he's doing the lyrics

1489
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:08,920
for the Mandarin.

1490
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,480
Yeah, I just think.

1491
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:15,460
With the freaky fantastic voice.

1492
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:21,440
Or at the very least, an original IP

1493
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,800
of all you two characters from the tours

1494
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:28,400
as its own musical superhero kind of a mashup thing.

1495
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:31,520
Yes, wait, who will take us through some other characters?

1496
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:33,900
Well, Bono is like the pop tour.

1497
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:35,180
Bono is like a box.

1498
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:39,140
Bono is the boxer and he's got like a big like robot

1499
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:43,020
and like it's Bono is usually the interesting character

1500
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:43,940
on the show.

1501
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:46,500
So can I pitch where it would take place?

1502
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:48,620
Oh, please go for it.

1503
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:50,040
Joshua Tree National Park.

1504
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,280
No, that's the different, that's a different era.

1505
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,760
I just mean a setting.

1506
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:54,940
Yeah, you could combine it.

1507
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:55,980
All right, fine, fine.

1508
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:56,920
It's a jukebox musical.

1509
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:01,200
Wait, your YouTube musical is just like three albums.

1510
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:04,280
It's not even a dressing all of it.

1511
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,000
The covered YouTube stuff is all the nonsense

1512
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,700
with the characters and stuff.

1513
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:08,500
Stuff people don't like.

1514
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,920
The stuff that people, people like Octon Baby,

1515
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:12,540
but people get a little bit weird

1516
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:16,620
about the Mr. McFisto stuff for some reason.

1517
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:18,280
You've also of course got in,

1518
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,780
if it's multiple Bono villains and characters meeting,

1519
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:25,320
you gotta get Dr. Robert, the character he played

1520
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,480
in Julie Taymor's film across the universe.

1521
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,000
From the Beatles song.

1522
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,540
That's why this all happened.

1523
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:35,280
It actually started with Bono and the Edge,

1524
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,480
not Julie Taymor.

1525
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,760
And they had one condition, the condition is Julie.

1526
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:43,660
That's so they caused, they created this monster.

1527
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:46,260
Was this after Across the Universe?

1528
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:46,860
Yeah.

1529
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:47,640
Wow.

1530
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:49,720
It's been a long time.

1531
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:53,020
So you just saw how she just did not understand the Beatles

1532
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,280
and they're like, what if she could

1533
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,100
misunderstand Spider-Man too?

1534
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:00,100
And rap music in general and Tom Waits.

1535
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,680
The other characters, I forget,

1536
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,540
the other characters on the Pop Mart tour

1537
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:07,380
other than Mr. McFisto were Bono's the fly character

1538
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:11,940
when he had big, his giant glasses and then Mirror Ball Man.

1539
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:14,380
Barf.

1540
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:20,460
I was looking at some articles about Mr. McFisto.

1541
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:22,620
I didn't really have time to do the full research

1542
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:23,520
I would have liked to.

1543
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,360
And I don't know how much I believe this,

1544
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:30,080
but according to U2Songs.com,

1545
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,080
Joel Schumacher, the director of Batman Forever

1546
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:36,660
had met with Bono to discuss an on-screen role.

1547
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,520
Initially it was thought that Bono would play a villain,

1548
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:41,600
but there were already two evil characters

1549
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,780
in the film already.

1550
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:46,600
So instead Schumacher considered having Bono perform a song

1551
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,940
in costume as McFisto.

1552
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,220
McFisto is almost in the movie.

1553
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:52,460
I believe that.

1554
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,420
Yeah, I don't know why I wouldn't.

1555
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:55,540
It's a crazy movie.

1556
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,140
Coolio was in the second, it was in Batman and Robin,

1557
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:00,600
I believe, there are little weird cameos.

1558
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,560
And then there's like decent, I don't know,

1559
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,440
Drew Barrymore is in like a tiny role.

1560
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:07,120
There are people that are put in the movie as is.

1561
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,380
And he did a song on the soundtrack.

1562
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,900
So it makes sense that he met with him.

1563
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,120
And it makes sense Joel Schumacher would have been like,

1564
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,860
I like Mr. McFisto.

1565
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:17,700
This feels like a good time to bring this up.

1566
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:21,520
So I don't know if you guys had anything like this

1567
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,140
in your middle school music classes,

1568
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,620
but I sure did.

1569
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:30,560
And it's still confusing to me to this day.

1570
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,420
So we would get this,

1571
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:35,200
the music teachers would get these magazines,

1572
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:39,660
like glossy magazines that every student got a copy.

1573
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:46,100
And for like a couple of weeks at least,

1574
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,840
we would analyze a popular song

1575
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:53,600
using things we had learned in music classes.

1576
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:57,320
And the one year it was Kiss From A Rose,

1577
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,020
Kiss By A Rose?

1578
01:04:59,260 --> 01:04:59,740
Kiss From A Rose.

1579
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:00,560
Kiss From A Rose.

1580
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:04,400
And the next year it was, I Believe I Can Fly.

1581
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:05,060
Whoa.

1582
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:05,940
So.

1583
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:10,560
Both of the big Warner Brothers, R&B crossover.

1584
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,320
Yeah, so maybe that magazine,

1585
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:15,440
I mean, I'm sure that magazine was funded by a record label,

1586
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:17,740
probably Warner Brothers Records.

1587
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:23,320
And I, but it only went, we only did that,

1588
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,960
maybe it's just the same teacher,

1589
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,420
but like I never did that again.

1590
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:29,520
Was it sanctioned, like a curriculum passed out

1591
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,180
on a professional level?

1592
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:34,920
Yes, like that looked in like a magazine

1593
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:39,620
that looks like a thin floppy Rolling Stone kind of thing.

1594
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:42,560
Which really, maybe that gave you a thirst

1595
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:45,300
for music and song and lyric analysis

1596
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:47,940
that led to this very podcast today.

1597
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,240
Like I'd like to get that booklet now and say,

1598
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,680
okay, so let's move on to line three.

1599
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:56,300
I'm a rolling baby rolling in the green,

1600
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:58,800
but I'm unique, a freak.

1601
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:00,360
Now, what do you make of that?

1602
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:05,040
I love it.

1603
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,200
I love Batman Forever.

1604
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,860
I hope we keep doing a lot of Batman Forever talk

1605
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:09,800
in general.

1606
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:13,860
But you know, we're missing a big component

1607
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:16,780
to what makes this video great,

1608
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:19,260
which is that at the end,

1609
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:21,640
we get to see the real time reaction

1610
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:25,760
of wonderfully cantankerous David Letterman.

1611
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,680
Watching him, so he comes out

1612
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:31,460
and is kind of that bemused mode,

1613
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:34,320
like, oh, oh, oh boy.

1614
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:37,900
And he makes this very odd lame joke.

1615
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:40,180
It's like a party at my mom's house

1616
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:44,680
and is kind of, and then gets surrounded by all the freaks.

1617
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:47,480
And that it's just priceless.

1618
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:48,560
It's wonderful.

1619
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:52,080
And then at the very, very end,

1620
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:54,560
the YouTube video cuts off in a wonderful way

1621
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,760
where with half a second to go,

1622
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,420
Electro lights up a flame

1623
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:00,700
and he's taking his mask off by that point.

1624
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:03,560
So he's just this enthusiastic dude, like, hey.

1625
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,540
And it's so wonderful.

1626
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,140
He barely gets it in there.

1627
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:09,860
A big open flame next to David Letterman.

1628
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:13,420
And what I think is that any other host,

1629
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:14,880
this is not as funny.

1630
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,320
Like that this is about performance being done

1631
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:21,960
in the, like in the home of the meanest man.

1632
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:23,540
Doesn't like anything.

1633
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:26,200
Does he, yeah, cause I feel like

1634
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,520
I don't remember what the verdict was on this.

1635
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:31,700
Usually does Letterman usually like the musical performances

1636
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:33,320
that were on their show or not?

1637
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:34,520
No, he was usually checked out.

1638
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:35,760
No way.

1639
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:39,600
He likes the Foo Fighters and he likes maybe like.

1640
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:40,560
Springsteen probably.

1641
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,500
Springsteen, like the Black Keys probably.

1642
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:43,160
I think he likes.

1643
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,120
Super chunk or New Pornographers would play,

1644
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:46,200
be like, hey, that's great.

1645
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,520
I think he might like some of that.

1646
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:48,380
But I think.

1647
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:49,780
Beastie Boys, I think.

1648
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,400
They seem to have fun with Letterman.

1649
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,540
He famously, I think is an old crank

1650
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:54,880
and doesn't like most things.

1651
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:55,260
Yeah.

1652
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:55,960
So yeah.

1653
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,640
That's the thing that today,

1654
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,800
this performance is done for Jimmy Fallon or James Corden.

1655
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,520
And they come out after and like, oh my God,

1656
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:05,880
that was fantastic.

1657
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:07,760
They're there, they love it.

1658
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:08,320
They eat it up.

1659
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:09,800
They like suck up.

1660
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:12,240
Like it's, it's the best thing I've ever seen.

1661
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:13,860
That's how it's done, baby.

1662
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:16,980
That kind of, and I, it's just, I miss so much.

1663
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:18,860
Smokers.

1664
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:19,260
Hooray.

1665
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:19,580
Yeah.

1666
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,280
Like if you're saying, give it at a hundred percent,

1667
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:24,200
they will give the reaction to it a hundred percent.

1668
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,200
The cast of Spider-Man, turn off the talk everybody.

1669
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,400
If you know, that's my Jimmy Fallon impression.

1670
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:29,440
I always do everything.

1671
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:30,840
He always says, everybody.

1672
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,200
Yeah, he does that weird.

1673
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,160
It's apparently bothers no one but me.

1674
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:34,060
In fact, no, I know what you're saying.

1675
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1676
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:35,680
Yeah.

1677
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:39,000
The only, the only funnier version of this

1678
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,820
would be if they were doing this exact,

1679
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:42,660
the performance on Ed Sullivan.

1680
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,240
Now, ladies and gentlemen.

1681
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,140
And like, he had to kind of like walk around

1682
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:49,060
and just like not know what to make of it.

1683
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,200
And like, he wouldn't be able to sell that.

1684
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,700
He was never an excitable man.

1685
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,940
So like that would be an equivalent, but yeah,

1686
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:59,020
no newer host would like show you what he felt.

1687
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:00,020
Yeah.

1688
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,840
Would immediately sell out the piece.

1689
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:05,960
And I've got one more little thing,

1690
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:08,380
which is that as you said, Jason, this,

1691
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:09,980
there was previously a Spider-Man turn off

1692
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:13,280
the dark performance and that was the star Reeve Carney

1693
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,460
performing the big ballad Rise Above.

1694
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:18,100
And that's my absolute favorite part of the book,

1695
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:18,840
Song of Spider-Man.

1696
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:20,300
That I think is the most,

1697
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,120
listening to a handful of songs from the musical,

1698
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:27,200
that seems the most Broadway-y of the songs, I think.

1699
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:29,780
Sure, yeah, it's the big soaring moving.

1700
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:31,840
Actually, I was wrong.

1701
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:37,000
The singer is T.V. Carpio who plays Arachne.

1702
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,560
And this gives you a,

1703
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,300
if you're interested in reading Song of Spider-Man,

1704
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,400
this is a real like window into the tone of the book.

1705
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:45,840
But this is like, he's at,

1706
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:49,040
the writer is absolutely at wit's end.

1707
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:51,340
He owes incredible changes,

1708
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:54,460
like massive overhauls of this play that's falling apart

1709
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:55,860
and hurting people.

1710
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,980
And right at that very moment, he's alone.

1711
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,700
He's removed from his family.

1712
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:01,260
They literally live somewhere else.

1713
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:03,400
He hasn't seen his child in months

1714
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:06,500
because he's putting together a freak like me needs company.

1715
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,540
And he's, so he's like, he's alone

1716
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:10,540
in his New York apartment.

1717
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,800
It's cold, he's shivering, and he turns on the T.V.

1718
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:14,240
And his very work,

1719
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,840
Spider-Man, Turn Off the Dark, comes on.

1720
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:16,940
And the lyrics,

1721
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,860
your strength will be a vision beyond visibility.

1722
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:22,760
And the, sorry, the lyrics,

1723
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,320
your strength will be a vision beyond visibility.

1724
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:28,200
And the gift I've woven for you will give you new eyes

1725
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:32,260
to see that you can rise above yourself then.

1726
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:36,960
And I let out a scream, loud, ragged, and long,

1727
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,640
until the walls echoed and my throat hurt.

1728
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:41,380
I felt like throwing up.

1729
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,720
I felt like slamming my hand against a wall

1730
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:45,360
until I had shattered some bones.

1731
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:47,020
But I didn't.

1732
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:48,740
I made myself some coffee.

1733
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:54,400
The most, and I, what I love about that is that for all,

1734
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,960
this is a man having a melt, he's abandoned his family.

1735
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,560
He's having an absolute meltdown alone.

1736
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,880
Just all like curled up in the ball of the floor.

1737
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:06,400
And a woman on T.V. dressed as a spider lady is singing,

1738
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,420
you've got to rise above.

1739
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:10,660
And he goes, ah!

1740
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,460
He's like screaming.

1741
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:16,280
He's having a meltdown like from a movie to himself,

1742
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,220
from a fucking Spider-Man performance of a theme,

1743
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,320
it's a theme park show.

1744
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,580
This is so rich.

1745
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:25,180
These are adults acting like this and doing this.

1746
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:26,980
And then he made himself a cup of coffee.

1747
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:32,360
And then he tossed in like Vanity Fair celebrity profile,

1748
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:35,300
first paragraph details of like,

1749
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:39,640
Anna Kendrick walked into LaMille and ordered her latte.

1750
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,920
And it's like, we don't, these profile,

1751
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,160
like stop telling us what everyone's ordered.

1752
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,300
Actually, I kind of know what, I like to know.

1753
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:48,360
How else do you get to know a character?

1754
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:50,220
You learn how they drink their coffee,

1755
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:52,300
what they order for breakfast, how they shave.

1756
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:55,240
They exchange money for goods and services just like me.

1757
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:58,460
It's a regular, it's an average temperature day

1758
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:05,140
in Los Angeles and Mia Cabrera is sipping on a cup of water.

1759
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:08,300
To soothe her voice apparently from a big performance

1760
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:09,100
the night before.

1761
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:10,120
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

1762
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:10,900
What are these?

1763
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:13,340
Why do articles need to pad out with this crap?

1764
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,620
Steve Bannon ordered another cup of slop

1765
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:20,700
as he walked into the garbage dump that he called a home.

1766
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,620
Directly with his mouth.

1767
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:22,980
Yeah.

1768
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,860
Every item made of corrugated iron that had rusted.

1769
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:30,300
He had a 10 gallon drum of bleach to pour into a hot tub.

1770
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:34,100
But nothing would clean him of his sins.

1771
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,080
Oh, there he is, the green goblin.

1772
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,780
We've got a perfect final frame.

1773
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,360
His wonderful smile.

1774
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,620
I don't, I mean, it shows you how much,

1775
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:45,260
I think we've all been waiting probably for years

1776
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:48,480
to talk about this at length and there's so much there.

1777
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:49,300
And there's more.

1778
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:50,540
We'll get to more.

1779
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:51,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1780
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:52,180
I'm sure we'll do a sequel to it.

1781
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:52,740
We haven't.

1782
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:53,860
We'll do the whole Mr. Mephisto episode.

1783
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:56,300
Mike saw the whole show so we can do,

1784
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:58,880
we can go through, we can do an episode

1785
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,080
on both versions of the show

1786
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:04,040
because they were different after the rewrites.

1787
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:04,960
Oh yeah, we'll find.

1788
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,340
And after the previews closed.

1789
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:07,560
Yeah, yeah.

1790
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,740
So you've got YouTube homework to do

1791
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:13,520
if you have watched them talking about Halloween costumes.

1792
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:15,280
Watch everything you can get your hands on

1793
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,820
because this thing, what I, I mean,

1794
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:19,280
I guess it all sounds like shit talk or something,

1795
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:22,420
but truly this thing makes me so happy.

1796
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,040
It's cheered me up.

1797
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:27,080
If I'm in a bad mood, I could put this on and I smile.

1798
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,420
I thank everyone involved for doing

1799
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:31,360
this wonderful piece of television.

1800
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:31,840
I agree.

1801
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,640
It's made me so happy for so many years.

1802
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:37,260
And I thank both of you for making me relook at this

1803
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:39,940
with a theme park lens where yes, it's perfect.

1804
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,380
With a Broadway lens or a comic book lens,

1805
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:45,240
it is a puzzle you will never be able to solve.

1806
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:47,720
But if you think, yeah, it's theme park entertainment.

1807
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:52,440
I'm in the world of a villain broke into the Letterman show.

1808
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:53,640
I do, I love it.

1809
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,840
I wish things like that happened all the time.

1810
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,440
Just, hey, thanks everybody.

1811
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,700
It's so great.

1812
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:03,480

Most of all, keep it freaky.
