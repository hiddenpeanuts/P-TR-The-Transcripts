1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog!

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Warning!

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:12,640
The following podcast contains late-night Woody Woodpecker business, very bad pillows,

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,440
and the citizens of Bluffington.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,800
Personal stylist and my new wife Jane Clare joins.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,800
It's me!

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,080
How did you get in here?

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,080
Shoo shoo!

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,080
Baby!

11
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,840
It's Doug Live on Podcast The Ride!

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,600
Well, don't you dare.

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,600
Let her do it.

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,600
Let her do it.

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,600
No!

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,200
If you want to do it so bad, then you get your joke out.

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,200
Okay.

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,440
There's your chance though, Jane.

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,440
Jump in.

20
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,880
Don't you dare.

21
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,880
Yeah, I like this.

22
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,880
I like this.

23
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,880
We're shaking it up.

24
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,880
This is good.

25
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,880
Yeah.

26
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
We're recording now.

27
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,880
This is part of it.

28
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,880
Yay!

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:16,120
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the show where we try to embody the nobility of the humble

30
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
quail.

31
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,720
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by Mike Carlson.

32
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,840
I'm here and I'm feeling humble, I guess.

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,840
Humble and noble.

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,840
And Scott Caron.

35
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,040
I know, I try to stress the noble side more than the humility, with a lot of facets to

36
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,040
cover.

37
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,640
There's a lot of nobility in what we do, and that's something we really need to dwell

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,640
upon more.

39
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,640
Yeah.

40
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,640
Look in each other's eyes.

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,840
We're essential workers in the media, as we learned a few years ago.

42
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,840
That's true.

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,680
That was a good, I'm like, what from the world of Doug can a joke be pulled out?

44
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,600
And that was a very surprising one.

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
Yeah.

46
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,600
Yeah.

47
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,600
Excellent work.

48
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Thank you.

49
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,360
All right.

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,520
You didn't quite slip it in there without your, as you said right before I started recording,

51
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,520
blushing bride.

52
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,080
My beautiful blushing bride.

53
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,080
Let me bring her in.

54
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:09,440
How often have you said that out loud since it happened?

55
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,640
I said it now because I knew it would make her smile.

56
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,600
My new wife, my love, Jane Clare is here.

57
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Hello.

58
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Hi.

59
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Hi.

60
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Welcome back, Jane.

61
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Hello.

62
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Congratulations.

63
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,600
No, obviously we've seen you, but we haven't seen you where it counts, on the air.

64
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,600
So here now with people listening, congratulations on your recent wedding.

65
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Thank you so much.

66
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
You have said blushing bride a few times, in a cute way.

67
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Oh, thank you.

68
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,600
You have.

69
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
It's cute.

70
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
I like it.

71
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,840
Also, I want to say, when he called me the ball and chain, I thought it was so funny.

72
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,600
We say that all the time, the old ball and chain.

73
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,600
It's fun.

74
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
I didn't take it personally.

75
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Oh, I figured.

76
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,600
No, no.

77
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
It's a thing.

78
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,960
I forget what episode that occurred in, but I just thought it was funny to hear that phrase

79
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:04,600
after a long ... He's really milking it about your styling and your ... I think we were

80
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,220
too offensive to the computer program, where you pick Minnie Mouse's dresses, and Jason

81
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,960
needed to inform us that styling is actually complicated in art.

82
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,960
Very complex career.

83
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,600
That Minnie Mouse computer, I think, really disrespected it and kind of infantilized it

84
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
in a way.

85
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
I'm glad these things were corrected.

86
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
That's true, yeah.

87
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Look, Jason likes the old-time language, too.

88
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
That's true.

89
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Were you a fan of the old-time language before getting together with Jason?

90
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
No.

91
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Pretty quick, no.

92
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
He's talking so much about the 1920s.

93
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
I like it.

94
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,600
It's always so funny when he says something sincerely, and he uses a phrase.

95
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,600
I have to go, could you explain that, actually?

96
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,600
I'm trying to stay sincere, but I don't actually know what that means.

97
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Do we have a good one?

98
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Let's put you on the spot.

99
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,600
The other day, I said something about radio silence, which is a common phrase.

100
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,600
That's not really what I would consider.

101
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,600
No, but I was talking about the origins of, like, you never want silence on the radio.

102
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Is that what radio silence is?

103
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,600
But that's not what I would ... worse for where?

104
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,600
I don't even know.

105
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,600
He says worse for where a lot, but that one I kind of know now.

106
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Like, Gone Mole, he'll say.

107
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Oh, yeah, that was unfamiliar to me.

108
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Well, you just hear mole, and you think shopping mole.

109
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Whenever it was first said, I did not have gun mole at the ready as the primary use of mole.

110
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
I actually am not aware of what that is.

111
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
This is what you are to him now.

112
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
You're his gun mole, right?

113
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Like a gangster's girl.

114
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Like a monster's girl.

115
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Jason is a gangster, and you're his girl.

116
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Big jacket, leopard print.

117
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Fur.

118
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Yeah, a big mink stole.

119
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
A lot of red lips.

120
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
What anniversary is the mink stole anniversary?

121
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
I don't know.

122
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
What is Jane Getter mink stole?

123
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
He's going to forget anyway.

124
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Jason's the squirrely gangster, apparently.

125
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Hey, what are you doing?

126
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
He's the distraction.

127
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,600
How often are you listening to Podcast the Riot, and you hear him say something that younger people say,

128
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,600
and you feel like you're responsible for his knowledge of modern slang?

129
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Once in a while?

130
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
I love you guys so dearly, but I do not listen to every episode.

131
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
We're not asking that.

132
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
We're not requiring that.

133
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
We're just saying if you listen, ever.

134
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,600
You've said a few things where I'm like, oh, that's funny.

135
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
We were talking about that the other day.

136
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
I don't know.

137
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,600
I can't think of anything off the top of my head, but yes, that has happened before.

138
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,600
It's just a strange blend that we have with your husband here,

139
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:46,600
where it's a high degree of knowledge of slang from 2025 or from 1925.

140
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,600
You just don't see this blend, I think, very often in people.

141
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,600
I can only assume that the 2025 comes from you.

142
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
Thank you so much.

143
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,600
And yes, I think that is an accurate statement.

144
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Thanks for bringing him to Modern Times.

145
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,600
You're welcome.

146
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Also, have you been...

147
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
I don't know how I feel about him in Modern Times, honestly.

148
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,600
I don't care for it.

149
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
I prefer he didn't know anything.

150
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,600
I think you've really stoked the fire of Jason being a man out of time.

151
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
I think that's kind of the...

152
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,600
That's the brand that I've tried to cultivate for him.

153
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,600
Sure, and I've cultivated by just existing.

154
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
That's right.

155
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,600
With a myriad of obscure interests.

156
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Certain companies have more than one brand.

157
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,600
That's okay. Hot Topic is Hot Topic, but also Box Lunch.

158
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,600
So Jason is now Hot Topic and Box Lunch.

159
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
That's actually a really good analogy.

160
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Hot Topic definitely is from the early 1900s.

161
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Right, right.

162
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Box Lunch is really modern.

163
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Really old-timey.

164
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,600
If you're going department store, he's Hot Topic and he's Gimbals.

165
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,600
He's some out-of-date brand.

166
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
I only know that from the movie Elf.

167
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Is it an Elf? Really?

168
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,600
Because it's like a Macy's equivalent.

169
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,600
I don't know the context in Elf, admittedly.

170
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
I know just from Simpsons jokes.

171
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,600
He gets a job there and he overhauls their Christmas section one night.

172
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
They're like, did corporate come in and do this?

173
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
And he's like, I did it all overnight.

174
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Anyway, that's how I know Gimbals.

175
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:23,600
It seems like you might grab Gimbals catalogs from eBay or something.

176
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
I know.

177
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
I have a good one.

178
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,600
So the other day we were leaving the house and he went, oh, we have a package.

179
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,600
He goes, oh, that must be my history of Kmart book by blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

180
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
And I went, God, I love you so much.

181
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
But I was like, you little weirdo.

182
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,600
I bought a book about the rise and fall of Kmart.

183
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
And I was like, all right.

184
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
All right, babe.

185
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,600
Local historian who lives in the Midwest and I was reading,

186
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,600
if you're aware, I found him on Blue Sky or Twitter or what.

187
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,600
And I was like, oh, that book sounds very interesting.

188
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:05,600
I'm fascinated by like the rise and fall of like the big box store, department store.

189
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,600
We've barely even scratched the surface of like the ones I grew up with.

190
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,600
James Way, Clover, Bradley's, Kaldor.

191
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,600
We have not.

192
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,600
We've got to handle each of these as their own thing.

193
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
How often does Jason bring up Clover, Bradley's?

194
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
No, no, comma, comma.

195
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
There's commas in there.

196
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Clover was what?

197
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,600
Did you think it was Clover, Bradley's?

198
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
Yes, that's exactly what I thought.

199
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
I was about to Google Clover, Bradley's.

200
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
I'm not quite familiar, to be honest with you.

201
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
I don't really know about these.

202
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
This does not open the door.

203
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
No, I'm just kidding.

204
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Oh, OK.

205
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Oh, what is that phrase?

206
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
What?

207
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
This does not open the door to a new conversation.

208
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Discussing.

209
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Do you know what that was?

210
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
No, I just see it.

211
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Open the door?

212
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Are you guys serious right now?

213
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
That's pretty common.

214
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
I mean, I understand with context, but I've never heard it sort of said like that.

215
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Open the door to, oh, really?

216
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Wait, this is a valuable thing.

217
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,600
So I could say, Mike, this does not open the door to future puppet discussion.

218
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
This is a very valuable phrase for me.

219
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
All right, I'm going to keep this right at the forefront.

220
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,600
This is the weapon I've needed on this show for a long time.

221
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Forgive me.

222
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,600
Isn't that sort of a passive aggressive statement?

223
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
I don't care.

224
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
It can be aggressive aggressive.

225
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
I need it.

226
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
I'm using it.

227
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,600
I need doors to close on puppet talk and a myriad of other things on this show.

228
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Closing the door on any further 311 discussion.

229
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
I would love that.

230
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
I don't like that this even came up.

231
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,600
311 currently isn't a major runner on the show.

232
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
But after any episode, it could be.

233
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
What is 311?

234
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
311's the soul of the 90s.

235
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
From the 90s, yeah.

236
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
I don't know.

237
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Sorry.

238
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Come original, down.

239
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
You know, they had a.

240
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
All right, Mike, we're closing that door.

241
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
We have a lot to get to.

242
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Oh, I love it.

243
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
This has been a valuable door.

244
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Opening the door, closing a door.

245
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,600
But opening the door to Clover at New Jersey and Delaware, a discount chain.

246
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
No, you're right.

247
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
No, go ahead.

248
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Let's open the door.

249
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Mike, say what you're going to say.

250
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Go through the door.

251
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
I don't want to.

252
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Go through the door.

253
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
You reopen the door.

254
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
No, I don't want to reopen the door.

255
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
All right, fine.

256
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Do you want to talk about Clover or what was the other one?

257
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Bradley's.

258
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Bradley's.

259
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
James Way.

260
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Or James Way.

261
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Or does this all go against James Way, which I assume would be talking about your wedding?

262
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Yes.

263
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,600
I mean, that's what we were, you know, the episode called Doug Live.

264
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,600
And we will talk about Doug Live, a very important theme park show.

265
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Hold your horses, Doug Live heads.

266
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Don't, like, cool it.

267
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
These people got married, all right?

268
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
This needs to be discussed.

269
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Yes.

270
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Relax, Skeeter heads.

271
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,600
My first question is, is this behind a paywall?

272
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
No, this is made feet.

273
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Okay.

274
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Would you like it?

275
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
We can move it.

276
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
What do you want?

277
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Obviously, I want made feed.

278
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
I love attention.

279
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
And I'd love for you guys to follow me.

280
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
I'd love for you guys to comment.

281
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
We're getting plugs now.

282
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600
I need the serotonin.

283
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,600
So, like, please like my shit.

284
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,600
I'll just say probably less since it's not behind a paywall.

285
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Not less, but less.

286
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Oh, no.

287
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
What were you going to say?

288
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
What were you going to get, like, out there?

289
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Like, what are you going to?

290
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,600
I get very personal very easily, and sometimes I share too much.

291
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
But we can edit, you know.

292
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Okay, that's true.

293
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Okay.

294
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Tell us.

295
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Don't hold back.

296
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
We're in the room.

297
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
We want to hear it.

298
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
You can ask later.

299
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
There's a few more people on the main feed.

300
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
Okay.

301
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
Hello, everyone.

302
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
It's a massive difference.

303
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Thank you for listening.

304
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
That's not so crazy.

305
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
All right.

306
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Well, where do you want to start?

307
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Well, let's talk about the wedding.

308
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
Where do you want to start?

309
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,600
I guess it goes back to the fall.

310
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,600
So, in the fall, we took a trip to Jason's parents.

311
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,600
We were at his mom and stepdad's house.

312
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,600
And we both were having a little, like, edible fun.

313
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,600
And we were like, should we get married?

314
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Well, I was going back even further, because we were having coffee outside.

315
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
We're going to be here forever.

316
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
It's an idea.

317
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
This was such a wild idea to get married.

318
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Only drugs could have inspired it.

319
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
No, no, no.

320
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,600
We were having coffee outside with my mom, and she said something offhand about marriage.

321
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Oh, she's like, sorry.

322
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
I don't want to mention marriage.

323
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,600
She's like, sorry, sorry.

324
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,600
I don't want to put any pressure.

325
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,600
And we were like, no, we've been talking about it.

326
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Like, you don't have to say it like it's like a...

327
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Verboten.

328
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Well, wait.

329
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
If you've been talking about it, then you've got to go back even further.

330
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Oh, God.

331
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
What did you start talking about?

332
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
We've got to go back to the very beginning.

333
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Look, I love my wedding, but I really love Doug Live.

334
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Okay.

335
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,600
When it's up to you, then you have to, I think, personally scale it.

336
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
That's, I think.

337
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Because we could talk about so many steps.

338
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Okay, yeah.

339
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,600
So we kind of came up in conversation that night when we were getting ready for bed.

340
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
We were like, should we get married?

341
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,600
And he was like, yeah.

342
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
And I was like, should we try to do it on our six-year anniversary?

343
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
And he was like, yeah.

344
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,600
And I was like, when we get back, do you want to go get rings?

345
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
And he was like, yeah.

346
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,600
So the week we got back, because I had already picked out a ring because I went with my friend

347
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
Alexis.

348
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Shout out, Alexis.

349
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,600
She's getting married in August.

350
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Now, when did it start for her?

351
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
When was the first Alexis started talking?

352
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,600
Well, this is good.

353
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
I've got to close the door on this.

354
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Close the door.

355
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Close the door.

356
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Yeah, we're going to close that door.

357
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Love her.

358
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
All right.

359
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
I had already found a ring I like.

360
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
And I was like, hey, I know the ring I like.

361
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
And we kind of had an idea for his.

362
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,600
And we just went and picked out rings and had them sent out for resizing.

363
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
And then we were like, OK.

364
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
We always kind of wanted to do a courthouse thing.

365
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,600
I have never really dreamt of having a big wedding.

366
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,600
I think it's just a very personal thing.

367
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
I don't have a ton of family.

368
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
No one lives out here.

369
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,600
And truthfully, I don't like enough people to pay for them to come to an event.

370
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,600
I'm not trying to pay thousands of dollars.

371
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
I keep my circle tight.

372
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
I have five really close friends.

373
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,600
And it's just like, I'm not trying to do all that.

374
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
You need to know this about yourself.

375
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,600
So five would be the cap if you were going to.

376
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
I mean, the cap became zero.

377
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
Well, it became one.

378
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
It became one.

379
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,600
It became one former podcast guest.

380
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
A photographer and former podcast guest.

381
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,600
And then he was our witness.

382
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Let me be clear, Andrew.

383
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
You're never coming back.

384
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
You're a former guest.

385
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
One and done.

386
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
One and done.

387
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
Doors shut, Andrew.

388
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,600
I just meant he had been on it before.

389
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Friend of the show.

390
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,600
If we're going to examine language ticks, we're going to be here all day.

391
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
We have been doing that.

392
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
We are.

393
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,600
We've been doing that for eight years now.

394
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Anyway, as you were saying, darling.

395
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Thanks.

396
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,600
So he was also our witness because then we saved $20.

397
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
If you don't have a witness.

398
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
Oh, I see.

399
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
I see the scheme here.

400
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
No, no, no.

401
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
No, it was sweet.

402
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
It was really sweet.

403
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
I feel like we're both friends with him now.

404
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,600
You've known him longer, but he came my birthday and we both knew him, so it felt appropriate.

405
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,600
I say he came my birthday because again, I keep things tight.

406
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,600
I don't invite a lot of people.

407
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:56,600
The jewelry store also told us when we were figuring out the rings, I was like, all right,

408
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,600
are there sales going on right now?

409
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,600
I love that this happened.

410
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,600
Oh, me too.

411
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
She said it.

412
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
She said it too.

413
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,600
We both asked about it and they were very cool.

414
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,600
She went like, well, not right now, but starting this weekend.

415
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,600
Like she's like, if you can come back in a few days.

416
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
It was like 30% off or something.

417
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Yeah, it was hundreds if not thousands of dollars in savings.

418
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,600
So I was like, yeah, of course I don't mind waiting a few days.

419
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
That seems very silly.

420
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Sure.

421
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
Yeah.

422
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,600
Great.

423
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
So we got that.

424
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
It was pretty cool.

425
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,600
And then some stuff happened.

426
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:41,600
Some not so fun stuff and things kind of not got pushed off, but we were kind of working

427
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
through some stuff.

428
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,600
And then eventually I was like, okay, let's figure this out because you have to first

429
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,600
get a marriage license, which is its own appointment.

430
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,600
And only certain courts in LA are eligible for these kind of things.

431
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,600
So we really wanted to get married at the Burbank courthouse, but it's not one that

432
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
you can get married at.

433
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,600
We ended up going with Beverly Hills because I think Van Nuys was technically the closest,

434
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,600
but for pictures, it's not really like as pretty over there.

435
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,600
And Beverly Hills was like maybe five minutes farther away.

436
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,600
And I know Beverly Hills a decent amount just from work.

437
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
And I knew kind of where that courthouse was.

438
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
And I was like, I think this could be really pretty.

439
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,600
Let's go get our license there and check it out.

440
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,600
And so we did that.

441
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,600
And then when we got there, you schedule the wedding, but they only do it a few days a

442
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,600
week.

443
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
So we kind of looked out.

444
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,600
Originally we were going to do, is it March?

445
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
March 14th.

446
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Oh my God.

447
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
I was about to say six.

448
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
That's not our anniversary.

449
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,600
It's not our anniversary.

450
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
March 14th.

451
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
What a puff.

452
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,600
What a foul it could have been.

453
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
Oh boy.

454
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
Jason's in good graces now.

455
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Say blushing bride again.

456
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Lay it on thick.

457
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
You just wait.

458
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
The episode is done.

459
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
You're doing great, blushing bride.

460
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
I wanted to get married on a Friday.

461
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
I don't know why.

462
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
I just really liked that.

463
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,600
And the 28th was available and two and eight are my numbers also.

464
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,600
So it just felt right.

465
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
And they were like 10 45 a.m.

466
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,600
And I was like, sure.

467
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Sure.

468
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
Why not?

469
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
It's a 15 minute slot.

470
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,600
The perfect time for love.

471
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
Traditionally.

472
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
You can look that up.

473
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,600
You could look that up in books.

474
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:20,600
And it is very fun the day they do all these ceremonies like back to back to back.

475
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Because all the brides and grooms are coming in and out.

476
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
You're seeing each other.

477
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,600
Everyone's waving and cheering each other on.

478
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
You see the Star Trek ones.

479
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,600
You see the old timey western ones.

480
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,600
Are these all the themes going on?

481
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,600
I mean I guess that's more Vegas probably.

482
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,600
I think you're allowed to do whatever you want.

483
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
I mean you have to go through a metal detector.

484
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,600
So it's probably best not to have even prop weapons.

485
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,600
A Klingon war blade?

486
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Yeah.

487
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,600
You're something blue.

488
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Can't be a blue pistol.

489
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
OK.

490
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Yeah.

491
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Yeah.

492
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
It can't be a detective special.

493
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,600
It can't be 38 blue steel detective special.

494
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,600
This is a problem for mobsters in their gun malls.

495
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
You cannot get married in a cordless.

496
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,600
You probably wouldn't want to get married in a cordless if you're a mobster or a gun

497
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
mall.

498
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Do you wait in an area with everybody after the metal detectors?

499
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:18,600
You go up to it's all on a certain floor and there is like some hallways and there's a

500
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
big patio.

501
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,600
That's the other thing.

502
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:27,600
If you're looking for great views of the city there is this beautiful balcony patio at

503
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
the Beverly Hills.

504
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:34,600
I'm trying to figure out like layout wise how it appeals like you know compares to city

505
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
walk or a theme park.

506
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Quite small.

507
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,600
It's on the fourth floor and it's the whole floor is dedicated to weddings but it's not

508
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
huge.

509
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,600
You basically get out of the elevator and it's just one hallway to the left and there's

510
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,600
the office two restrooms and the chapel.

511
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,600
We're going to be able to rob this place by the time we're done.

512
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
We're going to know the exact blueprint layout.

513
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
That's right.

514
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,600
I don't know that there's anything there.

515
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,600
There's pens.

516
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
I want the pens.

517
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
I'm taking the pens.

518
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
You could.

519
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Everybody shut up.

520
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
No I'm just kidding.

521
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
I'm sorry.

522
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
You're the blushing bride.

523
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Fine.

524
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,600
You can tell us to shut up.

525
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Thank you.

526
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Thank you so much.

527
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,600
No there are props in the room you get married.

528
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,600
It's like a photo booth.

529
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
Essentially yes.

530
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,600
So the room you get married in is not like a typical courthouse room.

531
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Like I thought it would just be like that.

532
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,600
No.

533
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:37,600
This is just a regular ass room but one of the walls is painted like neon yellow and

534
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,600
it says love is love really big and then one wall says like and they lived happily ever

535
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
after with like stickers.

536
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Wow it's like Disney.

537
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:52,600
And then another wall just has this big like heart picture and then in the corner there's

538
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:58,600
a fake wedding cake and champagne flutes.

539
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:05,600
So and then there's like green wall like green those um leafy green what do you like

540
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
grass?

541
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Like influencer walls.

542
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,600
Yeah like flowers.

543
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,600
Not quite a step and repeat.

544
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,600
And fluorescent lights.

545
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,600
So I will not be using any of those pictures because it looks awful.

546
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,200
Famously beautiful lighting.

547
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,600
No it looked so bad.

548
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,600
But the uh she wanted to judge what was her title?

549
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,600
She had a very complicated like superior woman.

550
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,600
You're going to need to produce it on the podcast or the wedding is not legal.

551
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,600
I couldn't I asked her like multiple times because I just assumed the title would be

552
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,600
judged but it's like.

553
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
You asked her multiple times.

554
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
I asked her.

555
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Once again ma'am what is your title?

556
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
Is this binding or not?

557
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Because I wanted to know because I was interested but she was very funny.

558
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
I loved her.

559
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,600
I thought like I really exaggerate because I was like we're going to walk in here.

560
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,600
An old white guy that I probably don't like because I just don't like men in general.

561
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
But I was like give me some old white guys.

562
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,600
I'm sorry I'm sorry for the room you find yourself in there.

563
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
That's okay.

564
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,600
I have some except.

565
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,600
We're actually we're kind of boys that never grew up on it.

566
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,600
Kind of.

567
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
We're not old.

568
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
Don't you dare include me in that.

569
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
Peter Pan.

570
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
The last thing I want to be part of.

571
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,600
But no I was so I walked in and it was an older woman of color and I was like this is the

572
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,600
exact opposite of what I thought I'd be and I'm so happy.

573
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
She was really really sweet.

574
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,600
When we were doing our vows we kind of just did them off the dome.

575
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,600
I was like if I write something that's not really how I roll I'd rather just say some nice things.

576
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,600
And we do have Grissom took a cute little video of it.

577
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,600
I feel like I should play a little audio of the vows or something.

578
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
Like they're really sweet.

579
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,600
Oh.

580
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
But is that too personal for you?

581
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,600
No but do you have the time code?

582
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,600
Yeah because remember we sent it to my mom and sister.

583
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
They edited clips.

584
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,600
Meaning back from the microphone.

585
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,600
Well we don't we don't need to do it but essentially.

586
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
You can send it to Mike and he can cut it in.

587
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
OK.

588
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
That's true.

589
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Yeah you can give Mike work to do.

590
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,600
No it's just really it's really really sweet.

591
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,600
And I started crying a little bit and she like gave me a tissue and like it was just really really sweet.

592
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Did Jason compare you to did he say that you have the proud nobility of the quail?

593
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
I fucking wish.

594
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,600
That would have been awesome.

595
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,600
That's why when you're going off the dome you're not going to get a phrase like that.

596
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:26,600
She told me weeks before like OK you don't have to write long vows or anything.

597
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,600
But no bits please.

598
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,600
I was like our wedding is a zero bit.

599
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Don't make this a bit.

600
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:39,600
Well and then you texted all of us including Erin and Lindsay and all of our responses included jokes and bits and you got mad at us for doing.

601
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
I did. I said y'all can't take nothing serious can you.

602
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,600
And you guys were like no and I was like man I hate this.

603
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Lindsay herself said no.

604
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:55,600
But Erin sent a lovely photo of a Mickey and Minnie standing next to each other with giant dilated pupils.

605
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,600
I thought that was a lovely wedding sentiment.

606
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Yeah.

607
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
No you guys were really funny.

608
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:06,600
You guys are so funny.

609
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,600
We're cooking now.

610
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,600
The bride's blushing now.

611
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,600
I love you baby.

612
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,600
You said that as if you were about to jump off a roof.

613
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
The ship was going down.

614
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
Love you baby.

615
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
You never know really.

616
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
You never know.

617
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,600
You never know.

618
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,600
So yeah I said no bits please don't make our wedding bit.

619
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,600
We had one tiny bit in the pictures with the emergency exit that you really wanted to have.

620
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Yeah.

621
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,600
I made one gentle joke in the vows but it was tasteful.

622
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
It wasn't a bit.

623
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,600
Bit crosses the line.

624
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
Bit crosses the line.

625
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,600
Does bit to you mean just like now a little voice is being effected.

626
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,600
And now listen missy is that the.

627
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,600
What are you avoiding with bits.

628
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:02,600
I was yeah I mean I was going to get introduced by a simple southern lawyer and then turn around and then turn back.

629
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
You're going to have a Matlock performance.

630
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,600
I now present this man to this here woman.

631
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,600
Ladies and gentlemen of the wedding witnesses.

632
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,600
It might have been nice.

633
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,600
Yeah I did not do that.

634
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
No the vows were really really sweet.

635
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,600
Like genuinely I'm so glad I saw him pull out his camera and I was like oh I'm really glad he did this because it was really really sweet.

636
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
They were just quick.

637
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,600
Yeah.

638
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
That's nice.

639
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
It was really nice.

640
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,600
And we'll get the file over and Mike get cracking on Mike.

641
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,600
I'll do it.

642
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
I literally have the clip.

643
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,600
I'm going to send it to my mom and sister.

644
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,600
All right y'all little boys talk amongst yourself do your little do your little skits.

645
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Give me a sec.

646
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:52,600
I do have a funny story which was two days before I ordered a suit online and that week I took it to Milton E.D.'s to get tailored and we went to pick it up.

647
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:59,600
And who is the first person I see in the dry cleaners is Derek Waters.

648
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
Former guest.

649
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
Oh yeah.

650
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,600
Yeah.

651
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:08,600
Former guest Derek Waters and I was like oh we're getting married.

652
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:14,600
You know he was very excited for us and he goes are you doing it at Disneyland or Epcot.

653
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,600
So got my ass.

654
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,600
Fair question certainly.

655
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,600
It's a shame none of us did you know.

656
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
Add that out of the three.

657
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,600
You know because really you could doing a quick thing.

658
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:38,600
You could get someone that's ordained kind of secretly not even secretly do it at Epcot in a very nonchalant way that wouldn't draw attention and you wouldn't have to pay like the thousands upon thousands of dollars that a ceremony would cost.

659
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,600
There's a way to do it discreetly like dumping ashes at Disney World.

660
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:47,600
You can do whatever you need in your life at Disney as long as you do it discreetly.

661
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,600
Where would you Epcot specifically.

662
00:25:51,600 --> 00:26:06,600
Where in Epcot would you want to get covertly married during whispered during American Adventure while I watch Mark Twain and Ben Franklin shake hands because that's a good answer.

663
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,600
It's a bonding forever just like those men are bonded in the history of this great nation.

664
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,600
Okay great answer.

665
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:20,600
My answer is after Sugar Ray is done performing every morning at the Garden Rocks stage in front of the American Pavilion.

666
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,600
Do a quick thing where somebody the ordained person just does the ceremony real quick.

667
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:30,600
I thought you were going to say having Peter Noon say hey something's on fire over there.

668
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Well that would be a second.

669
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,600
Burning passion of love.

670
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,600
Yeah.

671
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,600
Hey those two are getting married.

672
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,600
Back to singing Mrs. Brown.

673
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,600
But then you get caught you don't want him to see that.

674
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,600
I want Peter Noon to see it.

675
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
You don't want Peter Noon ratting you out.

676
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
Yeah he's a rat.

677
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,600
You're right.

678
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,600
I don't trust him.

679
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
I found it.

680
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Okay.

681
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,600
It's probably a minute or two so I can not play the whole thing or I can and you can edit it.

682
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,600
I mean two minutes off of a phone does seem like a tough idea.

683
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,600
Whatever if the audios I mean it's up to you.

684
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
I'm going to play all of it.

685
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
Sure.

686
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
Because I want you guys to hear it.

687
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
Sure.

688
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Because it's really really nice and then you can honestly edit all of it out if you want.

689
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,600
Oh I don't want to cry.

690
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,600
I just want to say it's such an honor to be your partner and I'm so happy to officially

691
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:18,600
become your wife and be my husband and you're so strong and I look up to you so much and

692
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,600
I just think that you're so great and I'm so lucky.

693
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,600
I love you so much.

694
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,600
I don't want to cry.

695
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,600
I love you.

696
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,600
Jane I love you so much.

697
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:37,600
I said from the very beginning from our very first date that I could tell you a very good

698
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:47,600
heart and like any relationship we've certainly had our ups and downs, our prosperity and

699
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:57,600
our adversity but we stuck it out and I just love you so much and I'm so proud of you and

700
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:04,600
I can safely say this was the most positive online dating experience I've ever had.

701
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,600
That's a bit, he did a bit, he got a joke in there.

702
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,600
It was a joke not a bit.

703
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,600
That's good that he got, he was still himself.

704
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,600
That was a tasteful joke that everyone liked.

705
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,600
That was nice.

706
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,600
That was very sweet.

707
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,600
That felt like scolding us for what we were imagining.

708
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,600
Not like I wanted what you guys would do, your skits.

709
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,600
I knew she would like it and that was the most important thing.

710
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,600
Well that was very nice.

711
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,600
That was very nice.

712
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,600
Thanks for playing.

713
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,600
No I couldn't get through, we did a little thing in the living room when we got married

714
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600
and I couldn't get through it.

715
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,600
Lindsay was rock solid.

716
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
I couldn't do it.

717
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
You were crying?

718
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
Yes.

719
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
A little emotional baby.

720
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,600
I'm very emotional.

721
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
No one knows.

722
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,600
I'm not.

723
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,600
This stern.

724
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,600
Shut the door Mike.

725
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,600
This facade of Mr. Tough Guy.

726
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,600
I don't want to hear it okay, toughen up.

727
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,600
Mr. High Tea over here is kind of emotional.

728
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
Is it related to my high tea?

729
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
I don't know.

730
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,600
We don't know.

731
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,600
It's related to how much blood you lose with constant checks of tea.

732
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,600
That's right, it's possible.

733
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
Check me again Doc.

734
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,600
I'm anemic as well as having high tea.

735
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,600
Are you anemic for real?

736
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,600
No.

737
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,600
Oh okay.

738
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
No, no, no.

739
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,600
I just have normal tea.

740
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,600
It's normal, it's average.

741
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,600
It's not piping hot?

742
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,600
Well, when I'm spilling it, it is.

743
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,600
See, that's a current thing.

744
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,600
That's not that new.

745
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,600
That's an old phrase.

746
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,600
It's over ten years I think.

747
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,600
It's not like locked in.

748
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,600
Everyone's locked in these things and stuff.

749
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,600
I know locked in.

750
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
I know what that means.

751
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,600
I know LFG, but that's old.

752
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,600
These are old.

753
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,600
Yeah.

754
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,600
Your dress, you have not mentioned.

755
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
Oh.

756
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Your dress.

757
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,600
So I made my wedding dress and I was really happy with how it came out.

758
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,600
I originally was not going to make my dress, but I was ordering all of these kind of short

759
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:03,600
courthouse wedding dress vibes and they either were super cheap or fit me weird and I was

760
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
like, oh, I'm going to have to get this really altered.

761
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,600
I was like, I can probably alter this myself.

762
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,600
I was like, if I'm going to do all of that work, why don't I just see if I can make it?

763
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,600
I prefer not to use patterns.

764
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,600
I like to just go for it and do my own design and kind of build it on my body.

765
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:27,600
The first month I made a dress and it ended up falling apart, so I actually restarted

766
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,600
and with the dress that I finished with, I did it in one month.

767
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,600
So I was like, well, that was crazy.

768
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,600
But yeah, it ended up exactly how I wanted.

769
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,600
I was really, really happy with how both of us looked on the wedding.

770
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,600
I think it turned out great.

771
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,600
Yeah, you both look great.

772
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,600
Thank you.

773
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,600
Wonderful photos.

774
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,600
With that experience, would you recommend that if Mike or I were to renew our vows,

775
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,600
should we take a stab at making our own tuxes?

776
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,600
Absolutely, you should.

777
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,600
I said that jokingly.

778
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,600
You should.

779
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,600
I will speak for myself and say that's the worst idea.

780
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,600
I'd love to see what mess y'all came up with.

781
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,600
It'll be all patchy.

782
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,600
It'll be like an old hobo from the movies.

783
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,600
It's cute.

784
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,600
You can make patchwork work.

785
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
Yeah, maybe.

786
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,600
Maybe I will do it.

787
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,600
Maybe I will make a suit.

788
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,600
It seems fun in concept.

789
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
I don't think I have the time.

790
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Sewing is really fun.

791
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,600
I get very, quote unquote, locked in.

792
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,600
Jason will be like, I can't wait until you're done with this dress.

793
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,600
You can hang out with me again.

794
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,600
Because I would spend the entire day working on this dress.

795
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,600
That's one of those things where you have to have a lot of focus.

796
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,600
And I'm not always good with that.

797
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
I like to draw a lot.

798
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,600
But to be really good, you've got to have so much focus.

799
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
And it's bad.

800
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
My brain is bad at that.

801
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,600
Yeah, I mean, I'm not amazing at focus sometimes either.

802
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,600
But when it's something that I'm very passionate about,

803
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,600
it comes a little differently.

804
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,600
Sure.

805
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,600
You know what I mean?

806
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,600
So yeah, thank you for mentioning that.

807
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,600
I was very happy with that.

808
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,600
The night before, if you want to talk about this,

809
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,600
we stayed at the Beverly Hilton.

810
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,600
The historic Beverly Hilton.

811
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,600
Oh yeah, we have stories.

812
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
I forgot.

813
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
Are we going to get to Doug?

814
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
That was fun.

815
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,600
It's up to you.

816
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
Yeah, it's up to you.

817
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
The ball is in your court.

818
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,600
We can talk about the wedding,

819
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,600
and then maybe we'll take a quick break.

820
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,600
Yeah, I have to use this.

821
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
And then come back and talk about Doug.

822
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,600
Okay.

823
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,600
Let's get to fly through this,

824
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,600
because now I'm like, okay, let's get to Doug.

825
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600
Okay.

826
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,600
Not that I didn't love my wedding.

827
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,600
So we stayed there, and we were like, oh, this will be great.

828
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Kind of like a chill, fancy restaurant.

829
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,600
And we walk in, and there are just people everywhere.

830
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,600
And there's clearly an event going on.

831
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,600
And I'm already stressed out,

832
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,600
because I didn't start my Alexa Pro yet.

833
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,600
That's why I was like, do I talk about that?

834
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,600
Well, and I am just fried.

835
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
And he's just fried.

836
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
I'm just mentally fried a lot of times.

837
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,600
And so I'm stressing the hell out,

838
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,600
because there's people drinking and stuff

839
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,600
up at the front desk where I'm trying to get to

840
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
with him in the wheelchair.

841
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,600
And I'm like, no, we're actually checking in.

842
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,600
I got crazy.

843
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,600
Did you yell at people?

844
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,600
It was so loud.

845
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,600
It was literally so loud.

846
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,600
There were hundreds of people.

847
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,600
Well, because what was happening was the GLAAD awards

848
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,600
were going on that night.

849
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,600
And the Beverly Hilton also home every year

850
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,600
to the Golden Globes.

851
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
So they have a very large event thing.

852
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,600
There's a big party going on in the lobby.

853
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,600
But it wasn't really a party.

854
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,600
It was the line to get through security and red carpet.

855
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,600
So we also did see a few people were like,

856
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
oh, I know who that is.

857
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,600
But then when we went to the other side of the lobby,

858
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,600
where the lobby bar and gift shop were,

859
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,600
there was no one.

860
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,600
So is that where you hung out mostly?

861
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,600
For a little.

862
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,600
Yeah, we hung out a little.

863
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,600
We met a very nice bartender.

864
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,600
And he was talking to us about, we were all talking about baseball.

865
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,600
Yeah, Dodgers gave us a lot.

866
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
How long were you sort of stuck in a line?

867
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,600
How long were you stuck in the GLAAD awards?

868
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,600
As little time as possible.

869
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,600
I was like, we just got married.

870
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,600
Kind of like, wink, wink, do we get an upgrade?

871
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,600
And they're like, do you want an upgrade suite?

872
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
And I was like, yes, I do.

873
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
Elevators are over there.

874
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,600
I was like, zoop, I just want to get to the room.

875
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,600
OK.

876
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,600
There was an upgrade?

877
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,600
There was.

878
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,600
How did you do the upgrade?

879
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,600
Well, because we initially got a two bed,

880
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,600
because when we do hotels, we love our own bed.

881
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
Like, I just want my own bed.

882
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,600
And I was like, night before our wedding, I want my own bed.

883
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,600
And they're like, do you want this upgraded giant room

884
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
that's a king bed?

885
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,600
And I said, yes, I do.

886
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,600
Thank you so much.

887
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,600
And the balcony was like triple the size

888
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,600
of what we would have had.

889
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,600
And I was right over the port cachet,

890
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,600
if you know the Beverly Hilton layout at all.

891
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,600
So we were just kind of like right above that.

892
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,600
So that was fun.

893
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,600
And so that felt very special.

894
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,600
You know, they had like robes and slippers.

895
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,600
And like, it was just so luxurious.

896
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,600
Again, I had been there before for work,

897
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,600
but I've never stayed there.

898
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,600
So it was fun to be like, oh, I'm the special one.

899
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,600
Like, I get to stay here.

900
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,600
I'm not leaving with bags and garment bags of clothes.

901
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,600
Have you worked award shows at the hotel?

902
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,600
No, I've done like fittings there

903
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,600
for people who are doing award shows,

904
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,600
but like pre-award show, not night of stuff.

905
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,600
I love stuff.

906
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,600
Well, what's funny though is Ashley Crystal Hairston.

907
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,600
Yes.

908
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
Shout out to her.

909
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,600
Former guest.

910
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
Former guest, icon legend.

911
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,600
We love her.

912
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,600
I am now styling her, which is really, really fun.

913
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
I love her to death.

914
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,600
It kind of just happened.

915
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,600
And now we're like, I love her.

916
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,600
And originally, she was going to go to the GLAAD Awards

917
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,600
because they were nominated for the Fairly Odd Parents

918
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,600
reboot that Lindsay K tie.

919
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
That's my love.

920
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,600
My love.

921
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
I say my love so much.

922
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,600
We say that around the house so much.

923
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,600
Yeah, it's iconic.

924
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,600
Now, I know it's been a little while,

925
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,600
but I would just like to hear it.

926
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,600
Would you mind?

927
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,600
We say my love a lot.

928
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,600
Would you mind calling her your blushing bride?

929
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,600
Right now on mic or in the future?

930
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,600
Just imagine she's listening.

931
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,600
No, no, no.

932
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,600
I'd like it to be on mic, please.

933
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,600
My blushing bride.

934
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
Is that good?

935
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,600
Yeah.

936
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
It was better than I could have imagined

937
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
because I had that liltz.

938
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,600
The liltz is what really sells it.

939
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,600
Because you know what that is?

940
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,600
That's the high T.

941
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
That's when you really channel the T

942
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
in the word bride.

943
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,600
That's right.

944
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,600
You're getting into Lovitz territory

945
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,600
with that.

946
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,600
Lindsay, my blushing bride.

947
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,600
My blushing bride.

948
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,600
Yeah.

949
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,600
Oh my gosh.

950
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,600
Anyway, I'll wrap this up.

951
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,600
I just, I like.

952
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,600
Well, yeah, I have a Jason.

953
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,600
Very Jason.

954
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,600
Jason has a Jason story.

955
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,600
So initially she was going to go,

956
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,600
and then a few days before she called me,

957
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,600
she's like, they're not paying for us to go anymore.

958
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,600
So we were both really sad.

959
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,600
She had some really cool looks lined up.

960
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,600
And then they won, and I was so mad.

961
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,600
But the irony was, I would have been there

962
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,600
for the awards, or I could have gotten her ready

963
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,600
because I was already going to be there.

964
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,600
So I didn't even, just kind of worked out that way.

965
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,600
You could have split time between Jason and her.

966
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,600
Yeah.

967
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,600
Is what you're saying.

968
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,600
I truly would have.

969
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,600
Just leave him over in that bar area.

970
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,600
It was a very long room.

971
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,600
It's quiet.

972
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,600
The sports will be fine.

973
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,600
You know?

974
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
A very long room and long balcony.

975
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,600
So I could have made myself scarce.

976
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,600
Oh, it was, yeah.

977
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
The bathroom was huge.

978
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,600
It was all giant.

979
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,600
So I was like, oh, I wish she would have been able to go.

980
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
It would have been nice.

981
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,600
Yes.

982
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,600
We ended up at the Beverly Hilton,

983
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,600
and they did not.

984
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
And that was very surreal.

985
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,600
The irony.

986
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,600
Okay, you can go now.

987
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,600
Okay.

988
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
Here's the thing about the-

989
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,600
You may talk now, husband.

990
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
Yes, wife.

991
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,600
Thank you.

992
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,600
Here's the thing about the Beverly Hilton.

993
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,600
Here it comes.

994
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,600
Here it comes.

995
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
Here it comes.

996
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
Here we go.

997
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
Here we go.

998
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
Let's see the bill.

999
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
What did it cost?

1000
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
Is there any talk about the bill?

1001
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,600
Is there any of the charges?

1002
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,600
Is your neck okay?

1003
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,600
You were shaking your head when I said that.

1004
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Let's keep an eye on that.

1005
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,600
Wedding night, bills.

1006
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,600
All right.

1007
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
Pre you.

1008
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,600
The worst pillows I've ever slept on.

1009
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,600
It was not good.

1010
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,600
It was gnarly.

1011
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,600
It was surprisingly bad.

1012
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,600
You're on blast, Beverly Hilton pillows.

1013
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,600
What about the pillows?

1014
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,600
They were just hurting my neck.

1015
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,600
Yeah, they didn't really move much,

1016
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,600
and they were quite thick and lumpy,

1017
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,600
but they didn't have much cushiony to it,

1018
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,600
so it was just a really uncomfortable rock

1019
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,600
that just didn't-

1020
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
You goddamn pillows.

1021
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,600
Do you realize whose heads are on top of you?

1022
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,600
This is a husband and a blushing bride,

1023
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,600
and you don't give them support?

1024
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,600
We missed a giant part.

1025
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,600
Yeah.

1026
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,600
I'm sorry.

1027
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,600
We've got to talk about this.

1028
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,600
I'll talk about my stupid thing,

1029
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,600
and you talk about your big thing.

1030
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,600
So I could not sleep.

1031
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,600
It wasn't pre-wedding jitters.

1032
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,600
I am just like, I'm trying a pillow,

1033
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
I'm trying two pillows,

1034
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
I'm moving them around,

1035
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
I'm throwing them on the ground,

1036
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,600
I'm balling up a sweatshirt.

1037
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,600
I could not sleep,

1038
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,600
so at some point I'm just on my phone,

1039
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,600
and I ended up on eBay,

1040
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:25,600
and I bought a $4, $5 Woody Woodpecker

1041
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,600
Islands of Adventure opening year pin,

1042
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,600
and I'm like, I can't believe I'm doing this

1043
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,600
the night before my wedding.

1044
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
What?

1045
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
I can.

1046
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
I can, first of all.

1047
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,600
I love that.

1048
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,600
Anything but that, I'd be surprised.

1049
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,600
What time are we looking at?

1050
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,600
Is it 4 a.m.?

1051
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,600
3 a.m.

1052
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,600
3 a.m., okay.

1053
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Wow.

1054
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,600
Did you take Nyquil or anything?

1055
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,600
No.

1056
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,600
No.

1057
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,600
You've got to be happy, Jane,

1058
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
that it's the night before.

1059
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,600
He's getting married in the morning,

1060
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,600
and he's up at 3 a.m.,

1061
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,600
thoughts rushing through his brain.

1062
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,600
You've got to be happy that it's not like,

1063
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
who else it could have been?

1064
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,600
Past loves.

1065
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,600
It's Woody Woodpecker from Islands of Adventure opening.

1066
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,600
Luckily it wasn't Winnie Woodpecker.

1067
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,600
Oh, then you'd be in trouble.

1068
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,600
Oh, well.

1069
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,600
I'll pass.

1070
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,600
I'll pass, yeah.

1071
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,600
I'll pass.

1072
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,600
No, I was like, yeah, man,

1073
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,600
whatever you want.

1074
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,600
I did not want this wedding to be stressful.

1075
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
That was the thing.

1076
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,600
I was just like, yeah, okay, cool.

1077
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,600
Yeah?

1078
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,600
Did you fall asleep immediately

1079
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,600
after buying it?

1080
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,600
A little while later.

1081
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,600
Okay, so that didn't immediately put you to sleep.

1082
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,600
No, but it certainly calmed you.

1083
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,600
Calmed me, I think.

1084
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
That's the night.

1085
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
Wow, wow.

1086
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
If that's what you need to enter.

1087
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,600
I think it's cute, actually.

1088
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,600
I meant to bring it today.

1089
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
I totally forgot.

1090
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,600
When I started applauding and stuff,

1091
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,600
what I assumed was that you were getting into this section

1092
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
about how much the parking cost

1093
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,600
and the hidden fees with the room.

1094
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,600
Well.

1095
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,600
Here we go.

1096
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,600
Now we're doing it.

1097
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,600
There are a lot of fees,

1098
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,600
but I was prepared for that.

1099
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:49,600
But then, after the wedding,

1100
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,600
we went back to the apartment

1101
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,600
for the rest of the day and the night.

1102
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,600
And then we stayed a couple nights

1103
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,600
just at Hilton in Burbank,

1104
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,600
just at Hilton Garden Inn in Burbank.

1105
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,600
And they were hosting the GLAAD Awards Night 2.

1106
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,600
Well, hold on.

1107
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,600
Well, don't get ahead of us.

1108
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,600
It's very chill.

1109
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:11,600
The food is shockingly delicious.

1110
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,600
It's really good.

1111
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,600
It's really good at the inn hotel restaurant there.

1112
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,600
But yeah, so your big thing that kind of, thankfully...

1113
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,600
Well, you didn't get to what at the hotel we ran into.

1114
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,600
Well, we'll circle back to that.

1115
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,600
Oh, my God.

1116
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,600
Okay.

1117
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:31,600
So on Thursday, when we're about to head

1118
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,600
to drop Garfield off at boarding and last minute things

1119
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,600
and then go to the hotel to check in.

1120
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,600
So Garfield, unfortunately, you guys,

1121
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,600
he's getting quite old.

1122
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,600
He cannot see.

1123
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,600
He does not like to be touched.

1124
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
It's gotten really, really sad.

1125
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,600
He's still our sweet little boy,

1126
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,600
but it's not been easy.

1127
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,600
I didn't realize that.

1128
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
Yeah, it's not been great.

1129
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,600
But I mean, he's okay.

1130
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,600
But you can tell he's probably like 11 now.

1131
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
That's not even that old,

1132
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,600
but it's like an older dog.

1133
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:07,600
He was sleeping very cute in a beanbag chair when we left.

1134
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,600
That was cute.

1135
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,600
So that was great.

1136
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,600
Did he go up to the computer

1137
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,600
and buy himself a Woody Woodpecker as an adventure tent?

1138
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,600
No, he can't see.

1139
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,600
The other day, our, not entertainment system,

1140
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,600
but we have a block of cubes.

1141
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,600
The Ikea Calax.

1142
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,600
And I'll just see him,

1143
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,600
and his head is just in one of the cubes,

1144
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
and he's just standing there.

1145
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,600
He just can't see, and he'll just stare at the wall.

1146
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,600
It's really sad.

1147
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,600
But anyway, the reason I say that is because I was trying

1148
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,600
to get him in the car, which is impossible now

1149
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,600
because you have to pick him up, and he bites.

1150
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,600
It's really stressful for me.

1151
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,600
So I'm putting things in the car, and he gets away.

1152
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,600
He's on his leash, but he runs away.

1153
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,600
And I was like, oh, crap.

1154
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,600
Why did I censor myself?

1155
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,600
Oh, fuck.

1156
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,600
So then I open the door, and I turn.

1157
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,600
And we're in our parking garage that has these giant columns.

1158
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,600
And there's one right by my car.

1159
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:06,600
And I turn, and I full force ram my head into the pole,

1160
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,600
like full body weight.

1161
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,600
And I immediately start crying.

1162
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,600
And I have a very high pain tolerance,

1163
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,600
and I was so shocked and scared

1164
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,600
because it was literally like turning and running into a wall.

1165
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,600
And I was like, Jason, my wedding pictures!

1166
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,600
My wedding pictures!

1167
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,600
I'm going to have this big purse!

1168
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,600
I can't fucking believe it!

1169
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,600
I worked so hard on my skin for weeks,

1170
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,600
and now I hit the pole.

1171
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,600
I'm freaking out.

1172
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,600
I'm in shock.

1173
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,600
I'm in utter pain.

1174
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,600
I'm like, am I going to have a good cushion?

1175
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,600
But you did flash to the pictures before you flashed to...

1176
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,600
Yeah, a fucking horse like this.

1177
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,600
Do I need to go to the hospital?

1178
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,600
Are you kidding me, guys?

1179
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,600
I did red light therapy.

1180
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,600
Oh, red light?

1181
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,600
I want to do red light.

1182
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,600
Michael, I meant to tell you, it actually really works.

1183
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,600
I have a little wand.

1184
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,600
A door is open, everyone.

1185
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,600
It's the only thing I notice that changes my skin

1186
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,600
if I use it every day for like...

1187
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,600
Really? Oh, I'm excited about this.

1188
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,600
Please, no.

1189
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,600
Like, absolutely 100% red light.

1190
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,600
Give him your red light guy.

1191
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,600
No, no, I'll get a hold of it.

1192
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,600
I'll work on it.

1193
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,600
Mine was a gift, actually, from a styling event.

1194
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,600
So, technically, I didn't buy it.

1195
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,600
But it works really well.

1196
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,600
You have to cough that up yourself.

1197
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,600
I did not work for weeks on my skin

1198
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,600
to have a fucking bruise on my forehead.

1199
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,600
And by the grace of the wedding gods,

1200
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,600
for whatever reason, you could not see it.

1201
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,600
I could feel the fuck out of it.

1202
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,600
But it was just right at the top.

1203
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,600
Oh, my God.

1204
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,600
Like, huge.

1205
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,600
The most clear area of skin on your face.

1206
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,600
Oh, yeah.

1207
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,600
Completely available for a cartoon.

1208
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,600
I was like, oh, God, this is gonna be awful.

1209
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,600
You couldn't see it.

1210
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,600
The only time I could see it was when it was healing.

1211
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,600
It was just this yellow circle.

1212
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,600
Like, it still kind of hurts.

1213
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,600
And this was two weeks ago now.

1214
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,600
Two weeks ago Thursday.

1215
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,600
Yeah.

1216
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,600
So that was just like a terrible start.

1217
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,600
And I was freaking out.

1218
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,600
I was already kind of frantic

1219
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,600
because we were, you know, taking Garfield

1220
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,600
and that's the whole thing.

1221
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,600
So I was like, oh, what a great way to start this,

1222
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,600
like, wedding adventure.

1223
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,600
I'm like, concussion, potentially?

1224
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,600
Let me drive to Beverly Hills now.

1225
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,600
Yeah, she was really shocked and upset.

1226
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,600
And she's like, it's kind of bruised.

1227
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,600
It's gonna have bruised the pictures.

1228
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,600
And I'm trying to hold our hands

1229
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,600
and trying to remember concussion protocols

1230
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,600
of like, did you lose consciousness?

1231
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,600
Let me see your pupils, blah, blah, blah.

1232
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,600
Do we need to go to urgent care?

1233
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,600
Yeah, look in the light.

1234
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,600
Did they die in the light?

1235
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,600
Yeah.

1236
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,600
Yeah.

1237
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,600
But you said it was okay?

1238
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,600
It was okay.

1239
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,600
Dr. Sheridan ruled that it was fine.

1240
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,600
Well, losing...

1241
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,600
I've been watching a lot of Dr. Odyssey lately.

1242
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,600
I can get you through this.

1243
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,600
We actually are behind a few episodes.

1244
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,600
Maybe I can't get you through it.

1245
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,600
I'm behind a few episodes, but I'll try.

1246
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,600
I'm behind a few episodes.

1247
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,600
Look, I've eaten shit a few times the last few years

1248
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,600
and I've like, on the phone, like,

1249
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,600
seeing if I need to come in.

1250
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,600
Sure.

1251
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,600
You know, they do a basic questionnaire.

1252
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,600
Like, the main thing is like, did you lose consciousness?

1253
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,600
Did you blackout?

1254
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,600
Did you have spots in your eye?

1255
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,600
In this case, do you remember Doug's last name?

1256
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,600
Do you remember the town that he is from?

1257
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,600
Puddy, Puddy.

1258
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,600
Puffington, Puffington.

1259
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,600
21 Jumbo Street.

1260
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,600
What is Doug's home address?

1261
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,600
21 Jumbo Street.

1262
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,600
21 Jumbo Street.

1263
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,600
21 Jumbo Street.

1264
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,600
21 Jumbo Street.

1265
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,600
It's a very important song.

1266
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,600
We'll get there.

1267
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:13,600
So, yeah, that was kind of like a startling start.

1268
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,600
I'll say.

1269
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,600
Wow.

1270
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,600
It was really scary.

1271
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,600
And then I'm like, time to drive to Beverly Hills.

1272
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,600
Like, I guess I'm just gonna go.

1273
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,600
And it ended up like being okay, relatively.

1274
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,600
But like, Jesus, that hurt.

1275
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,600
And it just scared the crap out of me.

1276
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,600
I was immediately just like in a wall.

1277
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,600
Like, I was so startled.

1278
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,600
I just started crying.

1279
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,600
So I just wanted to mention that because we were like, why?

1280
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,600
How?

1281
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,600
Like, I was like, I worked so hard on my skin.

1282
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,600
It looks great.

1283
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,600
This is not fair.

1284
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,600
Like, I was so mad.

1285
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,600
But the skin, if you hadn't worked as hard, maybe it wouldn't have absorbed the...

1286
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,600
I think the red light made you...

1287
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,600
It helped.

1288
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,600
What a good point.

1289
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,600
Yeah, I think so.

1290
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,600
That's a really good point.

1291
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,600
Yeah.

1292
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,600
It does make your skin very plump.

1293
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:01,600
Maybe that proves with enough red light therapy, you can purposefully bang your head on a concrete

1294
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,600
pole.

1295
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,600
It makes it strong skin.

1296
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,600
Yeah, yeah.

1297
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,600
And you'd be fine.

1298
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,600
Yeah.

1299
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,600
Like, I literally just like touched it and be like, oh.

1300
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,600
And I'm like, oh.

1301
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,600
It hurts a lot.

1302
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,600
I'm sure.

1303
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,600
Like, it hurts a lot.

1304
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,600
Anyway.

1305
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,600
I'm convoluted.

1306
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,600
So we stayed at the Hilton.

1307
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,600
It was kind of a gloomy weekend.

1308
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,600
Yeah.

1309
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,600
Weekend.

1310
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,600
And we're like, oh, the hotel's like empty.

1311
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,600
We have a place to ourselves.

1312
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,600
And we were just kind of walking outside.

1313
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,600
And they had a fire pit.

1314
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,600
We came back inside.

1315
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,600
And there was just a giant...

1316
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,600
There was a Greyhound parked outside.

1317
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:42,600
Inside, there was just a giant high school cheerleading squad and all the parents and

1318
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,600
chaperones.

1319
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,600
And...

1320
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,600
And the what now?

1321
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,600
Chaperones.

1322
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,600
Chaperones.

1323
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,600
Just say, chapel-rone.

1324
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,600
Just say, chapel-rone.

1325
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,600
Chapel-rone.

1326
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,600
Then it's right.

1327
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,600
Yeah, there was a bunch of chapel-rones.

1328
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,600
But then all the cheerleaders and all the chapel-rones.

1329
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,600
But when I tell you, it felt like wall-to-wall of the lobby.

1330
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,600
It wasn't just like a circle.

1331
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,600
I walked in and I went, God.

1332
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,600
Oh, God.

1333
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,600
Not this.

1334
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,600
Not this.

1335
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,600
And we tried...

1336
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,600
Sorry, I'm...

1337
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,600
Sorry.

1338
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:14,600
But the other thing I learned that weekend that was, in hindsight, kind of embarrassing.

1339
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:19,600
But look, I'm on a lot of medications for various things.

1340
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:24,600
And Mike's birthday a few weeks before, I had a single beer and I was fine.

1341
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,600
I had a gin and tonic and it just...

1342
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,600
My body...

1343
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,600
It just felt like it had four gin and tonics.

1344
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:37,600
And that happened the night before the wedding.

1345
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,600
I thought, well, it's probably just exhaustion and jitters.

1346
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:46,600
And then a couple nights later, we walked into this lobby that had previously been no one in there.

1347
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,600
Literally.

1348
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,600
And now it's just...

1349
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,600
This is not...

1350
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,600
Which hotel are we at now?

1351
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,600
That's not...

1352
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,600
That's the one you...

1353
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,600
The later one.

1354
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,600
Yeah.

1355
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,600
Yeah.

1356
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,600
I tried a couple times.

1357
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,600
But we walked into the full lobby and it's like, all right, let's get drinks.

1358
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,600
Same thing happened.

1359
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,600
I am just dizzy.

1360
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,600
I just don't feel well.

1361
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,600
But when you see a crowd or was it before that?

1362
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,600
No, I'm saying the gin and tonic.

1363
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,600
It interacted with whatever I was on.

1364
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,600
And so, yes.

1365
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:27,600
So for Epic Universe, I am going to be a messy little soda boy, not a messy little gin boy.

1366
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,600
Not a messy little...

1367
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,600
Scott and I are going to...

1368
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,600
I'm sorry to say, Scott and I are going to be pounding shots when we're at Epic Universe.

1369
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,600
Well, if it's...

1370
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,600
They had a hammer.

1371
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,600
Jane, if you want one.

1372
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,600
She knows.

1373
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,600
No, no, no.

1374
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,600
Honestly, I don't drink.

1375
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:42,600
I also had one drink, but I don't drink.

1376
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,600
I don't like it.

1377
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,600
I also have medications in effect.

1378
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,600
I feel awful.

1379
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,600
I don't enjoy it.

1380
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,600
So it's not like I miss it.

1381
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,600
I hate it.

1382
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,600
That's a bummer.

1383
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,600
Yeah.

1384
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,600
Well, you can't do it.

1385
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,600
It really makes me feel awful.

1386
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,600
One drink and I'm like, my stomach is killing me.

1387
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,600
You know what?

1388
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,600
This is me with edibles.

1389
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,600
Me with edibles too, unfortunately.

1390
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,600
Yeah.

1391
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,600
See, I'm the opposite.

1392
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,600
Weed is...

1393
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,600
Different paths.

1394
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,600
Different paths.

1395
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,600
Takes all kinds.

1396
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,600
That's right.

1397
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,600
Well, we're going to do...

1398
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,600
We're going to play beer pong with Vincent Various in Celestial Park.

1399
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,600
No.

1400
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,600
Wait.

1401
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,440
Well, that character is not happening anymore.

1402
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,440
Is that official?

1403
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,440
Do we know that?

1404
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,440
I suspected that.

1405
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,440
No, I'm telling you.

1406
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,440
I know for a fact it's not.

1407
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,440
I hate when people don't believe it.

1408
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,440
No, I'm not...

1409
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,440
No, I'm just saying I suspected that it was.

1410
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,440
I'm not saying I don't believe you.

1411
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,440
Yeah, I said it was.

1412
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,440
But you have this...

1413
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,440
You have this intel that it's Vincent Various.

1414
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,440
I have inside information that...

1415
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,440
Is Vincent Various...

1416
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,440
What's the Star Wars character who didn't make it?

1417
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,440
Admiral Constable Zuvio?

1418
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,360
Is Vincent Various the Constable Zuvio of Celestial Park?

1419
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,520
We knew what Zuvio looked like because we had a toy of him.

1420
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,520
I don't know that we...

1421
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,520
We didn't even find out what Vincent looked like.

1422
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:42,600
Somebody was cast, so there might be a picture of him somewhere, but it's not public.

1423
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:46,680
The tea is, they worked and rehearsed for all of the Celestial Park entertainment for

1424
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:53,560
10 weeks, and then all of a sudden they said, all of this is scrapped, goodbye, and they

1425
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,560
just cut all of it.

1426
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,560
Jesus Christ.

1427
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,000
So they were supposed to have a lot of stuff, but...

1428
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Yeah, that's what we heard.

1429
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
We heard some people saw it.

1430
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:05,160
At this rate, if it truly has disappeared, Vincent Various will immediately move into

1431
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:10,040
the ranks of Mighty Ikhwan, one of these things where the only available results are us talking

1432
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,040
about.

1433
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,480
Because we're the only people who seized on it in time.

1434
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:20,240
We should really try to get Universal to sue us by putting out a series about Vincent Various.

1435
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,640
Try to feel like a narrative podcast or a show, we could shoot a show.

1436
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,800
The Jason references from time to time Chinese democracy when Guns N' Roses had...

1437
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,800
Guns N' Roses album.

1438
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,720
Guns N' Roses had long said they were going to put out this album called Chinese Democracy,

1439
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,760
they never made good on it year after year, but ultimately the offspring said, we're doing

1440
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:37,760
it.

1441
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,760
We're putting out an album called Chinese Democracy.

1442
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,760
That's their sense of humor.

1443
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,760
Snooze you lose.

1444
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,760
Which I always thought was funny.

1445
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,760
But that's what we got to do.

1446
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,480
It's like, okay, if you own Vincent Various, do something with it.

1447
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,480
Put him in the park.

1448
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:54,040
Otherwise, it's up to us and our great imaginations to imagine adventures for Vincent Various.

1449
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,040
What does he do?

1450
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,040
What would he have done?

1451
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,040
Well, he was...

1452
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,040
Sorry, you know the answer?

1453
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,280
No, no, no.

1454
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,280
I had something else to say.

1455
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,280
So please continue.

1456
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,280
Oh, I was just going to say that I think he...

1457
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,120
This is dangerous because there might be 15 more minutes about Vincent Various.

1458
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,120
I'm just going to...

1459
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,120
Just letting you know as a courtesy.

1460
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,120
This episode's going to be so long.

1461
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:10,440
I'm just saying that Vincent Various, I think he was like sort of in charge of all the different

1462
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,480
establishments in Celestial Park and to, you know, he was...

1463
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,760
He refilled the soda for the messy little soda boys.

1464
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,760
He will...

1465
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:17,760
Yeah.

1466
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:18,760
Well, he would have somebody probably do it.

1467
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:19,760
He's in charge.

1468
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,760
He could summon it.

1469
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:21,760
He's...

1470
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,760
All right.

1471
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,760
So he possibly...

1472
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,760
He accepts the time cards for...

1473
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,120
But Captain Kakao at Maya the Explorer traveled the cosmos trying to find treats for the...

1474
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,200
Right.

1475
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,200
Well, these guys got to be cut too, right?

1476
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,200
Well, no, but they're on the merchants.

1477
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,200
There's already...

1478
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,120
But Maya's got to be out.

1479
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,120
There's no flush on Maya.

1480
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,120
Maya might be out too though.

1481
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,120
I don't even know who that is.

1482
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:41,760
I only know because I Googled something to do a specific joke about in our episode about

1483
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,760
this.

1484
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:43,760
Well, we're going to...

1485
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,720
We own Vincent Various now as far as I'm concerned.

1486
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,720
Yeah.

1487
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,720
Unless Universal does something...

1488
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,720
We'll give them eight weeks.

1489
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,720
We got it.

1490
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,720
We got it.

1491
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,720
We own Vincent.

1492
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,720
Eight weeks from now.

1493
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,720
If they don't do anything...

1494
00:51:54,320 --> 00:52:00,720
I'll see if I can find out any information.

1495
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,440
Here's what I'll say.

1496
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,440
Orlando live show.

1497
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,440
Yeah.

1498
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,440
Vincent Various will appear at our live show.

1499
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,440
That's a good thing to just declare right now.

1500
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,440
Yes.

1501
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,440
You will.

1502
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,440
Guess what?

1503
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,840
Maybe the big dog in town isn't going to let you meet Vincent Various, but that's a podcast

1504
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,840
that I promise.

1505
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,840
Podcast the right.

1506
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,840
An art show?

1507
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,840
Yeah, we make good on that.

1508
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:20,840
I don't know which show of...

1509
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:21,840
There's two shows.

1510
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,520
What kind of entertainers would we be if we didn't allow you to meet Vincent Various?

1511
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,520
You will meet Vincent Various at the Podcast the Ride live show.

1512
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,520
We are playing with fire.

1513
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:32,080
Comcast NBCUniversal is going to send the woman in the yard after us.

1514
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,080
We're going to be fucked.

1515
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,080
Comcast, you bring that woman in the yard.

1516
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,080
Bring it on, I'm saying.

1517
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:41,080
You're going to be playing with your Ninja Turtles and you're going to hear, today's

1518
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,080
the day.

1519
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,080
And then you're fucked.

1520
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:47,080
Well, then we will take control of her as well, this character, woman in the yard.

1521
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,080
That movie is actually really sad.

1522
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,080
I bet it is.

1523
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,080
It represents trauma.

1524
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,080
I bet it is.

1525
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,080
We're going to make it fun.

1526
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:59,200
Can I just have a quick idea for something they could do with these characters that might

1527
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:06,040
be cool if they were able to budget-wise or whatever, be really cool to have them as atmosphere

1528
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:11,920
characters in City Walk to kind of share celestial park vibes and get people interested in the

1529
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,840
park and incorporate it a little bit?

1530
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:17,240
Would that be kind of cool?

1531
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,240
We would like it.

1532
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,800
It would be cool, but I wonder for dad who wants to have a couple of beers at the NBC

1533
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,640
bar and grill, he might be a bit confused.

1534
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,680
Yes, somebody snuggles out of the hot dog hall of fame and like, you there, you look

1535
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,680
like a man who might be interested in what lies beyond.

1536
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,160
What if I told you there were five portals nearby?

1537
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,560
Why the name's various.

1538
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,560
I have a house at the end of the Andromeda Strain.

1539
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,760
Why, sir, right this way?

1540
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:47,080
I like original characters for the preview center, like, it brings people in.

1541
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,080
Bring me to the greatest preview center of all time.

1542
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:53,840
I'm just saying, I feel like that could be, and no, this isn't related to what we were

1543
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,680
talking about, but.

1544
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,080
My car is a moonbeam.

1545
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,080
I love that.

1546
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,080
I love that.

1547
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,080
This is great.

1548
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,080
All right.

1549
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,080
There'll be three Vincent variouses you will meet at the podcast.

1550
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,080
Various variouses.

1551
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,080
Vincent.

1552
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,080
Meet a various.

1553
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,080
Various, various.

1554
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,080
Sort of a variouses.

1555
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,080
Vincent variouses.

1556
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,080
And they're all Dream Finder-ish.

1557
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,080
Hello.

1558
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:21,080
Well, with the tesseract and time portals, we all exist simultaneously.

1559
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,080
Thank you, Vincent.

1560
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,080
Yes.

1561
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:26,080
In various stackable dimensions.

1562
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:30,080
I eat three rainbows a day.

1563
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,080
All right, so I'm going to reel this back in a little bit.

1564
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,080
Sure, yes.

1565
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,080
Okay.

1566
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,080
The door's cracked open a little, but we're closing it.

1567
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,080
I'm not shutting it, but let's kind of mute it.

1568
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,080
No, I'm just kidding.

1569
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,080
Okay, we can close it.

1570
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,080
I feel like.

1571
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,080
These are the kind of bits you're avoiding.

1572
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:47,080
I literally sat here and I went, I'm going to give them a little bit of time to do this.

1573
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,080
Let the boys run around.

1574
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,080
Get their energy out.

1575
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,080
Everyone likes this.

1576
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,080
They're feeling ramy.

1577
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,080
Get it out.

1578
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,080
People are going to be psyched.

1579
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:57,080
There's going to be a line out the door at the tin roof in Orlando to see Vincent variouses.

1580
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,080
There's going to be a line out the door to see you guys.

1581
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,080
People love you guys so much.

1582
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,080
Yes, that's true.

1583
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,080
Definitely.

1584
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,080
But there's going to be an extra.

1585
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:06,080
The line is going to dwarf our line.

1586
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,080
Suddenly it's a line of thousands.

1587
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,080
It's what the theme park would have gotten.

1588
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,080
Exactly.

1589
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,080
But we get it now.

1590
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,080
It's ours now.

1591
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,080
We're going to create such a fire hazard.

1592
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,080
There's going to be a bit.

1593
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,080
That room full of cheerleaders you guys are complaining about.

1594
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,080
That's going to be nothing compared to all the Vincent various fans.

1595
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:26,080
The 2,000 people trying to fit into a venue meant for 300.

1596
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,080
That's right.

1597
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,080
Well, it'll be a good show.

1598
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,080
For no fires, Vincent will protect us.

1599
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,080
I can ward them off.

1600
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,080
I control ice.

1601
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,080
Did we forget anything?

1602
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,080
That's part of me too.

1603
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,080
About the wedding?

1604
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:39,080
The only thing I was going to say is the cheer parents after everything died down were at

1605
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:43,080
the bar watching the videos and clearly like, oh, that couple's not going to stay together.

1606
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:47,080
They're like having problems with their together because of their kid or like that crazy mom

1607
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,080
is yelling at the other crazy mom because of this.

1608
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,080
So we were kind of just observing at that point.

1609
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,080
Like these parents are kind of crazy.

1610
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:59,080
Was there any of that even at the at the other hotel of like, oh, you said you noticed a

1611
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,080
couple of people.

1612
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,080
Were there any there were famous people there?

1613
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:05,080
Were there other people you were sort of like, oh, we'll do people watching while we're

1614
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,080
there.

1615
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,080
I did not.

1616
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,080
We didn't.

1617
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,080
We didn't catch anyone.

1618
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:14,080
And then the bar, everyone was just kind of like chilling, watching the Dodgers.

1619
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,080
So it was more you were more watching the parents of the cheerleaders.

1620
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:22,080
It was just funny because we were at the bar and I'm like, oh, Jason, I think these are

1621
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:26,080
all the parents that are having their various reactions to their life being.

1622
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:29,080
They all just seemed exhausted.

1623
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,080
All watching the videos.

1624
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:34,080
Sad life, a ride on a bus.

1625
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,080
It's a long day, a competition day.

1626
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:40,080
I think it was that they said it was that the competition was at William Burroughs High

1627
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,080
School.

1628
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,080
John Burroughs High School.

1629
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,080
John Burroughs.

1630
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,080
Excuse me.

1631
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,080
William Burroughs.

1632
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,080
That's a good guy.

1633
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,080
He always got Frawley on the mind.

1634
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,080
Just a little.

1635
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,080
William.

1636
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,080
Always.

1637
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,080
That's true.

1638
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,080
Dreaming of him on his wedding night.

1639
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:56,080
Was there any, but there wasn't any commotion like as far as in the middle of the night,

1640
00:56:56,080 --> 00:57:00,080
like both of these groups, were they like, there wasn't like girls cheering down the

1641
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,080
hall at midnight.

1642
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,080
They were a little noisy.

1643
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,080
You slept through it.

1644
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,080
Really?

1645
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,080
You didn't hear them.

1646
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,080
In the hallway?

1647
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:10,080
It's just kind of going to and from the elevators.

1648
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,080
They were chanting.

1649
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:14,080
They were spelling everything they could get their eyes on.

1650
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,080
These cheerleaders can't stop spelling shit.

1651
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,080
E-X-I-T.

1652
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,080
Exit, exit.

1653
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,080
H-I-L-T.

1654
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,080
Hilton Garden Inn.

1655
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,080
Hilton Garden Inn.

1656
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,080
Ho, ho.

1657
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:25,080
You're a little too good at the cadence of that.

1658
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,080
Were you a cheerleader?

1659
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:30,080
Does he do anything so?

1660
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,080
I'll start busting out the old videos.

1661
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,080
Amazing.

1662
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:38,080
Oh, oh, this is what I was going to say.

1663
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:43,080
We got off the elevator and all of the elevators kind of look out to the pool and we were like,

1664
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,080
oh, the pool.

1665
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,080
And I turn and look and it is just flooded with teens.

1666
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:50,080
And I went, oh, God, the teens have taken over.

1667
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,080
And then I turned around.

1668
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:54,080
There was a cheer dad and he was like, yep, there's 46 of them.

1669
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,080
Like, it was just so funny.

1670
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:01,080
So I was like, oh, God, they're like infesting.

1671
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,080
Infesting.

1672
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,080
They were everywhere.

1673
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:07,080
And it was just so funny because the dad was standing there like leaning against the wall

1674
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,080
with a drink like, yep, there's 46 of them.

1675
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,080
He was like ready to go.

1676
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,080
Quintin Jaws or something.

1677
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,080
Yeah, there's 46 of them out there.

1678
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,080
It was just so funny.

1679
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,080
You would have rather that the hotel had bed bugs.

1680
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,080
It was going to be infested by anything.

1681
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,080
Yeah.

1682
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,080
It was easier to deal with.

1683
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,080
I checked the beds.

1684
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,080
I always check the beds.

1685
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,080
How do you check?

1686
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,080
Do you check the corners?

1687
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,080
You pull back the sheet.

1688
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,080
Because you would see them, you're saying.

1689
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,080
You can check the mattress.

1690
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,080
Right.

1691
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,080
I was just wondering if you had like a machine or something that could do it.

1692
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,080
No.

1693
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:39,080
You can get a cheap blacklight pen, but that's different.

1694
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,080
You don't want to do that in a hotel.

1695
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,080
No, no, no.

1696
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,080
Yeah, you don't want to do that.

1697
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,080
Plausible deniability is the way to go.

1698
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,080
You know it would be really, you'd never sleep in a hotel again.

1699
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,080
How did it get here?

1700
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,080
How'd that big splash get up there?

1701
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,080
Yeah, it would be shocking.

1702
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,080
Can they crawl walls?

1703
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,080
How would they do it?

1704
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,080
Yeah, no.

1705
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,080
I don't want, even in the nice hotels.

1706
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,080
Yeah, especially the nice.

1707
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,080
Especially the nice hotels.

1708
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,080
Weird stuff goes down.

1709
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,080
Oh, oh, oh.

1710
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:07,080
At Beverly Hilton, we were on the same floor and mirror rooms down from where Whitney Houston died.

1711
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:12,080
Multiple, multiple people in the elevators.

1712
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,080
Multiple people were going to visit.

1713
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,080
Like it's a really big thing.

1714
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,080
I believe that.

1715
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,080
We're like going to check room 434.

1716
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,080
So people stay in that room?

1717
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,080
Yeah, 434.

1718
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,080
I think it's been fully renovated and stuff.

1719
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,080
Room 434.

1720
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,080
Did they tell people, like by the way, here's your room key.

1721
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,080
Just so you know.

1722
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,080
Just so you know.

1723
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,080
No, it's just pretty infamous.

1724
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,080
Yeah, but people obviously are in there every night.

1725
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,080
Yeah.

1726
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:35,080
But would you, I feel like if I, hotel staff, I think you would not encourage telling people that.

1727
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,080
But some people go to see it.

1728
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,080
Sure.

1729
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,080
And it's like an attraction.

1730
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,080
But I see what you're saying.

1731
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:44,080
We don't know what room JFK Maryland got.

1732
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,080
If they were on a chocolate bar.

1733
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,080
Oh, Maryland and JFK would go there to fuck.

1734
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:52,080
Do you think they had many different, I assume if they went more than once, they would have different rooms?

1735
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,080
Or do you think there was the same suite there?

1736
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,080
I don't know.

1737
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,080
Yeah, I don't really know, but they were.

1738
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,080
Did they also go to Frank Sinatra's Palm Springs house as well?

1739
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,080
Yeah, probably.

1740
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:00,080
I'm sure.

1741
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,080
I don't know.

1742
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,080
As far as I know, I think they went to that.

1743
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,080
You know more about this than I do.

1744
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,080
I don't know.

1745
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,080
I just said what I know.

1746
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,080
You got a big leap of info on this.

1747
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,080
They just be fucking, you know.

1748
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:15,080
So in the room, there's a candy bar at the Beverly Hilton and it has a black and white picture, like you could buy it, of JFK in Maryland.

1749
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,080
Oh, really?

1750
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:23,080
And then a documentary about, what was it, JFK started playing on the TV and I was like, I'm freaked out right now.

1751
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,080
This hotel is haunted.

1752
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,080
I started freaking out.

1753
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,080
Remember that?

1754
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,080
Yes.

1755
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,080
Because I was like, oh no, he's coming through the TV.

1756
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,080
He wasn't killed there.

1757
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:33,080
Just don't go to the courthouse in an open top car.

1758
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,080
Oh my God.

1759
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,080
No, no.

1760
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,080
Avoid the-

1761
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,080
My beautiful pillbox hat.

1762
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:39,080
Don't book the Ambassador Hotel.

1763
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:49,080
The hotel in Burbank, I did watch a lot of my favorite, The Food That Built America.

1764
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:52,080
This is a romantic wedding weekend.

1765
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,080
I like that show too.

1766
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,080
She was dead asleep.

1767
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,080
I like that show too.

1768
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,080
She likes it too and then she fell asleep.

1769
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:59,080
One day I slept the whole day and I kept apologizing and I'm like, I'm sorry.

1770
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,080
What's the whole, you mean literally from morning till night?

1771
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,080
I slept a good chunk of Sunday.

1772
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:06,080
Like I really did because I was just so fucking tired.

1773
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:09,080
Oh, we did, keep adding these things, I don't know.

1774
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:18,080
The day we got home from the wedding, Friday, it was still early in the day and I immediately asked for alone time because I was so like over-stimulated.

1775
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,080
So we got married.

1776
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,080
We took our pictures.

1777
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,080
We came home.

1778
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:25,080
We were like, oh, that was crazy and I went, so can I have alone time now?

1779
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:27,080
Because I just need to like decompress and he was like, yeah, sure.

1780
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:30,080
And we just went our separate ways for a while.

1781
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:33,080
And I just think that's funny.

1782
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,080
And then we took a nap.

1783
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:36,080
I don't know, I feel like I'm sucking on this podcast today.

1784
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:39,080
I feel like I'm not killing it.

1785
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,080
You're doing great.

1786
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:43,080
Tell her she's blushing bread.

1787
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:46,080
Yes, beautiful, beautiful blushing bread.

1788
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,080
Beautiful blushing bread.

1789
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,080
I don't know why is that.

1790
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,080
Come on, Jack, come on.

1791
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,080
Joe Biden.

1792
01:01:50,080 --> 01:02:00,080
We came home, put on sweats and watched like Ordinary Adventures or Miss Tomorrow, whatever we always put on.

1793
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:04,080
I was just like, all right, everyone leave me alone.

1794
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,080
I was like, I don't want anybody talking to me.

1795
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,080
I want a full log of everything that was watched.

1796
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:11,080
I think you owe the listeners every single piece of material.

1797
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,080
There were some ancient aliens in there.

1798
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,080
We watched Family Guy the night before our wedding.

1799
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,080
We did watch Family Guy.

1800
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,080
I was worried some of these were going to fall through the cracks.

1801
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,080
Walk off, Scotty.

1802
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:24,080
Fuck the fuck off, man.

1803
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:28,080
Some listeners living vicariously through Jane right now.

1804
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:33,080
I will leave this room and you can finish.

1805
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,080
Jane needs alone time.

1806
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:42,080
No, but actually what was funny is Family Guy, the TV was so big and you could see it from outside because I stepped outside to like smoke.

1807
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:45,080
And the way our room was you could see right into it with the windows open.

1808
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:49,080
And I was like, you can see the Family Guy TV that we're watching from like outside.

1809
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,080
From downstairs.

1810
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,080
And from like the freeway.

1811
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,080
I feel like they could see it because the TV was so big and I just thought that was funny.

1812
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:58,080
So people like walking on the street could see Quagmire or something.

1813
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,080
Oh, yeah.

1814
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,080
There was a lot of construction going on around the hotel.

1815
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,080
It was like so big.

1816
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,080
I was like, I'm watching this from outside.

1817
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,080
Right.

1818
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,080
Yeah.

1819
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:07,080
So we watched some good Family Guy.

1820
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,080
All right.

1821
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,080
Well, I have to use the bathroom.

1822
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,080
All right.

1823
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:14,080
Well, let's all piss and shit and then we'll come back for some talk about Doug Live.

1824
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,080
Okay.

1825
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:19,080
Now, now that that's all out of the way.

1826
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,080
Boy, that was rough.

1827
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,080
Do not go in there.

1828
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,080
Oh, they're shitting and pissing.

1829
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,080
Right.

1830
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:33,080
Yeah.

1831
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,080
That's not what you meant.

1832
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,080
I don't know what he meant.

1833
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,080
That's what I thought he was referring to.

1834
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,080
That's what I thought he was referring to too.

1835
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,080
I showed you at the wedding.

1836
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,080
Never mind.

1837
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,080
We got through all that.

1838
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,080
You were acting like it was so hard to pee.

1839
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:50,080
I'm just glad you liked it because something I like to do is just like when I'm with my

1840
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:53,080
friends, just like say Jim Carrey quotes and get everybody to crack up.

1841
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,080
Yeah.

1842
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,080
It really was.

1843
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,080
It's just something I do.

1844
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,080
I don't know.

1845
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,080
I'll keep doing it.

1846
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,080
I'll try to weave one more into the episode.

1847
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,080
Smoke it in.

1848
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,080
Yeah.

1849
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,080
That should be easy.

1850
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,080
Okay.

1851
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:07,080
Now, let's talk about Doug Live.

1852
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,080
Ren, just the basic facts.

1853
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,080
Doug Live ran.

1854
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:14,080
He's very mournful here.

1855
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,080
Let's talk about Doug Live.

1856
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:19,080
Look, we both have a lot to say about Doug Live.

1857
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,080
Okay.

1858
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,080
We're joking.

1859
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,080
We'd keep it succinct.

1860
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:35,080
But Doug Live ran at Disney MGM Studios from March of 1999 until 2001, I believe May of

1861
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,080
2001.

1862
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:39,080
Short run in the theme park.

1863
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,080
Short run.

1864
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,080
Yeah.

1865
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:47,080
This was a live musical experience based on what at that point was called Disney's Doug.

1866
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,080
Yes.

1867
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:52,080
It was one of the fundamental primary Nick tunes.

1868
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:53,080
Yes.

1869
01:04:53,080 --> 01:05:00,080
Part of that original hugely popular block with Ren and Stimpy and Rugrats.

1870
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:04,080
And then kind of a strange thing where Ren and Stimpy fell off and moved around for the

1871
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,080
various reasons that it did.

1872
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:10,080
And Rugrats, still one of the crown jewels of the Viacom empire.

1873
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,080
Doug moved.

1874
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,080
Weird.

1875
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:15,080
Like, whatever moves from Nickelodeon Disney.

1876
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:19,080
So there was this strange, like, I think they did four seasons on Nickelodeon.

1877
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,080
Yes.

1878
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,080
And then it switches over to Disney.

1879
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:26,080
They bought the production company, seemingly.

1880
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:31,080
And then they start airing it on, not on cable anymore, but it gets the bump up to network.

1881
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:34,080
Doug went network on ABC's One Saturday Morning.

1882
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,080
Yes.

1883
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:38,080
And I was a huge Doug fan on Nickelodeon.

1884
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,080
I loved it so much.

1885
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:44,080
I remember the premiere of Doug and Rugrats and Ren and Stimpy.

1886
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:47,080
I definitely remember my childhood before and after.

1887
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:50,080
I remember explaining to my dad, there's these new things now.

1888
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:53,080
There's these shows and it makes me very happy.

1889
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:56,080
My childhood is better now because there are the shows.

1890
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,080
Nickelodeon had original cartoons.

1891
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,080
They'd never done that before.

1892
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:03,080
They showed a lot of Hannah Barbera stuff.

1893
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,080
It was all Inspector Gadget.

1894
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:07,080
It was a repurposed Inspector Gadget.

1895
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,080
A lot of Gadget.

1896
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:09,080
And a weird show with the koalas.

1897
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,080
But now, Nick is doing its own things.

1898
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:14,080
But one of the main Nicktoons becomes a Disney thing.

1899
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,080
It's crazy.

1900
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,080
It becomes a Disney thing.

1901
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,080
I specifically remember the premiere.

1902
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:28,080
And the weeks after, I'm like, this block is, they're all on on Sundays.

1903
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,080
I have to go to church.

1904
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,080
And so I'm sure I was taping them.

1905
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,080
So you mean the new Doug?

1906
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:35,080
No, the original Doug.

1907
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,080
The original Nickelodeon Doug.

1908
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,080
Oh, okay.

1909
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:41,080
Premiered in August of 1991.

1910
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,080
Okay.

1911
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:45,080
And I also premiered in August 1991.

1912
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,080
Oh, yeah.

1913
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:50,080
So we've discovered that my introduction to Doug was Doug Live.

1914
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,080
I was too young to know the show.

1915
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:53,080
I was wondering this.

1916
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:56,080
You were probably more, you were more of a Disney Doug.

1917
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,080
That's where it falls off for me.

1918
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,080
I don't know what's going on on Disney Doug.

1919
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,080
I don't know what happened.

1920
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,080
I don't know anything about Disney Doug.

1921
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:09,080
I knew a little, but I always viewed it as kind of a false Doug.

1922
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:10,080
Whoa.

1923
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,080
These are fine words.

1924
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,080
What do you think of that, Jane?

1925
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,080
This is opposite subtract.

1926
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,080
Go ahead.

1927
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:17,080
To be honest, I'm just like, yeah, that makes sense.

1928
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:21,080
I don't really have anything to fight about because I'm just so much younger than you guys.

1929
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:24,080
So it's just, I'm so much more youthful.

1930
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:30,080
So honestly, I'm really patient with you guys because you have a different lived experience than I do.

1931
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,080
That's true, yeah.

1932
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:36,080
You put up with us older men, these old, we're just a couple of, a bunch of older men.

1933
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,080
I thought you were boys.

1934
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:41,080
Well, we say that to masks that we know, we're old, old men inside.

1935
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,080
Not talking about skincare five seconds ago.

1936
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:49,080
Have I pointed this out that either, because you obviously do the thing of like, you know, appearing youthful and hip.

1937
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:52,080
But there's also a lot of time, and I especially noticed it while I was gone, that you do a lot of like,

1938
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:59,080
well, as an older man, now that I'm aging, now that I'm getting a little bit older in years.

1939
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,080
Thank you, Jane.

1940
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,080
You really fucking got his ass.

1941
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,080
You really knew.

1942
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,080
Jim Carrey and Mike.

1943
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:09,080
But that's like, you either fall into like overcompensating or like over saying that you're old.

1944
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,080
Yeah.

1945
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:11,080
I think that's probably right.

1946
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,080
I don't know.

1947
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:13,080
Finish it.

1948
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:14,080
It's on your mind.

1949
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,080
It's where we need all that red light to blast out of your brain.

1950
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,080
It is on my mind.

1951
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,080
If we could, yeah.

1952
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,080
Well, I want the-

1953
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,080
That's how it works, right?

1954
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,080
It's the eternal sunshine technology.

1955
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,080
Just get the fact that how old I am out of my head.

1956
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,080
It's not, you don't want to reverse aging.

1957
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:29,080
You just want to get rid of the part of your brain that is aware of the aging.

1958
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,080
Yeah.

1959
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,080
Seems like it'll come back.

1960
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:35,080
I think when you're in your 80s, you'll remember you're aging.

1961
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:39,080
We'll get you on a, we'll get your Roblox account, you know.

1962
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,080
We'll get you-

1963
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,080
I don't want to go back that far.

1964
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:44,080
No, we'll get you in the Minecraft movie screenings.

1965
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,080
You'll be throwing stuff.

1966
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:48,080
I think I can get fooled into thinking I'm like eight.

1967
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,080
Yeah.

1968
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:52,080
You play with toys, it's probably not going to be that hard.

1969
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:55,080
Yeah, but they're characters from 40 years ago.

1970
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,080
So it's confusing.

1971
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,080
God.

1972
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,080
It'll be confusing.

1973
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:04,080
So, yeah, so Doug was very big for me when I was very young.

1974
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,080
Then we switched to Disney.

1975
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:10,080
I was like, okay, Patty Mayonnaise has a new haircut.

1976
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,080
That's fine.

1977
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,080
I'm sure some people saw it-

1978
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,080
It's not a Felicity situation.

1979
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,080
It changes everything.

1980
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:18,080
Scott, I was just about to say, I'm sure some people-

1981
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:24,080
I thought that was fine, but it always bugged me that Doug's sleeves got slightly longer.

1982
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,080
I was like-

1983
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,080
I didn't care for that.

1984
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,080
I saw a picture of it.

1985
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,080
I said, this is not for me.

1986
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,080
I don't care for it.

1987
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,080
They're trying to, this isn't Doug.

1988
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,080
Doug is awkward.

1989
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,080
Not Doug to me.

1990
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,080
Doug wouldn't do this.

1991
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,080
He's out of step fashion-wise.

1992
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,080
I'm on the way to see Mystery Man at the movie theater.

1993
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:39,080
I don't care about Doug.

1994
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:41,080
This is not my Doug.

1995
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,080
Generations Doug.

1996
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:47,080
But then after a while, as I was looking up all these timelines,

1997
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:53,080
Disney buys Jumbo Pictures right around the same time they buy ABC.

1998
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:58,080
They're like, we'll put Doug in our Saturday morning block.

1999
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:04,080
By the time Doug the musical premiered, and right around that time Doug's first movie came out,

2000
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:09,080
I would have been 13.

2001
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:16,080
Five-year-old and 13-year-old, while I clung to a lot of my interests,

2002
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:20,080
I was already kind of dug in on the Fox.

2003
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,080
Dug in hat.

2004
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:22,080
Doug.

2005
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:25,080
Doug Funny in on the Fox.

2006
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,080
No, it should have just stayed a duck.

2007
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,080
Okay.

2008
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,080
Come on.

2009
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,080
Polishing Bride's right.

2010
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,080
We're going to talk, Melissa.

2011
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,080
I don't...

2012
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,080
Listen, ball and cheese.

2013
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,080
Okay.

2014
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:36,080
We fight so much.

2015
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,080
Oh, yeah.

2016
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:41,080
I don't know what that meant.

2017
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,080
That had such an air to it.

2018
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,080
I don't know whether to believe it or not.

2019
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,080
We really don't fight a lot.

2020
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,080
We're very good at communicating.

2021
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,080
Yeah, we communicate pretty well.

2022
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,080
That's good.

2023
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:55,080
I was already kind of had my heels dug in on the Fox Kids Kids WB war.

2024
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:58,080
There was a war up between?

2025
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:06,080
I feel like there was a war for Saturday morning ratings because CBS Kids and ABC Kids block,

2026
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:11,080
they were both also doing cartoons, but mostly Disney stuff.

2027
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,080
You wanted to be brand loyal.

2028
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,080
Yeah.

2029
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,080
Now that said, Recess was pulling me away.

2030
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,080
I was a big Recess kid.

2031
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,080
Oh, huge Recess kid.

2032
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,080
Yeah.

2033
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:22,080
Love Recess.

2034
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:24,080
What year does Recess premiere?

2035
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,080
Because I feel like I miss Recess.

2036
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:29,080
Mid to late 90s, I feel like.

2037
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:30,080
I've never seen an episode.

2038
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,080
No, I don't know.

2039
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,080
Really?

2040
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,080
Jack about Recess.

2041
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,080
Oh, it's so good.

2042
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,080
Who's the voice of the main kid?

2043
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,080
He's a famous...

2044
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,080
There's some famous younger actors.

2045
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,080
97 is Recess.

2046
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,080
Okay.

2047
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:42,080
I was like six.

2048
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:48,080
Original Doug Voice, by the way, Billy West, longtime voice actor Billy West.

2049
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:53,080
It's such a sweet, vulnerable performance.

2050
01:11:53,080 --> 01:12:00,080
I think that probably we all hooked onto to some extent that he is this awkward, shy kid

2051
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:04,080
who imagines being less awkward and less shy.

2052
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:10,080
Whereas so much of Billy West's work is more bold and crazy.

2053
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:14,080
I guess Fry is on the awkward...

2054
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,080
Fry is in the zone.

2055
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,080
Fry is kind of a grown Doug in a way.

2056
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,080
That is a good point.

2057
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,080
But it is such a...

2058
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,080
I don't know.

2059
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:23,080
It's very soft, tender kind of performance.

2060
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,080
And that just really shows his range.

2061
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,080
Lives in his head a lot.

2062
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:31,080
Doug always imagining himself a superhero or a secret agent.

2063
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,080
Big imagination.

2064
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,080
Journaling a lot.

2065
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:34,080
More confidence in the...

2066
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,080
Kind of the original Walter Mitty.

2067
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:43,080
That is a fictional story from the 40s and 50s.

2068
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:46,080
We're going to put a hit motion picture of...

2069
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,080
A hit stiller?

2070
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,080
Yeah.

2071
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,080
Do you have...

2072
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,080
Here, I guess, how am I going to put this?

2073
01:12:52,080 --> 01:13:00,080
I don't have so much attachment to Doug now that I'm like, oh, I got to show this to my kid.

2074
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:05,080
There's other cartoons that I feel like I'm still more attached to in my adult years.

2075
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:09,080
I'm saying, is this similar to you or do you really have a strong attachment to Doug?

2076
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:12,080
I don't really remember a ton of the original Doug either.

2077
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:14,080
I was looking on...

2078
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:17,080
Like, you can find Disney Doug on Disney Plus.

2079
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:21,080
You can find the movie and the few seasons of TV.

2080
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:22,080
But not original Doug, you're saying?

2081
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,080
But original Doug, I don't know if it's up...

2082
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,080
I'm sure they're all up on YouTube.

2083
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:28,080
I know Quail Man.

2084
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,080
I know the names of the characters.

2085
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:32,080
I know Banging on a Trash Can.

2086
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,080
Yeah, Banging on a Trash Can.

2087
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,080
The Beats.

2088
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:38,080
I know the Beats is a concept, but I don't know that I can name an episode for.

2089
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,080
I don't remember an episode.

2090
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:44,080
And I had really lost a lot of the character names until this episode came up.

2091
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,080
I recall them now.

2092
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:46,080
Yeah.

2093
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,080
I know Skeeter.

2094
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:48,080
I know his friend Skeeter.

2095
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,080
Skeeter.

2096
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:50,080
Roger Klotz.

2097
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:51,080
Roger Klotz.

2098
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,080
The villainous Roger Klotz.

2099
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,080
That's right.

2100
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,080
Patty Mayonnaise.

2101
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,080
I wish we didn't have to meet him in Doug Live.

2102
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,080
I know.

2103
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:58,080
But unfortunately, he's part of the...

2104
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,080
Unfortunately.

2105
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:04,080
Interesting fact, there's some cool projection stuff going on in this.

2106
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:09,080
And Skeeter and Roger and Patty kind of come out of the projection.

2107
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:11,080
Goosebumps every time when I saw it as a kid.

2108
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,080
Fuck.

2109
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,080
I was like, oh!

2110
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,080
Like, every time.

2111
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,080
Wow, really?

2112
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:18,080
How old were you when you saw it for the first time?

2113
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,080
I don't know.

2114
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,080
What does that work out to be?

2115
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,080
I guess 99 or 2001.

2116
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,080
99.

2117
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,080
Well, just do the math backwards from being so much younger than us.

2118
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:24,080
Just start there and then go back to 99.

2119
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,080
I was like six months old.

2120
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:30,080
No, yeah, probably like eight or nine then.

2121
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:33,080
I feel like I was younger than that.

2122
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:35,080
But, oh, every time.

2123
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,080
I was so fucking stoked.

2124
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,080
Wait, sorry.

2125
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:47,080
Doug is journaling or drawing as he is in the opening of both iterations of the show.

2126
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:53,080
And he draws his friends and then they burst out of his notebook pages and live on stage

2127
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,080
in front of you.

2128
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,080
It was so cool.

2129
01:14:55,080 --> 01:15:00,080
That's probably the biggest special effect production value of this show.

2130
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:01,080
Yeah.

2131
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,080
So Goosebumps always.

2132
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,080
You saw this a lot.

2133
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,080
Tell us about your connection.

2134
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,080
Like almost every weekend.

2135
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:12,080
Because when I was little, we lived in Orlando from like five till maybe 10, 11 years.

2136
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:15,080
And we had passes and my whole family would go every weekend.

2137
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:17,080
And we always saw this show.

2138
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:19,080
This show was really sentimental to my whole family.

2139
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,080
We still sing the songs.

2140
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:23,080
I went, Mom, I'm going to do this show and talk about Doug Live.

2141
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:24,080
She went, Oh, my God.

2142
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,080
And I was like, Mom, no, I think everyone hates it.

2143
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,080
She was like, why?

2144
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:29,080
And she started singing one of the songs.

2145
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:30,080
I was like, I know.

2146
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,080
It's really devastating.

2147
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:34,080
She got sad.

2148
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:35,080
She was like, really?

2149
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,080
I love Doug Live.

2150
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,080
And I was like, I know.

2151
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:40,080
Well, do we think people hate it?

2152
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:43,080
At the time, again, I was 13, 14.

2153
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,080
Like I was leaving middle school, starting high school.

2154
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:50,080
So I think I was a little like stuck out.

2155
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,080
I don't know.

2156
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,080
Punk?

2157
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,080
Yeah.

2158
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,080
So you were saying you didn't like it?

2159
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,080
Because I never saw this at the park.

2160
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,080
Oh, I saw it.

2161
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,080
You really didn't?

2162
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,080
No, I didn't.

2163
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:01,080
I know it was there.

2164
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,080
I saw it once or twice.

2165
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:06,080
And this eventually theater became the American Idol experience.

2166
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:07,080
Yes.

2167
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:12,080
Well, between Doug Live ended and Doug Live was replaced by nothing.

2168
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:15,080
It sat vacant for seven years or so.

2169
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:18,080
And then it was replaced by a pretty disliked attraction.

2170
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:21,080
There's no way it's close, I don't think, to American Idol.

2171
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:25,080
I don't think to American Idol experience as far as dislike.

2172
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:28,080
And now it's like, it's one of these Frozen things.

2173
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:32,080
You'll know we're getting to the end when we do the episode for the first time in forever.

2174
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,080
Frozen sing a lot.

2175
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,080
We're like, we are out.

2176
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,080
We are out.

2177
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,080
We're out of fucking restaurants to talk about.

2178
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,080
It's true.

2179
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:41,080
Jason, you didn't like Doug Live.

2180
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,080
You have a memory of not liking it.

2181
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,080
Yeah.

2182
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:49,080
I think when I first, when I saw it at the time, I didn't love it.

2183
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:54,080
We watched a pretty decent video rip of it last night.

2184
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:57,080
And I was like, okay, I kind of like this.

2185
01:16:57,080 --> 01:17:02,080
And I think I really appreciated the audience participation.

2186
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:06,080
Let me ask, did you or any of your family ever get picked for the show?

2187
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,080
No.

2188
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,080
And I would have been so scared.

2189
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:12,080
You guys, there's a part where they all come down to the front of the, like, audience,

2190
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,080
like just off the stage.

2191
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,080
I was like freaking out.

2192
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:17,080
I was so scared of Roger.

2193
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:20,080
I would like tuck my legs and I'd be like, I don't want to go in here.

2194
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,080
I don't want to go in here.

2195
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:22,080
So no, I would have been freaking out.

2196
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,080
Well, he's terrifying looking.

2197
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:28,080
The green makeup and the nose and he's like.

2198
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:34,080
And you were probably also frazzled by the fact that in the cartoon animation on the

2199
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:38,080
back of the set, he's wearing his attire from Disney's Doug.

2200
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:43,080
But during the show, he's wearing his leather jacket from Nickelodeon's Doug.

2201
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:45,080
And that's a pretty big oversight.

2202
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:49,080
You could change wardrobe when you jump out of a notebook page.

2203
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,080
I don't think so.

2204
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,080
I don't believe it.

2205
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:53,080
Get your animation in check, funny.

2206
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:54,080
Geez.

2207
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,080
Nice.

2208
01:17:55,080 --> 01:18:01,080
This, here's what, is this controversial to say that I find all the characters scary?

2209
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,080
No, I got it.

2210
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,080
They all have an odd.

2211
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:06,080
Now, I'm not saying I don't like it because like I like Zubili Zoo, this old show that

2212
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:09,080
had a bunch of scary looking animal characters.

2213
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,080
I've heard of that.

2214
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,080
I don't know it.

2215
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:12,080
It's old.

2216
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:13,080
It's old.

2217
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,080
You wouldn't.

2218
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,080
I'm not saying this with them through time.

2219
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:18,080
Nobody, we aren't bringing Zubili Zoo along for the ride.

2220
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,080
Not yet.

2221
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:20,080
As time marches on.

2222
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,080
Well, we might be, but.

2223
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,080
Not yet.

2224
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,080
But yeah, so I'm not saying it's not a bad thing.

2225
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:28,080
I'm just saying that like when I'm watching this now, I go, God, these are all unnerving

2226
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,080
characters.

2227
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:35,080
Well, because they make, and if you're unfamiliar with Doug, it's like, you know, like The Simpsons,

2228
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:40,080
it makes color choices with the characters, crazy cartoon color choices.

2229
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,080
Yeah.

2230
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:47,080
So if you iterate something like this in a live setting, you have to decide how to represent

2231
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:50,080
the weird, kooky colors that all of the characters are.

2232
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:57,080
And you've got like, you know, you've got like Roger is green and Skeeter is like aqua

2233
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:59,080
and Patty is kind of orange.

2234
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:00,080
Orange.

2235
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,080
They go sort of orange.

2236
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:06,080
And when you put them, and then, and then the dog Porkchop is like, he's like a light

2237
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,080
gray.

2238
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,080
So there's a lot of face paint going around in general.

2239
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:15,080
Put them all together is a lightly terrifying nature to this.

2240
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:18,080
I'm not saying it was the wrong decision, but you know what?

2241
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:24,080
It's somewhere between the fact that there's like, there's like also a lot of weird smoothness.

2242
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:29,080
I feel like Roger especially is like, he feels shaved on the sides.

2243
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:31,080
He's got like a Macklemore thing going on.

2244
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,080
He shaved on the sides.

2245
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:39,080
And then the makeup covers his real eyebrows and then false eyebrows are drawn on top.

2246
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:45,080
And then Skeeter, a choice I don't even recall from the cartoon is that Skeeter only has

2247
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:48,080
one eyebrow, but they keep this alive in the live production.

2248
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:54,080
So he has this odd just floating eyebrow that feels like it was left on by mistake.

2249
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:58,080
I know, but like from the audience, I feel like it works because that stage is really

2250
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:01,080
big and it doesn't get filled completely.

2251
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,080
So I feel like it reads from the audience.

2252
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:07,080
But if you're taking a backstage picture, it's going to look funky.

2253
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:10,080
When you group them all together, when you clump them, it's like, oh, that's a lot of

2254
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,080
paint.

2255
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:13,080
It wasn't meant to be a production that they film.

2256
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:16,080
This is all from home movies we're watching now in hindsight.

2257
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:21,080
They were making the characters just so they would appear correct in the audience.

2258
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:22,080
Yeah.

2259
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,080
Yeah.

2260
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:24,080
It's not.

2261
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:30,080
I mean, do you think the Zubals are scarier than the Doug Live people or are they on par

2262
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,080
from Zubali Zoo?

2263
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,080
I mean, these are more cats like these are like Andrew Lloyd Webber.

2264
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,080
They're a little like cats.

2265
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,080
They're a little Starlight Express.

2266
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:38,080
Yeah.

2267
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,080
And they're called the Zubals.

2268
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:41,080
I don't think I knew that they were Zubals.

2269
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:42,080
They say it in the opening theme.

2270
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,080
Zubali Zoo.

2271
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:46,080
Let's introduce the Zubals to you.

2272
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,080
Ben Verene is one of those Zubals.

2273
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,080
Oh, nice.

2274
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,080
Yeah.

2275
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,080
I think there's just a lot more going.

2276
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,080
Oh, cool.

2277
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,080
A lot more going on.

2278
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:57,080
Jane's like, yes, turn it around, please.

2279
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:59,080
I don't want to see the Zubals anymore, please.

2280
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:00,080
Ben Verene.

2281
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,080
That's why I'm like, yeah, that's great.

2282
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,080
Also, shout out to cats.

2283
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:04,080
Shout out to Betty Buckley, my girl.

2284
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,080
We love her.

2285
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:06,080
Icon legend.

2286
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:07,080
She's cool.

2287
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,080
But was she ever in Zubali Zoo?

2288
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,080
Fuck off, Michael.

2289
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:10,080
You got one, too.

2290
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,080
Oh, boy.

2291
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:12,080
About even.

2292
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,080
It's from love.

2293
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:14,080
Jason got one, too.

2294
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,080
I'm just kidding.

2295
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:24,080
We're all, everybody's getting it.

2296
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,080
Mike deserved that for not turning the laptop around.

2297
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:30,080
I need to make sure you have fully absorbed each Zubal.

2298
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:34,080
I'd also like to say, can I just vocalize, I love Zubali Zoo.

2299
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,080
And I'd love to do an episode about it.

2300
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:40,080
I hope this is the way that I could get out of doing an episode about it.

2301
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:45,080
So I wouldn't be mad at all if we did an episode about Zubali Zoo.

2302
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:46,080
Next week?

2303
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,080
I think we should do one next week, baby.

2304
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:49,080
The loud words he's saying are good.

2305
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:51,080
They feel good to me.

2306
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,080
They feel good for me to say.

2307
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,080
I feel good when I look at that picture.

2308
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:57,080
I'd feel good if we set one up soon.

2309
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:59,080
I like everything that I'm hearing.

2310
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:02,080
Did you all know that Porkchop is supposed to be a bull terrier?

2311
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,080
What?

2312
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,080
I didn't know the breed.

2313
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,080
No, I did not know that.

2314
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:10,080
I looked that up, and I was very surprised.

2315
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,080
Like a Spuds McKenzie kind of.

2316
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,080
You looked it up?

2317
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:14,080
Where did you look it up?

2318
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:16,080
Just on Wikipedia.

2319
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:20,080
I just kept following rabbit holes and Wikipedia and fandom.

2320
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,080
Yeah, I didn't know.

2321
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:22,080
Yeah, I didn't know.

2322
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,080
You know what?

2323
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:25,080
I won't breed what I even imagined Porkchop was.

2324
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,080
I don't know.

2325
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,080
It's just dog.

2326
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,080
Just cartoon dog.

2327
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,080
Like a mutt or something.

2328
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,080
General.

2329
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,080
Breed.

2330
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,080
General dog.

2331
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:36,080
So yeah, it makes sense.

2332
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,080
Yeah, when they do like...

2333
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:39,080
I'm trying to think.

2334
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:40,080
There's like peanuts.

2335
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:43,080
When you see like You're a Good Man Charlie Brown or something,

2336
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:45,080
they didn't decide...

2337
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:49,080
I've seen this show a couple times, You're a Good Man Charlie Brown.

2338
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:52,080
They oftentimes don't make a big paper mache head

2339
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,080
that would mimic the peanuts characters on stage.

2340
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,080
But they have to sometimes.

2341
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:57,080
The costumes don't really over the top.

2342
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:59,080
They do the shirts and stuff, for sure.

2343
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:01,080
The shirts do the heavy lifting.

2344
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:04,080
But some production out there must have done big scary heads.

2345
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,080
Do you think so?

2346
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,080
Where they take a lot of pipe cleaners

2347
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:10,080
and put them together to make Charlie Brown's hair swish.

2348
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,080
Well, there's a sketch.

2349
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,080
There's a Saturday Night Live sketch, right?

2350
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:13,080
With Martin Short or something.

2351
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:14,080
Did they do it?

2352
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,080
Yeah, yeah.

2353
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:16,080
I can't think of...

2354
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:17,080
That was pretty good.

2355
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:18,080
Did they do the heads in that one?

2356
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,080
They did the heads.

2357
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:21,080
There's a much older sketch with Brendan Fraser,

2358
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,080
where...

2359
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:24,080
I fucked that up.

2360
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,080
I always forget Fraser Fraser.

2361
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,080
Fraser.

2362
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:28,080
You said it right.

2363
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,080
So I did it right.

2364
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:31,080
But it's so weird that he didn't say it right.

2365
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:32,080
It's a Pepo Pepo thing.

2366
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,080
But where they did crazy make-up,

2367
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:38,080
to purposefully terrifying effect.

2368
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,080
Right.

2369
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,080
So I get the choice.

2370
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:44,080
It's just funny now watching it on grainy VHS 25 years later.

2371
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:47,080
I just think you could have skipped the fact

2372
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:51,080
that the Doug characters have crazy colors.

2373
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:53,080
Because Doug himself does not.

2374
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:55,080
So Doug is just normal.

2375
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:56,080
Well, what do you think?

2376
01:23:56,080 --> 01:24:00,080
I think that that's a very beautiful way

2377
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:02,080
of kind of showing him as the lead

2378
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:05,080
and all the colorful characters in his life.

2379
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:06,080
Sure.

2380
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,080
Metaphorically as well.

2381
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,080
Because he's kind of new in town

2382
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:12,080
and he meets all of these groups from all stripes.

2383
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,080
Not even necessarily like they're kooks,

2384
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:16,080
but I think it's a cute way to go like,

2385
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:20,080
it's from this person's perspective.

2386
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:21,080
I don't know.

2387
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:22,080
I just thought about that.

2388
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,080
I was like, oh, this is actually kind of cute.

2389
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:27,080
Maybe it's just to kind of represent the...

2390
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:31,080
His family is all kind of regular.

2391
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:32,080
Well, what's funny is...

2392
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:35,080
They're like regular, but the neighbor's purple.

2393
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,080
He feels like he doesn't fit in,

2394
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:39,080
but he's the most quote unquote

2395
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:41,080
stereotypical normal looking person,

2396
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:43,080
which is also something I think worth thinking about.

2397
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:46,080
Well, I think it shows you the...

2398
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:51,080
I think I attached to Doug from the vantage point

2399
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:53,080
of the stuff in your head

2400
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:56,080
and how the stuff in your head can swally up

2401
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:59,080
and stuff that you don't even need to be thinking about.

2402
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:01,080
It doesn't need to be wearing you down.

2403
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:03,080
I mean, for example, that the entire thing

2404
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:06,080
is his secret crush is on Patty Mayonnaise,

2405
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:09,080
and how can he ever tell Patty Mayonnaise that he...

2406
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:11,080
How can I ever put this together with the girl

2407
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,080
who's exceedingly nice to me,

2408
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:15,080
with me every day at all times,

2409
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,080
affectionate to me,

2410
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:20,080
sweeter to me than the other boys?

2411
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:24,080
It's funny that the unrequitedness is the runner

2412
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:27,080
where like, oh, Doug, oh, Doug, come on.

2413
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:29,080
It's right there, Doug.

2414
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,080
Basically, you're a girlfriend already, Doug.

2415
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:31,080
Just do it.

2416
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:33,080
But that's the kind of kid I needed.

2417
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,080
And I know you were this way too.

2418
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,080
I was just like needing...

2419
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,080
I need like all...

2420
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,080
Like a regular kid might just need like a vague green light.

2421
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:44,080
We need like 100 levels of green light to know to...

2422
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:45,080
Can I say this?

2423
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:46,080
When watching some Doug...

2424
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,080
No.

2425
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:48,080
Well, just allow it,

2426
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,080
and I can cut it out if you don't allow it.

2427
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:51,080
Okay.

2428
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:55,080
I empathize with Doug so much

2429
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,080
and what you're saying about Doug,

2430
01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:00,080
so much so that I can't stand Doug.

2431
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:02,080
I don't want to watch him.

2432
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:03,080
If you just go back to like,

2433
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:04,080
this is young me a little bit.

2434
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:07,080
Because he drives me insane because it reminds me of myself

2435
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,080
and I'm being serious.

2436
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,080
This is...

2437
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,080
Wow.

2438
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,080
He's so...

2439
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:12,080
Come on.

2440
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,080
God, don't act like such a loser, Doug.

2441
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,080
This is the dialogue I was having today

2442
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,080
when I was going through some stuff.

2443
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:18,080
You might as well be saying Mike.

2444
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,080
You might as well be saying...

2445
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:20,080
Yes.

2446
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,080
Wait, we dislike what we see in others

2447
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,080
when we see ourselves.

2448
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,080
Yes, so I'm annoyed with Doug

2449
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:28,080
because he reminds me of a loser-ish me.

2450
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:29,080
Wow.

2451
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:30,080
That's heavy.

2452
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:35,080
I very much loved TV's and film growing up and I...

2453
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:36,080
TV's and film.

2454
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,080
TV's and film.

2455
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:38,080
TV's and film.

2456
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,080
TV and film growing up.

2457
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,080
Sure.

2458
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,080
And it was all this stuff about kids,

2459
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:48,080
boys having crushes and unrequited crushes

2460
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,080
and if they say they like someone,

2461
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:50,080
they don't like them.

2462
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,080
Their life is over.

2463
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,080
And it wasn't until I was much older

2464
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:56,080
that so many of the people writing this

2465
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,080
were antisocial weirdos.

2466
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:04,080
Were like, ah, I will either show my childhood

2467
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:08,080
in an affectionate way or I will be like,

2468
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:11,080
I'll write when I never had to.

2469
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:12,080
You know?

2470
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,080
Well, that was scary.

2471
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:14,080
Yeah.

2472
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,080
It was ominous.

2473
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:16,080
How does it feel to be...

2474
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:19,080
You're having anxiety watching the show

2475
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:20,080
because you connect to Doug so much

2476
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:23,080
and here we are on your post-wedding episode.

2477
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:26,080
Does it feel nice to feel like there's a happy ending

2478
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:29,080
to the story as if Doug and Patty had gotten married?

2479
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:30,080
Yeah.

2480
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,080
I found my Patty mayonnaise.

2481
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:35,080
I did briefly get out of my own way.

2482
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:36,080
Sure.

2483
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,080
That's nice.

2484
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:39,080
Because I put myself there in the way

2485
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:42,080
and I said, you are not getting past this.

2486
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,080
I'm in the way now.

2487
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:45,080
This is your life now.

2488
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:46,080
This is my way.

2489
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,080
I'm just kidding.

2490
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:48,080
That's kind of nice.

2491
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,080
Yeah.

2492
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:50,080
Our first date I said, oh,

2493
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:51,080
what do you think you'll have for lunch?

2494
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:54,080
And you just grabbed my ear and was like, come on.

2495
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,080
What?

2496
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:56,080
Enough of this business.

2497
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,080
I was so...

2498
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:58,080
I'm a very different person now

2499
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,080
because I had a lot of therapy,

2500
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:00,080
but I was very nervous

2501
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:02,080
and I never wanted anyone to spend money on me

2502
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:03,080
because I felt terrible.

2503
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:05,080
So I was like, just some pita bread.

2504
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:07,080
I didn't even order a meal

2505
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:09,080
because I was like, you don't have to spend money on me.

2506
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:12,080
Did Jason also say, though, keep it under $10, please?

2507
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,080
Hey!

2508
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,080
No!

2509
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:17,080
All right, just wanted to check.

2510
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:19,080
I was like, I don't want him to spend money on me.

2511
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:21,080
I'll just get something really cheap.

2512
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:23,080
Well, I get that.

2513
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:24,080
I understand that.

2514
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:25,080
Where were we?

2515
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:26,080
Can we get back to the show?

2516
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:27,080
Like the live show?

2517
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:28,080
Yeah.

2518
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:30,080
I feel like I have a lot of cool perspective things

2519
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,080
from a theme park performer perspective

2520
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,080
that I noticed.

2521
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:34,080
Oh, please.

2522
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,080
I thought was really interesting.

2523
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:40,080
The first thing I noticed was

2524
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:43,080
there are five on mic characters,

2525
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:47,080
and then they bring on audience participation.

2526
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:49,080
A few things of note to me.

2527
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:50,080
To me, that goes, hey,

2528
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:52,080
we have the budget for five equity performers.

2529
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:55,080
Figure it out for the rest of the performers.

2530
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,080
Yeah, that's right.

2531
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:57,080
Yeah, those rubes in the audio,

2532
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:59,080
they don't know they're supposed to be getting paid.

2533
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:00,080
It's the same money.

2534
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:02,080
We can't pay four beats every night.

2535
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,080
Let's get audience members.

2536
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:05,080
Okay, they're in this one scene.

2537
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:07,080
They're not paying people to do that,

2538
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:08,080
and they're not on mics.

2539
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:09,080
It would be a different thing anyway.

2540
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:10,080
I'm like, they're not paying people for that.

2541
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:13,080
I forgot that they were the adult audience members.

2542
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:14,080
My next thought was,

2543
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:18,080
they would never put people on a turntable

2544
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,080
with props willy-nilly like that.

2545
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:21,080
Never!

2546
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,080
They would never do that.

2547
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,080
When I did Fantasia on the turntable thing,

2548
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,080
I had to practice it a bunch of times for safety.

2549
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:29,080
They would never throw people on a turntable.

2550
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:30,080
I'm serious.

2551
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,080
They would never do that.

2552
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:32,080
That's interesting.

2553
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,080
Okay, okay, yes.

2554
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:38,080
Parents are picked in an embarrassed dad dance competition,

2555
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:42,080
and the reward is that you get to be the band, the beats,

2556
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:47,080
and some of the show is oriented around a big beats concert.

2557
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:48,080
When they appear,

2558
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:51,080
they are revealed via a big turntable

2559
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:53,080
that shows the concert set.

2560
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:55,080
I'm not saying it's dangerous necessarily,

2561
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:58,080
but that stuff has to be rehearsed with a turntable.

2562
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,080
Interesting.

2563
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:00,080
It probably is a little dangerous.

2564
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:01,080
I wonder how they got away.

2565
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:03,080
Was it just a less regulated time?

2566
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:04,080
I know it was.

2567
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,080
I know that not long after,

2568
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:08,080
what I associate this era with is Disney

2569
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,080
starting to get a little more careful about this stuff,

2570
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:12,080
and just things like there's two tiny steps

2571
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:15,080
that lead you up to the wishing fountain

2572
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:16,080
behind the castle or whatever.

2573
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,080
Better put bright yellow tape on that

2574
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:21,080
so nobody trips and falls and sues us.

2575
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:24,080
That kind of thing was starting to happen around this time,

2576
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:26,080
maybe right after this time.

2577
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,080
This is the fact that there's a bunch of parents

2578
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:29,080
on a turntable.

2579
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:30,080
It is a pre-litigious Disney move.

2580
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:32,080
I feel like they would never just throw people up there

2581
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:33,080
like that.

2582
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:34,080
That's interesting.

2583
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:36,080
That stood out to me.

2584
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:37,080
Risky.

2585
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:42,080
Threat lawsuits always around every corner with this show.

2586
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:46,080
And then I always had a little crush on Doug.

2587
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:50,080
I always liked little nerds that you'd never know.

2588
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:51,080
What?

2589
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:52,080
What's up?

2590
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:54,080
I always liked cute little nervous nerds.

2591
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,080
You're not really nervous.

2592
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,080
You're quite confident.

2593
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:58,080
But you still are very cute.

2594
01:30:58,080 --> 01:30:59,080
Thank you.

2595
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:05,080
Well, BDE, to quote the previous episode,

2596
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:07,080
to quote former guest Jane Cleary.

2597
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:09,080
Hello.

2598
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:15,080
Yes, my husband has a huge personality.

2599
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:17,080
Oh, OK.

2600
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:18,080
There we go.

2601
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:21,080
I am very satisfied.

2602
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:22,080
Oh, boy.

2603
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,080
He was just talking about the energy.

2604
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:26,080
He was talking about the energy, to be fair to Scott.

2605
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,080
I was talking about the E and not the D.

2606
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:29,080
He said the E.

2607
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:30,080
I didn't even say it was B.

2608
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,080
That's fine.

2609
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:32,080
I mean, whatever you want to say, it's fine.

2610
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:33,080
I was talking about the E and not the D.

2611
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:34,080
I don't know if there was B.

2612
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,080
I like to try to make you two as uncomfortable as possible

2613
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:37,080
sometimes.

2614
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:38,080
I love it.

2615
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:39,080
I don't take much.

2616
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:41,080
That's why I.

2617
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:43,080
The secret to me, as the Hulk would say,

2618
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:45,080
is I'm always uncomfortable.

2619
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:48,080
You're so funny.

2620
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:49,080
So I always like that.

2621
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:51,080
I'm going to jump to talking about the music.

2622
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:52,080
Is that OK?

2623
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,080
Please.

2624
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:56,080
So before we get to what we listened to this morning.

2625
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:57,080
Right.

2626
01:31:57,080 --> 01:32:01,080
The music really hit me in a way.

2627
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:06,080
21 Jumbo Street was always so nice and made me

2628
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:07,080
feel so many different feelings.

2629
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:10,080
So that music really did hit me.

2630
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:14,080
And yeah, I remembered so much of it.

2631
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:16,080
But I'm like, yeah, that song in particular,

2632
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:19,080
I think it made me feel so happy.

2633
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:20,080
I don't know.

2634
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:21,080
It was so nice.

2635
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:22,080
That's nice.

2636
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:25,080
This is kind of opening number, and it's reprised at the end.

2637
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:27,080
It's sort of the meet the cast.

2638
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:29,080
The show is happening in full now.

2639
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:30,080
Yeah.

2640
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,080
I also like the anybody else at all.

2641
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:35,080
The anybody else at all.

2642
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:38,080
When Doug's like, I wish I was not me, you know?

2643
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:40,080
I like that one.

2644
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:43,080
Do you feel like you're looking at these songs better

2645
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:46,080
than a theme park musical might ever have a right to be?

2646
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:48,080
Like they stick with you longer than?

2647
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:51,080
I'm not going to go so extreme on that.

2648
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:54,080
But I will say there was a lot of heart in 21 Jumbo Street.

2649
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:55,080
I don't know.

2650
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:56,080
I think they captured the vulnerability

2651
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:57,080
pretty well in that.

2652
01:32:57,080 --> 01:32:58,080
21 Jumbo Street is the best of the songs.

2653
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:59,080
I think so too.

2654
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:02,080
That's the only one I remember from watching this.

2655
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:05,080
Yeah, this morning we listened to a podcast

2656
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:09,080
with the two writers of the music for the show.

2657
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:12,080
And it was really, really interesting.

2658
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:15,080
The best part was when they talked about Eisner

2659
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:17,080
coming to watch it.

2660
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:20,080
And Scott just leaned forward.

2661
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:21,080
Scott just like leaned forward.

2662
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:22,080
Let me be clear.

2663
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:23,080
I've been leaning forward through it.

2664
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:24,080
It's not as if I was back the whole time.

2665
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:25,080
No, no, no.

2666
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:26,080
But you were like, oh, what's up?

2667
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,080
I played it cool, though.

2668
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:28,080
I wanted to lean forward.

2669
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:29,080
So they said.

2670
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:30,080
You're always uncomfortable

2671
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,080
unless Eisner is being talked about.

2672
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:32,080
Oh, I feel good.

2673
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,080
I just like because we always talk about like,

2674
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:35,080
do we think Eisner had to approve this?

2675
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:36,080
Did he have to watch it?

2676
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:37,080
The fact that he came and watched Doug Lime.

2677
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:39,080
I was going to say, I have information for you.

2678
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:41,080
The sale of the Jumbo.

2679
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:42,080
What the company's name?

2680
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:43,080
Jumbo Pictures.

2681
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:45,080
Did Michael Eisner say Jumbo Pictures?

2682
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:46,080
He had to have.

2683
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:47,080
Jumbo.

2684
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,080
So anyway, go ahead.

2685
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:52,080
So when they were going to have him come to the rehearsal,

2686
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,080
they made a huge note and a huge thing about

2687
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:55,080
everyone wanted everything to be perfect.

2688
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:57,080
They were straightening things on the wall.

2689
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:59,080
They had all these like things laid out for him

2690
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:01,080
because they were like so nervous about it.

2691
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:02,080
I just thought that was funny.

2692
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:06,080
But when he watched it, he said,

2693
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:09,080
oh, you need to put in a radio song like for the beats,

2694
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:10,080
a beat song.

2695
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:11,080
You need to put in a radio song.

2696
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:13,080
And they were like, that was our note from Eisner

2697
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:15,080
and thought it was really interesting.

2698
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:18,080
They also talked about Fantasmic opening around the same time.

2699
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:22,080
And so they got to go to the dress rehearsal for Fantasmic.

2700
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:23,080
And I just thought that was really cool.

2701
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:26,080
And it kind of inspired them in how the animation

2702
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:29,080
and the live were combined.

2703
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:31,080
And something else that was really funny,

2704
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:36,080
they said, is they were rehearsing in the parking lot of MGM.

2705
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:38,080
And when they were on break,

2706
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:40,080
there were these two bushes that they would go through

2707
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:41,080
to go into the park and ride rides

2708
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:43,080
and then come back, these two composers.

2709
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:44,080
Whoa, wow.

2710
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:46,080
And I was like, oh my God.

2711
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:48,080
There was a security breach.

2712
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,080
Truthfully, it sounded like they were like,

2713
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:52,080
yeah, we would just go ride some rides and come back.

2714
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:53,080
Wow.

2715
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:58,080
But they were hired on just to write the music.

2716
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:00,080
And they weren't even invited to the opening and stuff.

2717
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:02,080
It was like, for hire, OK, you're done now, bye.

2718
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:04,080
So they were like, we weren't really included

2719
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:06,080
in a lot of that stuff.

2720
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:10,080
But yeah, I just thought all of that was quite interesting.

2721
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,080
And they wrote so many more songs, apparently,

2722
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:15,080
which, yeah, that's usually what happens.

2723
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:18,080
Their names were Jeffrey Lewidan and William Squire.

2724
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,080
And they were interviewed on this podcast called

2725
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:25,080
The Tiara Talk Show, which has come up in the past.

2726
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:29,080
But specifically, they said the Fantasmic dress rehearsal

2727
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:32,080
was the middle of the night in the park.

2728
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:36,080
And they sat directly behind Michael Eisner to watch this.

2729
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:37,080
So he gave notes.

2730
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:39,080
It was in the same span of time where he saw Dog Live

2731
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:42,080
and Fantasmic, and where he's given out

2732
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:44,080
those genius little nuggets that would help

2733
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:47,080
to cement these shows as legendary.

2734
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:50,080
And when they are putting in a radio thing,

2735
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:56,080
that is an early episode of the Nickelodeon Doug,

2736
01:35:56,080 --> 01:36:01,080
where Doug and Skeeter win tickets to a beats show.

2737
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:04,080
And then Skeeter gets grounded and can't go.

2738
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:06,080
And Doug the Ops hang out with Skeeter.

2739
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:09,080
They go to the mall shop, and the beats show up.

2740
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:11,080
So maybe Michael Eisner had seen this.

2741
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:13,080
He goes, you know the one with Skeeter where he gets grounded

2742
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:15,080
and Doug and him are going to the beats?

2743
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:17,080
We have to do something like that.

2744
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:18,080
It's a great episode.

2745
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:20,080
Have you seen it aired in 1990?

2746
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:22,080
Well, let's jump the shark since.

2747
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:24,080
Frankly, I'm disappointed with Disney's Doug.

2748
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:25,080
I thought they peaked back then.

2749
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:26,080
Disney's Doug.

2750
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:29,080
I'll sell Jumbo as soon as I can

2751
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:31,080
if the quality doesn't increase.

2752
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:32,080
Breck loves it.

2753
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:34,080
He's 20, and he loves Doug.

2754
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:37,080
They said that even before the Disney sale,

2755
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:41,080
they were working on some sort of Doug musical thing

2756
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:44,080
that Jim Jenkins, the creator of Doug,

2757
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:48,080
was hoping to license out to schools and stuff.

2758
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:52,080
For school performances, which I did think was actually real.

2759
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:55,080
I'm like, oh yeah, that kind of sounds right.

2760
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:56,080
A touring.

2761
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:58,080
Either for a touring for people to come to schools

2762
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:00,080
or I guess people to put it on buzz.

2763
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:04,080
That is a good children's entertainment touring show

2764
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,080
if they flushed it out maybe a little bit more.

2765
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:11,080
I crafted it to be doable for middle school budgets.

2766
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:12,080
Yeah, all that stuff.

2767
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:14,080
Nice little play that people can put on easily.

2768
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:16,080
But then every middle school would have the choice

2769
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:18,080
of do we do the face paint?

2770
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,080
Can we afford the face paint?

2771
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:22,080
Are people going to be afraid of the face paint?

2772
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:25,080
Jim Jenkins, by the way, if you look him up,

2773
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:27,080
Doug is very autobiographical.

2774
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:30,080
He's been very clear about that.

2775
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:36,080
Even the name Patty Mayonnaise was a portmanteau

2776
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:38,080
of girls he had crushes on.

2777
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:40,080
Sally Mustard.

2778
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,080
Yeah, Sally Mustard.

2779
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:42,080
Oh, you know her too?

2780
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:44,080
She was a latte.

2781
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:46,080
I just saw her.

2782
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:50,080
But if you look at older Jim Jenkins,

2783
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:55,080
you still look like an older Doug.

2784
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:58,080
He kind of has a Doug vibe about him.

2785
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:02,080
Honestly, I'm shocked we haven't gotten a Doug reboot.

2786
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:04,080
You know, Doug and Patty are married,

2787
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:05,080
and you're their kid.

2788
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:07,080
I mean, we got that with Boy Meets World.

2789
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:10,080
There's been no talk of new Doug?

2790
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:12,080
I haven't seen any.

2791
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:13,080
He perfected it with the live show,

2792
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:15,080
so you really just don't want to touch it at this point.

2793
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:17,080
You're always going to be chasing Doug live, yes.

2794
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:18,080
Yeah, why even try?

2795
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:20,080
Yeah, well, I mean, look, I'm glad.

2796
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:22,080
I don't want to see Doug ever again.

2797
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,080
Is this a personal thing?

2798
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:25,080
Yeah, it's too dark for you.

2799
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:26,080
I don't want to see Jim Jenkins' face

2800
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:27,080
that looks like old Doug.

2801
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:29,080
That's really what I don't want to see.

2802
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:30,080
It reminds me of myself.

2803
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:32,080
If your daughter starts watching new Doug

2804
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:34,080
on Disney Plus or whatever,

2805
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:37,080
and then you scare her by standing up and saying,

2806
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:38,080
stop that Doug!

2807
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,080
Yeah.

2808
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:40,080
Get your act together, Doug!

2809
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,080
Right.

2810
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:42,080
Throw some nuts, Doug!

2811
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:43,080
Come on, Doug.

2812
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:45,080
Mike throws a plate at a woman.

2813
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:46,080
Yeah.

2814
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,080
Sit to this!

2815
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:48,080
You're 49, Doug.

2816
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:52,080
You shouldn't be awkward anymore.

2817
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:53,080
Work on yourself.

2818
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:54,080
Sorry.

2819
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,080
There you go.

2820
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:58,080
We also were talking about,

2821
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:00,080
when I was saying there's five roles in the show,

2822
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:02,080
because Roger doubles, obviously,

2823
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:03,080
as the bad guy in that one scene,

2824
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:06,080
which, as a kid, I was fucking terrified of, by the way.

2825
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:07,080
Oh, yeah.

2826
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:08,080
What's his bad guy name?

2827
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:10,080
Dr. Professor Rubbersuit?

2828
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:11,080
Yeah.

2829
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:12,080
Is that right?

2830
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,080
Yeah.

2831
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:18,080
But I was like, what is the most involved,

2832
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:20,080
not really involved role, but I'm like,

2833
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:22,080
what would be the hardest track for this?

2834
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,080
And I was like, well, Doug's on stage the whole time,

2835
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:27,080
so probably him, but I went, that fucking dog,

2836
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:31,080
he is doing stage crew work while he's performing,

2837
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:32,080
and very physical.

2838
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:34,080
So while he's not singing,

2839
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:38,080
when the quail, the head thing falls off of him

2840
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:39,080
when he's putting the helmet on

2841
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:41,080
and the quail man's belt falls off,

2842
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:44,080
you see the dog sneak in the background and grab it,

2843
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:46,080
and then when they do the quail kid,

2844
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,080
he leans forward and they use his mic.

2845
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:50,080
So he's kind of structurally,

2846
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:52,080
he goes and grabs the tickets from the radio guy

2847
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:53,080
and brings it over,

2848
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:55,080
and I'm like, this is a really interesting track

2849
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:59,080
because it's physical and you're doing like logistics.

2850
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:02,080
And then I was like, Doug's probably the most demanding.

2851
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:04,080
He's only off stage for like 30 seconds

2852
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:06,080
in that one scene with Patty and the green guy.

2853
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:10,080
And so I'm like, oh, okay, I guess him.

2854
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:13,080
I feel like Patty is probably the chillest track,

2855
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:15,080
which would have been really awesome to do

2856
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:16,080
if I had been old enough,

2857
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:19,080
because she, I also like that she's kind of the one

2858
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:21,080
who's like, you guys are all fucking crazy.

2859
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:22,080
Okay, see you later.

2860
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:24,080
She's not like the straight,

2861
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:27,080
well, she kind of is like the straight man, honestly.

2862
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:28,080
Can I ask a question?

2863
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:29,080
When you say track, is that-

2864
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:30,080
Oh, sorry.

2865
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,080
Like the role, so like-

2866
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:32,080
I assume that's what you meant.

2867
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:36,080
So like in Beetlejuice, my track was Fantasia.

2868
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:40,080
But like a track for Roger, your track is still that

2869
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:42,080
and the radio host, that's one track,

2870
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:43,080
even though it's two characters.

2871
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:45,080
Is that the same guy?

2872
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:46,080
I didn't realize that.

2873
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:47,080
Are you joking?

2874
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:51,080
He's the radio guy before he's Roger?

2875
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:52,080
It's three.

2876
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:53,080
He's the radio guy.

2877
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:54,080
Oh.

2878
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:55,080
Radio guy.

2879
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:56,080
But that's still one track.

2880
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:57,080
It's one actor's track.

2881
01:40:57,080 --> 01:40:59,080
So that's if you're like, if you're sharing roles,

2882
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:01,080
if you're like, you dip off to do this thing

2883
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:02,080
and then you come back to this thing.

2884
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,080
It doesn't have to be that.

2885
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:04,080
You could be the same character.

2886
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:05,080
Doug is a track.

2887
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:06,080
Sure.

2888
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:08,080
Is that a Broadway term or a theme park term?

2889
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:09,080
Both.

2890
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:10,080
Okay.

2891
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:11,080
I mean, I guess.

2892
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:13,080
I use it interchangeably.

2893
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:15,080
But like for Broadway, a lot of times ensembles,

2894
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:17,080
there'll be different ensemble tracks.

2895
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:20,080
And ensemble typically plays various things

2896
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:21,080
throughout the show.

2897
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:24,080
So like track, dance track one is like,

2898
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:25,080
oh, I have to remember that it's different

2899
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:27,080
than dance track seven.

2900
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:29,080
I give those, not those people,

2901
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:33,080
people in ensembles who do cover so many tracks,

2902
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:34,080
like I give them so much credit

2903
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:37,080
because it's also slightly different sometimes

2904
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:38,080
that you have to remember, oh wait,

2905
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:40,080
I'm doing this track for this.

2906
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:43,080
And so that's what I mean when I say,

2907
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:45,080
like roll in the show maybe.

2908
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:46,080
Sure, sure.

2909
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:47,080
I assumed, I just didn't know.

2910
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:48,080
No, no, no, yeah, I am.

2911
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:49,080
I didn't know what it was.

2912
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:54,080
So you might, you would, if this was still around

2913
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:57,080
or had been when you were able to be in these shows,

2914
01:41:57,080 --> 01:42:00,080
you maybe would have wanted to be Patty.

2915
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:01,080
Oh my God, yeah.

2916
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:04,080
Or is Pork Chop a gender neutral,

2917
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:05,080
I feel like it.

2918
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:06,080
I guess it could have been.

2919
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:09,080
I feel like I saw pictures of female Pork Chops.

2920
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:10,080
Really?

2921
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:11,080
I guess it could have been.

2922
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:12,080
I'm not sure, maybe.

2923
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:13,080
Yeah, I would have killed to be Patty Mayonnaise,

2924
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:15,080
although I'd be scared of Roger.

2925
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:17,080
I'd be scared when he's the bad guy

2926
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:19,080
and I'm standing on the thingy, but.

2927
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:22,080
There's a pre-show character too, right?

2928
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,080
Doing like trivia with the audience

2929
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:26,080
and getting the kid and getting the adult.

2930
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:27,080
I don't know what character, but.

2931
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:29,080
Yeah, just kind of has like crazy dress on.

2932
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:31,080
They tell you when the bad guy comes out,

2933
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:35,080
go boo, boo, and when Doug wins and he's the underpants,

2934
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:38,080
like yay, yay.

2935
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:43,080
I did, I came across on the Doug Wiki about the show.

2936
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:46,080
There was an interesting set of comments.

2937
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:47,080
No.

2938
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:51,080
On March 3rd, 2018, someone said about this show,

2939
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:54,080
it's gone now, isn't it?

2940
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:59,080
And then someone replied on March 28th, 2023,

2941
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:00,080
yes it is.

2942
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:03,080
It's okay.

2943
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:04,080
So that's it.

2944
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:06,080
Just a five year difference.

2945
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:09,080
Five years later to get that yes it is.

2946
01:43:09,080 --> 01:43:10,080
You are correct.

2947
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:12,080
Checked every day, every day.

2948
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:13,080
Every day.

2949
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:15,080
Until finally somebody, yeah.

2950
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:16,080
There was nowhere else to find.

2951
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:18,080
It's not the closure I wanted.

2952
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:20,080
Yeah, but you know,

2953
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:22,080
well they waited for five years for that.

2954
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:26,080
So yeah, I certainly appreciated more watching it now.

2955
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:28,080
When I was 13, I was a little like,

2956
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:30,080
I didn't love that.

2957
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:31,080
Wow.

2958
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:32,080
I think that's interesting.

2959
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:33,080
I don't know.

2960
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:34,080
You actually remember this

2961
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:36,080
and you had a natural reaction to it at the time.

2962
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:37,080
Yeah.

2963
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:39,080
And then you attribute it to like snobbiness or something.

2964
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:41,080
I just, I don't know.

2965
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:42,080
Puberty, moodiness.

2966
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:44,080
You were a purist, a Nickelodeon dog purist.

2967
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:45,080
I was kind of a dog purist.

2968
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:46,080
I feel like it's more that.

2969
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:47,080
Yeah, but you were like.

2970
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:49,080
Like I kept trying to show you last night

2971
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:51,080
and you were not interested.

2972
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:54,080
I was like, look, his sleeves used to be shorter.

2973
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:55,080
This drives me nuts.

2974
01:43:55,080 --> 01:43:56,080
Okay, no, no, no.

2975
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:57,080
I'm not making this up, Jay.

2976
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:59,080
I thought you were specifically just talking

2977
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:00,080
about the live show.

2978
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:01,080
And I was like, yeah, it's cartoony.

2979
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:02,080
Well, no.

2980
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:03,080
It's oversized.

2981
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:05,080
It's three quarters, but it's just a t-shirt.

2982
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:08,080
Well, yeah, no, it makes sense in the live show.

2983
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:09,080
Fuck with me.

2984
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:10,080
Fuck with me.

2985
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:12,080
You got it coming.

2986
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:13,080
Watch out.

2987
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:17,080
You can hear on Mike just for the theater of the mind.

2988
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:19,080
Oh, she's cracking her knuckles.

2989
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:20,080
Oh no.

2990
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:22,080
Wasn't there an episode while I was gone

2991
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:25,080
where you guys talked about how you want like a strong woman

2992
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:27,080
to throw you around like the X-Men?

2993
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:28,080
Yeah.

2994
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,080
Did you hear that one?

2995
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:30,080
Oh, yeah.

2996
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:31,080
Is that something that you already discussed

2997
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:32,080
in your home lives?

2998
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:33,080
Oh, yeah.

2999
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:35,080
I am quite strong.

3000
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:36,080
She's very strong.

3001
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:38,080
And I like to say I'm made of glass and popsicle sticks.

3002
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:39,080
Yeah.

3003
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:40,080
Sure.

3004
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:41,080
These are not good materials.

3005
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:46,080
So I, yeah.

3006
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:47,080
Vulcan.

3007
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:48,080
What's the character you want?

3008
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:49,080
What's the character you're chasing?

3009
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:50,080
Buff.

3010
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:51,080
Buff.

3011
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:52,080
Buff.

3012
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:54,080
And what's the laser one?

3013
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:56,080
From Generation X?

3014
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:57,080
Generation X, yeah.

3015
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:58,080
Oh, god.

3016
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:59,080
I don't know.

3017
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:00,080
I can't remember.

3018
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:01,080
All right.

3019
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:02,080
I'll look it up.

3020
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,080
Or we don't have to look it up.

3021
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:06,080
Or we could go with Buff and that's the end of it.

3022
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:07,080
Go with General.

3023
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:08,080
Yeah.

3024
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:09,080
I think you're the buff.

3025
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:10,080
We're good, James.

3026
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:11,080
We're good.

3027
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:12,080
No, no.

3028
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:13,080
I'm getting this.

3029
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:14,080
All right.

3030
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:15,080
Oh, god.

3031
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:18,080
I can see him in his spiky blonde hair.

3032
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:21,080
Live show-wise, like is this of all the things

3033
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:22,080
that have closed over the years,

3034
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:24,080
would this be your number one to bring back?

3035
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:25,080
No.

3036
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:26,080
Oh, no.

3037
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:27,080
It wouldn't.

3038
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:28,080
Hunchback.

3039
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:29,080
Hunchback would be number one.

3040
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:30,080
For fucking sure.

3041
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:31,080
You love that Hunchback show.

3042
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:33,080
I was going to say I would jizz my fucking pants.

3043
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:34,080
Wow.

3044
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:36,080
If the Hunchback of Notre Dame show came out,

3045
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:37,080
you would jizz your fucking pants.

3046
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:39,080
Don't even talk to me like I'm getting excited.

3047
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:42,080
Don't even talk to me about it.

3048
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:44,080
Because the actual casting that could happen

3049
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:47,080
where they do traditional, not traditional,

3050
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:50,080
but they stick to the right ethnicity of the characters,

3051
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:53,080
which they would do now, fucking sickening, man.

3052
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:54,080
Don't even talk to me about it.

3053
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:55,080
Don't even talk to me about it.

3054
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:56,080
I'm going to cry.

3055
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:57,080
It's too overwhelmingly awesome to imagine.

3056
01:45:57,080 --> 01:45:59,080
This is a positive feeling, but it's overwhelming.

3057
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:02,080
I literally am thinking about it, and I'm like, I will cry.

3058
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:03,080
Similarly overwhelming.

3059
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:04,080
Little tears are happening.

3060
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:06,080
It's Buff and Refrax.

3061
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:08,080
His name was Refrax.

3062
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:09,080
Is this a guy?

3063
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:11,080
The quickest way to fight those tears

3064
01:46:11,080 --> 01:46:13,080
is to start talking about Buff and Refrax.

3065
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:14,080
Does that balance you out?

3066
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:17,080
Yeah, that's guy who has x-ray vision and laser eyes.

3067
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:19,080
Wait, wait, that's who you want?

3068
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:20,080
You want her to be like Refrax?

3069
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:24,080
No, she's Buff because she's strong, and I'm Refrax.

3070
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:25,080
You're Refrax.

3071
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:26,080
You're Refrax.

3072
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:27,080
You're the Refrax.

3073
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:28,080
Not really.

3074
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:29,080
He's kind of a creep.

3075
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:30,080
Oh, Shane.

3076
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:32,080
Because the comic book characters.

3077
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:33,080
Did you know what happened on that episode?

3078
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:34,080
What?

3079
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:37,080
That episode we pitched an idea for a mutant based on you

3080
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:39,080
that already was a character that I didn't realize.

3081
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:41,080
Do you know what I'm talking about?

3082
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:42,080
I don't remember.

3083
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:43,080
I pitched an X-Man.

3084
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:44,080
That's what I should have been here.

3085
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:46,080
Scott made it 10 minutes in that episode when he was not on it,

3086
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:48,080
and he could not finish it for sure.

3087
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:50,080
That was the most difficult one.

3088
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:52,080
I, at the end of the episode, pitched an idea for a mutant

3089
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:55,080
called Soft Serve that Jason could play

3090
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:57,080
that would have a different flavor of ice cream

3091
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:59,080
coming out of each finger, and we went through

3092
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:01,080
which flavor each finger would be.

3093
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:02,080
We did all 10?

3094
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:03,080
We did all 10.

3095
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:04,080
I forced him to do it.

3096
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:05,080
We did all 10.

3097
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:06,080
I put him on the spot.

3098
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:08,080
In an episode I never heard, you just named,

3099
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:10,080
you assigned ice cream flavors to fingers?

3100
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,080
I gave him a time limit as well.

3101
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:14,080
I put him under the gun there in that one.

3102
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:15,080
And I beat it.

3103
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:16,080
I nailed it.

3104
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:17,080
I mean, it wasn't.

3105
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:18,080
It was like 60 seconds.

3106
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:19,080
That's my baby.

3107
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:20,080
That's my baby.

3108
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:21,080
Thank you for your support.

3109
01:47:21,080 --> 01:47:22,080
I love you so much.

3110
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:24,080
But apparently that's where we're getting X-Man.

3111
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:25,080
Really?

3112
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:28,080
There's an X-Man named Soft Serve that shoots ice cream.

3113
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:30,080
So I either stole it and didn't realize I stole it,

3114
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:31,080
or it's just parallel thinking.

3115
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:33,080
It's just too many mutants, I guess.

3116
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:35,080
You see, honey, Chamber and Husk,

3117
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:37,080
the original comic book characters,

3118
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:39,080
were too expensive to do TV.

3119
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:40,080
And that's our time, everybody.

3120
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:42,080
So when we're down, Doug Live.

3121
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:45,080
No, what do we want to get at about Doug Live

3122
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:49,080
before we shut the door, to use the term?

3123
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:53,080
It was kind of my introduction to the stage Fogsmoke

3124
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:54,080
and the smell of it.

3125
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:56,080
So that was also very visceral for me,

3126
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:58,080
like, thinking about that.

3127
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:59,080
Yeah, I don't know.

3128
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:00,080
I loved it.

3129
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:02,080
I have very fun family memories of it.

3130
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:06,080
And we were really sad when it closed.

3131
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:09,080
And I get that a lot of people, like,

3132
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:11,080
hearing your perspective of it,

3133
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:13,080
not knowing about the Doug series as much,

3134
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:15,080
I'm like, oh, yeah, that makes sense.

3135
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:16,080
It's probably weird.

3136
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:20,080
But if you're only seeing Doug in that perspective,

3137
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:21,080
you're like, oh, this is wonderful.

3138
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:22,080
I like this music.

3139
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:24,080
And Doug is so cute.

3140
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:26,080
And it's so romantic at the end.

3141
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:27,080
And they end up together.

3142
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:29,080
And Patty Menaise is kind of annoying.

3143
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:34,080
And a little, not jarring, not like...

3144
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:36,080
Flighty out of it?

3145
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:38,080
No, that was the last one I couldn't remember.

3146
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:41,080
I remember going, flighty?

3147
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:42,080
I don't know, you guys.

3148
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:43,080
Someone else talk.

3149
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:45,080
OK, well, can't do.

3150
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:47,080
We haven't talked about Doug's hair spikes.

3151
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:49,080
That's a, I said that Doug is normal

3152
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:50,080
because he doesn't have face paint.

3153
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:53,080
But also, the way they represent his cartoon hair

3154
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:56,080
is to just take regular hair and slick it down.

3155
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:59,080
And then he looks like he's in, well,

3156
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:00,080
I'll say the offspring again.

3157
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:02,080
He looks like Dexter Holland a little bit.

3158
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:05,080
He just looks like a 90s spiky guy.

3159
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:09,080
Well, because cartoon Doug has like six strands of hair.

3160
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:10,080
Right.

3161
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:12,080
But rather than weird wig,

3162
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:13,080
the wig choices are interesting.

3163
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:15,080
They just spike his real hair.

3164
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:17,080
Roger, they put in,

3165
01:49:17,080 --> 01:49:20,080
it's like a red wig with curlers.

3166
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:22,080
It's a big set of curlers.

3167
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:24,080
And then, as I said, like bald on the side.

3168
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:25,080
I'm terrified of Roger.

3169
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:26,080
No, Doug is definitely wearing a wig.

3170
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:27,080
That's not his real hair.

3171
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:29,080
Well, look what I'm looking at right here.

3172
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:31,080
I think we got some slicked up,

3173
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:36,080
some big old, like, gelled up hair, I want to say.

3174
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:37,080
Hmm.

3175
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:39,080
Oh, that's really tough.

3176
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:40,080
I don't know.

3177
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:42,080
I mean, it could be a big wig, I suppose.

3178
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:43,080
But it is very Beakman.

3179
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:44,080
It looks like Beakman from Beakman's World.

3180
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:45,080
Yeah, yeah.

3181
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:46,080
There you go.

3182
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:47,080
Yeah.

3183
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:49,080
Did Michael Eisner know who Beakman was, do you think?

3184
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:50,080
It's the competition.

3185
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:51,080
I curse him every day.

3186
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:52,080
Can we do an episode?

3187
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:53,080
That's why I got Bill Nye.

3188
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:54,080
To fight the scourge of Beakman.

3189
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:55,080
I love Bill Nye.

3190
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:56,080
Can we do a Bill Nye episode?

3191
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:57,080
We could.

3192
01:49:57,080 --> 01:49:59,080
I don't necessarily need to be on it,

3193
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:00,080
but I love...

3194
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:01,080
Still would.

3195
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:02,080
Still would do.

3196
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:03,080
When he shows for the oil companies

3197
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:04,080
on Universe of Energy?

3198
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:05,080
Still would do.

3199
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:06,080
You could talk about him there.

3200
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:07,080
Still would do, Bill Nye?

3201
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:08,080
I want to fucking stove it.

3202
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:09,080
Oh, thank you.

3203
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:10,080
Oh, Jesus.

3204
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:11,080
Here we go.

3205
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:12,080
Is he...

3206
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:13,080
So we didn't know we were winding down here.

3207
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:14,080
Now we're hearing you want to fuck Bill Nye.

3208
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:19,080
I don't know so much, but I still would.

3209
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:20,080
Bill Nye, really?

3210
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:21,080
Whoa.

3211
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:24,080
What was the formative Bill Nye TV show

3212
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:26,080
where it was like, oh, wow, Bill.

3213
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:27,080
Yeah, that was my...

3214
01:50:27,080 --> 01:50:29,080
I'm just saying, what was Universe of Energy?

3215
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:30,080
Yeah, what's the kind of thing you would do

3216
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:33,080
that implanted those feelings?

3217
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:35,080
When you picture the Bill Nye of your dreams.

3218
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:36,080
I don't know.

3219
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:38,080
I just think he's got this weird swagger.

3220
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:40,080
I'm glad we moved in together,

3221
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:43,080
because if I recall, he used to live

3222
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:45,080
in my old neighborhood somewhere.

3223
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:46,080
Did he?

3224
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:49,080
Because him and Ed Begley Jr. were neighbors,

3225
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:51,080
and they got into a war to make their houses

3226
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:53,080
the most energy efficient.

3227
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:54,080
Oh, my God.

3228
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:56,080
They're big environmental guys.

3229
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:59,080
You know, Ed Begley Jr. was taking the subway

3230
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:01,080
to the Oscars.

3231
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:03,080
Well, have you seen Bill Nye swing dance?

3232
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:04,080
Yes.

3233
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:05,080
You have?

3234
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:06,080
I believe I have.

3235
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:07,080
Yeah, I just made a face,

3236
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:10,080
because if you see that...

3237
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,080
Just saying.

3238
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:13,080
I mean, look, he was on Dancing with the Stars.

3239
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:15,080
He's really good at swing dancing,

3240
01:51:15,080 --> 01:51:18,080
and you've got to know how to move

3241
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:19,080
and different things.

3242
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:21,080
Can I ask, if it's too personal,

3243
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:23,080
did Jason know that Bill Nye was such a...

3244
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:25,080
I always told you I thought he was cute.

3245
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:27,080
I was always like, yeah, I've said to you,

3246
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:28,080
like, yeah, I would.

3247
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:29,080
Still would.

3248
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:30,080
Sure.

3249
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:31,080
So you flashed it.

3250
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:32,080
If you hadn't moved, you could have been

3251
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:33,080
walking around the neighborhood,

3252
01:51:33,080 --> 01:51:34,080
and Bill Nye was there.

3253
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:35,080
And then he rolls up on an electric bike

3254
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:38,080
that's even more efficient than...

3255
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:40,080
Probably the most efficient bike is not electric.

3256
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:41,080
What I'm saying is,

3257
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:44,080
a better bike than Ed Begley Jr.,

3258
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:46,080
and then your eyes go grazing over,

3259
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:48,080
ooh, oh, you don't say.

3260
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:49,080
I feel like I would have been too nervous

3261
01:51:49,080 --> 01:51:50,080
to say anything.

3262
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:52,080
And I'm just trailing behind her.

3263
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:54,080
Like, now that's the restaurant

3264
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:57,080
where Beretta went back for his gun,

3265
01:51:57,080 --> 01:51:59,080
where he said he didn't kill his wife.

3266
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:00,080
Mattel.

3267
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:01,080
Yeah.

3268
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:02,080
Robert Blake?

3269
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,080
Yes.

3270
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:04,080
Right?

3271
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:05,080
Yes, that's his name, yeah.

3272
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:07,080
I think you know him as Beretta first.

3273
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:09,080
I couldn't pull the name Robert Blake.

3274
01:52:09,080 --> 01:52:10,080
Robert Blake.

3275
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:12,080
But I could pull Beretta.

3276
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:14,080
And of course, the Universal Sheraton,

3277
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:16,080
the inspiration for that,

3278
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:18,080
stayed there for a while.

3279
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:19,080
The inspiration for what?

3280
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:20,080
For Beretta.

3281
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:21,080
It was the inspiration for the show Beretta?

3282
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:22,080
It was a different cop guy.

3283
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:24,080
A cop guy who had written a book.

3284
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:26,080
What, you're talking about Telly Savalas?

3285
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:27,080
No, no.

3286
01:52:27,080 --> 01:52:28,080
The...

3287
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:29,080
I forget.

3288
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:30,080
Oh, God.

3289
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:31,080
It's complicated.

3290
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:32,080
I forget.

3291
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:33,080
It came up on the original City Walk.

3292
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:36,080
Is this about Chamber or Reflex?

3293
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:37,080
I don't know any of the words

3294
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:39,080
y'all been saying in the last minute, by the way.

3295
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:40,080
Well, we're trying to figure it out, too.

3296
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:43,080
No, I got a little lost there.

3297
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:45,080
If you figure it out, let me know.

3298
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:46,080
I just wait.

3299
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:48,080
The hotel was the inspiration for...

3300
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:49,080
No, no.

3301
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:53,080
The man, this former super cop,

3302
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:56,080
wrote a book, and they were adapting it to a TV show.

3303
01:52:56,080 --> 01:53:00,080
The TV show got reworked after the first season

3304
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:03,080
and would go on to become Beretta.

3305
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:04,080
Okay.

3306
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:05,080
Okay.

3307
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:06,080
Wait, what does the hotel have to do with it?

3308
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:08,080
Yeah, what does the hotel have to do with it?

3309
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:12,080
He stayed, he was one of the people who stayed in that.

3310
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:14,080
One of the celebrities listed as staying...

3311
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:15,080
Was the super cop.

3312
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:16,080
Yeah, the super cop.

3313
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:18,080
The real life super cop behind Beretta.

3314
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,080
Quote unquote.

3315
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:20,080
Jason...

3316
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:21,080
How in the world did this information...

3317
01:53:21,080 --> 01:53:22,080
I just really want to personally thank you

3318
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:24,080
for letting us know all that information.

3319
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:29,080
Jane herself blessed Jason harder than either of us.

3320
01:53:29,080 --> 01:53:31,080
Wow, the biggest mic drop.

3321
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:35,080
You spend less than two hours with them.

3322
01:53:35,080 --> 01:53:38,080
You start nailing my ass.

3323
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:40,080
But I also nailed their asses.

3324
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:41,080
All right.

3325
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:43,080
That's an ass nailing to go around.

3326
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:44,080
Which is why we like that.

3327
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:45,080
I love ass play.

3328
01:53:45,080 --> 01:53:47,080
Jane loves ass play and that's why we have her.

3329
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:50,080
Is there anything else to get or do we start winding it down?

3330
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:52,080
Do we say on that note, Jane Clear,

3331
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:54,080
you survived podcast The Ride,

3332
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:56,080
and thank you for coming to us

3333
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:57,080
and bringing us your fond memories,

3334
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:59,080
bringing us your wedding tales,

3335
01:53:59,080 --> 01:54:01,080
and for nailing our asses.

3336
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:04,080
I will nail your asses any day, boys.

3337
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:07,080
Watch out for this video.

3338
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:10,080
You got it coming to you all the time, Mr. Sharon.

3339
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:11,080
What is that?

3340
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:13,080
This is Lookout Bear from Zubli Zoo.

3341
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:14,080
I don't like his pose.

3342
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:16,080
His pose is freaking me out more than anything.

3343
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:17,080
His name is Lookout Bear,

3344
01:54:17,080 --> 01:54:19,080
and he's kind of hitting the dab, honestly.

3345
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:22,080
His head's not in the elbow.

3346
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:23,080
It's very far.

3347
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:24,080
Not 100%.

3348
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:25,080
All right.

3349
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:26,080
Let's access the gift shop.

3350
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:27,080
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

3351
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:30,080
Well, first, can I be sentimental for a second?

3352
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:32,080
I just want to say I really love you both,

3353
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:34,080
and thank you so much for always helping us out

3354
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:39,080
and the extra things that we need between Jason and I,

3355
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:42,080
and even though I fuck with you guys so much,

3356
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:44,080
I really appreciate your friendship,

3357
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:45,080
and I just wanted to say that.

3358
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:46,080
You don't have to.

3359
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:47,080
Likewise.

3360
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:48,080
Oh, thanks.

3361
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:49,080
Jeez, appreciate it.

3362
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:51,080
And I just want to give Jason a shout-out,

3363
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:53,080
because this MS has kind of been kicking his ass,

3364
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:55,080
and he's pushing through

3365
01:54:55,080 --> 01:54:59,080
and trying not to let it defeat everything,

3366
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:01,080
so I just want to be sentimental for a minute

3367
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:03,080
and tell you guys I love you all.

3368
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:04,080
Thank you.

3369
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:07,080
As far as gift shop,

3370
01:55:07,080 --> 01:55:09,080
I'm a stylist, as we were saying.

3371
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:11,080
You can find me on Instagram,

3372
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:12,080
janeclairstyling.

3373
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:15,080
It's J-A-Y-N-E, C-L-A-I-R-E.

3374
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:17,080
Please reach out to me.

3375
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:18,080
I'm also on Twitter.

3376
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:20,080
I have like 30 followers or something,

3377
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:22,080
but I'm always looking for new clients.

3378
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:24,080
You want those numbers up, don't you?

3379
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:25,080
Please, you guys.

3380
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:26,080
Listeners, help Jane out.

3381
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:27,080
Please, I really want you.

3382
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:29,080
On the dying website,

3383
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:32,080
trying to get those listeners.

3384
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:33,080
The what?

3385
01:55:33,080 --> 01:55:34,080
The dying website.

3386
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:35,080
The dying website.

3387
01:55:35,080 --> 01:55:36,080
Oh, yeah.

3388
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:39,080
But no, I do event styling

3389
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:42,080
or just personal styling, closet stuff,

3390
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:45,080
and so reach out,

3391
01:55:45,080 --> 01:55:48,080
or if I've started doing these YouTube videos

3392
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:51,080
that I'm just kind of throwing up onto YouTube,

3393
01:55:51,080 --> 01:55:53,080
so let me know if you like it.

3394
01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:55,080
You broke down wedding look,

3395
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:58,080
your other styling content?

3396
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,080
Yeah, yeah.

3397
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:01,080
I asked on Instagram the other day,

3398
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:03,080
and some people really gave some good suggestions.

3399
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:05,080
I think one I'm going to try to work on

3400
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:08,080
is a video showing how to look cute in a theme park

3401
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:12,080
while still being comfy and it being reasonable.

3402
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:15,080
I feel like I'm going to have some controversial opinions.

3403
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:17,080
There's one I already have.

3404
01:56:17,080 --> 01:56:19,080
Please, go ahead.

3405
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:20,080
Well, okay.

3406
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:22,080
Here's what I'll say.

3407
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:23,080
I don't love...

3408
01:56:23,080 --> 01:56:24,080
Again, I'm not judging you.

3409
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:26,080
The whole thing with my styling is,

3410
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:27,080
if you want to wear it and it makes you comfortable,

3411
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:28,080
okay, I'm not going to tell you,

3412
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:30,080
but if you ask my professional opinion,

3413
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:31,080
I'm going to give it to you.

3414
01:56:31,080 --> 01:56:32,080
You know what I mean?

3415
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:33,080
So if you're asking me about that,

3416
01:56:33,080 --> 01:56:35,080
do not wear the theme park shirts.

3417
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:39,080
It's like Jason said, wearing the band tee to the concert.

3418
01:56:39,080 --> 01:56:41,080
It doesn't ever look cute.

3419
01:56:41,080 --> 01:56:43,080
It just looks silly to me.

3420
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:45,080
But if you love it, all right.

3421
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:46,080
Can I ask a question?

3422
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:47,080
Yeah.

3423
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:48,080
When we were all together at Epcot Center

3424
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:49,080
a couple years ago

3425
01:56:49,080 --> 01:56:50,080
and I was wearing a Mickey Mouse

3426
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:52,080
and Minnie Mouse yellow shirt,

3427
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:54,080
would that be a faux pas in your mind?

3428
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:56,080
I don't think necessarily.

3429
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:59,080
I don't like the gaudy, like so much going on,

3430
01:56:59,080 --> 01:57:00,080
like a vintage shirt.

3431
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:02,080
I would be okay with, like Jason and I

3432
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:05,080
have a lot of vintage theme park stuff.

3433
01:57:05,080 --> 01:57:09,080
And if anything, I would say something more basic

3434
01:57:09,080 --> 01:57:12,080
or something vintage.

3435
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:16,080
I just, I hate the gaudy shirts that are like, you know,

3436
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:18,080
I just, I've seen so many at Epic

3437
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:20,080
and I'm like, guys, this is so...

3438
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:22,080
Like you can look really cute in a theme park

3439
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:23,080
and it doesn't have to be one of those shirts.

3440
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:24,080
So I'm here to help.

3441
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:26,080
Would you, with the shirts you're talking about,

3442
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:29,080
would they be okay in regular society?

3443
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:30,080
No, but...

3444
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:33,080
It sounds like you just don't like these shirts at all.

3445
01:57:33,080 --> 01:57:34,080
Well, that's also kind of true.

3446
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:35,080
Yeah.

3447
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:37,080
Now if I, if you were to see me somewhere

3448
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:42,080
and I was wearing a shirt that had clip art of wine glass

3449
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:44,080
and then on top of that is the headgear

3450
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:46,080
that the Evil Queen from Snow White wears.

3451
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:51,080
And then it said in a really almost unreadably cursive font,

3452
01:57:51,080 --> 01:57:54,080
mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the drunkest of them all?

3453
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:57,080
Would that be a cool clothing item to wear

3454
01:57:57,080 --> 01:57:59,080
or would you advise me against that?

3455
01:57:59,080 --> 01:58:01,080
I advise against all of those.

3456
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:04,080
Look, if you want to look chic, don't wear printed stuff.

3457
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:06,080
I mean, genuinely, I like vintage printed stuff,

3458
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:08,080
but if you don't want to look,

3459
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:10,080
like if you want to look put together, wear solids.

3460
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:12,080
Do not wear gaudy shirts.

3461
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:13,080
Okay, I want to show you a picture.

3462
01:58:13,080 --> 01:58:16,080
And I've been just faving Vintage Islands of Adventure

3463
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:18,080
and Universal Escape shirts on Depop.

3464
01:58:18,080 --> 01:58:19,080
Again, vintage to me is a little different.

3465
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:20,080
I don't like these new prints.

3466
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:22,080
I'm not trying to be an asshole.

3467
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:23,080
I really am not.

3468
01:58:23,080 --> 01:58:24,080
But people are asking me,

3469
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:25,080
hey, how do I look cute in the theme park?

3470
01:58:25,080 --> 01:58:27,080
How do I look cute in the theme park?

3471
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:30,080
I need to show you a picture of that shirt I'm talking about.

3472
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:31,080
I want to know what you think about it.

3473
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:33,080
Okay, well, then I'm going to do the plug.

3474
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:34,080
Wait, hold on, hold on.

3475
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:36,080
Counterpoint.

3476
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:39,080
Dave Toma was the detective name.

3477
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:40,080
Jason, come on.

3478
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:42,080
Super cop Dave Toma.

3479
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:45,080
Dave Toma is the state of the universe.

3480
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:46,080
My God.

3481
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:48,080
Well, Jane, aren't you glad that he finished that fact?

3482
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:50,080
Toma was the TV show.

3483
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:52,080
That was going to take back that taking him to task.

3484
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:54,080
Toma became Beretta.

3485
01:58:54,080 --> 01:58:56,080
Well, you know, to pay off all the threads in this episode,

3486
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:58,080
wait, tell me that fact one more time.

3487
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:00,080
Toma became Beretta.

3488
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:02,080
Re-he-he-he-he-ly.

3489
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:03,080
Whoa.

3490
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:04,080
There we go.

3491
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:05,080
We got it all in.

3492
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:06,080
Thanks for subscribing to The Second Gate.

3493
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:07,080
I don't get it.

3494
01:59:07,080 --> 01:59:09,080
No, this is The Second Gate plugs.

3495
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:10,080

All of that is at patreon.com slash podcast the riot.

3501
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:23,080
And of course, excellently printed shirts on our T-public.

3502
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:24,080
That's true, yeah.

3503
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:25,080
The printing's so good.

3504
01:59:25,080 --> 01:59:27,080
It would totally pass muster as far as Jane's.

3505
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:28,080
You could wear that to our live show.

3506
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:31,080
But that's not a theme park section of the theme park or something.

3507
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:32,080
Okay, okay.

3508
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:33,080
So then we're fine.

3509
01:59:33,080 --> 01:59:34,080
Okay, Mike has produced his shirt.

3510
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:35,080
Let me see.

3511
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:36,080
Are we ready for this?

3512
01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:37,080
Mm-hmm.

3513
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:38,080
That's what I was wearing at Epcot.

3514
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:39,080
It sounds like a no, folks.

3515
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:40,080
Silence.

3516
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:41,080
It sounds like you got a no.

3517
01:59:41,080 --> 01:59:42,080
Silence.

3518
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:43,080
Speak volumes.

3519
01:59:43,080 --> 01:59:44,080
Is it a reprint or a real vintage shirt?

3520
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:46,080
Well, shouldn't you be able to tell?

3521
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:47,080
Because I think it's a reprint,

3522
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:49,080
but I'm asking you so you can be a little embarrassed.

3523
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:50,080
It's not a reprint at all.

3524
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:52,080
It was a new shirt on Shop Disney.

3525
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:54,080
Okay, so that's a new shirt.

3526
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:55,080
It's not a vintage shirt.

3527
01:59:55,080 --> 01:59:56,080
It looks kind of vintage.

3528
01:59:56,080 --> 01:59:57,080
Right.

3529
01:59:57,080 --> 01:59:58,080
Yeah, I don't like that.

3530
01:59:58,080 --> 01:59:59,080
Vintage or anything.

3531
01:59:59,080 --> 02:00:02,080
But did you know or is it more about the status?

3532
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:03,080
What do you mean?

3533
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:06,080
Is it the status of owning something that's vintage?

3534
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:08,080
Is it the idea of something being vintage

3535
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:10,080
or is it actually the way it looks?

3536
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:11,080
Both.

3537
02:00:11,080 --> 02:00:12,080
That's what I thought.

3538
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:13,080
Okay.

3539
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:14,080
Also, everyone wears the same fucking shirt.

3540
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:15,080
Do you want to look cute at theme park?

3541
02:00:15,080 --> 02:00:16,080
Do I wear the same fucking shirt?

3542
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:18,080
I've never seen another person wearing that shirt.

3543
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:19,080
That's unique.

3544
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:20,080
And there's a reason, Mike.

3545
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:21,080
No, I'm just kidding.

3546
02:00:21,080 --> 02:00:22,080
Wow.

3547
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:25,080
And right down at the end, the ass nailing has...

3548
02:00:25,080 --> 02:00:26,080
I've been nailed.

3549
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:28,080
We have one final nail of one final ass

3550
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:29,080
right at the exit of the episode.

3551
02:00:29,080 --> 02:00:30,080
In my little wooden seat.

3552
02:00:30,080 --> 02:00:33,080
You've been nailed square in the center

3553
02:00:33,080 --> 02:00:35,080
of your little wooden seat.

3554
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:38,080
And with that, we not only shut the door,

3555
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:41,080
we slammed the door on this entire conversation.

3556
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:42,080
Bye.

3557
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:43,080
Forever.

3558
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:46,080
