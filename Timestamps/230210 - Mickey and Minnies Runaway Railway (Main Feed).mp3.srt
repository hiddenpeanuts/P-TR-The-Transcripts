1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:13,400
Warning, the following podcast may contain hot takes, hot button grass, and hot ducks.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,880
The boys careen to wild trackless paths, but try not to fully derail from Mickey and Minnie's

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,880
runaway railway.

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,680
Nothing can stop us now, it's Podcast The Rock.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:55,120
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a podcast about rides that has finally run out of ice shows

8
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,160
egos and has no choice but to cover a ride.

9
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,080
I'm Scott Gardner begrudgingly accepting the situation.

10
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,080
Mike Carlson.

11
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,080
Hi.

12
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,080
Hey, I'm here.

13
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,080
Yeah, we'll do it.

14
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,520
We'll get through it.

15
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,360
You know, at this point we just need Bono to think of a new character.

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,760
And he's busy sitting at the State of the Union and he's not in his writing lab coming

17
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,200
up with new character names.

18
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,680
Look at as soon as Sam Smith did his little devil routine on the Grammys, the first thing

19
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,240
I thought of was my man, Mr. McFisto.

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,300
So I thought maybe we should do an immediate new episode about him again.

21
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,880
That was the perfect in because everybody I mean, I hate if I feel stupid talking about

22
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,400
your Ben Shapiro's of the world because like it's very performative.

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,680
Oh, this is bad.

24
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,040
And you have a month's a gin by Elon Musk tweets.

25
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,800
This feels like the end of days.

26
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,360
And you're like, this is the corniest little devil routine I've ever seen.

27
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,400
This is hot stuff.

28
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
The little devil.

29
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
I didn't watch Jason.

30
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,160
Jason Sheridan are hot stuff.

31
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,160
The little devil.

32
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,160
Thank you so much.

33
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,160
Thank you.

34
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,680
Show me the proper respect that it.

35
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,720
Yeah, it was like a million pop star rock star performance.

36
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,480
They're just like a naughty.

37
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,400
Wasn't there just a devil thing?

38
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,760
We had this conversation exactly.

39
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,760
But replace the same.

40
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,680
That's why I feel silly for like playing into like making fun of the conservative media

41
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,200
for being mad about it, because I'm like, I think they're pretending to.

42
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,440
I think it's all fake.

43
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,600
It's all kayfabe.

44
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:32,560
Plus, you know, our friend Denzel told us that the devil comes along when you least.

45
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
What did he tell you?

46
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,560
Smith?

47
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,560
We are really sure.

48
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,560
No, just moment.

49
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,560
Yeah.

50
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,560
Your biggest.

51
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,920
Oh, I remember now.

52
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920
OK.

53
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,800
Yes, that's that applies to the Grammys.

54
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,200
I think the devil.

55
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,840
That's what's all of us.

56
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,920
When we all have had proud moments like putting out an episode about Bono's devil alter ego,

57
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,160
that's when the devil comes for you.

58
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,680
A different devil as played by Sam Smith has played by Sam Smith.

59
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,400
But Bonnie Raitt, watch out.

60
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,640
The devil's lurking.

61
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,360
She's not safe backstage.

62
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,800
But, you know, that's really all I have to say.

63
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:13,760
I just thought of our guy, Mr. McPhisto, when all this controversy in quotes happened.

64
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,320
Where was George Bush about George Bush wasn't sounding the alarms about Mr. McPhisto?

65
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,360
And right back in the Europa era.

66
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,960
And Mr. McPhisto was at the State of the Union as well.

67
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
I mean, as alter ego.

68
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,240
I was saying, yeah, no, Bono's there.

69
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,840
So right, right.

70
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,960
So so this is very topical, very topical.

71
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:39,760
But I guess we should talk about a theme park ride.

72
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,640
A new big ride that's out that's that's very current.

73
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,840
The guy we don't do that.

74
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,440
This almost never happens.

75
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,680
Change is hard.

76
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,520
Change is hard.

77
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,400
I kept finding myself in uncomfortable territory where I was writing down like, I like this.

78
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,080
This is good.

79
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,600
Yeah.

80
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,840
Well, this is the that's the devil that's coming for us, maybe.

81
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,200
Sure.

82
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,560
Is that when we when we do the assignment of the show that we gave ourselves years ago

83
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,240
and we just talk about rides, sometimes when it's a ride that you like,

84
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,640
then you just say, I like the ride.

85
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,520
And then what?

86
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,640
And that's kind of how I feel about Mickey Minnie's Runaway Railway.

87
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,680
I mean, I have stuff that I'd like to talk about.

88
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,080
Yeah.

89
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,160
But, you know, it's fun when you got a big, big sack of snark

90
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,040
to start whipping around to toss onto the table.

91
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,920
But my sack is empty.

92
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,640
Well, sure.

93
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,640
Snark free.

94
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,440
I'll have plenty to complain about, though, when we hit Super Nintendo World,

95
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,520
because it seems like there's very little Mr.

96
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,560
Game and Watch representation.

97
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,640
What's that?

98
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,680
Mr. Game and Mr.

99
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,040
Game and Watch is a little stick figure man

100
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,160
from very early, I think, handheld pre Nintendo entertainment system.

101
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,040
He's cute.

102
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,080
He's cute. Mr. Game and Watch is very cute.

103
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,960
Eventually they would put them all together and release them on.

104
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,840
I think it was for Game Boy Pocket.

105
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,320
I don't I don't want to start giving Jordan assignments.

106
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,360
This is a video episode and we're with Jordan Katz, our producer.

107
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,440
But if we could see Mr.

108
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,800
Game and Watch, I have him on my laptop, but for the viewer.

109
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
And you can watch this on the forever dog YouTube.

110
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,200
Yeah. But we I don't I'm looking at him right now.

111
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,280
And maybe we'll throw him up on the big screen.

112
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,040
But the there's not enough of him to be cute.

113
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,520
There's not like he is just a body.

114
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,000
You know what I mean? Oh, oh.

115
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,960
Well, you know what?

116
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,640
When I played the I've never actually played the game and watch, but I played it.

117
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,040
I forget which Smash Brothers came out.

118
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,600
I think he's there's enough of him there to be cute.

119
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,640
Yeah, he's just he's featureless.

120
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,640
It's hard to be cute.

121
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,200
Well, he shows up in a super Smash Brothers, like Mike said.

122
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,760
So we that's the first time I played, played with him or played as him.

123
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,640
He does have a move set.

124
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,880
You know, he's got a full like, oh, yeah, Mr.

125
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,960
Game and Watch is a killer. Yeah, he'll kill you.

126
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah, you're going to be cute and a killer.

127
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,880
Yeah, sure. Oh, my gosh.

128
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,600
You got to be watching out for the kids who are like,

129
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,040
I want to play as Mr. Game and Watch.

130
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,480
It's like, OK, well, I have him unlocked.

131
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,880
Oh, that's like that's like the demented choice a little bit.

132
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,240
Maybe. I don't know.

133
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,440
Well, my character's Captain Falcon, so I don't know if I'm much better.

134
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,320
So, oh, so you're not even a Game and Watch guy when you're playing Smash.

135
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,960
No, I didn't say I was.

136
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,760
OK, but you're you're upset that you want to at least see him in the land.

137
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,280
I like seeing. Yeah.

138
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,600
I mean, I know there's little Easter eggs and I've tried to get the basics.

139
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,680
So I know what to do when I go.

140
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,840
But I'm trying not to spoil too much for myself.

141
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,640
And well, that's another topical theme park thing that perhaps we might talk about soon.

142
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,960
What a time. There's things happening.

143
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,600
There's things opening big relevant riots.

144
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,720
Maybe so. So far, we've been pretty lucky making it to these.

145
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,960
Now, Runaway Railway has been open since March 4th, 2020 at Disney's Hollywood

146
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,920
Studios. Yikes. Unfortunate.

147
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,520
Yeah. Yeah. I didn't realize it was that close.

148
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,920
So a couple of people got to do it and then much more year later.

149
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,720
But but it is brand new here in Disneyland.

150
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,000
It's only been open for a couple of weeks.

151
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,800
And Jason hasn't been down to see it there, but I have done it recently.

152
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,320
And Mike has done it just this week.

153
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,880
A couple of days. Right. Yeah. Two days ago, I did it.

154
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,600
Daddy went back to Disneyland. Yeah.

155
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,360
I'm talking about myself.

156
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,080
I'm talking about myself as daddy and purely from a parental place, not any sort of sex thing.

157
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,400
Daddy went back to Disneyland alone.

158
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,240
Yes. Well, that's your way, as it should be.

159
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,440
As is his way. Daddy went alone.

160
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,480
Bring a laptop this time. Do any work?

161
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:47,760
No. And thank God, because daddy was tired that day and he had a big meal by the pool

162
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,880
at the Grand Californian and a cocktail and his eyes started twitching.

163
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,880
Oh, and he has yet to recover from the energy.

164
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,040
He's so tired. It was a couple.

165
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,360
It was a string of bad baby sleep.

166
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,520
OK, nights. Yeah.

167
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,480
So and then so this is what happened.

168
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,000
I they have the whole virtual queue.

169
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,560
You have to get up at 7 a.m. to get your spot in line.

170
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,840
This this only never happens to me.

171
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,800
I had the alarm set.

172
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,440
I hit snooze on the alarm out of just sheer like panic.

173
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,080
What is that stupid noise?

174
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,080
Turned it off. Missed the virtual queue at 7 a.m.

175
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,160
Wow. Michael.

176
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,760
I woke up at 715 and I was like flabbergasted.

177
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,400
I had no like you do not.

178
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
How could this have happened?

179
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
You didn't check.

180
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,360
Not only do you do a bad job checking, there was no check.

181
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,280
Yes, I could not believe what had happened because I don't even really have a memory

182
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,840
of turning the phone off.

183
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,200
It's how tired I was.

184
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,400
I just literally like reached over, hit snooze on it,

185
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,480
and then it rang again eight or 10 whatever minutes later.

186
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,480
And I got completely missed the window.

187
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,440
Ring rust on checking.

188
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,680
I you take that back first of all.

189
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,080
That is not true.

190
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,120
He's so high on the CVS thing that he's got two dollars

191
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,480
more of a deal than you every week.

192
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,040
I know he's coming in. He's swinging at you.

193
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,320
Clock's ticking.

194
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,040
OK, Wednesday is soon going to become Thursday.

195
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,040
So I know every week.

196
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,680
Very the coupon fairy visits us all tonight.

197
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,000
And Jason will get a four dollar coupon.

198
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,960
I will get a two dollar coupon.

199
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,040
I'm waiting for it to just drop out entirely with no warning.

200
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,360
I'm also considering checking out that Mark Cuban has like a very cheap

201
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,560
mail order pharmacy company now.

202
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,520
What Mark Cuban has a pharmacy mail order pharmacy that's just generics.

203
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,880
And it's like pennies on the dollar for like the most common generic.

204
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,760
Sounds good.

205
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,720
But that also seems like the kind of thing you would hate,

206
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,520
like a billionaire doing a new thing.

207
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,760
I don't love that, but I do love a deal.

208
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,480
I know this is where this is what it's a billionaires often want to give you

209
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,600
is a deal.

210
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
So you have this fighting in your head.

211
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,240
You have these Smash Brothers smashing in your head all the time.

212
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,240
It's even cheaper that like Walmart has a lot of like generics

213
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,400
that are like really, really cheap.

214
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,280
And they.

215
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,720
But then I have to drive over this with just what?

216
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,840
What? Wait, sorry.

217
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,360
I would have to turn that way.

218
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,960
I was going, I thought you're going.

219
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,640
But then I have to support the Walton family and their exploitation of the workers.

220
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,400
Yeah.

221
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,680
Mom and pops disappear.

222
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,640
They're not great, but I got to drive.

223
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,720
I got to drive an extra drive to the like kind of inconvenient Walmart

224
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,400
versus it just shows up when the mailman.

225
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,360
No, it's not.

226
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,920
But versus they just shows up in the mail.

227
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,160
Well, sure, that's more convenient.

228
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,680
But I love the Empire Center, which is where the Walmart.

229
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,360
Oh, I do love the Empire Center, which is where Walmart is.

230
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,960
Yeah, but I'm more of a target guy.

231
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,360
Well, but that's not what you said.

232
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,200
And that's that's the driver center.

233
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,720
Yeah. Yeah.

234
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,840
Much easier parking side of the parking lot to navigate.

235
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,360
Well, I drive in the back of the Walmart.

236
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,800
I do a little parking. I know about the back of the buildings. Yeah.

237
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,840
And if you go, if you're going to Staples for any reason,

238
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,600
then you can drive around the whole back of the shopping center.

239
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,640
Yeah. Get around the Best Buy and then drive.

240
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,000
So you know all this. Oh, I know.

241
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,400
Because I used to walk.

242
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,560
It used to walk it.

243
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,120
I walked it, worked at the office building.

244
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,400
And so I will walk behind all the businesses and walk back.

245
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,200
Was like a mile. Right.

246
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,320
This is when I visited you at work one day and I wanted to go to hometown

247
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,840
buffet and you said, I'm not spending eight dollars for lunch.

248
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,280
I yeah. Yes.

249
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,920
There's a Jason quote.

250
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,160
I think I've told that story in the podcast, but maybe years ago.

251
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,720
Well, that's a bad five timers welcome anytime.

252
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,560
You're always you're always a I'm up for a seventh time.

253
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,320
There was no way, though, you were spending anything less than six dollars.

254
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,720
It wasn't like we were going to have like dollar hot dog somewhere.

255
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,400
Well, also, I don't know that buffet.

256
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,320
Like, I don't know. Is the food that good?

257
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,160
No, but it's funny if we did.

258
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,160
Oh, OK.

259
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,200
You saw like a point.

260
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,800
Yes, I don't know that the food is.

261
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,200
No, it's usually bad, but you can.

262
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,640
There's an icy machine usually at those hometown buffets

263
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,440
and you can get unlimited icy.

264
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,200
Now, that's a deal.

265
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,680
Jason, you could have gotten like a big, I don't know, gallon jug of icy.

266
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,120
I like like half a cup of ice.

267
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,840
Well, yeah, that's fair.

268
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,200
Yeah. But I'm saying you could have like taken it home and put in the freezer.

269
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,040
True. They love giving to go options.

270
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,960
I know that Jason likes to save desserts and have them after the fact,

271
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,920
but the saved ice is the grimace thing I've ever heard.

272
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,120
It doesn't like like only like the most like you.

273
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,000
You need to be like at at death's door.

274
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,680
And like all of your retirement has run out.

275
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,680
Every cent counts.

276
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,240
So, yeah. So where someone would say like, oh, I get the very big icy

277
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,200
and I drink half and I save the rest for the next morning.

278
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,880
You'd be like, I don't know if you look to make you happy.

279
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,160
Grandma. Yeah.

280
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,360
Some days, some days you got to leave yourself a little treat

281
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,720
to get out of bed next morning, especially working one of those cubicle jobs.

282
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,920
You know, like you do an email job.

283
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,160
Yeah, I've got my cubicle, a.k.a. my research fort.

284
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,960
The railway, railway.

285
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,040
No, no, I love my research.

286
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,080
It is different.

287
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,520
It is very gloomy.

288
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,440
There are a lot of layoffs.

289
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,680
You were in the basement. You were in the basement, right?

290
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,560
No, no, that office building was brand new.

291
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,560
Oh, I thought you worked in the basement for some reason.

292
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,400
No, I did not work there.

293
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,280
I worked in the vault for a few years.

294
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,320
Maybe you said vault and I imagine vault is in the basement.

295
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,680
No, they just just massive tape faults like the rooms were full of massive

296
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,680
listeners. When you hear vault, do you think basement?

297
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,320
I guess not necessarily doesn't have to be.

298
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,360
It makes sense. I can see why you pictured it.

299
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,320
But no, I don't think it's required to be.

300
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,440
Oh, yeah. Banks are mostly ground level. Right.

301
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,200
Vaults, I would think.

302
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,560
Well, here we're still we're doing a great job of

303
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,800
keeping this podcast about extraneous bullshit.

304
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,280
Yeah, even in the face of the challenge of talking about a big ride

305
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,240
that people are excited. That's right.

306
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,360
How mainly how was it to be bad?

307
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,440
I know you were tired.

308
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,800
Did you still manage to have some fun?

309
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,000
Yeah, it's great. I mean, I went on like a couple things.

310
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,000
I sat. Yeah, you chill out.

311
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,920
You have some food.

312
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,360
It was yeah, it was good to be back.

313
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,680
The crowds are just as bad as ever.

314
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,440
It's not like there's no difference.

315
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,520
Yeah. But yeah, you know, I did Guardians

316
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,720
Toontown, which is a place I don't even go very, you know,

317
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,560
you don't usually go into Toontown.

318
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,040
I mean, I would skip it entirely.

319
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,120
It's kind of an inconvenient corner of the park.

320
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,000
It was good. I like, you know, there was some snow.

321
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,720
We'll talk about the grass maybe now or I don't do we hold that?

322
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,120
I I've got the big bold word grass.

323
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,320
Yeah, we have to talk about the grass. Yes.

324
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,360
You you bolded grass.

325
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,400
I bolded March 4th, 2020, because it's such a

326
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,600
it if it was a little if it had been a month or two earlier,

327
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,960
that still would have not been great.

328
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,680
But it was just so extremely close.

329
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,480
That's the way I didn't realize. Yeah, I did.

330
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,560
For a joyous ride, the most like fun, silly celebration ride.

331
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,680
And then sorry, pandemic shut you down.

332
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,880
Yeah. Sun can't smile anymore.

333
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,120
You were saying, though, going to the grass.

334
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,520
I completely forgot they put the code on Jessica Rapids.

335
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,560
I forgot about the code.

336
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,640
You forget about the I forgot about the code, too.

337
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,880
I yeah. Yeah.

338
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,360
This ride, the ride's not open.

339
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,360
You can't see the code right now, can you? Right.

340
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,520
And you always the right.

341
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,680
I didn't go on the ride, but I was just going through stuff to prepare for today.

342
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,840
And then it was some stuff about the Roger Rabbit.

343
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,200
I forgot about the coat.

344
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,960
They just go rabbit no longer femme fatale now disgusting peeper

345
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,120
in the bushes with their trench coat, like a peeping tom.

346
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,880
So they put if you don't, I mean, we've talked about it before.

347
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,160
They put a trench coat on Jessica Rabbit to cover her up,

348
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,080
which they fixed sexism with that move.

349
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,040
Finally, we've all known that Jessica Rabbit was the source.

350
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,680
Might have been well intentioned, but I think it's a

351
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,520
it's a weird puritanical move to

352
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,760
and also very lady.

353
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,000
Yes, extremely. And you're on board with that.

354
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,840
But well, yeah, the reason they did it is because I went to City Hall every week

355
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,080
and complained that this woman is where her ample bosom is exposed.

356
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,280
But that doesn't mean you wanted a full.

357
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,120
You know, a head to toe trench coat.

358
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,720
You just wanted like a yes, like a turtleneck.

359
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,840
Well, a turtleneck or a nun's habit, anything just to help

360
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,840
help the problem along.

361
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,680
So French co ridiculous.

362
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,520
No, this character, Jessica Rabbit, is a character with no agency.

363
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,480
She needs to work for a detective agency.

364
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,760
This has fixed the agency issue.

365
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,440
I don't know what it like.

366
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,960
What are they saying about if she's wearing a sparkly dress?

367
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,080
I would have fixed the Native American representation on Peter Pan

368
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,600
before I would have covered up Jessica Rabbit.

369
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,360
That sure that seems like I don't know.

370
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,800
By fixing, you mean just like taking a hammer to the entire sequence

371
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,000
and throwing it in the garbage. Well, sure. Yeah.

372
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,360
Sure. An easy fix.

373
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,800
You want to put them all in trench coats.

374
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,040
We've got it up on.

375
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,840
We've got it up on the screen.

376
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,840
And oh, yeah, the cartoon version of it. Yeah.

377
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,200
Why? What's this for?

378
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,360
Does this do? I'm not sure.

379
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,440
Again, maybe well intentioned, but

380
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,880
Jessica Rabbit's like a fully fleshed out character

381
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,120
who does stuff in the movie and has a fun personality.

382
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,920
And there's no shirt collar.

383
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,600
So it does look like she's wearing a trench coat with nothing else.

384
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,080
So she's a flash.

385
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,880
That is true. Yeah.

386
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,640
Get that evening gown out of there.

387
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,320
Put her in just a trench coat and give her a hat.

388
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
So anyway, I don't know.

389
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,920
Maybe the good again, good intentions, but it's a bit silly.

390
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,160
When I was when I was refreshing myself on ToonTown in general

391
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,160
is when I came up on this. Oh, my God.

392
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,320
I haven't seen this picture.

393
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,200
It's like she's in in a yellow like Tracy.

394
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,960
Well, she's in like, yeah, Dick Tracy or like, I guess French Stewart

395
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,280
in the Inspector Gadget movie is not in a yellow coat.

396
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,440
He's in the traditional.

397
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,560
I know what you mean, though.

398
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,160
It feels more like French Stewart, Inspector Gadget than Matthew

399
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,120
Broderick, Inspector. Yeah, I don't know why that is.

400
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,880
But because I've never seen it straight to video trench coat.

401
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So so eyes.

402
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,200
This is not this is a weird looking animatronic, too.

403
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,160
Yeah. So don't know about this.

404
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,640
So that's a recent change to ToonTown.

405
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,200
Yeah. So I was just refreshing myself on ToonTown and like,

406
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,720
because a lot of it's still closed and they're like the

407
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,200
the left side of ToonTown is closed, basically.

408
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,240
Yes, there is this greater revamp occurring.

409
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,360
And I remember thinking, wait, this ride opens in January,

410
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,200
but ToonTown doesn't open till March.

411
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,040
That's strange. How's that going to work?

412
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,800
This has happened before.

413
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,640
This is what it was like in Tomorrowland

414
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,360
while most of the land was down, but they just kept like a long,

415
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,320
weird walkway entirely boarded up all the way to Space Mountain.

416
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,320
So you get real claustrophobic.

417
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,120
And it's not like that.

418
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,440
It's you know, it's it's pleasant over there.

419
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,000
They've just they've opened like 30 percent of ToonTown,

420
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,200
the 30 percent that contains this new ride.

421
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,040
Yeah. So it felt I will say ToonTown felt even though it was mostly closed.

422
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,880
It felt alive in a way. Yeah.

423
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,720
I don't because the music is very now similar to the ride.

424
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,520
So that's kind of piped in and that kind of gives it a different vibe.

425
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,880
And the grass, I guess we could talk about the grass now.

426
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,720
How about the grass? The grass is good.

427
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,080
Yeah. Well, let me hear it.

428
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,960
Let me explain. You go ahead.

429
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,440
Let me weave the grass narrative.

430
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,840
So this this broader renovation of ToonTown that's happening,

431
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,840
a lot of it is taking what was kind of concrete areas.

432
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,640
And, you know, they had statues and in this case, it was like a

433
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,960
it was a Roger Rabbit Fountain in a concrete area.

434
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,800
And they're fixing that there was this trolley that hasn't run for a long time.

435
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,920
The Jolly Trolley.

436
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,920
We're going to take those tracks out and put in more green spaces

437
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,680
for families to run around and kids to run around.

438
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,520
That sounded nice to me. That seemed fine. Yeah.

439
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,400
Then we saw we got our first look at the grass,

440
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,880
at any of this grass.

441
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,720
And Jordan, if you have a photo just called the grass.

442
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,200
Perfect. Thank you.

443
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,640
This is one of the views that that we saw before going there in person.

444
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,520
And let's be honest, in the concept art, which I should have brought,

445
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,520
but in the concept art, it looks like these rolling hills

446
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,600
that are full of of magic that kids would tumble down.

447
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,960
And what opened is like we're looking at like two

448
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,000
cartoon street lamps that don't match the grass.

449
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,640
Then a real tree, not a cartoon tree.

450
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,080
And then what I mean, a lot of people said it online.

451
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,240
And Erin said it when I showed this to her that it just it looks like

452
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,720
at the airport where dogs go to the bathroom.

453
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,960
It absolutely. Yeah.

454
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,640
They're a giant version of just the big fake grass.

455
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,680
It is very fakie grass.

456
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,920
And there was a very, very unflattering before and after

457
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,760
where before was a whimsical Roger Rabbit fountain.

458
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,720
And then what we get is this big, you know, or not even that big.

459
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,800
It's like it seems like a modest, like, you know,

460
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,960
a slightly bigger than average backyards worth of fake grass.

461
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,000
Yeah. Yeah. Can I ask a thing about the grass?

462
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,040
Yeah. Is it it's for sure.

463
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,720
Astro turf. You were there.

464
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,720
Now we both stood on the grass. Yeah, it is.

465
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,600
It is fake. Yeah.

466
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,520
So I heard one of the defenses of it,

467
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,440
which not quite sure why anyone was bothering with that.

468
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,880
But one of the defenses were like, oh, parents, you know, kids

469
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,640
very for them to run around and parent people to sit down.

470
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,760
And it's just like the more I thought about that position,

471
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,120
the more I was thinking, well, like, yeah, right.

472
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,840
Yeah, it's like rolling meadows.

473
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,000
This looks like pure, pure magic.

474
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,360
Just like, yeah, a childhood destination of your dreams.

475
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,640
And then look at look at look in the lower right corner.

476
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,640
Like big, huge, huge, huge trees providing so much shade.

477
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,840
Yeah. And it looks like there's some sort of like what is it?

478
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,560
What are those multicolored things?

479
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,400
Jason might not have a view of this.

480
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,760
You see what like those little tents or something to play.

481
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,360
I know mailbox. Yeah.

482
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,400
It looks like something to play with.

483
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,440
And there's a rolling hill.

484
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,640
There's like a rolling kind of hill.

485
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,240
There's definitely elevation.

486
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,720
Yeah. On the hill.

487
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,000
Elevation. Elevation.

488
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,760
Yes. And then you cut back to just the flattest.

489
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,680
Yeah. OK.

490
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,600
Jason, you were saying.

491
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,400
Well, a couple of things sprung to mind the more I thought about it.

492
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,240
One, AstroTurf occasionally heats up in this,

493
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,520
I guess, a little hot and plastic in the sun.

494
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,480
Two, let's say everyone's

495
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,160
hanging out and popping a squat, you know, to getting comfy.

496
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,520
Just getting comfy on the ground.

497
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,960
The stitch came out of it.

498
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,920
I just like I.

499
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,040
Like at the end of the day, it's AstroTurf

500
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,440
so they can take a bunch of garden hoses and hose it because it's going to get

501
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,280
filled with weird little chunks of food and dirt.

502
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,360
And you're saying it's going to get dirtier.

503
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,920
It's going to get nasty. Oh, it's going to get so nasty.

504
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,560
I mean, grass people would have just been like just grabbing chunks of it.

505
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,400
I feel like I'm taking this home.

506
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,680
I'm going to sell this on eBay.

507
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,760
Real Disneyland grass.

508
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,880
There's a reason there's a fence of behind all this.

509
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,040
You know what I'm saying? What do you mean?

510
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,880
What? What is that?

511
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,320
What is the reason? What's the reason?

512
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,320
If that guardrail was not there, people would just climb over

513
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,080
and just fuck around on the other side.

514
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,520
Well, they can't really come to the other side.

515
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,720
There's not really much on the other.

516
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,320
Why does the rail help?

517
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,000
So people aren't climbing over it.

518
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,640
I'm talking liability.

519
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,840
There needs to be a rail.

520
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,160
That's not new, though, is it?

521
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,360
Yeah, that was there before. No.

522
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,040
And that's fine.

523
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,120
But I'm saying like actual plant life, like if people would just go

524
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,960
and climb those hills by whatever is back there, I think people would.

525
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,040
Like people would climb that children would.

526
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,760
But again, the rail is not new.

527
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,360
The rail was always hung up on the rail.

528
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,920
And I'm curious what you brought up.

529
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,040
What is your point? Why am I hung up on the rail?

530
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,240
Oh, I'm just saying like real plant life could get destroyed by people

531
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,600
tramps saying over it all day long.

532
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,440
Sure. In the same way, like, OK, that railing is very clear.

533
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,280
Like, do not go further than this.

534
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,120
Do that railing that has been there for 30 years. Yes.

535
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,200
But more before even besides that, the bigger thing,

536
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,720
there are two of the saddest benches I have ever seen.

537
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,120
I feel like they don't match.

538
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,600
They don't match.

539
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,840
I don't quite understand why that is not all bench.

540
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,920
Yeah. To go back real quick.

541
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,440
Were you saying they're damned if they do damned if they don't in regards to

542
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,480
it's going to be bad if it's AstroTurf, it's going to be bad if it's real plant life?

543
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,360
Yeah. I mean, I think that yeah, I think that's a consideration.

544
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,480
I don't think I don't know that it's I'm saying it should have been grass.

545
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,800
I mean, and I probably wouldn't have thought about this at all.

546
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,360
If not for the previous concept art where they're showing like

547
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,000
massive amounts of green space, you know.

548
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,400
Well, let me get into why this is all come up.

549
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,360
And if you follow us on Twitter, you may have seen this and that.

550
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,360
OK, so, you know, we've recently been noting that some of

551
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,240
Universal's announcements and innovations have been more exciting.

552
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,680
Yeah. And more ambitious than Disney's recent news and announcements.

553
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,080
So I tweeted the joke.

554
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,720
Hey, let's look at Disney and Universal's new themed lands.

555
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:13,360
And side by side, I put Super Nintendo World and the grass

556
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:19,440
and our audience, you listeners who we love, got the joke,

557
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,680
liked the joke, most importantly, moved on from the joke.

558
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,640
I imagine all of you going like, uh, kept going.

559
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,640
Then I leave the computer for a while and I come back to a lot more alerts than usual.

560
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:35,960
And I discovered that we are in mid cancellation by Twitter.

561
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,360
And every don't say that Twitter don't give people the satisfaction.

562
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,680
What do you mean? Why not?

563
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,120
I think that's absolutely what it is, because I don't consider our listeners.

564
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,960
Diz Twitter, I get this type of person.

565
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,440
This is Diz Twitter.

566
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,320
My friend, that's where all if you're like, I'll show you what is using it as in a bad way.

567
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,280
Yes. Yeah, no, I get it.

568
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,480
I just like, oh, I don't want to.

569
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,800
I don't forgot. I forget about that phrase.

570
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,640
And then I see it. I'm like, guys, we must remember the phrase so that we're different,

571
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,840
so that we're better, so that we rise above this Twitter.

572
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,440
Sorry. I spend plenty of time online researching the parks,

573
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,440
but I spend most of my time in General Mills Twitter.

574
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,360
OK, Jen Mill, twin, you know,

575
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,200
just looking for boo berry hot takes.

576
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,440
No. So like suddenly all these replies, always from people who do not fall.

577
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,240
Who have never interacted with us before.

578
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,760
And just to cherry pick a few.

579
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,520
It's all it's bad take.

580
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,000
Bizarre take. This post is so lazy.

581
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,040
This is lazy.

582
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,040
Well, you're right.

583
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,000
But that's when you have an observation and you write it down.

584
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,760
Yeah, it doesn't take a lot of work.

585
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,520
You know, this is not if actually this is not a fair comparison.

586
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,560
Actually, what you've done is picked the worst view.

587
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:59,200
And if you turn your camera around, what you will see is that I didn't take the picture.

588
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,840
I can't turn my camera around.

589
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,960
I saw a photo of grass and it looks like boring grass.

590
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,640
And then a lot of people and then like, you know, it's it's not a new land.

591
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,560
It's a rethemed land.

592
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,160
And honestly, open park grass is so rare in a theme park that I welcome.

593
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,160
Rare, apparently still rare.

594
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,640
A disaster. If you turn the camera around, you would have just seen

595
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,680
a particle work construction walls like that's what you say.

596
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,360
You turn the camera.

597
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,960
What does that look? I don't know.

598
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,880
Any view of this grass should be like, of course,

599
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,840
when you choose the view of the grass, that's the bad view.

600
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,920
But if you use the good view, it will be a good view.

601
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,720
What do you mean? I haven't been in the grass.

602
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,080
I saw one photo of the grass like this.

603
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,240
Oh, this is the enemy.

604
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,080
What Jordan has brought up is a little Twitter bird with mouse ears.

605
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,920
And this is the this is the problem.

606
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:50,080
Well, well, well, it seems like times like this, we'd all be much better off

607
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,360
with unannounced tweet limits of like you sent two tweets today.

608
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,400
Slow down. Yeah, I tried to make a joke today.

609
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,920
And then it was like, you have reached your tweet limit for the day.

610
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,440
What is a tweet?

611
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,680
Have I tweeted anything today?

612
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,040
I think we treated three things as far as I knew there was not a limit

613
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,760
that was three. Yeah.

614
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,960
But then actually then what you have to do is just schedule a tweet

615
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,560
one minute in advance. And that's fine.

616
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,360
You can do that forever.

617
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,560
But when the world what is happening to Twitter?

618
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,920
But anyway, and here's what it built up to.

619
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,360
And this wasn't oh, wait, actually one more that I like.

620
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:29,880
Yeah. You know, Toontown is notorious for being a concrete jungle.

621
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,800
And where dreams are made of notorious.

622
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,120
Concrete where dreams are made of. Yeah.

623
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,280
Yeah. Which isn't that that's a beautiful thing.

624
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,640
A concrete jungle is a nice thing.

625
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,120
Like New York City or Buena Park. That's right.

626
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,000
That's horny. I mean, it's like, you know, you pretty much you got San Quentin

627
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,160
and you got to town, like in terms of just like just yard.

628
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,720
Yeah. You know, children have been afraid of getting curb stomped

629
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,880
in Toontown for many years.

630
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,600
And finally, they've made it impossible.

631
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,320
And I for one, welcome the great

632
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,160
the rise of film noir in America.

633
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,280
You know, it's it's movies like The Naked City or The Stranger.

634
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:13,440
And then it ends with Toontown 1994's Disney's Toontown.

635
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,720
Anyway, what it what it then builds to and, Jason, you were you kind of alluded

636
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,120
to this is that like and this wasn't a response to us.

637
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,280
This is a response to other people who posted

638
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,200
a very almost no comment with just pictures of the grass.

639
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,360
Childless dorks will never understand the benefit

640
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:37,040
to parents of the simple pleasures in a busy place of a plot of grass,

641
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,200
just a place where a child can roam free and just be just be themselves.

642
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,440
Like how are we?

643
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,400
It's because we've become Walt Whitman

644
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,960
about the plot of fake

645
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,200
about a putting green that has been open for less than 24 hours.

646
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,200
Just a simple place.

647
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,600
Three hundred feet of a putting green.

648
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,080
Is this not what makes America great?

649
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,640
I think of Yosemite and I think of what

650
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,560
grand Tetons the and this plot of grass.

651
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,760
This is what our country is made of.

652
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,840
Which will thinking to have like, well, the reality is going to be

653
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,840
it's going to be filled with, you know, crushed cheese crackers

654
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:23,680
and the smell of soil diapers within one hour of the land opening.

655
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,640
That is what the garden hose allotment in the budget is for.

656
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

657
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,840
You should add. I but when I hear this, the childless dorks

658
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,160
will not understand grass.

659
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,400
I have a child. I was a childless dork.

660
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,760
Oh, yeah, that's how we got into this podcast.

661
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:47,240
But I have a child and I have been to one, if not two, if not three parks

662
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,600
every day for the last two and a half years.

663
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,640
You know, parks like real places with grass that are beautiful,

664
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,760
that are made organically and that have like built up nature and culture

665
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,840
over the years that are like genuine places with lots of space

666
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,360
for kids to run around and, you know, things to do.

667
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,640
Like last night, check kids like swings and slides.

668
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,440
Yeah, you know, stuff like that.

669
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,800
That's what the one thing kids like is stuff.

670
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
And when I'm looking at this plot of grass,

671
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,720
I don't know that it has a lot of stuff.

672
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,760
There's not a lot of stuff. Yes.

673
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,920
So this is just I what what I have.

674
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,200
If you don't agree with the joke, that's one thing.

675
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,680
But now that you're now you are telling me that I don't understand grass.

676
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,040
The concept of grass. You don't.

677
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,880
I guess you don't. I guess you're just Mr. Big City.

678
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,720
Do you do you remember what this is?

679
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,320
Are we so cynical?

680
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:44,440
This is called a blade and all of life comes from this.

681
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,480
Don't you see?

682
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,120
But where are the country mice to go?

683
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,520
They were already run out when the orange groves were taken away.

684
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,040
This is all we have now.

685
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,440
It's a tribute to Anaheim's past.

686
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:02,800
Anyway, with all this, I needed to check out the grass for myself.

687
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,160
I have a picture of myself on the grass.

688
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,040
I there I'm trying to figure it out.

689
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,400
I'm getting my head around the grass.

690
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:19,760
What happens is then my son is let loose on the grass, runs around playing happy.

691
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,560
I pick him up. We start doing like our favorite game,

692
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,880
like exactly the kind of like spin around games that we love.

693
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,160
He loves the grass.

694
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,280
It's the happiest he's been all morning.

695
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,040
Aaron loves the grass.

696
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,240
We turn to each other when we both say, oh, all right, the grass is good.

697
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,920
Yeah. After all that.

698
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,920
OK, the grass is good.

699
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,320
Maybe the grass is good.

700
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,120
Mike, you felt similar?

701
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,000
Well, I said, oh, this is this is my son squishing my face on the grass.

702
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,200
Well, his personality was coming out.

703
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,160
He really was like wound up.

704
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,880
He was so happy on the grass.

705
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,920
I came into the land and I immediately looked over and there were just children

706
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,720
just running back and forth.

707
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,240
The hills, the lack of hills were alive

708
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,760
with the sound of children laughing and parents were sitting.

709
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,360
They were watching the children.

710
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,880
Children's are. It didn't look as bad.

711
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,320
Yeah. No, I have to admit that, too.

712
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,960
It photographed badly.

713
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,440
It's nonsense about like, but it's the bad view of the grass.

714
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,800
That's bullshit.

715
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,160
It's there's no it just looks kind of weird in a lot of pictures.

716
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:24,800
In a lot of. Yeah.

717
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,800
When you're there now, I see you got to seeing the fun.

718
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,040
Obviously, they could have done a better job with it.

719
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,960
This is what? Yes.

720
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,320
No one knows. The children would not be upset if it was like a little landscape till.

721
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,840
Yeah. And it's Disney.

722
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,960
Yes. But when I went over there, the grass was a big hit with a lot of people.

723
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,360
I have to admit, I just I wanted to do the buildup with the monologue.

724
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,680
I wanted to get the rant out of my system.

725
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,800
I still feel everything I felt in the rant. Sure.

726
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,440
Here's my ruling.

727
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,040
Grass good.

728
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,240
Diz Twitter bad.

729
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,800
OK, that's well, and let's see what happens when you add a few more dozen

730
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,200
people hanging out on that grass.

731
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,440
You know, with the better.

732
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,720
It's going to turn into Ultima.

733
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,360
It's going to turn into a lot.

734
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,120
Look, Disney's been saying for a long time, they need to be anti grass.

735
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,280
We need to let children run in the theme parks a little more.

736
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,680
We children love running by the concrete.

737
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,960
There's more.

738
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,080
The more as long as the green space opens on the other side.

739
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:33,080
I it's just if that green space should be better, it should not be big.

740
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,400
Putting green cannot be another big putting green, because I think it will make

741
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:40,000
the whole whole of Toon Town seem bad, because this is just a little chunk

742
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,600
when you come in on the right.

743
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,480
So when you look over, you're not really seeing that it's Astro Turf.

744
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,000
You're just seeing people sitting and playing and you still see Roger Rabin.

745
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,600
You still see the all the stuff.

746
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:55,000
So yes, the cannot be putting green on the left.

747
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,880
So we'll see.

748
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,120
Eyes are on the next batch of grass.

749
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,520
The next batch of grass is where we will really make the grass determination.

750
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,000
Yeah, we will do a new Toon Town episode, I think, when it's open.

751
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,640
Make the determination.

752
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,480
I don't have a pass.

753
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,960
I mean, do I have to get a pass just to see the grass?

754
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,600
You do. A lot of them have already sold out again.

755
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,920
I know I tried to read.

756
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:19,760
I had a one day pass and I tried to renew and it said, would you like the inspire?

757
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,920
And I thought that's the one I had. Right.

758
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,920
The cheap one. No, I had.

759
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,000
Imagine inspire is extremely expensive.

760
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,840
The expensive one.

761
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,840
I am glad I didn't just like squint at a word that starts with an I and ends

762
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,120
with an E and buy. Yeah.

763
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,400
And then when I saw like it's only one hundred

764
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,000
and forty dollars a month after the down payment.

765
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,080
Oh, you could buy a lot of grass seed for that money.

766
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,160
We can plant this magical grass.

767
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,160
That is suddenly so important.

768
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,960
And these, you know what it is mainly is this word take

769
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,280
because and this is where listeners I love you because you knew it was a joke.

770
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,680
And then this Twitter is like, actually, joke is not a thing.

771
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,480
There are takes and that is what everything is is take.

772
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,240
So make it your facts straight because you wrote a take.

773
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,200
It was a lazy take.

774
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,240
I know people were.

775
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,760
I tweeted there was a pic.

776
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,720
I was watching the Indiana Jones trailer and there's a picture where Harrison

777
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,880
Ford's on a on a horse and it's not him because the horse is going nuts.

778
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,600
And it's a CGI Harrison Ford.

779
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
And I was just watching it.

780
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,400
And one of the like screens popped out of me is it's funny

781
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,200
because his head looked tiny because it's been superimposed on this body.

782
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,840
And I post a photo of it with a joke or whatever.

783
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,000
I and somebody's like, what, you want an 80 year old man to be riding a horse?

784
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,600
Yeah. And I was like, yes.

785
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,160
And I want him to get hurt again.

786
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,560
Like I want Harrison's for I want Harrison Ford's bones cracking.

787
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,640
That's what I want. That's what you Taskmaster Mike demand.

788
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,400
Somebody was like, nerds should never have had a pause feature or something.

789
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,000
And I was like, what?

790
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I don't what are you talking about?

791
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,800
And someone's like the siege like blah, blah, blah.

792
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,280
CGI is fine if you don't like nitpick it or something.

793
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,400
And I was like, I don't care.

794
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,560
I thought it was funny. I actually was a big missing point.

795
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,760
I know that it sounds like I care about the grass

796
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,360
because I just yelled about the grass for 10 minutes.

797
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,640
But I was hopefully in the interest of being funny.

798
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,320
This is what the take of the joke people miss.

799
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,360
Yeah, they think that you have initiated a debate.

800
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,520
Yeah, I know this goes one way.

801
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,960
You know how in a comedy club, you have a microphone and you talk

802
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,560
that we know are not standups.

803
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,840
Not yet. We're getting there.

804
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,840
We're building up to it.

805
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,800
You know, working on being truth tellers and then we'll get to that level.

806
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,440
Well, I think we could get on club random with that.

807
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,400
Just go have it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

808
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:41,320
So, oh, my God, that Harrison Ford is just to pick that apart also.

809
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,960
Yeah, that person has come out.

810
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,960
Their take is anti pause button.

811
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,440
They I what my I think they should have never.

812
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,160
The pause button is the worst.

813
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,440
Some people say there never should have been an Internet.

814
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,560
How it's divided us.

815
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,600
I say it's the pause button.

816
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,440
I VHS is shouldn't have had them.

817
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,480
They shouldn't have them on film sets that those two little lines

818
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,800
or the or the death of culture can pick apart.

819
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,960
Yes, CGI now, which is bad.

820
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,040
And then some people there was like making a point about CGI.

821
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,680
And I'm like, I don't know.

822
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,080
Oh, there it is.

823
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,680
There it is. Oh, I said it.

824
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,640
I was I was trying to make sure that it was the right thing.

825
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,520
But no, it is five likes on that. Who are these five likes?

826
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,120
They don't listen to podcasts.

827
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,840
They're right. I guarantee it was funny.

828
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,880
His head was small.

829
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,200
It just looked funny.

830
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,560
It looked like a funny picture. What can I tell you?

831
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,520
You know what I saw when I saw that I saw one perfect shot.

832
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,320
It should have been on the Twitter. One perfect shot.

833
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,280
Well, that's a that is one that we're like, OK, this got out of hand really fast.

834
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,240
That is the tri star logo that is played for a lot of movies.

835
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,880
Jordan, I just emailed you a picture.

836
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,240
You can throw it up because we're talking about Indiana Jones.

837
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,840
This is the cardboard standee.

838
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,160
What for it? No, I this is the cardboard standee for Indiana Jones.

839
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,160
I sent this to Mike because I was at the movies seeing Megan.

840
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,120
Megan, very good, very fun.

841
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,200
She's a little creep. She's a little creepo.

842
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:13,920
But yeah, this is similarly to like they kind of didn't go all the way with this.

843
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:19,120
The CGI, some of the marketing material leaves a little to be desired.

844
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,280
I mean, Dial of Destiny, I think Jason, be careful.

845
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,320
You're going to get some blowback from whatever this is about.

846
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,720
That's great. I have all notifications turned off except text, text, messaging

847
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,480
and phone calls. So I'm sorry if you get did you get all those podcasts?

848
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,880
The ride Twitter like reply notifications.

849
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,440
Do you know because you always have notifications on.

850
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,280
Remember, I think I might have some notifications turned on.

851
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,600
But that's but for Mike, that's you dump.

852
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,240
That's my life. You dump a bucket of water into the Mississippi River.

853
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,080
Yeah, that keeps your notifications.

854
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,680
That kept me going when I was tired on Monday walking around

855
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,320
because I hadn't walked around in so long.

856
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,960
It's your crank. It's my crank.

857
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,640
You have notifications to get the adrenaline.

858
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I like it is what I'm saying.

859
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,880
But no, I don't I I don't I'm not I'm overwhelmed more by deals

860
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,840
being notified notifications.

861
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,880
Mm hmm. Drop everything else.

862
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,920
Is it tough for you to do these podcast records where that's two hours?

863
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,280
At least where you can't. Yeah, I have missed.

864
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,680
I have missed deals from doing the podcast.

865
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,600
Yeah, I'm not. Yeah. Do we need to end it?

866
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,840
Do we need to end it just so that you can or just give you the ability

867
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,120
to still be checking the deals? I record.

868
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:32,200
There's there's a new guy I follow that's got such good deals

869
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,600
that yes, maybe because of this new Twitter account deal vibes.

870
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,280
Will that turn it on for tax message?

871
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,560
You turn that deal vibes overrides.

872
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,360
Let's let's set it up.

873
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,000
Jordan, we'll do this here at Forever Doug.

874
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,040
Let's patch deal vibes right into the podcasting gear

875
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,040
so that like there's just a robot voice reading deal vibes.

876
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,560
My yeah, yeah, that gets deal vibes, notifications, Scott's get

877
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,640
Scott Gustin notifications so you can actually learn when magic

878
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,960
keys are on sale because Disney is no help.

879
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,440
That's true. Alerting people.

880
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,520
This is the candy.

881
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,920
Yeah, Jason, what is your issue?

882
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,400
Problem is just like it's just kind of him in the shadows.

883
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,600
There's like nothing about this movie.

884
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,760
It's just the logo.

885
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,280
And then he's like just hanging out and darken it like most of this stand

886
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,120
is darkness. Maybe he's in a cave.

887
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,200
Lava behind him. Maybe he's in a gold smelt.

888
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,080
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know.

889
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,760
So what's your issue with that? That's the end.

890
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,120
It just seems like nothing.

891
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,800
It just seems like it's just like a stand.

892
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,160
I take a photo.

893
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,920
I guess so.

894
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,800
It lets you know he's not shaving.

895
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,800
All right. Got a real stubbly chin.

896
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,200
So maybe he's at a rough run of time.

897
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,320
And you don't know he tries calling Mutt.

898
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,760
And Mutt doesn't call him back.

899
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,360
Right. And you don't know what he's looking at.

900
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,000
What and like what he's doing with his hands.

901
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,240
I mean, turning a dial.

902
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,440
Is he turning a dial left?

903
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,040
Is he turning right? He's he's reading a newspaper that says

904
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:58,840
Mutt Williams causes Gulf of Tonkin incident, sentenced to life in jail.

905
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,480
War in Vietnam begins.

906
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,680
Isn't that isn't it more funny is your imagination, Jason?

907
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,360
I suppose. I suppose.

908
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,120
So, you know, childless dorks will never understand

909
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,280
the benefit of just a simple teaser standee.

910
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,280
That's right. Well, but I've got disposable income to spend on all the grass,

911
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,560
seed and sod that I could need.

912
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:29,440
I don't have a Twitter account that gives me updates on sod deals, but I should.

913
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,160
Oh, sir. Sod. You follow, sir.

914
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,800
Sales on sod sales, in fact.

915
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,200
All right. All right.

916
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,080
Let's talk about Mickey Mouse.

917
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,320
All right. Yes.

918
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:44,160
From from the grass to the ride, if you don't know, there is a ride past the grass.

919
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:49,640
And yeah, it's it's it's brand Sparklin new looks wonderful.

920
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,240
Great exterior in Disneyland.

921
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:57,520
The the the full story here, if you don't know it, there has never been a Mickey

922
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,600
and Minnie ride before.

923
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:04,480
There's not really been a ride with the primary characters, as far as I can recall.

924
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,040
Maybe they appear in little fits and stuff.

925
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,040
Never. You've never there's never been something where you get in a ride vehicle

926
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,800
that moves that has Mickey and Minnie in it because they have the Mickey Mouse

927
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,720
review, which is a show basically in Disney World.

928
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,720
But yeah, this is the fill our magic or something.

929
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,960
Yes, a ride and the rides going to take you to see Mickey's.

930
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,480
Little never have little great movie where I sliver head sorcerer Mickey.

931
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,080
That's true. Yeah, that's true.

932
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,160
Seen. Oh, that's a good point.

933
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,200
But Disney is selling this.

934
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,640
It's like, oh, the first full Mickey Mouse ride.

935
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,960
Actual Mickey, Minnie, right?

936
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,960
And specifically, it is the style of these shorts that we've spoken very highly of

937
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,320
that I think are just called Mickey Mouse, so they've put them out under different names.

938
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:52,640
But these wonderful, visually dynamic, super manic, really funny for all ages.

939
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,920
Yeah. Yeah. Shorts that have been coming out since 2013.

940
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,280
Paul Rudish, the creative force behind them.

941
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,760
And I mean, what a cool that we're it's going to be a Mickey ride.

942
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,120
But attributing this world of yeah, yeah.

943
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,880
And they're like, there's something weird cartoons to their weird.

944
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,200
I I have a few things on that.

945
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,120
Todd Martin's mentioned that, like, oh, this ride is more like a screwball

946
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,520
car 1930s cartoon short.

947
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,120
I do wonder when I read that, it's like, oh, is that what's missing

948
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,120
from a lot of popular movies and TV?

949
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,440
It's like, oh, yeah, well, we don't have screwball, like to see, like John Cena,

950
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,960
like holding too many plates or like getting knocked by a door.

951
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,800
Oh, but he gets he chugs and blockers that blockers.

952
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,960
I think is a thing that people liked.

953
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,520
Like there was like crazy antics.

954
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,760
Yeah. Screwball is is let's ask the audience is blockers screwball.

955
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,120
Blockers screwball screwball.

956
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,720
I don't I guess screwing screwing balls and not a say of their brothers.

957
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,720
Was there any?

958
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,640
But did heparna get their way?

959
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,800
Did heparna Tracy butt chug in any of their films?

960
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,000
No, just to prepare for the scene.

961
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,160
Yes. Yeah, that was all that was in medical.

962
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,920
Just constantly drinking off screen and on.

963
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,680
So the shorts, OK, they are just called Mickey Mouse

964
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,640
from 2013 to 2018 was the first run.

965
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:23,080
And then in 2020, they've referred to them as the wonderful world of Disney.

966
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,680
They started where the wonderful world of Mickey Mouse.

967
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,920
Paul Rudish, a very interesting career.

968
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,840
A lot of work with Gendi Tartakovsky.

969
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,840
I think that's how you say that he worked on the Star Wars Clone Wars.

970
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,920
Early in his career, he worked in storyboard and character

971
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,280
development on Batman, the animator series.

972
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,600
Geez. That's incredible.

973
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:49,200
Crashly, we found out he's a freaking nepo baby.

974
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,120
He's a nepo baby. Oh, wow.

975
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,960
I didn't know his father created Rainbow Brite.

976
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,360
Wow. Wow. Really? Yeah.

977
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,680
Wow. I know that rainbow bright babies.

978
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,440
I you know that maybe we finally found the point

979
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:10,440
where I am bothered by the phrase because, you know, if there's talent.

980
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,920
And I think what people maybe miss about nepo baby is what you're

981
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,040
what is being implied is that the baby is not very talented.

982
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:21,360
Oh, sure. If the baby is talented, there is not a problem.

983
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,480
Yeah, that becomes a dynasty.

984
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,520
Yeah, yeah. Those happen.

985
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,920
There's very stacked, which this is incredible.

986
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,560
If that's a like animation legend, father and son.

987
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,480
And God knows, yeah, this guy's worked on incredible stuff.

988
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,560
My Little Pony as well, like kind of concurrently with these Mickey Mouse

989
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,840
shorts, my little pony samurai Jack Powerpuff girls.

990
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,840
Like it's all stuff people super love.

991
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,000
And I saw there was a panel, I think,

992
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,600
that Rudeish spoke on about this attraction.

993
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,680
And he made a point I thought was interesting, which is how

994
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,920
like there's a cool thing that, you know, this isn't

995
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,080
this isn't a ride based on stuff that was made 20 years ago.

996
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,440
And we're sort of like stabbing at that, a style that has like these are very

997
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:14,560
current and it's completely it is the artists and animators and voice actors

998
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,080
and everybody who works on their shorts putting the ride together.

999
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,160
So there's a real like, you know, direct through line,

1000
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,120
you know, like the vibe is exactly correct.

1001
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,200
And he pointed out how it's actually very early Disneyland

1002
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,000
that that is the case, because in 55 you have like

1003
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,760
Claude Coates and those kind of people that they're like Claude Coates

1004
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,560
is painting the Snow White background or whatever.

1005
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,480
And he did the background of the movie, too.

1006
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,880
So it's actually like hearkening back to kind of a cool,

1007
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,560
you know, tradition that maybe Disney has not had for for a little bit.

1008
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,320
Yeah, it's like the same people were.

1009
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,880
I mean, yeah, I'm trying to think.

1010
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,160
Yeah, they don't.

1011
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,240
I guess like Guardians of the Galaxy is new and new movie.

1012
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,760
And it's a newish ride, obviously.

1013
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,200
And Avatar is like the Avatar people.

1014
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,520
But yeah, it's but it's as far as the animated stuff.

1015
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,920
Yeah, it feels like that hasn't happened for a while.

1016
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,840
By the way, I haven't said this on the show.

1017
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:17,160
I don't think that this this victory that I had that I'm very proud of

1018
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,800
that the composer of Oh, right.

1019
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,800
Way of Water, but also I think at least one of the writers

1020
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:28,840
of the Shaman of Song song liked my Pyotr song.

1021
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,080
I was I was beaming about that.

1022
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:36,320
That's great. He gave like like replied up several times to my account

1023
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,880
to podcast the ride.

1024
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:41,000
Yes, I guess I'm in the same league as Simon.

1025
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,160
Two composers.

1026
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,760
Simon Franklin, I think.

1027
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,000
Just two Avatar composers talking shop.

1028
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,640
Frank Witter, Simon Franklin.

1029
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,720
Yeah, that freaked me out.

1030
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,440
That's a good credible. That's a good Twitter.

1031
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,160
You know, that's why.

1032
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,000
Yes, that's why you got to keep it.

1033
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,080
That's why Twitter is sold for so much money.

1034
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,800
You got the highest of highs and the lowest of lows, you know,

1035
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,040
happening all at once.

1036
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,240
Oh, wait, that was a high of high.

1037
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,840
That means the devil's coming for me.

1038
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,520
Oh, no. Watch out.

1039
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,720
And he's going to be in a cheap looking naughty devil outfit

1040
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,880
that he got at a costume store.

1041
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,840
By the way, really, let's try to stay on this for too long.

1042
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:20,360
But this is kind of fresh in the news that Eiger announces

1043
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,160
there is an Avatar something.

1044
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,040
Oh, right. Right. Right.

1045
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,400
Experience, he says, coming to Disneyland.

1046
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,280
And we were texting about this today.

1047
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,480
Mike took the you could say pessimist.

1048
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,720
You could probably say realist view that you think this is not

1049
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,280
flying past that attraction if it was going to be a cloned.

1050
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:44,840
I've seen a lot of people online say, oh, this is going into the ESPN zone.

1051
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,600
And it's like a walkthrough.

1052
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,520
I think there's one in the Shanghai.

1053
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:52,760
There's one of the one of the parks has like a walkthrough attraction.

1054
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,840
That's just sort of like Hong Kong, maybe Hong Kong.

1055
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,160
There's a very elaborate exhibit.

1056
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,520
And it's yeah, it's just like sort of an exhibit thing.

1057
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,120
I there was another part of that where they said they were exploring

1058
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,600
other ways to get the characters in.

1059
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,760
But I feel like he's saying attraction.

1060
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,840
Plus, they cut like 700 million dollars out of their

1061
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,360
theme park budget, I believe, as well.

1062
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,800
They said on this call today.

1063
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,960
And they're laying seven thousand people off.

1064
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,360
So I have a feeling it's not we're getting any part of Pandora anytime soon.

1065
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,520
But I hope I hope I'm wrong.

1066
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:28,360
I I think they should kill two birds with one stone, make it the ESPN

1067
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,240
zone, locate it on Pandora, you know.

1068
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,120
Oh, yeah, that's yeah.

1069
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,520
I think that's actually a very good idea.

1070
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,960
Rainforest Cafe is still open as Star Wars.

1071
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,320
Like what? I don't know if they're calling it launch bay, but it's start.

1072
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,080
The Rainforest Cafe is now like a rebel base.

1073
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,640
Oh, yeah. The jurors are like a trading post.

1074
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,960
Yeah, that's what they. Yeah.

1075
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,080
So then Pandora will be next door, probably at the ESPN zone.

1076
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,200
That'd be the dream of the humans for sure.

1077
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,600
This is of Miles Corritch is opening an ESPN zone on Pandora.

1078
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,640
You could see what I got to civilize this place.

1079
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,920
There's too much grass.

1080
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,960
See Navi Sports playing, you know, that would be fun.

1081
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,680
We're going to represent the low.

1082
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,600
We're going to air local games.

1083
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,080
It's going to be great. You love it.

1084
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,600
And we got an agreement with Caesar Sportsbook.

1085
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,080
Those commercials play every commercial break.

1086
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,000
Iger said that they're not going to sell ESPN,

1087
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,280
but that the previous administration was thinking about it.

1088
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,400
Was looking into it.

1089
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,240
So Iger wants to keep ESPN.

1090
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:31,400
OK, he's intimidated by just the sheer presence of Dana White's slap

1091
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,240
slap fight. Oh, yes.

1092
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,800
Got familiar with this real quick.

1093
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,360
It's really shocking, really unpleasant.

1094
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:43,480
It's just it's the guy who the UFC guy has a new new thing, a new sports

1095
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,520
endeavor where two guys just stand and they just slap each other really hard.

1096
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:53,400
And it sounds like the devil has come for all of the participants in the slap fight.

1097
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,840
I well, it's Dana White, so he might be the devil.

1098
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,720
So possible. I got me.

1099
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,360
I was watching a walkthrough.

1100
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,600
There's a great account called Document Disney, and they just, you know,

1101
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,520
to rides and lands and hotels and everything.

1102
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,400
And they're current from two days ago, their walkthrough of downtown

1103
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:17,200
Disney is very funny because there is so much branding and statues

1104
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,440
for this Disney 100 thing.

1105
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,680
But a good chunk of downtown Disney is construction walls

1106
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,480
and active construction sites.

1107
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:30,520
So it's just statues by like, OK, we crammed a bunch of picnic tables

1108
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,400
for people to sit at if they go to the food truck.

1109
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,680
And the AMC theater building is gone.

1110
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,880
Oh, yeah. It is an empty lot.

1111
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,360
I didn't see that. I mean,

1112
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,400
maybe it will become grass.

1113
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,280
Don't make fun of it, though. Fingers crossed.

1114
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,680
So anyway, we got the personnel of these great cartoons

1115
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:58,880
and and this all sort of because it opens in Florida first.

1116
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:02,360
And I don't know, maybe the intention was always to make it

1117
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,520
like a multi-park franchise, but it seems like it initially

1118
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:10,640
must have grown out of wanting for some reason to replace the great movie ride.

1119
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:14,960
Yes. If I still can't imagine why you'd want to do such a thing.

1120
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,200
I think I was listening to a podcast.

1121
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,880
I'll find it and I'll plug it in a second because I can't remember it off the top

1122
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,160
of my head. But I think there were that was the initial thing.

1123
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,920
And then they were like, just when they design it, they were like,

1124
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,520
well, we could also put this into Disneyland.

1125
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,920
So I think you're right.

1126
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,760
I think the start of it was like we want to replace the great movie ride.

1127
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,360
It was spurred by because we and you got a big footprint there.

1128
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:38,160
And like, you know, if we clear everything out, that's like a tremendous amount

1129
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,480
of space, like giant rooms where you could do something sprawling. Right.

1130
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,840
Which this attraction certainly is.

1131
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,640
There were rumors for a while it was going into California Adventure.

1132
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,160
I don't know if that was ever possible, but I remember hearing that a lot

1133
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,440
that they were going to put that on the lot in the Hollywood lot.

1134
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,120
That's a good Hollywood choice.

1135
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:59,080
Would have been something big to finally be good over there.

1136
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,880
Disney History Institute podcast,

1137
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,880
which I did. I like that website.

1138
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,880
Yeah. I didn't even know existed until today

1139
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,880
when I was listening to this, and it's got a lot of the good history

1140
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:13,360
and of this ride and no like that.

1141
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:17,640
You mean without like a big screed against the grass, Dana White stuff.

1142
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,240
Talk about the Jessica Rabbit trench coat. Yeah, none of it.

1143
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,320
All right. So if you want the pure, we should have given the people

1144
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:28,040
this plug early in the show if they wanted to go switch to something purely

1145
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,640
for information.

1146
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,280
Just because we can like step through what's what's cool about this thing

1147
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,520
and the differences between the two iterations.

1148
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:42,160
But but maybe just to like dive in and like emotional reaction from it,

1149
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,400
let's just talk about like the basics of what this is,

1150
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,560
which is I mean, the headline of it and the technology of it

1151
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,640
is you are you are truly in the world of these cartoons.

1152
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,000
They use the phrase two and a half D.

1153
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,680
It is not a 3D ride. You don't wear glasses on this,

1154
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,120
but it is crystal clear,

1155
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,000
just a maculite footage that you're watching.

1156
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,960
And it's these giant expansive rooms that 360 degrees every way

1157
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:16,640
that you turn is is just bright, splashy, dynamic, hand drawn looking

1158
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:21,280
backgrounds, art, animation that led you into the world of these

1159
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,200
like madcap adventures of Mickey and Minnie.

1160
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,880
It's just like like the most bright visual carnival of a ride.

1161
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,680
How does everybody how we all feel about it?

1162
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,960
I rode this with when my family and I were down in Florida.

1163
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,720
It was the first day I think was first thing we rode

1164
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,920
because Rises of Resistance was broken.

1165
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,760
So we went on this, which I was I had not seen anything about.

1166
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,320
I knew about the theater.

1167
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,520
I knew about the you go into the screen.

1168
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,800
And I was delighted by this.

1169
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,960
I was just I was shocked.

1170
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,680
I thought it was so fun.

1171
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,600
I thought it was so just neat.

1172
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,320
I like everyone really liked it.

1173
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,520
My family really liked it.

1174
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:10,440
I was singing that song to myself all week.

1175
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,320
The entire time we're there, the last day or second to last day

1176
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:19,280
where they went back on Disney Plus Day, went back to Hollywood Studios

1177
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,680
and everything at a really long wait.

1178
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:26,400
But my dad and I like stuck it out and rode this again because like I

1179
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,000
I am riding this again.

1180
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,280
I thought this was great.

1181
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,040
Yeah. I want to be like up to speed on it.

1182
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,320
And I just saw it.

1183
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,840
It's really technically impressive.

1184
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,680
And I think it's really fun.

1185
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:44,160
I think I would say more fun, like more bouncy, goofy fun than say like.

1186
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,960
I don't want to start pitting it against like Rise of the Resistance.

1187
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,360
I think it's go ahead. Go ahead.

1188
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,440
I think it's the best thing. Imagine you're like, hold on.

1189
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,720
Let me do it. Do it.

1190
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,720
It's more it's easily more fun.

1191
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,000
And at this point, less work than Rise of the Resistance.

1192
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:05,160
I think it's the best thing Disney has done since like the year

1193
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:09,720
where they had Pandora and Guardians of the Galaxy within weeks apart.

1194
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,960
Wow. Wow. Crazy.

1195
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,720
Yeah. Hard to argue that, Mike.

1196
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,000
What would you think?

1197
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,640
Yeah, it's it's great.

1198
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,840
I anything that I have as an issue with it is really minor.

1199
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,440
But it does.

1200
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,720
I don't know. It does everything you would want it to do.

1201
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,320
The technology, it's like it's pretty much

1202
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:32,000
if if if you were completely anti screen on rides,

1203
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:37,880
this would hopefully make you go, OK, well, yeah, it does not have to be

1204
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,920
what we're accustomed to. It does not.

1205
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,240
It doesn't have to be what kind of worse era universal.

1206
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,560
Why we started a screen rights. Right.

1207
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,640
And I'm sure screen resolution continues to improve.

1208
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:53,840
I feel like this is going to age much better than so much stuff like so,

1209
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:58,720
because the way it seamlessly integrated into 3D stuff

1210
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,800
in the ride and practical stuff is pretty seamless.

1211
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,120
Where I'm watching videos and I go, I can't.

1212
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,600
I think that might be painted, but I can't tell.

1213
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,840
Like, I feel like this might be just a painted wall and I can't tell. Yes.

1214
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,960
Yeah. It's such a.

1215
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,160
And the thing is, we've seen certain things like the Harry Potter paintings

1216
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,240
in the queue or whatever, where you can't quite tell.

1217
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,840
But this is on such a scale that every say you can look any direction

1218
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:27,240
in any of these massive showrooms and you're not exactly sure

1219
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:28,600
what you're looking at.

1220
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,560
Like, is every wall projected is only part of it projected?

1221
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:35,440
And the answer seems to be somewhere in between or in some rooms

1222
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,160
it is entirely projected.

1223
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:41,080
But then it still requires big physical, you know, because you want it

1224
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,360
for there to be a big physical footprint and a little bit of thrill and movement.

1225
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,640
And it completely has that, too.

1226
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,160
So you'd never call it a screenwriter.

1227
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,680
You you move a ton and there's huge set pieces.

1228
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:56,880
And and incredible like sculpture work like that tornado

1229
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,320
towards the beginning.

1230
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:01,880
And yeah, it's yeah.

1231
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:06,640
Screen ride would be a bizarre thing to call it, even if it it technically is.

1232
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,680
Yeah. At some points.

1233
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,680
But it's yeah, they're.

1234
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:11,680
Yeah, I don't know how they I mean, I guess it's a lot of projection

1235
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,320
from inside things.

1236
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,520
I guess sometimes. Yeah.

1237
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:19,480
But the first time riding it, I yeah, same thing.

1238
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:24,480
Could not tell like what is a set and what is I knew the fact

1239
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,840
I think I had heard about the fountain like there you go by a fountain at one point.

1240
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,160
And the water is like projection.

1241
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,200
The water is moving.

1242
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,880
But I think the fountain is painted.

1243
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:36,720
Yes. Yeah.

1244
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:42,160
Where there's like, yeah, like little ribbons, cute little like that are blank.

1245
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,600
But they project water splashes onto it to give it

1246
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,400
movements and yeah, visual electricity.

1247
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,240
I think maybe I'm maybe I'm getting this wrong.

1248
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,320
But then like the when you see like Donald at the carnival or something

1249
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:57,440
like Donald is animated, but the background is not.

1250
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,560
There's something back there isn't.

1251
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,600
It's like his background is is is just the painted thing.

1252
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,240
But Donald himself is animated.

1253
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,960
And maybe it's like a piece of glass or something in between or something.

1254
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,880
There's some sort of thing going on there where like completely confuses your brain.

1255
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,160
Like you cannot decipher.

1256
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:18,160
And you just saw it without any character before you get

1257
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,800
like when you arrive in the room, there's nothing.

1258
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:26,280
And then this room turns on as if like somebody's flipping switch, switch, switch, switch.

1259
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:31,960
Yeah. And so surfaces that have nothing are now bright with color and visual information.

1260
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,480
In that case, I think like and this happens a couple of times, I think,

1261
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,520
with the little bird at the end, too.

1262
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:44,040
I watched a video that explained how there's like there's the character on one screen,

1263
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:47,280
but then there's another screen in the back that is just for its shadow.

1264
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,600
And that gives it depth, which is, I guess, something they do in Rise of the Resistance, too.

1265
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:57,600
Like maybe the like the like torture room or whatever with Kylo Ren.

1266
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:01,600
Oh, yeah. That's something that makes it like gives it depth.

1267
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,400
And it doesn't just look like, you know, a screen with a character.

1268
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,680
The bird's name. The screen pushes forward.

1269
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,440
Sorry. Or no, wait, that's I forget.

1270
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,520
That's not the interrogation room.

1271
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:13,280
But that's like there's another element of when he's coming at you on Rise of the

1272
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,760
Resistance that I didn't know.

1273
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:16,600
But when he like lands, he lands and he blocks.

1274
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:17,840
The saber comes in.

1275
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,000
That's a projection of him.

1276
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,440
But I didn't realize the screen sort of thing that's that's he's being

1277
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:26,760
project on is moving forward to make him appear like he's walking and getting bigger.

1278
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:27,480
Oh, that's cool.

1279
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,400
The bird is named Chubby.

1280
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,160
Oh, the little bird.

1281
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,720
And I I remember that you can buy a plush of Chubby.

1282
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:40,200
Oh, really? In at Hollywood Studios, and I'm assuming soon Disneyland.

1283
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,280
Well, the gift shop shop Disney.

1284
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,000
The gift shop was closed.

1285
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,680
OK. When I left.

1286
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:46,560
Yeah, I don't remember.

1287
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:47,960
It was sort of renovated.

1288
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,200
I think that's where the gift shop was.

1289
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,120
But sort of when you came out, there were a lot of curtains and

1290
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,640
stuff under whatever.

1291
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,360
So I guess the gift shop is not available.

1292
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,480
So again, we'll review that when we do Toontown.

1293
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:01,520
Yeah, I was trying to find I wish there was like some blog or something

1294
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,720
where like they would literally break down each room of some of these newer rides.

1295
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:09,600
Because so many of the older things have obviously books and stuff written about them.

1296
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,360
But there's a channel called How It Works.

1297
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,880
I don't know if that's the channel, but the videos are called that.

1298
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,520
And which which broke down some of the stuff right.

1299
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,400
And does for newer rides.

1300
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:22,000
And even but even there, then they'll admit they're guessing.

1301
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,480
Yes, because they're trying to keep some of the and this ride has some great effects

1302
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:29,200
where you are not sure exactly what's going on and you have to stop

1303
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,520
and think about it for a minute.

1304
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:34,760
I guess with that in mind, let's start breaking down stuff in it.

1305
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:39,840
That's cool. And one thing like, OK, so Jason did in Florida.

1306
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,000
Mike, you did it in Disneyland.

1307
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,600
Yes, I've been able to do both.

1308
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:53,280
Yeah. And I if you're comparing them, I think the the only thing

1309
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,400
you don't want to be the Florida one is great.

1310
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,000
It's a great experience. Yeah.

1311
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,240
And you got to give it to I think that neon sign outside.

1312
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,040
Oh, yeah. Really nice.

1313
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:05,560
And just the fact that the Chinese theater exterior

1314
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:08,720
and interior from the great movie writer are still intact.

1315
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,840
It is really like a lovely and ornate and classic Hollywood in there.

1316
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:18,520
However, you do this toon town one and oh my God, it's so much fun.

1317
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:20,840
And it just makes so much more sense. Yes.

1318
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:25,360
And it's not just like pure Chinese theater until one turn.

1319
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,640
And finally, it gets cartoony.

1320
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:30,880
It is cartoony from the get go from the outside.

1321
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:34,280
It's so fun. I really love the Disneyland version.

1322
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:37,120
Compared to the grass, the El Capitoon,

1323
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,800
the theater in Toon Town looks terrific.

1324
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:45,080
Yeah. And also looks I mean, I know they always do often do this,

1325
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,400
but it feels like it's been there forever.

1326
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:52,280
It makes sense in which is nice because I wanted to down to still feel early.

1327
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,320
Yes, right. That's what it is to me.

1328
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,320
And it kind of does.

1329
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:58,080
And there's a lot of as well mentioned, there's a lot of early 90s

1330
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,960
tribute going on here. Yeah.

1331
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:06,000
The interior, like you said, Catholic, the Chinese theater, if you go to

1332
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:11,200
the actual Chinese theater, the TCL, is that the current name?

1333
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,320
If you go there, you will get stabbed.

1334
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:17,920
I eventually I a lot of.

1335
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,120
Yeah, it's very similar inside.

1336
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,800
It's really kind of a very tiny lobby.

1337
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,960
They've converted the theater itself to like stadium seating, IMAX,

1338
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:30,360
but a similar vibe to the, you know,

1339
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:33,120
Disney replica of the Chinese theater.

1340
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,760
And I like that.

1341
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:40,280
I will say the overflow queue is just on the kind of brutal cement

1342
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:44,280
outside of the theater, like and it hell hit it.

1343
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,800
It's not comfortable to stand on.

1344
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:50,080
And the elements are not forgiving.

1345
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:51,320
Should be on some AstroTurf.

1346
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,280
AstroTurf would be a godsend.

1347
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,280
Right.

1348
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,600
A notorious concrete jungle.

1349
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,680
Yeah. A notorious cement jungle.

1350
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,080
Yeah, I did it in July.

1351
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:08,040
July in 90 degree, I found that I had a screenshot of the temperature

1352
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:11,960
because I was clearly like I was needing to vent to people what line I was at,

1353
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,760
what line I imposed on myself that I'm doing so low.

1354
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,840
But like 90 degree and intense humidity.

1355
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:22,200
And it's most of an 80 minute line is just in that Chinese theater courtyard.

1356
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:23,800
Just back and forth, back and forth.

1357
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:27,920
And at that point in time, I am so sure I am getting the Delta variant

1358
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,000
right then and there, which I did not.

1359
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,840
But I like I was really stressed the entire time.

1360
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,440
Or so who knows?

1361
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,320
I don't know where they send the overflow in this

1362
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:47,080
Disneyland one because it's virtual queue, which worked pretty well.

1363
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:51,960
If you don't sleep through it, you have to do the 1 p.m.

1364
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,760
one. You did get the get the 1 p.m.

1365
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,000
one. Yeah, that's a good set.

1366
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,400
The fact that you that you can that they aren't just all.

1367
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:00,400
Yes. That early in the morning, I got on it

1368
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:04,120
and pretty early I was on by nine thirty or so.

1369
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:06,520
And it's yeah, I don't know.

1370
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,480
Pretty efficient.

1371
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:10,280
It's not as bad as the resistance was for so long.

1372
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,800
No. Yeah.

1373
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,120
You can pay $15 and do it.

1374
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:14,640
That's true. Yeah.

1375
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:15,760
That's haunting you with that.

1376
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,320
Like, you know, you can pay right now, buddy.

1377
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:20,040
Oh, as long as this. Yeah.

1378
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:25,120
But you get into the El Capetoon Theater, a play on the El Capitan Theater,

1379
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,800
another Hollywood Boulevard theater, the one that Disney owns.

1380
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:32,680
And very quickly, it's all of these great movie posters

1381
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:39,360
that are all it's all cartoonified versions of live action Disney films.

1382
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:43,160
Yeah. And a newsies you get a I should have written down the puns.

1383
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:44,720
There's a newsies as a honey.

1384
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,080
I shrunk the kids.

1385
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,680
There's a mighty ducks.

1386
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,520
There's an absent minded professor.

1387
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,520
They'll throw out the pun ones.

1388
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,800
There's a ton. There's a ton of them, too.

1389
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:54,440
Which is fine.

1390
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:57,400
I have photos of a few, although now I don't remember what.

1391
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,720
Toon's ease to and see.

1392
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,440
That's cute.

1393
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:06,440
Honey, I shrunk the nieces that and that's many many and her nieces.

1394
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:06,920
Yeah.

1395
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,360
Uh, let's see.

1396
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:13,040
What does the goofy Friday like Freaky Friday for the 70s?

1397
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:18,080
Freaky Friday where Ian Max switch absent minded Professor von Drake.

1398
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:22,920
And they're all they really like match styles perfectly, too,

1399
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,040
for the original posters.

1400
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:30,360
It is so I really appreciated that level of like, OK, it is exactly like a 60s

1401
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:31,760
pain drawn poster.

1402
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,400
And like there's a couple that I have.

1403
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,760
Jordan, if you could pull these up.

1404
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:37,360
There we go. There's the Scroogiest millionaire.

1405
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,720
I mean, that's so great.

1406
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,480
And that's a delicate thing to like draw cartoon characters,

1407
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:45,960
but convey a different art style when like when it's all drawn.

1408
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:47,400
Like you got to get that exactly right.

1409
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,200
And fonts are perfect.

1410
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,600
So 1969.

1411
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,720
And actually, there's another one.

1412
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:54,120
There's this other this parent trap one.

1413
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,480
You still have the Journey video game.

1414
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:58,400
Hey, yeah.

1415
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,800
Well, now we know we can be mad at that.

1416
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:01,200
Whatever we want.

1417
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:06,280
This this year, the Chipmunk Trap, which is clearly the Lindsay Lohan

1418
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:11,560
parent trap, which has I always forget this is a Nancy Meyers movie.

1419
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:14,760
Oh, right. And thus it has a very Nancy Meyers poster.

1420
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:19,200
And I just appreciate that, like, wow, they can do 1969,

1421
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:23,880
like closer to Walt era posters and then get kind of the subtlety

1422
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:27,240
of more recent Nancy Meyers posters so well.

1423
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,440
It's really it's all ends of the spectrum.

1424
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,960
That other one in the middle that you had, Jordan,

1425
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:37,200
this is a hocus pocus parody called Meeska Mooska.

1426
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,760
And and it's fun in general.

1427
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,480
But I have to I'm just going to I don't have to admit this to the audience,

1428
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:47,320
but I feel like I I should be forthcoming.

1429
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:48,560
I passed by this.

1430
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:49,800
I thought it was fun.

1431
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,400
And then I couldn't believe this came out of my mouth,

1432
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:52,600
especially given her reaction.

1433
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:57,240
But what I said to Erin was, I I think the Sarah Jessica Parker

1434
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:00,600
Daisy is kind of hot. Wow.

1435
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:05,520
Is there we going to zoom in on my Sarah Jessica Parker of computer enhanced.

1436
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:13,600
Wow. I that is the most that by the way, that is the most sexual thing

1437
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,520
that's ever been said on the show in like an aggressive way.

1438
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,600
It was you found that aggressive.

1439
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,360
Let's be Jason, would you also vote that that is aggressive?

1440
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,360
For this podcast?

1441
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:26,560
I look I can see both sides of the aisle.

1442
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,360
I can see both sides.

1443
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:31,480
I understand where Mike's coming from, but I thought you said

1444
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:33,880
it pretty thoughtfully and consider.

1445
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,680
That's right. I sure did.

1446
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:36,520
It's a compliment.

1447
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:39,520
It's a compliment to Sarah Jessica Parkerified Daisy.

1448
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,280
Yeah, you're talking about this specific version of Daisy.

1449
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,960
I couldn't believe that. Yeah, I don't know.

1450
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,560
I haven't been attracted to Daisy.

1451
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,400
I've been attracted to Daisy before.

1452
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:48,280
Hair looks great.

1453
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:49,400
Something about it.

1454
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,160
It's the hair.

1455
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:51,960
You know what? I think it is.

1456
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:52,840
Eyelashes are great.

1457
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:53,920
You know, it's great.

1458
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,160
You know what I think it is? It's the attitude.

1459
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,960
Yeah, which is really what's attractive about people often.

1460
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,040
And the attitude, she's got a cool attitude going.

1461
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:02,840
You know what else is weird, though?

1462
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:07,160
I didn't specifically have a crush on that on Sarah Jessica Parker.

1463
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,960
I don't remember the name of that sister,

1464
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,880
but it's not like I'm bringing that into the picture.

1465
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,880
It required I didn't like Daisy and I didn't like Sarah Jessica Parker.

1466
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,480
But you put them together and I'm in love.

1467
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,080
Wow. Interesting.

1468
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:20,960
And my wife was like, ick.

1469
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,080
Yeah. Which what else is she supposed to say?

1470
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1471
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,640
It's also rare that I will say that, that I will I will vocalize an attraction

1472
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:33,400
even to like a celebrity and that I what I chose to do it for was Daisy.

1473
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,840
I don't know. I kind of like their Kathleen and Jimmy

1474
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:39,880
Claribel up there.

1475
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:43,520
Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, let's say all three of them have their virtues.

1476
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,600
Well, you know me, I like the Midler Mini.

1477
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:49,880
Oh, well, well, there's a way there's three of them and three of us.

1478
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:52,720
And that's a go round.

1479
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:55,040
It's not cheating if they're cartoons.

1480
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,000
That's what I say. Not cheating.

1481
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,320
If it's impossible, it becomes cheating if we were to like,

1482
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:04,200
you know, hit up people who make the action figures that you like and say,

1483
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:07,360
could you do like some really realistic?

1484
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,440
Here's this poster.

1485
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:11,520
Could you just like physicalize these and make them as tall as us?

1486
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,280
Which would that? OK, well, that's it.

1487
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:16,920
Yeah, that is way different.

1488
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,360
As long as we're not.

1489
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:21,360
But what if we would if you went to some sort of an inventor and said

1490
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,840
it make us an invention and we can go inside the cartoon?

1491
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,640
And that's problematic.

1492
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,600
Um, hmm. Yeah.

1493
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,880
Do Hall pass would Hall passes be OK

1494
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:35,160
in a world where you have a cartoonifying machine?

1495
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:40,160
Because that also here's the issue, though, Mike, is that you can get the invention

1496
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:41,720
that cartoonifies you.

1497
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,600
Yeah, let's assume that's possible. Right.

1498
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,960
Does it make every cartoon that's ever existed real?

1499
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,920
Well, that's up to the inventor to do it.

1500
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,560
That's a lot of work. That's a lot of work.

1501
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,560
That is God. That is creating a universe.

1502
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,000
Well, thanks. Wait.

1503
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,640
Oh, that's good. There's my.

1504
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:57,840
Well, hold on.

1505
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,400
I need some clarification from you, Scott.

1506
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:06,200
They have had walk around versions of these at some of the Halloween parties.

1507
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,560
Have they? Of not of Daisy.

1508
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,160
Yeah. What? All three of them.

1509
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,800
These characters exist as a character in three dimensions.

1510
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:15,680
Oh, my gosh.

1511
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:17,160
Yeah. What did you search to find this?

1512
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,320
Mickey's not so scary.

1513
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:19,760
Hocus pocus is that what it is?

1514
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,560
Focus mini because the act is the Sanderson sisters.

1515
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,720
The real ones are also at the high.

1516
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:26,560
I bet suit.

1517
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,360
I bet suit real life.

1518
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,880
Daisy doesn't have the same attitude as this poster, though.

1519
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,080
Yeah, I'm looking at photos.

1520
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:34,680
I know I don't have the same.

1521
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:35,440
I don't have the same.

1522
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,640
Lost. Yeah.

1523
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,040
No. But if I.

1524
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,920
Now, if there was an opportunity for me to hug that character,

1525
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:42,960
I think this would be very upsetting to you, Mike.

1526
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,920
I think that is a cross of the line.

1527
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,600
You talk about aggression.

1528
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,880
I know you wouldn't be OK with me hugging that character.

1529
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,240
I wouldn't be OK. Yeah, I would.

1530
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,640
Just don't show it to me. I'm fine.

1531
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:56,400
Maybe you do behind closed doors, by which I mean at a theme park

1532
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,920
with someone taking a picture of it.

1533
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,200
Yeah. Yeah. All that would that would be different. Yeah.

1534
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:03,320
You don't know how to describe it, but you know it when you see it.

1535
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,400
Yeah. Huh. I didn't know.

1536
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,560
I'll say this. I wasn't.

1537
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,520
I don't think I immediately was attracted to any of the posters

1538
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,840
in line in that way.

1539
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,080
Are there others?

1540
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,760
I'm trying to think like candidates.

1541
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,720
Well, everybody likes that girl from from movie movie movie.

1542
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:19,440
And again, we were all the same.

1543
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,040
But we were all the same age at the time.

1544
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:21,800
Yeah, you have to go back.

1545
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,080
We saw the movie for the first time.

1546
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:25,600
So I don't think that that's younger even.

1547
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:26,920
But it was aspirational.

1548
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,000
Yes, that's true.

1549
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,480
Eleven in another one of Mike's science fiction stories

1550
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:34,760
where scientists are inventing cartoon race for him.

1551
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:36,480
Not for beef.

1552
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:41,320
Roxanne Roxanne is a high powered big city lawyer.

1553
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:44,920
And you're saying I've worked out a scenario where she's now an adult

1554
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:49,600
and I'm an adult and the inventor with the cartoon Ray shoots me.

1555
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:54,400
And then I meet her in some sort of meet cute cartoon world in Toontown.

1556
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:58,160
I'm imagining the cartoon race series as a multi volume

1557
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,560
like sort of thing like you remember.

1558
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,640
I'm sure you had this at your high school, the kid who was like writing

1559
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:08,240
like his own science fiction stuff, his own like and would start

1560
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,520
numbering his volume.

1561
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:12,000
He's like, OK, well, the next book in the series.

1562
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,560
It's like you are 11.

1563
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,960
Please slow it down.

1564
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,680
Well, the ambitious, it's good.

1565
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:21,560
The listener wants to write this series of perverse

1566
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:24,000
cartoon podcast, the ride.

1567
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,040
And Jordan's given us another option.

1568
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:29,000
It's Scrooge McDuck's wife or mom.

1569
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,840
Oh, yeah. What character is that?

1570
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,600
I might know the name of this character because there's a if

1571
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:37,720
if this is correct, because there is separately in Runaway Railway.

1572
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:41,800
There's like a trivia wall about like the history of the El Capitune.

1573
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:45,880
And I saw a sign and I didn't know what this was referring to.

1574
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:50,240
The very first ticket sold at the El Capitune was purchased by Casey

1575
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:53,000
Coot's sister, Elvira Coot.

1576
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:54,800
And I'm like, who's Elvira Coot?

1577
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:58,520
And Elvira Coot is apparently Donald Duck's grandmother,

1578
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:02,160
who does appear on Duck Tales, maybe in flashbacks or maybe still alive.

1579
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:07,000
I don't know. But I looked kind of like this may be Elvira Coot that we're looking.

1580
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:10,840
But isn't Uncle Scrooge's his uncle only one generation up?

1581
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,760
His grandmother would be another generation up.

1582
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,760
Yes, that might be what we're looking at.

1583
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,920
But they, you know, they coexisted there around.

1584
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,320
Is that Magica Dispel with the red hat?

1585
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,760
That's clearly Magica Dispel.

1586
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,720
I think that's Magica Dispel.

1587
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,840
And who's under that? Let's keep going.

1588
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:27,640
That's Daisy.

1589
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:30,680
Is there a lot of eligible duck bench?

1590
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:32,040
Loretta's poster.

1591
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:36,760
Daisy looks very jaunty in that, as does what's what's his face.

1592
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:39,960
Launchpad. Yeah, launchpad also looks very fine.

1593
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:41,880
He's holding hands with a crocodile.

1594
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:43,280
Everyone's having a nice time.

1595
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:46,160
Even the crocodile looks like a new hall pass.

1596
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:47,440
Mr. Crocodile here.

1597
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,760
Look at the suits that Donald and Scrooge have on.

1598
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:53,200
Those are like sharp, sharp kind of retro suits.

1599
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,520
Everyone looks great.

1600
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,760
Everyone is in their best mode.

1601
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,880
Yeah. What's Magica Dispel is the character.

1602
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:02,280
It's a great hat on Magica Dispel.

1603
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:03,840
Yeah, the Carmen Sandiego style.

1604
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,160
Very Carmen Sandiego.

1605
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,320
She's got a little cup of tea there.

1606
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:11,120
And she's yeah, she's also she's the witch, basically, on the DuckTales.

1607
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,680
You remember her, Scott. She's on DuckTales.

1608
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:15,280
Yeah, I watched it, but I don't remember.

1609
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:16,280
Almost any other.

1610
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:18,560
Well, she's not to be trifled with, I'll tell you that.

1611
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,200
Where's Gizmo Duck?

1612
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,960
Anywhere here? I don't think he is.

1613
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:27,200
I swear to God, if my if my kid is doing a podcast in 30 years

1614
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:30,840
about the crap he's watching about Leo the truck.

1615
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:34,880
You're Leo and you built the car that was so

1616
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:36,960
wheels, motors and wood.

1617
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,960
And don't you dare.

1618
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,280
Don't you dare, son of mine.

1619
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:42,480
You know, that Paw Patrol character is kind of good looking.

1620
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,120
Oh, no, this is going to be me.

1621
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,320
What's the what's the movie where George C.

1622
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:49,840
Scott is yelling while he watches his daughter?

1623
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,480
Like, oh, hardcore.

1624
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,760
I think like, no, turn it off.

1625
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:55,800
I haven't seen it.

1626
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:59,080
I believe he's watching his daughter have sex or she's in a she's in a.

1627
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:03,680
You're saying watching your kid do a podcast about hearing my son

1628
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:06,400
do this podcast, but about the things about

1629
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:09,680
Gecko's Garage and the shows he's watching.

1630
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:10,480
That's fair.

1631
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:14,120
Episode by episode through the filmography of Mr. Beast.

1632
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,480
No, no, shut it off.

1633
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:23,240
We sent a young child to college to not to.

1634
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:27,040
We paid him not to do a podcast and he used that money to pay for his

1635
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,160
college and grad school.

1636
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,080
Here's the deal.

1637
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:34,560
This is this money is entirely dependent on you not doing a podcast.

1638
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,400
I'm going to play you an example of my podcast.

1639
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:42,200
Just say, so, yeah, then, yeah, I'm with my son and I say, isn't Daisy hot?

1640
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,360
Well, see, is this what you want to be?

1641
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,920
I don't want you to be me, son.

1642
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:51,280
Son, you were raised with dirty money, money that was made from mining.

1643
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,680
Mastalgia.

1644
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:57,520
Saying outrageous things about childhood cartoon characters.

1645
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,920
I yelled about grass for 50 minutes.

1646
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:02,120
I'll grab you put milk in your mouth.

1647
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:03,920
This money is.

1648
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:07,200
I wasn't mining for unobtainium.

1649
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:09,440
That's only an avatar, son.

1650
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,560
Disgusting money.

1651
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:15,440
So go to church every week to absolve me of the sins.

1652
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:20,960
Anyway, you know what else is in the line is that Fred are femurs arm.

1653
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,200
He's number three in the skeleton dance.

1654
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:26,640
And I thought that was fun that they named the skeletons in the skeleton dance.

1655
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,160
I will. Maybe this is a little bit ahead, too, because they have some fun

1656
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:36,160
like little stuff for the kids to twirl like the propeller on a plane from plane crazy.

1657
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:40,520
Yeah, yes. Oh, and the ships with you got a steamboat willy wheel.

1658
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:44,760
I was telling you guys he was like on the this was a long line for he is like his dad

1659
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:47,120
in a good way that he has no tolerance for lines.

1660
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:53,440
So we were like rounding a bend and like, well, we need a diversion real quick.

1661
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:56,720
He we got a wheel. He loves to spin a big wheel.

1662
01:18:56,840 --> 01:19:00,160
It's a great line in terms of like I was tough to do.

1663
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:04,280
I wish I had longer a longer time in that line because there's so much stuff.

1664
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,640
Look, I see. I see your point.

1665
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,840
I in terms of like, is this a very good cue?

1666
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,240
Absolutely. It is. Am I glad I saw it? Yes.

1667
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,760
Is still any cue technically skippable?

1668
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:19,960
Also, yes. Can I say the thing that gave me

1669
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:23,040
I was very tired by the time I went on.

1670
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:26,280
So my emotions maybe were a little bit more free flowing.

1671
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:30,960
But I saw something that made me feel like feel it gave me all the feels.

1672
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,960
Well, it was the dresser from the Lonesome Ghosts.

1673
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,480
Wow. Did you remember that?

1674
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:39,720
Now, wait. Well, here explain it.

1675
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:41,640
Yeah. So in Lonesome Ghosts, I've talked about this.

1676
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:42,880
It's the episode.

1677
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:47,080
It's the cartoon where Donald Goofy and Mickey Go ghost busting essentially.

1678
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,720
Yeah. And as a kid, I'd watch it all the time on Halloween multiple times.

1679
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,760
It was always my favorite Mickey short.

1680
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:55,200
Goofy gets hurt badly in it.

1681
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:58,040
And I didn't like that part, but it's very memorable.

1682
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:01,280
It's burned in my brain of Goofy, like hurting himself.

1683
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:04,920
Goofy gets stuck in this dresser while the ghosts are messing with him.

1684
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:08,520
So it's I love it is really what I'm saying.

1685
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:12,560
And I turned a corner and I saw the dresser.

1686
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:17,280
The dresser was yes, Lonesome Ghosts.

1687
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,440
And I went, I think I made a noise alone.

1688
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,560
I'm not I wasn't trying to be performative or anything.

1689
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,440
No one was there. I made like my noise of like,

1690
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,720
and I was like, it's a dresser from Lonesome Ghosts.

1691
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,120
And I got so excited.

1692
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,720
Well, I forgot it has a big mirror on top, too.

1693
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:35,640
Yes. And I was showing that to my boy just to like, hey, there's us.

1694
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,840
It was just just to show him himself in the mirror.

1695
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,840
And then what should appear in the mirror?

1696
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,760
But one of the Lonesome Ghosts. Yes.

1697
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:45,320
And it worked. He went, oh, like much like you did.

1698
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,080
But it didn't scare him.

1699
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:50,400
It did, because I'm concerned about that this entire time.

1700
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,240
It's a little bit of a long line for him.

1701
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:56,040
I'm worried about losing him because this is a big wide.

1702
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,520
Mom and dad really want to do it.

1703
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,800
And it's an all ages ride.

1704
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,360
So I want it to be fun for him so that he got a little scare

1705
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:05,040
and he jumped, but not a scare that made him cry.

1706
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,200
That's great. Love that.

1707
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,360
I was happy to see the ghost.

1708
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,200
I almost forgot about this. Yeah.

1709
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:14,320
So, yeah, that was the that there was other parts of the line I love.

1710
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:18,240
But that one, I was like, wow, the real thing from the real cartoon.

1711
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:21,760
Yeah. It's got Mickey's hat on it, too, which is fun,

1712
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,120
because Mickey's wearing a real funny, big, like hunting hat.

1713
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:26,600
It's like a Sherlock Holmes kind of hat.

1714
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,440
Yes, you're right. It is like Sherlock Holmes.

1715
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:33,080
I a few things about the dresser from Lonesome Ghosts.

1716
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:37,840
If you see, son, do you want to say that phrase in your life?

1717
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:41,280
Sorry. One thing about the dresser, one thing just about my memories

1718
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:46,360
of Lonesome Ghosts, but Disney did like a walkthrough video,

1719
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:50,400
like a good, very good video quality walkthrough of this cue.

1720
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:54,120
Yes. And they had imagineers commenting on things like, oh, this and that.

1721
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:57,760
And the one guy like hosting it was like, and this is the dresser

1722
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,040
from the Lonesome Ghosts.

1723
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,000
And we're really pushing to get this in here.

1724
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:03,760
My memory of Lonesome Ghosts is that

1725
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:07,680
they all went into the house with weapons.

1726
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,440
Yeah, like a big musket. Yeah.

1727
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,320
Shotguns. Yeah.

1728
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:13,320
One of the yeah. What are the I just remember one of them had a net.

1729
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,000
One of them just had a gun.

1730
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,760
Yeah. I think Mickey has the shotgun, but I could be wrong.

1731
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,800
Does one of them have a spear or a trident?

1732
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:21,560
I forget what I feel like.

1733
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:23,840
Goofy has maybe I'm going to people.

1734
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,080
You're not a Lonesome Ghosts fan.

1735
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,720
I feel goofy as the net.

1736
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:28,880
Mickey has the shotgun gatekeeping.

1737
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:33,120
And then actually, that was a pretty that was pretty lazy memory

1738
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,200
about Lonesome Ghosts 1937.

1739
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:39,520
I like that one extra because I really like the real Ghostbusters cartoon.

1740
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,920
And the other Ghostbusters cartoon.

1741
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,040
I did, too. Yeah. Yeah. With Tracy the Gorilla.

1742
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:47,120
Yes. And every now and then the original Ghostbusters.

1743
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:49,840
It was because there was a live action one.

1744
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,760
Yeah. And every now and then I'd find either.

1745
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:58,000
I think there was maybe one video game arcade of the original Ghostbusters.

1746
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:02,560
And at garage sales or thrift shops or something, I'd come across a toy

1747
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,520
and you could never find those toys.

1748
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:08,840
Yeah. Compared to like the real Ghostbusters toys,

1749
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:12,000
which you walk one block and you could find them.

1750
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,480
Yeah, there's the Lonesome Ghosts toys.

1751
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:18,400
I need those to be made tomorrow.

1752
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:24,680
The one that I gasped that I was shocked how excited I was.

1753
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,520
And maybe I never vocalized how much I loved that.

1754
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:28,440
I just I just looked it up.

1755
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:31,480
The shortest Pluto's Christmas tree from 1952.

1756
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:36,240
Yeah. And there's a little lineup of when I just thought it was so clever

1757
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:40,640
when I was a kid that Chip and Dale are running from Pluto and they dress up.

1758
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:45,240
They put on a little Santa hat and a beard and disguise themselves as candles.

1759
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:47,320
But then they get lit on fire on the deck.

1760
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,680
But the little prot, like the other ornaments

1761
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:53,360
that have already been pilfered by Chip and Dale, that was a gap.

1762
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:56,160
And I did have to keep walking right past it.

1763
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:59,320
Maybe have we finally found a scenario where.

1764
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,680
Yeah, maybe. I don't wish I had more time in the queue because the

1765
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,280
the kid was going to freak out. Well, that's a different story.

1766
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:09,160
I'm not so crazy that I'm going to like make a two year old

1767
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,480
stay in a long line.

1768
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:15,560
So you say, I will say, you're going to come to shove in a year or so.

1769
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:18,360
And ghosts say a prayer while we're sitting here.

1770
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,600
People are mad. People are angry at us.

1771
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,960
I think they want us to keep moving.

1772
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,720
Well, they can stay angry for all I care.

1773
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:27,880
She's going to cry. OK.

1774
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:31,320
She's going to cry as long as it takes her to stop crying so she can appreciate this.

1775
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:34,200
These are important ghosts.

1776
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:37,560
Um, I think undeniably, a very fun

1777
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:41,000
point of this queue is Mickey Mouse Disco, of course.

1778
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,360
Oh, which is kind of a broader retro room, because there's also a mouser size

1779
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,560
right next to it on a disco floor.

1780
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:50,120
Yes. It's a great, great. Yeah.

1781
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:52,720
Yeah. Really fun.

1782
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:55,440
This is the type of like

1783
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,160
I haven't been on the Guardians of the Galaxy, right?

1784
01:24:57,160 --> 01:25:00,480
But this is the type of thing when they were saying, oh, the history of Epcot

1785
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:01,600
or something. Yeah.

1786
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:05,760
Where it's like a little wink winking thing to the history of something in Disney

1787
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:09,480
that's done in a way that even if you don't know any of it, it's fun and like

1788
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:12,480
there's none of that, I think, in that guardians queue for as far as like history.

1789
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,560
We've got but this is like this is great.

1790
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:18,680
And even just the detail that it was organized as a tribute by Minnie

1791
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:22,920
and the Toontown Hysterical Society, not historical society.

1792
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:25,360
That's really cute.

1793
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:29,120
I think the other thing I like about it just is turn.

1794
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:34,000
It's it's nice to see the company embracing its actual history

1795
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,880
that it has created and not just bought, you know, because Marvel and Star Wars

1796
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:41,400
get all the play nowadays.

1797
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:46,440
But it's just like these Mickey Mouse shorts are pretty undeniable, you know,

1798
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:51,080
and lots of people have fond memories of the live action films, you know,

1799
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:54,680
and they've they've whittled it down, I think, to the live action films

1800
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:57,160
that people like, you know.

1801
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,240
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

1802
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:03,480
There was a representation of the Patrick Swayze tall tale from 1994.

1803
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:07,920
It's not all of them, but maybe people like tall tale.

1804
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:12,160
I don't know. Well, and on that point, like they know that they got to play up

1805
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:16,720
that goofy. They know like, you know, goofy movie has such a cult at this point.

1806
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,840
And then you get you get power limes.

1807
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:22,200
You're in a little it's it's the concessions for the movie theater.

1808
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,360
The concessions are so good.

1809
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:26,200
Yeah, they make fake and set.

1810
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:31,040
They made fake candy, which, you know, me, you know, Jason, candy guys,

1811
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,840
candy boys, as you might say.

1812
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:37,280
And they found the next podcast candy boys.

1813
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:38,800
Oh, my God.

1814
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,880
Is that different candy every episode?

1815
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,560
That's right. It's not like doughboys.

1816
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,080
It's like it's candy.

1817
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,000
Can you be pretty narrow?

1818
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,200
It's a narrow.

1819
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,240
I know everybody. A lot of people like candy, though.

1820
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:51,440
What a lot of people like.

1821
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:52,560
You're saying narrow focus.

1822
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,720
Oh, no. Our subject matter.

1823
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,000
Yeah. Narrow is good.

1824
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,280
Specific is good.

1825
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,840
But lots of people like it.

1826
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:02,640
So big potential audience, big potential audience topics.

1827
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:03,600
Oh, boy.

1828
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,840
But they made fake candy, which looks so fun.

1829
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:09,640
And they really should think about making it for real.

1830
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:11,000
They're not going to.

1831
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,800
But I assume. But yes, power limes.

1832
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,440
There's a dark winged duck candy.

1833
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,440
Oh, I didn't see that called.

1834
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:19,520
I have a picture of it somewhere.

1835
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,440
It's like basically like Reese's like Reese's cups.

1836
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:25,040
It's called like Mallard cups or something.

1837
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,320
And it's got the dark winged duck colors.

1838
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,800
The popcorn is all Mickey shaped.

1839
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:32,320
Do you see that?

1840
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:35,440
I was moving fast. The big popcorn.

1841
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:39,360
The big popcorn popper is popping things and it's a kind of it's it's got the sound

1842
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,400
playing. It's not actually popping fresh popcorn.

1843
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:44,800
There's a little like video kind of projection playing to make it look like it is.

1844
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:48,520
But if you look, the whole thing is filled with Mickey popcorn.

1845
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:53,520
And when I say Mickey, you look closely and each kernel has a little snout

1846
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,240
and ears. Wow.

1847
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:58,120
Like the detail is so small and you easily would miss that.

1848
01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:59,840
I did miss it. Yeah, I didn't catch that.

1849
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,440
But there's I mean, I'm sure there's a bunch of stuff like that that I don't know.

1850
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,760
But the concession area is so fun.

1851
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:09,760
The where you get your condiments, condiments.

1852
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,480
Oh, yeah. Thank you. Mallard cups.

1853
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,200
Yeah, there it is.

1854
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:16,240
Somebody I want Mallard cups.

1855
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:21,360
I want to put a purple peanut butter cup in my mouth stat.

1856
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,480
Now, that's the most aggressive thing I've heard on the punch.

1857
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:26,960
Well, that's right. It is.

1858
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,400
So that's my law.

1859
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:31,640
I'm lusting to eat a purple peanut butter cup.

1860
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:35,360
Mike's tan. Mike's taking us down a change and involves mouth business.

1861
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,880
That's right. And I'm not ashamed of this.

1862
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:41,000
I want dark winged duck candy and I want it now.

1863
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:44,640
Eat it out. They have.

1864
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,960
All right, Scott, let's not push it.

1865
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:48,560
Let's not push it.

1866
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:51,320
I knew that would that would throw everyone.

1867
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:56,240
Now, what is the parody movie poster of the Tim Allen, Craig Kilburn Shaggy Dog?

1868
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:58,560
Is Craig Kilburn in that film?

1869
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,480
Craig Kilburn is the supporting

1870
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:04,920
like, I think Lee supporting actor.

1871
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:06,760
I know Robert Downey Jr.

1872
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:10,040
is in that one. It is not on Disney Plus.

1873
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:12,360
I know. OK, I think I tried to find this.

1874
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:16,120
Wow. Craig, I don't know that that's been parodied.

1875
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:21,920
For another for the kids, the condiment stations,

1876
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:26,360
which is fun. Did you get did you let your son do any of that?

1877
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,720
You know, yeah, briefly.

1878
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:29,640
But the line was moving. Yeah, right.

1879
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:31,320
There it does. A second. I wanted to be there.

1880
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:33,720
Well, there's some fun like ketchup mustard.

1881
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,800
It doesn't actually spit this stuff out.

1882
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:38,920
But then one of them is haggis.

1883
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:41,160
Oh, really? And then one of them, I forget, there's another one

1884
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:45,160
that's like molten and it's like kind of burning the the countertop.

1885
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:47,640
I'm sorry. I'm a little distracted

1886
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:51,360
because I just found a review of the Shaggy Dog 2006. Go ahead.

1887
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:56,440
You know, I must admit, when I first saw this movie, when it came out,

1888
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:57,960
it was incredible.

1889
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:00,200
And that and know that I'm all grown up.

1890
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:02,040
It's even more terrific.

1891
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:05,920
It's nice to have to see the Santa Claus and the voice of Buzz Lightyear

1892
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:10,120
get turned into a dog so he can understand the value of being with his family.

1893
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:12,280
So I think this movie is perfect.

1894
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:16,200
So teaching us all the importance of family. Wow.

1895
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:21,640
Wow. That's a pretty thoughtful review of someone who just let people enjoy things.

1896
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:23,720
And you can't complain about that.

1897
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:25,880
You know, wow.

1898
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:27,240
It's beautiful. Yeah.

1899
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:32,040
Maybe a childless nerds don't understand the beauty of a simple Santa Claus

1900
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:35,000
turning into a dog to understand being with family.

1901
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,360
Their lives are misery.

1902
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:38,840
They stand in front of the firing squad,

1903
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:41,480
enjoying their last cigarette before the end comes.

1904
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:49,000
So there's I just I can identify like this condiment station as a kid.

1905
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,680
I would have been like, this is my I remember this.

1906
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:53,720
I'll talk about this on a podcast in 30 years.

1907
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:54,840
These are moments.

1908
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:57,640
This is, you know, the thing that you talk about, Mike,

1909
01:30:57,640 --> 01:31:00,120
like we're just wanting to have like big beats and moments.

1910
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:02,120
You remember the queue has them.

1911
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:06,200
Yes. We'll be talking about these parts of the queue for a child and for daddy.

1912
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:10,200
Yes. Again, we have different definitions of aggressive.

1913
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:15,000
That's just the things that sound weird to me are different than for daddy.

1914
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,200
For child and for daddy.

1915
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:17,160
For child and for daddy.

1916
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:22,680
I'm daddy. Look, I'm daddy.

1917
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:25,800
Okay. Well, you're a father, but I'm daddy.

1918
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:32,120
That we keep topping up the most aggressive thing said on this podcast.

1919
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:35,080
Let's get to this ride.

1920
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:37,320
Let's get a deep, deep in the soul.

1921
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:38,600
No, DL.

1922
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:39,480
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1923
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:40,680
Everyone in the booth is here.

1924
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:41,880
We'll try to move through this.

1925
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:46,280
But the OK, talk about these moments.

1926
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:47,240
Big, big things.

1927
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:49,160
And it's a big one in the pre show.

1928
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:53,160
Yes. The pre show is you get to you go into a room

1929
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:57,480
and you watch premiere of a new short, a Mickey short, perfect picnic.

1930
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:05,000
And then the song plays, which is the earworm song that nothing can stop us.

1931
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:10,840
Yes. And then some fun happens and chaos and Goofy shows up in a train.

1932
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:11,640
Yes.

1933
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:14,840
And then a pie gets lodged into the Goofy's smokestack.

1934
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:20,200
It's Mickey and Minnie are driving alongside Goofy in a train.

1935
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:24,600
They say a nice hello to each other, but then they hit a bump that is on the train track.

1936
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,320
Pluto goes flying.

1937
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:33,560
Pie goes flying goes right into Goofy's smokestack, starts steaming, whole thing blows up.

1938
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:38,200
And the smoke goes off of the screen into the room.

1939
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:40,920
And this is a great thing to.

1940
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:42,600
Well, we've just told you about it.

1941
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:47,160
If you if you might already know about it, if you go with anyone who doesn't know this beat

1942
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:50,360
as I got to with Erin, she had no idea this was coming.

1943
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:51,400
It's such a jaw drop.

1944
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:54,280
You're just like, wow, it's a great pre show.

1945
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:59,640
And it like not only so exciting that well.

1946
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:03,320
And then just to say the whole thing that Goofy is now.

1947
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:08,040
He's been thrown from the train and he's hanging up on part of the screen that is still

1948
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:11,240
working up above the big hole that's been blown in it.

1949
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:11,640
Yeah.

1950
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:17,480
He starts talking to the person in the room, the ride attendant, the cast member,

1951
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:21,800
says, do you mind helping these good people into the cartoon?

1952
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:26,440
Well, I fixed this here loki motive like that.

1953
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:27,160
This is great.

1954
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:32,600
I am a sucker for a person on screen or animatronic talks to cast member.

1955
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:34,680
It's a nice nod to the great movie ride.

1956
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:36,760
Also a nod in this.

1957
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:40,840
The ride kind of starts and finishes in a railroad barn.

1958
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:49,480
I've found possession of Walt Disney himself of a barn with railroad stops to railroad.

1959
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:55,560
Yeah, it's a really good train ride, which right, which really helped propel my son along

1960
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:56,440
through the whole thing.

1961
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:59,880
Just telling him like, oh, yeah, you're going to go on a bunch of trains today.

1962
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:02,360
And one of the trains is driven by Goofy.

1963
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:03,400
You could see him.

1964
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:04,280
What else do you want?

1965
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:04,840
Yeah.

1966
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:05,560
Ah, OK.

1967
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:09,320
First of all, if it was me and I was little, I'd be like, that's not a good idea.

1968
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:11,320
This is going to go poorly.

1969
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:12,040
Is he trained?

1970
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:12,680
Let's not go.

1971
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:16,120
Surely the union doesn't know about this.

1972
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:17,640
Goofy show me his license.

1973
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:20,200
Does he take regular tests to make sure he's equipped?

1974
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:24,600
One thing I've always thought about this ride, did they have to have the conversation

1975
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:26,600
of the term railway?

1976
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:28,680
They're like, we can't call this a railroad.

1977
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:32,760
We have actual railroads on property and people will be confused.

1978
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:36,600
I think this is actually an example of a title that was probably group

1979
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:39,560
think group thought to death.

1980
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:41,240
But it works.

1981
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:42,120
Yeah, I like it.

1982
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:47,000
I do like it because it's like it's not actually like Mickey and Minnie's railway.

1983
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:47,640
It is not.

1984
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:48,520
Yeah, it's not correct.

1985
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:49,640
And it's a railway.

1986
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:53,400
Why wouldn't it just be railroad or why wouldn't it be like the name of the cart?

1987
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:56,120
Like it works and I like it.

1988
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:58,840
But it is example of I think an overthink.

1989
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:02,280
OK, they need we can't just be Mickey because Mickey and Minnie are together.

1990
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:06,920
That's their ride, not just Mickey, even though the whole queue is Mickey.

1991
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:11,800
But Mickey and Minnie's runaway railway, it says what it is kind of.

1992
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:13,640
So I think I like it.

1993
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:14,600
I like the title a lot.

1994
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:19,320
I think I think it was like it was constructed for a lot of reasons that way.

1995
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:22,520
I like that everyone just has jobs.

1996
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:23,320
Everyone has weird.

1997
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:25,560
Goofy drives a locomotive.

1998
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:28,120
Pete is jackhammering.

1999
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:32,440
Daisy teaches a dance class that covers both Waltz and Rumba.

2000
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:35,480
Yeah, Mickey has a red big red convertible.

2001
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:39,480
Like we don't spend time getting to know about Mickey's big red car.

2002
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:40,840
That's true.

2003
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:42,920
We need to know more about that big red license.

2004
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:49,880
Significantly less horrific than the like nightmare car that was the parked in front

2005
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:52,680
of his house, you know, into town.

2006
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:54,520
Is that a nightmare car?

2007
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:56,600
It's just kind of like I like that car.

2008
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:00,200
I just kind of weird proportions.

2009
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:01,880
It's kind of looks a little scary.

2010
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:03,000
It's fun as a cartoon.

2011
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,760
It's not like Mr. McPhisto's car from the Batman forever video with the hands.

2012
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:07,480
Oh, no.

2013
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:09,240
Well, we're all scared of that car.

2014
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:11,240
Yeah, I like Mickey's car.

2015
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:16,120
One of these things like that the hole is blown in the screen and then Goofy and the

2016
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:21,160
cast member discuss that they will let you into the cartoon and then you walk through the screen.

2017
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:23,400
So that's a separate hole has been blown in the screen.

2018
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:23,800
Cool.

2019
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:25,160
Wait, how do I get in this ride?

2020
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:27,000
I go into the screen.

2021
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:27,880
That's great.

2022
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:31,400
And it's blown out towards you, but it's still being projected on.

2023
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:34,920
So that texture like the chaotic cutout is great.

2024
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,360
That yeah, it's awesome.

2025
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:38,200
And as a kid, I would not know.

2026
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:40,040
I'd be like amazed by it.

2027
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:41,960
Can I give a little minor gripe?

2028
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:46,840
This works better in Hollywood Studios than it does in Toontown because in the reality

2029
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:49,640
of Toontown, you've already walked into the cartoon.

2030
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:52,040
You're in the cartoon already in Toontown.

2031
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:52,280
Yeah.

2032
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:55,400
Now, now the whole thing is like, oh, my God, we're going in the cartoon.

2033
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,920
We were already in the cartoon.

2034
01:36:56,920 --> 01:36:59,560
So you don't get a different until.

2035
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:00,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2036
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:02,200
That's but again, minor gripe here.

2037
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:06,920
Well, I guess that's the turn you have to make because in this version, you entered

2038
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:09,160
the cartoon the second you enter Toontown.

2039
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:09,800
Yes.

2040
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:13,400
So you're you already they're going to another cartoon.

2041
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:14,280
I see what you're saying.

2042
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:15,320
That is interesting.

2043
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:18,440
Is the the queue in Florida?

2044
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:24,360
Is it also like posters of movies that likely would have premiered at Grauman's Chinese

2045
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:24,840
Theater?

2046
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:31,400
I don't like posters of Mickey shorts from like the time period when this was like the

2047
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:34,200
show Palace of Stars of Hollywood.

2048
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:37,080
Like, I think that's a thing I I like that.

2049
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:41,720
I do I do think it's tasteful and it's a nod to like the Golden Age of Hollywood stuff.

2050
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:43,160
Yeah, you like of course.

2051
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:44,360
Of course, I like it.

2052
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:46,680
I'm 37, but I've always been 80.

2053
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:49,320
Robert Osborne of the Robert Osborne.

2054
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:51,240
Look, he kept that right.

2055
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:55,640
Those last few years Turner Classic Movies was keeping the lights on for that ride.

2056
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:58,520
You know, we stand Robert Osborne.

2057
01:37:58,520 --> 01:37:59,400
We certainly do.

2058
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:04,120
But but yes, no, this is not a major no kids like through a fit.

2059
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:05,960
We were already in the cartoon.

2060
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:07,080
What?

2061
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:09,000
We were already there.

2062
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:09,960
Why do we go again?

2063
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:12,200
And again, doesn't make sense.

2064
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:14,920
Yeah, we of course we were there.

2065
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,800
If they in cartoon world, they would just call this movie.

2066
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:19,960
They would just call this media, you know,

2067
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,360
your children aren't logic police because they aren't on Twitter yet.

2068
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:25,080
They're not.

2069
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:25,560
Yeah, right.

2070
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:29,880
So you go through this and then you go into a very like I would say like.

2071
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:34,680
By the way, also, I don't really understand how the screen blowing upwards.

2072
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:36,360
I know that it rises up.

2073
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:38,120
Yeah, but you really got it.

2074
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:40,360
Depending on how much smoke there is, you really can't tell.

2075
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:43,880
And there's also this black barricade, like what would be under a movie screen.

2076
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:46,680
And something happens there, too, to give you passage.

2077
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:48,200
And I don't quite get what it is.

2078
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:49,880
Something shoots down.

2079
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:51,640
Maybe the black goes down.

2080
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:52,760
And it's hard to tell.

2081
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:55,560
It's one of those newer things where it's almost like the great.

2082
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:58,440
You seen a clip of the beast transforming in Japan?

2083
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:01,480
Yeah, that's I don't know what's going on there.

2084
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:02,680
Yeah, I think it's the same.

2085
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:06,040
The similar thing is on the Shanghai pirates

2086
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:10,120
that a skeleton turns into Jack Sparrow and you're watching it.

2087
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:13,160
And you're like, I know there's a projection happening, but I don't know what.

2088
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:16,280
I could not in a million years think or figure out what this is.

2089
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:21,160
But yeah, similar thing to here where I'm like, I think something's just shooting down,

2090
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:24,440
but this fog and the misdirect is working so effectively.

2091
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:28,440
And then you go into kind of a generic barn, I would say,

2092
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:30,760
like a generic kind of barn feeling place.

2093
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:33,720
But it's so like warm and gentle in there.

2094
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:35,000
I love that room.

2095
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Well, and the music is playing.

2096
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:41,880
It's that it's like the intro of the song.

2097
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:43,400
And it's just kind of on a loop.

2098
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:44,920
It's a very just pleasant melody.

2099
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:46,440
Any form you hear it in, it's great.

2100
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:49,160
Something I'm going to say about this ride.

2101
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:51,400
I don't think I've ever called this out on a ride before.

2102
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:52,920
Stanchions.

2103
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:54,040
Good.

2104
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:54,520
Oh, yeah.

2105
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:57,240
Stanchions, the line separators.

2106
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:57,560
Yeah.

2107
01:39:57,560 --> 01:40:00,680
Because in the first half of it, you've got real like art deco.

2108
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:03,160
It's little like cube pyramids.

2109
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:03,960
Look out for those.

2110
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:05,320
They're functional, but they're good.

2111
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:07,080
And then you get into cartoon world.

2112
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:08,280
They're wonderful.

2113
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:11,640
These big, like these fun, big yellow knobs.

2114
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:14,680
That have been like drawn on all crazy.

2115
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:16,440
They're wonderful pieces.

2116
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:20,120
If they started selling these, like getting rid of stray ones,

2117
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:23,400
I'd buy a Runaway Railway stanchion at an auction.

2118
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:26,280
Stanchions on the Haunted Mansion are really memorable.

2119
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:27,080
Yes, sir.

2120
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:27,960
In the line, too.

2121
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:30,600
I don't think they've had a good stanchion game.

2122
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:31,240
So yeah.

2123
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:34,760
So maybe if we start fetishizing the stanchions.

2124
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:35,320
Sounds like us.

2125
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:37,640
That will put it out into dis Twitter.

2126
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:40,440
And then in like 20 years, Disney will start selling them.

2127
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:41,080
Sure.

2128
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:43,720
Eventually, we'll get there where they monetize this.

2129
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:47,480
Oh, because they have like the bats on the stanchions at Haunted

2130
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:50,360
Mansion, I think you get as like a wine stopper.

2131
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:51,160
Oh, really?

2132
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:51,880
Or as like decorative.

2133
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:53,240
Well, they have been monetizing the stanchions.

2134
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:54,680
So some stanchions, maybe.

2135
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:55,240
But not these.

2136
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:56,040
But these are new stanchions.

2137
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:56,520
Yeah, yeah.

2138
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:57,640
We're going to get yelled at.

2139
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:59,560
They have been monetizing the stanchions.

2140
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:03,240
You call yourself theme six years in theme park podcast?

2141
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:05,240
You don't know about the monetization of the stanchions?

2142
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:10,040
If someone's saying that phrase, they aren't capable of being as aggressive as you're being.

2143
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:12,440
That voice would not match that statement.

2144
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:14,680
They don't have as much tea, you're saying?

2145
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:20,120
You haven't even talked about the Disney 100 ears, the drippy ears that look gross.

2146
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:21,320
Oh, the drippy ears.

2147
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:22,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2148
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:25,480
We don't have time to talk about it in this episode.

2149
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:26,280
Not out of time.

2150
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:34,840
Another big moment for me in this ride, and I don't know if you guys had the same thing,

2151
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:39,560
but I had not really spoiled it for myself in terms of what the ride mechanism is.

2152
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:41,240
I assumed that it was a railway.

2153
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:45,960
I'd heard that Goof, well, that's a big moment that the doors swing open and Goofy is,

2154
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:48,120
like he's talking to you from the front car.

2155
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:56,760
But then I really took it on faith at the beginning that I had no reason not to assume

2156
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:03,880
that this is a train that all moves together as one piece.

2157
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:08,920
I think I knew it was trackless, but I still thought maybe these are connected somehow.

2158
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:11,480
You could still explore wherever in the rooms.

2159
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:16,920
So it genuinely was a surprise to me that all of the cars being in a row like a train

2160
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:18,520
is made up.

2161
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:25,000
It's sold by the fact that they move and have slack similar to a train would be.

2162
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:31,880
Then Mickey crashes into a switch, Goofy goes one way, every car splits off,

2163
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:33,640
goes every other which way.

2164
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:35,640
Oh my God, this is not a train at all.

2165
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:37,080
This is a trackless vehicle.

2166
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:41,880
It's in the realm of rise of the resistance and who knows what these vehicles can do.

2167
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:43,480
It's a really exciting moment.

2168
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:44,440
Really delightful.

2169
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:48,040
There's like three things in there that I was just delighted by.

2170
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:50,760
The swinging open of the window with Goofy.

2171
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:52,600
That was really fun.

2172
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:53,880
The trackless ride thing.

2173
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:58,280
I feel like I've read reviews of rides and people go like, why is this track?

2174
01:42:58,280 --> 01:42:59,880
Why does this have to be trackless?

2175
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:02,040
It's not using the form at all.

2176
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:05,320
This very clearly pretty fun splitting apart.

2177
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:08,680
All dancing together is really fun.

2178
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:09,320
And then another.

2179
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:11,160
This anti-ride, I hate that.

2180
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:12,920
It doesn't use the form at all.

2181
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:15,400
One car goes one way, another car goes up the other way.

2182
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:16,760
You have different views.

2183
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:21,720
No, no, I think this is a good or like the Efteling is a very good use of it where the

2184
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:23,480
rides split off and go on their own.

2185
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:27,560
I saw the video that pointed out that's maybe a better like probably the ultimate

2186
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:31,880
trackless dark ride is that all the vehicles all have completely different experiences.

2187
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:32,360
Yeah.

2188
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:34,600
But it's still pretty new.

2189
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:38,920
This anti-rise thing is spreading and I'm right here.

2190
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:41,800
I meant more like in general when a ride is trackless.

2191
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:43,320
It's like, oh, does it use the full?

2192
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:44,280
Did you say rides?

2193
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:44,920
Not rides.

2194
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:45,720
I said rides.

2195
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:45,960
Sorry.

2196
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:47,320
Scott's hearing things.

2197
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:48,600
I'm just ready to pounce.

2198
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:50,040
I was going to make the point.

2199
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:51,880
I think it's the wrong system for a ride to use.

2200
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:55,160
Interesting.

2201
01:43:56,040 --> 01:44:00,600
The third thing, I think the voice acting on these shorts in general, but especially

2202
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:02,840
this ride is so great.

2203
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:05,800
This ride has legitimately funny moments.

2204
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:07,160
Yeah, absolutely.

2205
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:12,040
When Mickey hits the railway switch, he's like screaming.

2206
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:15,480
He's a real neurotic every man in these kinds of shorts.

2207
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:21,080
And then at the very end, there's a moment where Minnie is just screaming at full volume.

2208
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:22,840
And I was just like, this is fun.

2209
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:24,120
This is really fun.

2210
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:25,080
They're all great.

2211
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:32,120
In so many, it is the new Mickey, who I'm going to butcher the name if I try to say it,

2212
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:36,120
but it's that actor who's in the, he's one of the new Three Stooges.

2213
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:37,640
He's Moe in the, I've actually seen Stooges.

2214
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:38,440
Oh, I did see that.

2215
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:40,600
He's fantastic.

2216
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:42,680
His Mickey in general is so great.

2217
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:47,240
But then it's not as if they recast everybody because it's the classic people.

2218
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:51,640
This ride is Rucy Taylor who's passed away since, but it is like the Minnie that it's

2219
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:53,080
been for most of our lives.

2220
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:58,200
And they just get fresh angles out of her.

2221
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:03,080
Everybody, Bill Farmer, Goofy, all the people who have been doing it forever are just top

2222
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:05,400
of their game in this version.

2223
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:07,320
And Daisy's Tress McNeil.

2224
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:09,080
She is so great.

2225
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:14,600
I think they've never had an angle on Daisy besides, Daisy has always been like Minnie

2226
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:15,160
but Duck.

2227
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:19,480
And now this Daisy is like, she's demented.

2228
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:24,680
You get into that dance studio and you're like, I don't like where this is going.

2229
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:27,880
I am uneasy about what the plans are.

2230
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:32,200
I heard, did you, this is again, too late in the podcast to start taking tangents,

2231
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:36,920
but I have to say this because I, when I went to see a live read of The Simpsons,

2232
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:41,320
courtesy of Mitch, when he used to work on The Simpsons, I was awesome to see everybody

2233
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:43,640
do the voices, but I was like, oh, it's Tress McNeil.

2234
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:45,160
And she did two lines.

2235
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:48,520
And again, I like lit up even more than seeing almost anybody else.

2236
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:51,160
Even Dan Kesslin, I do Homer live, which is insane.

2237
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:55,640
But Tress McNeil, two lines out of it, like out of there, not maybe immediately, but

2238
01:45:55,640 --> 01:46:00,920
Tress McNeil, John Lovett said he auditioned for Saturday Night Live with Tress McNeil.

2239
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:06,200
And you heard this anecdote and Lauren said, oh, Tress McNeil was the best one.

2240
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:06,840
Too old.

2241
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:08,440
What?

2242
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:10,840
Maybe 37 or 38 at the time.

2243
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:13,000
Wow. No, I have not heard that.

2244
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:13,480
Oh, yes.

2245
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:17,240
This is fresh information SNL, red meat for us nerds.

2246
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:20,600
I forget there was another woman he said he auditioned with too that I think did really

2247
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:25,080
well, but I believe specifically Tress McNeil did the best out of anybody because there's

2248
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:29,000
something with Tress McNeil who we're talking about who does so many voices on The Simpsons

2249
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,080
and she's dot on Animania.

2250
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:31,720
All these voices.

2251
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:33,080
She's so funny.

2252
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:36,920
And sometimes you go, oh, maybe somebody's voice is just funny, but she's a groundling

2253
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:39,160
and clearly a great performer.

2254
01:46:39,160 --> 01:46:39,960
Must have been her own.

2255
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:41,080
Has the chops, has the instincts.

2256
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:42,280
And she got back far with SNL.

2257
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:43,560
That made me so mad.

2258
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:49,240
I think in that same time, Lynn Stewart, who is Miss Yvonne on Pee-wee.

2259
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:50,120
Oh, maybe.

2260
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:52,040
Who's maybe a little older.

2261
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:55,960
I think it's all might have been the spot that Jan Hooks got.

2262
01:46:55,960 --> 01:46:57,160
And I like Jan Hooks a lot.

2263
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:57,960
Yeah, I like Jan Hooks.

2264
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:59,000
This is all what a.

2265
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:04,200
But to hear that story, I was like kind of mad for a, I was like, that's awful.

2266
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:10,200
I just had to wait for a millennial to create a cartoon and just lay down the law of the

2267
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:11,400
lead is Tress McNeil.

2268
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:12,280
OK.

2269
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:14,280
The lead voice is Tress McNeil.

2270
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:19,080
I don't care what famous actor of the five famous actors you remember.

2271
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:21,160
You want to be the lead, but it's Tress McNeil.

2272
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:24,680
So yeah, she's Daisy now, which is great.

2273
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:25,080
Yeah.

2274
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:25,320
Yeah.

2275
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:29,400
It's even that that's like with no other choices, just giving.

2276
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:34,920
We're throwing that ball to the greatest living voice actress possibly.

2277
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:36,040
Probably, I think.

2278
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:36,360
Sure.

2279
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:37,800
So great.

2280
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:41,960
I mean, we can we can jump around, but I.

2281
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:48,120
Basically become like the track, the switches flipped and now every car is going every which

2282
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:48,760
way.

2283
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:54,120
It's up to Mickey and Minnie to try to save you and corral the train cars.

2284
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:58,040
I think the ride does a really great job of like, there's always the issue of you need

2285
01:47:58,040 --> 01:48:01,800
to have your adventure, but the characters are having their adventure and it's hard to

2286
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:03,400
make all those things combine.

2287
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:07,720
And I think this and Goofy is kind of his own plot, although we just lose him for most

2288
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:08,280
of it.

2289
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:12,520
But I think it does the spread does a great job of it's everybody's story.

2290
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:15,000
You're part of what they're doing or part of what you're doing.

2291
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:19,640
And it's and it's not doing the thing I've complained about lately where other people

2292
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:22,040
have put it better or more articulately.

2293
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:28,600
There's so much going on around you that there's plenty of stuff to look at, depending on

2294
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:29,960
what you want to look at.

2295
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:30,600
Yeah, yeah.

2296
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:34,440
Which is I like that better than when you're pointed at stuff again, except for the

2297
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:38,600
Yeah, which is they perfectly pointed at the perfect amount of information.

2298
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:42,120
Full performance in the tear jerking scene.

2299
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:48,840
Yeah, no, every I think you'd never get tired of look because even like, yeah, just unimportant

2300
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:54,680
stuff whizzing by looks neat and is for you could just I'm going to go on this this time

2301
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:55,080
on this ride.

2302
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:57,240
I'm only staring at stuff that doesn't matter.

2303
01:48:57,240 --> 01:48:58,440
I think you'd have a great time.

2304
01:48:58,440 --> 01:48:59,160
Yes, for sure.

2305
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:00,840
But you're in this old West scene.

2306
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:01,400
That's really fun.

2307
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:03,320
They really like start showing you the tricks.

2308
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:09,400
They're trying to lasso you and struggling to do so.

2309
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:12,360
Then you go into this carnival scene that's jaw dropping.

2310
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:17,320
We referred it's as if it's like, yeah, it's like there's nothing happening on the walls

2311
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:19,000
and then it all turns on.

2312
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:24,520
I think what we are looking at for a lot of it is just different percentages of this.

2313
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:28,680
A lot of this is painted and this is permanently what it is.

2314
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:32,280
And it's just really bright and lit to where it looks like a cartoon.

2315
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:32,680
Yes.

2316
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:37,720
And then so seamlessly blended in our projection spots.

2317
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:42,760
But then you've got other rooms where it has to be the entire wall that's projected.

2318
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:43,000
Right.

2319
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,720
And you're also like, where are these projectors coming?

2320
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:49,880
Sometimes I saw a video that was slowed down that pointed out, all right, they're up there

2321
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:54,360
in the ceiling hidden, but it's all short throw projectors so they can just hit from

2322
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:55,800
really particular angles.

2323
01:49:56,600 --> 01:50:03,160
But still at the best resolution you've ever seen of visual images in front of you.

2324
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:03,480
Yes.

2325
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:09,480
So I have a moderately priced projector that I've used in the backyard on a white sheet

2326
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:11,880
and the light is not strong.

2327
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:12,520
It's tough.

2328
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:13,720
You got to love those lumens.

2329
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:14,280
It's got to be dark.

2330
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:15,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2331
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:19,560
And I got a higher lumen, amount of lumens than the cheapest projectors,

2332
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:22,600
but still it's got to be pretty dark for that.

2333
01:50:22,680 --> 01:50:28,600
So imagining like a fairly dark room projecting, that just has to be the most.

2334
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:29,240
Good to get at that.

2335
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:31,000
How many lumens must it take?

2336
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,480
Next time I go on this thing, I'm going to find a cast member and go like, hey,

2337
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:34,360
pretty good ride you got here.

2338
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:36,280
How many lumens?

2339
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:40,120
Will Jim and Len look into how many lumens each projector has?

2340
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:41,080
Please, I'm begging them.

2341
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:42,200
The lumen count, guys.

2342
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:46,920
I mean, if they could just hit up all the AMCs in the LA Burbank area too.

2343
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:48,920
Like some of those are the lumens.

2344
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:50,520
You want Jim and Len to go investigate the AMC Burbank?

2345
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:52,120
I mean, it would be great.

2346
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:54,200
I a few times have been like.

2347
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:55,000
I think we know the answer.

2348
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,600
I kind of want to go talk to someone.

2349
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:57,640
Lumens are low.

2350
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:00,120
The 16?

2351
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:02,760
The 16, I think, is actually operating pretty well.

2352
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:06,120
Sure, and there's obviously the higher resolution theaters that have more lumens.

2353
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:08,440
And recliners.

2354
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:10,920
Right, but you're saying with the six.

2355
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:11,560
That has nothing to do with anything.

2356
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:13,080
You're saying the six and the eight have bad lumens.

2357
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:14,840
Oh, the six and the eight have pretty bad lumens.

2358
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:17,560
Yeah, they try to trick you in those with the recliner.

2359
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:18,600
And then you're like, what?

2360
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:19,720
I am squinting.

2361
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:21,000
Another thing.

2362
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,440
You know what else doesn't have recliners?

2363
01:51:22,440 --> 01:51:24,200
Forever Dog Studios.

2364
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:27,720
We're here sitting upright, stressing our backs.

2365
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:30,040
We want to be able to do this thing all the way.

2366
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:31,240
Yeah, we want to recline.

2367
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:35,080
If we're going to do a podcast for three hours talking about Mickey and Minnie's

2368
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:36,120
runway railway, then.

2369
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:36,920
We're racing now.

2370
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:39,800
What's just important stuff to get?

2371
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:42,440
OK, another jaw dropper to me.

2372
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:44,920
Love this sequence.

2373
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:50,440
You end up in like a Hawaiian lagoon with cliffs and waterfalls.

2374
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:52,280
Here's a big rock wall.

2375
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:55,160
You watch Minnie and Minnie fly into a plant.

2376
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:57,880
The plant rustles and they poke out of it.

2377
01:51:57,880 --> 01:51:58,600
They want to help you.

2378
01:51:58,600 --> 01:51:59,640
But then you're careening.

2379
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:01,640
They warn you about a waterfall, right?

2380
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:06,840
When exactly when you're going to go down the waterfall, every car goes into a little

2381
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:07,480
pot.

2382
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:13,560
You're all in your own little simulator dome where you like great fun little waterfall

2383
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:14,280
sequence.

2384
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:17,720
Then you come out, you turn around, you are now underwater.

2385
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:23,240
But you were looking at the same room you entered that is now projected 100 percent

2386
01:52:23,240 --> 01:52:23,720
different.

2387
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:29,160
But it's all the same set pieces and they all look like that plant that Mickey and Minnie

2388
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:31,240
flew into is now kelp.

2389
01:52:31,240 --> 01:52:34,760
And the cliff walls are now underwater rocks.

2390
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:39,560
It takes you a second to like, wait a minute, and how do they do that so quickly?

2391
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:40,600
Is that the same wall?

2392
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:43,000
It's got to be because there's only one way to go here.

2393
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:45,480
I'm blown away by that.

2394
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:51,800
For a second, because it sort of goes into a that might be because you go off a waterfall

2395
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:55,880
and it's sort of a very familiar theme park trick of like it makes you feel like you're

2396
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:56,760
shooting far down.

2397
01:52:56,760 --> 01:52:58,520
But really you're just seeing a video or whatever.

2398
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:04,040
And that part I remember being like, oh, oh, kids will enjoy this part.

2399
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:08,040
This part doesn't do so much for a sophisticated writer like myself.

2400
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:09,720
And then it turns around and the whole room is different.

2401
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:13,320
I go, OK, well, that's now we were in a little box and now we're OK.

2402
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:13,960
You got me.

2403
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:19,880
The giant different rooms are really something I like when you come around, you come out

2404
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:21,720
of something and there's just a city.

2405
01:53:22,440 --> 01:53:25,320
There's just a full city scene happening.

2406
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:26,760
Yeah, it's so busy.

2407
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:30,280
It looks like the horizon goes forever.

2408
01:53:30,280 --> 01:53:31,960
Tons of cars racing by.

2409
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:32,520
Yeah.

2410
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:35,400
And then you go into a factory and Mickey gets stuck.

2411
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:39,320
I always liked when characters got stuck in the gears and the machines and stuff.

2412
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:40,840
I always liked that as a kid.

2413
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:41,480
Yeah.

2414
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:42,360
Still holds up.

2415
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:47,960
I do have a question coming out of that scene because when I was trying to watch

2416
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:54,040
videos of them back to back, is there kind of like a weird dark tunnel at the Disneyland version?

2417
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:58,200
Like it seemed like in the Florida version, you come out of the factory

2418
01:53:58,200 --> 01:54:00,680
and you're right at that picnic ending.

2419
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:01,160
That's correct.

2420
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:01,640
Yeah, yeah.

2421
01:54:01,640 --> 01:54:03,640
Yeah, they somehow it ends different.

2422
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:07,880
The room is flipped like Mickey and Minnie are on the left in one version, on the right

2423
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:08,360
in the other.

2424
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:09,080
OK.

2425
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:11,160
Yeah, I think the unload is different.

2426
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:13,080
So they have to get you to some.

2427
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:16,760
And I think they added animation of Goofy to cover it.

2428
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:17,320
I see.

2429
01:54:17,320 --> 01:54:19,240
So yeah, that is different.

2430
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:20,120
Yeah, yeah.

2431
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:22,360
That's a thing I really like.

2432
01:54:22,360 --> 01:54:27,320
And they really tread it the line very carefully here.

2433
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:33,160
The big headed Mickey and Minnie that are three dimensional but have projections on it

2434
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:36,040
that you see in the car at the beginning, you see at the picnic at the end.

2435
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:37,400
I think they're cute.

2436
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:38,840
I think those are great.

2437
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:45,240
And those could have also looked very uncanny valley, just like big head Mickey.

2438
01:54:45,240 --> 01:54:45,720
That's true.

2439
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:48,280
That could have been horrifying if they didn't do it right.

2440
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:53,240
But I think it navigates the two dimension to two and a half dimension, three dimension

2441
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:54,120
pretty well.

2442
01:54:54,120 --> 01:54:54,600
Yeah.

2443
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:55,720
For most of this ride.

2444
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:56,360
Not completely.

2445
01:54:57,320 --> 01:55:00,440
The room, the dancing room with Daisy, I really like.

2446
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:00,940
Great.

2447
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:06,520
That's where I think it's fun just to see what the cars can do, what the ride vehicle can do.

2448
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:09,640
I know that these ride vehicles are like, they're a little bit updated, I think,

2449
01:55:09,640 --> 01:55:12,840
technology from like Pooh's Honey Hut and Ratatouille.

2450
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:16,120
And I think they can move faster than those can actually.

2451
01:55:16,120 --> 01:55:17,080
And maybe even Rise.

2452
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:18,280
I'm not sure if that's the same one.

2453
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:25,000
But I almost wish there was another room like the Daisy room in it.

2454
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,040
But that's kind of a gripe.

2455
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:28,360
But it's like, I don't know, it's just a small room.

2456
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:30,280
It's the intimacy, I think.

2457
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:33,800
But it's almost like it's fun to have kind of that variation where all of a sudden

2458
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:35,800
you're in a small room and you're doing kind of fun stuff.

2459
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:39,160
Just scale wise, it's fun to go back and forth between the two.

2460
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:40,040
And you pause.

2461
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:42,760
You're like, we're going to have a wall facing a wall.

2462
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:46,920
And it's not about moving forward and getting to the next thing.

2463
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:47,160
Yeah.

2464
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:51,640
And some of it, I think, if you have never been on like Trackless Ride,

2465
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:54,600
if you've never been on like Pooh's Honey Hut or something,

2466
01:55:55,880 --> 01:56:00,120
the first time we went on that ride, it blew my mind in the same way you're talking about.

2467
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:05,000
Where like the car splits apart and you get like all these different tricks

2468
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:08,280
because they're very similar to some of the stuff they do on that Pooh ride.

2469
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:10,360
So like if you're going out for the first time and you've

2470
01:56:10,360 --> 01:56:13,880
gone on the traditional dark rides, all this stuff is so cool.

2471
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:18,600
And yeah, I don't know, there's two parts, two thoughts.

2472
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:20,200
I'm losing my mind a little bit.

2473
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:21,560
I still haven't caught up on sleep.

2474
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:24,360
I can't imagine you would have.

2475
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:26,360
My eye is twitching right now, honestly.

2476
01:56:26,360 --> 01:56:27,080
The right one.

2477
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:28,120
I've been twitching too.

2478
01:56:28,120 --> 01:56:28,760
What's happening?

2479
01:56:28,760 --> 01:56:29,240
Are we?

2480
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:32,840
It's usually lack of sleep or I think sometimes if you're over caffeinated,

2481
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:33,720
which I am not today.

2482
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:34,520
No, I'm not either.

2483
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:34,760
I'm asleep.

2484
01:56:34,760 --> 01:56:35,640
So it's sleep then.

2485
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:36,680
Sleeping great too.

2486
01:56:36,680 --> 01:56:37,080
I don't know.

2487
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:37,720
Oh, well then I don't know.

2488
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:38,200
Something else.

2489
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:38,760
I know.

2490
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:39,720
I better have my eye checked out.

2491
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:40,760
My eye just twitches when I'm tired.

2492
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:47,320
Yeah, but well, and the switch of the dance, like now we've established waltz

2493
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:50,760
and then all of a sudden conga, which is much more jerky and crazy.

2494
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:53,960
It's almost like all these flowers come out of nowhere in the room.

2495
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:54,520
Sofa.

2496
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:57,400
What a delightful, you're just laughing at that.

2497
01:56:57,400 --> 01:57:02,600
Just from a writing perspective, that reminded me of such like an old Mickey

2498
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:04,600
or old Looney Tunes gag.

2499
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:07,560
Just the mention of waltz and conga back to back.

2500
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:11,800
I was like, I feel like that was always a thing that characters would get up into

2501
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:17,000
antics where they would end up dancing a very funny dance that as a child, I'm like,

2502
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,360
I don't really know what these things are, but it's funny when Bugs Bunny does it.

2503
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:22,920
You know, like a machine would make somebody do it.

2504
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:25,400
Like now, oh yeah, manipulating a character.

2505
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:27,400
They're into congaing and they don't want to be.

2506
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:29,560
The Beetlejuice is kind of like that.

2507
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:35,400
Simpson's always watching a movie or something where like some kid, a college kid, shoots

2508
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:35,960
people.

2509
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:37,960
Oh, with a ray that, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2510
01:57:37,960 --> 01:57:38,360
Yeah, yeah.

2511
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:40,600
And then they're all dancing against their will.

2512
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:42,440
That's fun.

2513
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:45,240
That's when the daisies making you do that.

2514
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:48,840
She's forcing a dance on all these people.

2515
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:49,320
Sure.

2516
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:49,880
Really fun.

2517
01:57:50,680 --> 01:57:55,320
And then that final scene, that park at the end after the factory is another

2518
01:57:55,320 --> 01:57:59,880
incredible like, oh yeah, all in the, in a, like in a second, it becomes a different type

2519
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:05,960
of from chaotic, scary factory with something called the Smasher to a serene park.

2520
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:10,120
One set piece moves down, something else rises up and it goes from being like a,

2521
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:15,000
I don't know, some just some industrial piece to a merry-go-round.

2522
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:15,240
Yeah.

2523
01:58:16,360 --> 01:58:17,320
It's lovely.

2524
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:23,400
And then that, like that final scene is just like oddly gentle and serene for having come

2525
01:58:23,400 --> 01:58:24,680
out of a really hectic ride.

2526
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:31,560
And lasts a while too, which is almost, it's similar to the, what they did to the snow white

2527
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:35,160
ride, even though there's a lot less time on that ride, but the end of, have you been on it yet?

2528
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:35,640
Yeah.

2529
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:36,040
Okay.

2530
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:36,360
Yeah.

2531
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:37,880
I love the ending of it now.

2532
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:43,240
And it's another thing where they like give you a nice, like calm, fun, peaceful, not even fun,

2533
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:44,600
I'll say, just calm and nice.

2534
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:46,920
And it's, that's the way out of it.

2535
01:58:46,920 --> 01:58:49,160
And not all rides need to be that way, but it's fun.

2536
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:51,400
It's nice to see that on some of them.

2537
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:57,720
And this one really feels like you're in, like living the like perfect happy ending of all the

2538
01:58:57,720 --> 01:58:58,360
cartoons.

2539
01:58:59,080 --> 01:58:59,640
Yeah.

2540
01:58:59,640 --> 01:59:04,040
I think, cause the week I was down there, Ratatouille had just opened in Florida.

2541
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:08,920
So doing this in Ratatouille, back to back, obviously this one much, much more advanced,

2542
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:12,200
but tonally this is more joyful and goofy.

2543
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:16,200
And Ratatouille is just kind of like, oh, this is a nice, serene is probably the right word,

2544
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:20,840
nice French, like you feel like you're in Paris and there's a little bit of antics

2545
01:59:20,840 --> 01:59:25,480
cause you're running, you know, under all the kitchen appliances and stuff, but it's like,

2546
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:29,640
oh, a nice pleasant vibe that lasts a little bit, you know?

2547
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:36,920
So it's all, you know, we have been shitting on Disney recently,

2548
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:38,920
but it's just because we want more of it.

2549
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:42,200
We want as many of these as possible because God knows they got it.

2550
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:45,480
These are like great rides recently.

2551
01:59:46,280 --> 01:59:49,720
I mean, this is one of the best things in any of these parks.

2552
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:51,400
And it's from the last three years.

2553
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:53,720
I just want more.

2554
01:59:53,720 --> 01:59:54,280
That's all.

2555
01:59:55,640 --> 01:59:56,520
They're so great.

2556
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:57,720
They're such down there.

2557
01:59:57,720 --> 02:00:02,520
I think it's a cycle they get into a lot where they get like a big ride out,

2558
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:07,400
like a runaway railway or radiator Springs racers.

2559
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:10,920
And then for a few years after that, they just coast on like,

2560
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:15,240
hey, there is a new rice dish at the food festival sheds.

2561
02:00:15,320 --> 02:00:19,560
Like, they just coast on that or merchandise and stuff.

2562
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:23,640
Or like, I understand that they have to pay off this ride.

2563
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:28,760
I know that like they want to try and make a little money before they do the next big ride.

2564
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:36,520
But we certainly were conditioned to expect big rides a lot faster growing up in the 90s.

2565
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:37,160
You know?

2566
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:37,660
Yeah.

2567
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:41,480
Well, when you get them at Universal more so lately,

2568
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:43,960
it just depends on who's got that big pile of money.

2569
02:00:44,600 --> 02:00:47,720
Maybe it won't be Disney again for a while, but I'm glad when they get it.

2570
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:50,520
They have the pile, pay the cast members, whatever they're at,

2571
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:54,200
like the dollar more they're asking for and build some rides.

2572
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:58,440
Truly, it would not take much out of the bottom line if they did just those two things.

2573
02:00:58,440 --> 02:00:58,760
Yeah.

2574
02:00:58,760 --> 02:00:58,920
Yeah.

2575
02:00:58,920 --> 02:00:59,420
Yeah.

2576
02:01:00,040 --> 02:01:00,360
Yeah.

2577
02:01:00,360 --> 02:01:03,960
Because look, these rides that are exciting, we're excited.

2578
02:01:03,960 --> 02:01:05,480
This has been very positive.

2579
02:01:05,480 --> 02:01:10,360
If I could close out with one thing, Jordan, I have a little video of this is a special

2580
02:01:10,440 --> 02:01:14,440
that a clip from a special of people who were pretty excited about the ride.

2581
02:01:14,440 --> 02:01:17,480
This is an interview with Charita Carter who's doing the Princess and the Frog,

2582
02:01:17,480 --> 02:01:24,600
the Splash Mountain redo, but some Disney channel folks, including somebody named Milo.

2583
02:01:24,600 --> 02:01:29,640
I think they're all from the movie Zombies and they came to check out this ride.

2584
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:38,280
And I just really like for it being this very earnest cartoon situation, like who they paired,

2585
02:01:39,240 --> 02:01:43,240
who they like the vibe of this guy compared to the vibe of the ride.

2586
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:43,640
Do we have it?

2587
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:44,760
Do we have that video Jordan?

2588
02:01:44,760 --> 02:01:47,000
This is the very first scene in our attraction.

2589
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:50,520
This is where Mickey and Minnie are getting together to go on the perfect picnic.

2590
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:52,360
We're very proud of it.

2591
02:01:52,360 --> 02:01:54,600
And I can tell you this is just the beginning.

2592
02:01:54,600 --> 02:01:55,160
Okay.

2593
02:01:57,160 --> 02:02:00,120
I hear there's a piece of Disney history on the ride.

2594
02:02:00,120 --> 02:02:01,080
There sure is.

2595
02:02:01,080 --> 02:02:02,360
And I'd love to show you.

2596
02:02:02,360 --> 02:02:03,080
Come with me.

2597
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:04,520
Charita, Charita.

2598
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:05,980
Yo.

2599
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:07,660
So you know.

2600
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:09,240
That's pretty much.

2601
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:12,440
And it's a great place to have a picnic.

2602
02:02:12,440 --> 02:02:13,160
Okay.

2603
02:02:15,240 --> 02:02:16,600
I'm listening.

2604
02:02:16,600 --> 02:02:21,640
They should have had Kyle's character from Smash do this.

2605
02:02:21,640 --> 02:02:22,140
Yeah.

2606
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:30,520
That feels very much of a piece with Disney adventures pairing like,

2607
02:02:30,520 --> 02:02:33,560
look, John Malkovich is on the cover and he's hanging out with Stitch.

2608
02:02:34,520 --> 02:02:36,440
Okay.

2609
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:41,160
So your new movie takes us inside the or in the line of fire.

2610
02:02:41,160 --> 02:02:41,660
Okay.

2611
02:02:43,880 --> 02:02:44,380
Yo.

2612
02:02:45,400 --> 02:02:51,480
Stitch wants to know what is it like being you because didn't get the movie at all.

2613
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:55,880
So yeah.

2614
02:02:55,880 --> 02:02:58,760
Hey, I'm as excited as Cool Milo.

2615
02:02:58,760 --> 02:03:00,120
That was the name of that clip.

2616
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:02,280
I named the file Cool Milo.

2617
02:03:02,280 --> 02:03:08,680
And you know, for anybody from little kids all the way up to the coolest of Milo's

2618
02:03:08,680 --> 02:03:10,920
Runaway Railway is for you.

2619
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:11,560
It's a winner.

2620
02:03:12,280 --> 02:03:15,240
It's so great and fun to talk about something we're super excited about.

2621
02:03:15,240 --> 02:03:18,840
You survived podcast the ride and thank you,

Yeah, both.

2627
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:35,080
Y'all catch so many little things that second time things like, oh, that part.

2628
02:03:35,080 --> 02:03:39,240
I didn't know we're 46 minutes in that Scott sift a coconut LaCroix.

2629
02:03:39,240 --> 02:03:39,720
That's right.

2630
02:03:39,720 --> 02:03:41,880
I wouldn't have caught that just in the audio one.

2631
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:46,680
Carlson's eye starts twitching around an hour and 15 and it's really alarming.

2632
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:47,880
It's really weird.

2633
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:52,120
It's a drinking game to figure out who is whose eyes are twitching.

2634
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:56,760
Yeah, watch them age rapidly within the episode.
