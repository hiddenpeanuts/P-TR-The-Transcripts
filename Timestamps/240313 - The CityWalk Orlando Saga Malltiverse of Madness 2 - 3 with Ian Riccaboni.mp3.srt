1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,540
Dog.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,620
When your town has made you frown.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,320
When your square has made you swear.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,880
When life gives you one more punch.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,960
You need a doughnut soaked in Captain Grunge.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,380
You need a place, a place to stroll with alcohol.

8
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,640
A place that features part of the Berlin Wall.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,600
Where steampunk robots sell chocolate snacks.

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,620
A place where you can tattoo your lower back.

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,680
So let's go take a walk.

12
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:50,300
Let's all go to City Walk Orlando tonight.

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,140
Podcast The Ride presents the City Walk Orlando Saga.

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,920
Multiverse of madness.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,340
A daily, extremely necessary series.

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,080
Exploring the shops, restaurants, and cosmic wonder.

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,280
That make up Universal City Walk Orlando.

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,360
Welcome to Podcast The Ride.

19
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,100
The City Walk Orlando Saga.

20
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,200
Multiverse of madness.

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,640
And I just want to say, folks,

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,460
mama always said,

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,460
podcasting is as podcasting does.

24
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,620
My name is Mike Carlson.

25
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,160
Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,800
Hi.

27
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,540
Scott Gierdner also here.

28
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,140
Yeah.

29
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,560
And life is like a box of podcasts.

30
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,320
Life is like a box of podcasts.

31
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,400
What does that even mean?

32
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,080
You could put it in a box of CD-ROMs.

33
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,040
I suppose it had a bunch of episodes on them.

34
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:44,680
Oh, sure.

35
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,080
Yeah.

36
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,620
Do we need to do like a physical media release at some point?

37
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,700
The box set?

38
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,940
Could we do like a high end Jack White's, whatever,

39
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,220
third man records,

40
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,920
like vinyl pressing of some of our greatest episodes of all time?

41
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,320
Well, you could do like a split, like a seven inch,

42
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,820
one side is City Walk Hollywood theme.

43
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,520
One side is City Walk Orlando theme.

44
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,800
That's true.

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,600
We could do that.

46
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,780
Would it be full episodes or would it just be like greatest hits?

47
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,980
Would it just be like Jason said,

48
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,760
no one gives a fuck about grapefruit.

49
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,160
And that's like one track.

50
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,460
Is it more of likeâ€¦

51
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,880
Well, let's get it straight.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,460
It's who gives a shit about grapefruit.

53
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,680
Let's get the profanity right.

54
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:24,940
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,320
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,620
But this is why we need an archivist of our own material

57
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,840
to correct us on our own points.

58
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,160
So whoever out there feels qualified to be our keeper of the vault.

59
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,900
Well, maybe it's our guest.

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,100
Maybe he's ready to sign up for this unpaid job that we've just created

61
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,360
and he wants to do it.

62
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,640
He's returning to the show from Ring of Honor, from AEW, Ian Rickabani.

63
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,500
Welcome back to Podcast The Ride.

64
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,900
Oh, thanks everyone.

65
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,760
Yeah, I downloaded all of the City Walk episodes during the pandemic.

66
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,840
And so during the first Ring of Honor bubble tapings,

67
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,620
I got really into Podcast The Ride.

68
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,360
I got really into the program,

69
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,540
which led to me aggressively sending Mike DMs

70
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,460
because I confused Mike and Scott at one point about all this beat boys minutia.

71
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,520
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

72
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,080
And so I was feeling the fever.

73
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,040
I could feel it building up.

74
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,200
So we drove down to Florida over Christmas this year,

75
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,200
and I made my wife listen to most of the original City Walk saga.

76
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,700
And she had a lot of questions about Nick Mundy, who's become a friend of mine,

77
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,580
and about some of the accusations that led me back and forth in that episode.

78
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,320
But it was a really good time.

79
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,540
And I explained to her, I said, hey, we're on a mission.

80
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,080
It's almost like the Blues Brothers who come into play in this, by the way.

81
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,560
It's like we're on a mission from God.

82
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,720
Yes, we're going to see my parents.

83
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,460
Yes, we're going down for Christmas, but we got to get to City Walk.

84
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,260
We absolutely have to get to City Walk.

85
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,060
Wow, that inspires me.

86
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,480
By the way, Mike and I both just saw Nick Mundy for the first time

87
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:08,280
since the deepest throes of pandemic at Disneyland and in my case, downtown Disney.

88
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,620
Wait, what were the designations there?

89
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,560
It was not.

90
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,480
It was OK.

91
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,500
It's phases now.

92
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:14,920
What was it?

93
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,660
It was Worlds.

94
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:21,480
So that was World 1-3, which is the Napoli Italian restaurant.

95
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,320
So I'm happy to say that I got to see Nick Mundy on fertile soil.

96
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,560
And sorry to say nothing has changed.

97
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,220
He is still a bad man.

98
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,400
Yeah, very good.

99
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:33,760
He was rooting.

100
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,660
We went on Rise of the Resistance, and he was rooting for Kylo Ren.

101
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,340
Whoa.

102
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,000
I saw him in Utah, of all places.

103
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,360
We were in Salt Lake City together.

104
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,260
And he had a Houston Astros hat on, which I thought was very disrespectful

105
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,320
because everybody knows I'm a Philadelphia Phillies fan.

106
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,980
And unfortunately, the Astros beat them two years ago in the World Series.

107
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,520
So we had a little rough start, but I agreed with all of his Bo Jackson takes

108
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,680
when it was all said and done.

109
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,240
I'm glad you found common ground.

110
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,460
That's great.

111
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:09,120
Well, being that I myself, there's confusion about past profanities that we've said in past sagas.

112
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,840
There's confusion about are we are we worlds or phases or what is it?

113
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,500
Why don't we set the record straight by quickly checking in with the Sector Keeper

114
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,300
and getting today's official phase and sector assignment.

115
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,980
Boys, boys and Ian, phase two, sector three is Bubba Gump,

116
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,740
Starbucks, Cold Stone Creamery, and Red Oven Pizza.

117
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,520
Good luck, boys and Ian.

118
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,700
All right, there we go.

119
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,600
All of these.

120
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,140
OK, look on the surface, some of these things are fairly perfunctory.

121
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,400
Some of them are things that we have covered in previous sagas before.

122
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,960
But the thing that is different here is Ian and Ian's excitement,

123
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,680
seemingly about your time in City Walk, about past memories in City Walk.

124
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,900
So, Ian, if you would like to calibrate us to your feelings about City Walk

125
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,060
or even anything in this particular sector.

126
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,240
Absolutely.

127
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,180
I think what everybody needs to know is that the Sector Keeper sent me here

128
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,560
and it was through a Beetlejuice like function.

129
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:23,840
Anytime anyone mentions Allentown or anything related to Allentown three times, I appear.

130
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,780
And so when Jason mentioned Dorney Park and then Christine Taylor,

131
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,640
Allentown legend was mentioned, and then Tim Heidecker was mentioned,

132
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,260
that's what drew me to the City Walk saga.

133
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,820
And that's why I'm here today.

134
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,080
When was all those?

135
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,440
These are all just recent things that we've we've talked about.

136
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,820
I have vague memories of some of it.

137
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:51,860
The Tunnel of Love, Dorney Park came up a bunch because they had a mill chute ride for many years

138
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,820
that was called Mill Chute and then later journeyed to the center of the earth.

139
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,100
But it was essentially a dark tunnel of love that ended in a shoot the chute drop.

140
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,200
Right.

141
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:08,980
And I was researching all that very late the night before and we recorded it in the morning the next day.

142
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:14,580
And as I was like heading home, I was like, oh, I should have asked Ian if he had any memories about this.

143
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:24,520
And sure enough, when it came out, I woke up to messages from Ian about the trout fishery.

144
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,600
The trout ponds are still there.

145
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,100
Just move down the road.

146
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,080
Yeah.

147
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,980
Go ahead.

148
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:37,660
When when the discussion of famous rivers was happening, I was yelling at my phone, the Lehigh River, the Lehigh River,

149
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,960
because that's where the trout hatchery and fishery is in in Allentown, Pennsylvania.

150
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,680
So they just kind of shifted them up the river and over into a smaller place.

151
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,940
It's on Fish Hatchery Road for those that would like.

152
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,180
That follows.

153
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:53,560
Yeah.

154
00:07:53,600 --> 00:08:00,220
Is there anything about the fish hatchery or fishery that is themed that would warrant an episode?

155
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,720
There is actually.

156
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:10,800
So it so the Native Americans, the Lenape are that was a fertile ground for them to fish.

157
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,200
And it also was the site of turtles and things like that.

158
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,300
And Lenape culture, they believe that the turtle that the universe was created on the back of a turtle.

159
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:26,800
And so there's really cool markers along the it's called the Little Lehigh that feeds into the Lehigh and explains some of the Lenape culture.

160
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,420
But it's also through a grant from PBS or the Explorer, not the Explorer.

161
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,400
One of the characters from from PBS leads you through leads you down.

162
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:37,980
Really?

163
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,550
Yes.

164
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,360
So the PBS intellectual property.

165
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:42,860
Wow.

166
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:43,900
Yeah.

167
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,300
Yeah.

168
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,140
And I'll try and I'll try and find that.

169
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,060
But it's PBS 39.

170
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,240
They do a lot of great stuff through the through the community.

171
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,840
They yeah, they're wonderful, wonderful organization.

172
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:02,880
So but yeah, they've they've continued to keep that fish hatchery portion alive and doing well.

173
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,360
And my kids love to go and feed the fish.

174
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,680
And it's a family friendly activity.

175
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,360
That's great.

176
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,620
Can I ask a question?

177
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,800
Jason brought I've said this.

178
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,780
We just talked about this again for the 100th time.

179
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,800
But just I did I ask you, have you ever fished for pond eels?

180
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,220
Oh, geez, I've never I don't know what pond eels are.

181
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,920
OK, never.

182
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,340
OK.

183
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:21,960
Yeah.

184
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,340
Nuff said.

185
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:22,820
Got it.

186
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:23,640
Yeah.

187
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,800
It feels like something I should know from my journeys to Bubba Gump shrimp, though.

188
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,200
That feels like yes, it does feel like part of that world for sure.

189
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,120
Yeah, yeah.

190
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,220
We're in that zone.

191
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,940
But you were part of why you.

192
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,940
OK, so you were you were summoned here by the keeper.

193
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,460
The sacred words were said, which we didn't know Christine Taylor was one of them.

194
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,460
But now we know for the future.

195
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:55,380
But in you, you had talked a little about we were DMing about your fond memories of City Walk, Orlando.

196
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:03,840
Is that a good way to weave us in just like what you know, some City Walk glory years that you because not every guest has.

197
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:10,020
A lot of the guests are people who were like, please go down to this place because we don't know a lot of guests who've ever been here.

198
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,540
But you, in fact, have a history here.

199
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:13,700
Absolutely.

200
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,220
My brothers lived in Orlando since 2003.

201
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,040
And so as soon as I hit college age, I'd go down and visit quite a bit.

202
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,000
And I even lived in Orlando for a summer.

203
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,460
I was a legal resident of Florida because at one point my parents had also moved down as well.

204
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,000
So I changed my license and everything.

205
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,860
And my brother and I, we'd go to City Walk to kill time with his wife and just hang out.

206
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,280
And I have a lot of fond memories of just walking around, hanging out.

207
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:45,540
And then my association with wrestling, they used to tape total nonstop action there.

208
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:53,620
And so in addition to Ring of Honor, which we filmed a couple of times there last year, I used to go down during those summers and see TNA wrestling.

209
00:10:53,620 --> 00:11:04,360
And now I've worked with a lot of people that since that were on those TNA tapings like Samoa Joe, Christopher Daniels, AJ Styles, whether it be for prolonged periods or short periods.

210
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:17,980
But I think my most embarrassing story was one of the only times I had the courage to actually talk to a woman outside of a school situation or anything like that was at the beautiful Starbucks.

211
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:23,660
Right when you walk in the nice open air area and it would later be someone that I'd work with quite a bit.

212
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:29,540
So I don't want to finish that story, but please let it be known that I asked her if she'd like to go see wrestling that night.

213
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,700
And she said, yeah, I'll be there.

214
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,720
And she certainly was.

215
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,840
She was part of the event.

216
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,320
So wow, it was a it was a wrestler is who you were attempting.

217
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,100
Yeah, it was somebody that that ended up being on television.

218
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:48,320
She wasn't on TV at the time yet, but she would be making her her debut that evening.

219
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:53,340
So, yeah, I didn't I didn't get turned down and it all worked out because I met my wife about eight weeks later.

220
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,440
So, oh, wow.

221
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,580
All good.

222
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,100
Geez.

223
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:56,920
Okay.

224
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:57,300
All right.

225
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,740
So it's a happy story and you got to you got to meet a future co-worker.

226
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:12,400
This is great because the fact that you have anything resembling a moment or a story in a Starbucks is huge for us because this is our third saga.

227
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:18,320
We have we've had to deal with Starbucks in some cases several times within a series.

228
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,920
And I don't know what else there is to say.

229
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,640
You characterize it as beautiful.

230
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:34,140
It seems it may have moved since the one that you this is something we have to be on the ball about to is tracking where the location of start because Starbucks is one of those flux locations.

231
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,280
It kind of moves within city walk establishments.

232
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
I remember it being in the same place.

233
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,120
I remember it being when you walked in as you kind of walk down.

234
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,820
It's open air.

235
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,100
I don't remember it initially being that big.

236
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,480
And that could be the difference.

237
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,080
I think it is more real estate now than it did.

238
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,240
This would have been 2006.

239
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,540
I have a ton of really fond memories, too.

240
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:04,320
In 2020, we needed to get out of the house and Universal Studios said, we're opening up, baby.

241
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,660
We're going to be the first.

242
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,340
We're going to beat Disney to the punch.

243
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,020
We COVID who cares?

244
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,640
Wear a mask.

245
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,440
Come on in.

246
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,560
And my brother's down in Orlando.

247
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,620
My parents, my parents were probably the most at risk in terms of COVID.

248
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,880
We check with them.

249
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,160
We said, hey, can we bring the kids down?

250
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,000
We're going crazy.

251
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,880
It's been four or five months.

252
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,120
They said, sure.

253
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,820
My brother said, sure.

254
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,660
And then we snuck off the Universal Studios.

255
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,180
And I'll never forget the fun we had on that trip.

256
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,900
It was about 100 degrees because it was in July 2020.

257
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,480
And we had a ton of fun.

258
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,960
I felt so bad for the Grinch.

259
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,480
The Grinch must have just been sweating profusely.

260
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,040
Grinch out.

261
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,060
He doesn't even that's not the season for him.

262
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,960
No, no.

263
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,000
And he was out waving.

264
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,820
And the Starbucks.

265
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,600
I just we taking taking my daughter in who was who just turned one.

266
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,760
My son, who our son, who's about to turn four, just the joy on their face to do something.

267
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,940
And then they had figured out what cake pops were.

268
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,320
And those are those are relatively safe for kids and good portions.

269
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:18,260
So just the joy of them being able to walk around and see the Grinch wave at them as they came into the city walk area and then go into Starbucks.

270
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:24,560
It felt like that's when things were kind of getting back to normal, even though in my head I was like, do not do this.

271
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,320
You're going to get COVID.

272
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,100
You're going to not be able to work for a ring of honor.

273
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,960
You're going to get pulled off the tapings.

274
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,480
But it was a calculated risk worth taking.

275
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,920
And that trip in particular was so much fun.

276
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,980
And it started with Starbucks.

277
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,180
Wow.

278
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:36,700
Geez.

279
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,460
This is far more than I thought anybody would have to say.

280
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:45,860
Thank God you've really come through because I feel like we're kind of obliged to do more than 60 seconds on all of these places.

281
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,620
And speaking of obligations, let me get this out, because now that we've discovered at this point in the saga,

282
00:14:50,620 --> 00:15:00,140
we've realized that we are responsible for some material about City Walk Hollywood that updates things since the last time that we did it.

283
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,860
And so this seems like probably we've got to get this out for the sector keeper's sake.

284
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,940
Since the last City Walk saga, the Starbucks moved from what I think was Sector 14.

285
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,860
I could be wrong.

286
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:18,820
It moved up to a part of a space up top some stairs that was formerly occupied by Karl Strauss Brewery.

287
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,500
And it was there for a year or two.

288
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,260
And then it moved back to the original location where it was the first time.

289
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,940
Which I believe expanded the original location.

290
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,360
I think it took over part of the Blaze Pizza, too.

291
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:34,900
Okay.

292
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,540
Yes.

293
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,260
Blaze Pizza.

294
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:36,780
Okay.

295
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,220
I knew there was something up over there.

296
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:38,480
All right.

297
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,500
There has been a change.

298
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:46,940
I think it moved to the top of those stairs so they could redo the original space.

299
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:57,100
Because I could not figure out that when it was at the top of those stairs, I'm like, you have to walk up a flight of stairs and then walk down the flight of stairs with your piping.

300
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:03,860
You know how you like to get a piping hot cup of coffee and go down a full flight of stairs surrounded by strangers?

301
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,500
I just couldn't figure out why it moved.

302
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:14,060
And then when it moved back to this bigger space, I was like, okay, this makes more sense.

303
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:19,800
Well, and Jason, also the word Starbucks never left the original location.

304
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,880
So that was always confusing, too.

305
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,940
Why is there a giant, huge, empty space that says Starbucks and then you walk up to it and nothing happens.

306
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:33,700
And instead you got to go somewhere else, walk up a flight of stairs that where you can't necessarily fully see the word Starbucks.

307
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,480
And as I learned one time, a stroller could not clear the aisle.

308
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,300
I couldn't get my stroller all the way through after I took an elevator up with it.

309
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,560
This was a very frustrating situation.

310
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,420
Thank God rectified Starbucks backs back where it belongs.

311
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,460
Yeah, but for now, for now.

312
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,500
But who knows?

313
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,360
Yeah, these Starbucks, they're wily and all of these outdoor malls.

314
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,820
You never know where they're going to pop up.

315
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,140
They might show up underground.

316
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,560
They might show up in the sky.

317
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,400
We don't know.

318
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,260
Toothsome could just close and become a big Starbucks.

319
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,400
That seems like the most likely prediction.

320
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,160
It's possible.

321
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,320
In Hollywood.

322
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:10,880
Orlando.

323
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,400
Oh, I don't know.

324
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,040
Orlando is doing perfect.

325
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,020
Toothsome seems there to stay.

326
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,660
And feel free to toss in other Starbucks memories if you have them.

327
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:26,880
I'm also going to maybe point the direction towards one that I'm worried about content wise.

328
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,820
Maybe we just need to get a bare minimum done.

329
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,440
Cold Stone Creamery.

330
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,760
This is in your sector.

331
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,380
Does anyone have anything about the fairly nondescript Cold Stone Creamery?

332
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,320
I do.

333
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,300
Good.

334
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:38,780
Thank God.

335
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,120
I put this on the list for my wife, who's an amazing trooper.

336
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,640
She goes through all these wacky missions.

337
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:54,140
She has lived with me long enough to know that if there was a Kmart or an Ollies or anything on a road trip, we were likely stopping to check.

338
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:04,340
Oftentimes, I didn't buy anything, even if I found what I was checking for, which is my wife's least favorite thing that I do, which includes clearance out video games and action figures and things like that.

339
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,260
I just need to check and see if they're there.

340
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:14,260
But the Cold Stone, this is the thing that made my children maybe the happiest.

341
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,540
And we had this for dessert.

342
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:30,360
It also served as a refuge for my soaking wet children who decided it was going to be fun to run through the journey into your imagination style water shooters that they have out in the water fountain.

343
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,720
Yeah, we didn't have a lot to say about that either.

344
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,640
So this is actually cool.

345
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:42,380
How did those, as opposed to the Hollywood ones, which have caused all manner of trouble in our mythology, did your kids like those?

346
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,240
They did.

347
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:43,840
They loved them.

348
00:18:46,160 --> 00:19:00,400
My wife and I, before the trip, decided that we were going to be a little less hands on, that we are too much no, no, no, and that this was the trip where we were going to let the kids make a little mistakes here and there.

349
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,880
And it cost us about one hundred dollars because we had to buy them dry clothes.

350
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,960
They ran through the fountains.

351
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,420
They had the time of their life.

352
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:16,100
Unfortunately, the sun went down by that point and it was maybe forty five to fifty degrees that day.

353
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,560
So they were there, brother.

354
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,520
We were not going to let them get sick.

355
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,040
You know, but the fountains were very cool.

356
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,980
They were a little less predictable.

357
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:38,660
It was kind of like and it's going to be a far out reference that the game show Press Your Luck, Michael Larson was the greatest Press Your Luck competitor of all time.

358
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,160
He figured out there were three patterns on the board to get the big bucks.

359
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,780
And all he had to do was figure out which one it went on and he could time it.

360
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:51,280
And he won one hundred and ten thousand dollars on Press Your Luck back when the highest base was only five thousand.

361
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:51,560
Right.

362
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,080
Oh, wait, there's documentaries about that.

363
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,180
Yeah, this is a big story.

364
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,900
The guy who like who games the system.

365
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:56,540
Yeah.

366
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,160
And he did it perfectly legally.

367
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,180
He just figured out where the lights went.

368
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,200
So then they figured out how to randomize it.

369
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,740
And so that people couldn't do it.

370
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,280
I think that's what CityWalk did.

371
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:11,280
Because when you're at imagination, you can kind of figure out the pattern.

372
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:16,780
I was looking at this thing for all 10 or 15 minutes when my kids were running back and forth through it.

373
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,420
I couldn't figure out where the water was jumping.

374
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,560
There was more than one outcome for each fountain.

375
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,220
It was crazy.

376
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,140
It was it was awesome.

377
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:32,160
So I think maybe a kid Michael Larson did and figured it out and they had to change it, make it completely random.

378
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,900
Larson did.

379
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,380
OK, so they come in soaking wet.

380
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,280
So you're you are you're operating at a financial loss.

381
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:47,520
But now now cold ice cream is there a reward with we had promised them ice cream.

382
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,060
And yeah, I mean, it is what it is.

383
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,780
I'll say this.

384
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,760
It was as cheap as it is in Allentown.

385
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:04,180
So among theme park desserts, it ranks relatively inexpensive because the portions are still gigantic.

386
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,640
They're still as big as I remember it at Coldstone.

387
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,420
It was good.

388
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,400
It was quality.

389
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,340
And I think each of the kids things were like seven bucks.

390
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,280
And I think mine was like eight.

391
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,360
They gouge on the soda.

392
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,780
I think the soda was like, you know, four.

393
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,440
But right.

394
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,160
Yeah.

395
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:26,660
But the ice cream, you know, we got we got decently sized stuff for what you'd expect to pay in the suburbs.

396
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,620
So can I ask a quick question as far as far as kid preference?

397
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:42,200
Because oftentimes I Jason or I, but oftentimes myself, I choose something on a menu that might be aimed at seven, six year old, five year olds,

398
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,280
because it has a lot of colors, sprinkles or jimmies, as Jason might say.

399
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,000
How do your kids do?

400
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,380
Do they do they order like a birthday cake remix or do they go for something more sophisticated?

401
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,380
Yeah.

402
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,400
My son figured out that you don't have to color in the lines.

403
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:04,260
And it's dangerous because we let him at Dairy Queen, for instance, go and mix the Reese's and Snickers.

404
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:14,120
And the one time he did Reese's Snickers brownie and we and that's like I mean, it was almost to the point where they couldn't spin the thing because just OK.

405
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,740
There's too much stuff in it.

406
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,420
Plus, it added like an extra dollar fifty or two bucks or whatever.

407
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,480
So, you know, we we've encouraged him to be creative.

408
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:28,800
But now that he can read, he reads well, he could figure out what's on the on the menu.

409
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,540
My daughter, Nora, she just wants chocolate and sprinkles.

410
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,920
If it's chocolate and it's got sprinkles, that's that's for her.

411
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,440
So little mix of both.

412
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,060
I'm a I'm a strawberry boy.

413
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,740
If it's got strawberry, I like the strawberry shortcake.

414
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:45,240
So that's usually what I get at places like Coldstone.

415
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,980
I am also a strawberry boy.

416
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:52,800
If we're talking about the core three, the Holy Trinity of ice cream flavors, I am strawberry boy.

417
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:53,600
Absolutely.

418
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,780
And I'm a person who thinks that strawberry shouldn't be in the Trinity.

419
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,600
I don't think it's I don't know why it's a primary.

420
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,980
I it's fine.

421
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,640
I'll have some strawberry ice cream.

422
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,080
Jason, what do you think?

423
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,200
You think that's the Trinity?

424
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:14,000
I think chocolate vanilla strawberry is usually we're talking the appaltine.

425
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,280
That's the Trinity.

426
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,500
I like the what is it?

427
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,840
It's pistachio cherry chocolate.

428
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,440
That's another that's spum.

429
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,020
Yeah, that's been money.

430
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,160
That's not that's a different religion.

431
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,000
That's a different but I prefer that.

432
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,600
I like you know, I do like chocolate ice cream.

433
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,460
I think I like, you know, fudge and chocolate chips more.

434
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,180
Thank God you're clarifying this, Jason.

435
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,680
I think the audience was concerned.

436
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,720
It is different.

437
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:51,880
But like so if I like chocolate or not, if I can get a good quality vanilla

438
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:59,960
and then get some fudge and some chocolate chunks in there, you're not okay.

439
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,600
Long story short, you are not like Ian and I and you're not a strawberry boy.

440
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,880
Not a strawberry boy.

441
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,100
That's fine.

442
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:14,560
I did learn recently of a fudge boy that Cold Stone Creamery, they default to the sweet cream a lot,

443
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,600
which I saw someone were like making a short video working at Cold Stone and they're like,

444
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,060
well, sweet cream is just basically plain.

445
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:30,440
Like it's just the default ice cream, but there's no, you know, vanilla beans or vanilla extract, you know.

446
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,100
It's a vanilla without even vanilla in it.

447
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,780
That's right.

448
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:34,760
Flavor.

449
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,800
Now that sounds godless to me.

450
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,580
That sounds like I don't know how you even do that.

451
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:45,420
Well, I think I think at Cold Stone, it's just a base to put a lot of toppings in.

452
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,320
Oh, it's almost like they're creating their own ice cream.

453
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,020
I see what you're saying.

454
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,700
Yeah.

455
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,560
Depending on the toppings, the fixin, whatever, fixins or whatever they call them.

456
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,260
Jimmy's.

457
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,880
I'm glad you're putting this in religious terms, though.

458
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,460
You've kept that consistent, Mike.

459
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,080
Thank you.

460
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,620
Ice cream, the religion of the show.

461
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,420
I well, let me see.

462
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,680
Now I can't decide whether to veer to because I just feel like, you know, we should give,

463
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,520
if we need to shortchange one, we can, but it feels like we should give ample time to the real star of the sector,

464
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,640
which has been the previous star of a sector, and that is Bubba Gump.

465
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,780
And you, Ian, jumped at that.

466
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,440
You seemed like, OK, you're in town.

467
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,020
You're going to go do a family night.

468
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,740
You were more than willing to have Bubba Gump be the main feature of your city walk evening.

469
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:35,940
Absolutely.

470
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,820
Something strange happened.

471
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,540
My wife got really into it.

472
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:47,800
And it was, you know, we're sitting at my parents who live in the middle of the Ocala National Forest,

473
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,940
which is like, you know, seventy five to ninety minutes away.

474
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,720
And we were we had a lot of fun and we were going to, you know, we were going to see him a lot that week.

475
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,440
And I looked at my wife and I said, you want to go to Universal tonight?

476
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,280
She said, sure.

477
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,380
And so we loaded the kids up and we realized the city walk parking was more than we remembered.

478
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:13,000
And so we made the decision to see if there was any hotels at the in the area,

479
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:20,560
because in my mind, if I'm going to pay 40 or 50 bucks for parking and the hotel is 100 or 125,

480
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,820
might as well just do it instead of driving back late at night with the kids.

481
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,220
So is that what we're talking parking wise?

482
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,160
By the way, we don't really know what we didn't park there.

483
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,760
So we don't really know what we're dealing with.

484
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,380
Yeah, it got up to Disney levels.

485
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,980
It's pretty high and it didn't used to be that was that was one of the big reasons I used to see wrestling there,

486
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,900
because it was a easy night out wrestling.

487
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:45,160
The TNA wrestling was free and parking at city walk.

488
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,940
I think after five or six at some point was free.

489
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,680
And that wasn't the case anymore.

490
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,280
So we I think maybe the free parking starts at like nine o'clock now or eight.

491
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,320
It's like very late.

492
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,420
And the kids the kids bedtime is usually, you know, on a on a vacation night, it's eight o'clock or nine o'clock.

493
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,880
So we couldn't wait to have dinner until then.

494
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:09,860
So we figured, you know, if we're putting 40 percent of that toward a toward a room, why not?

495
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:15,160
So we got a room at Endless Summer, which is this is where I segue all the Beach Boys talk into.

496
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:15,840
Oh, sweet.

497
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:16,340
Yes.

498
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,000
Yeah.

499
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:22,060
And that's a phrase in their world that they use all the time for titles of lots of things.

500
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,120
Yeah.

501
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,000
And I thought earlier it was a big parable for using biblical terms, a parable for summer in paradise.

502
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:35,080
We were discussing all of the the failed expectations and things like that in the previous conversation.

503
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,020
But got an awesome room.

504
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,340
Very nice premise.

505
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,000
And I'm sure you'll go over this in the hotel section.

506
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:46,540
Well, this now look, OK, we clarify this in a later sector.

507
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,180
We did make the choice.

508
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,380
The other sector keeper made the choice.

509
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:50,680
Right.

510
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,080
You know what?

511
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,660
It was never it was never said.

512
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:59,020
So we just didn't because something has to be out and hotels had to be out because this is OK.

513
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,740
We've we don't know how long this is going to go.

514
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,980
So I don't know.

515
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:12,120
I guess if I sound defensively and it's because you've now if the audience is now wishing and hoping for a hotel sector, I don't know what to say.

516
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,380
Hotels were out of downtown Disney ordeal.

517
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,100
So this is in keeping with tradition.

518
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,440
Well, that's I can I'll keep it quick.

519
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:27,860
We had a beautiful view of an abandoned hotel that is probably going to get demolished and bought by Universal Studios and for another resort.

520
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,580
And we had a good to do.

521
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,000
Dunkin Donuts that were fully operating.

522
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,760
And but the hotel itself was actually beautiful.

523
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,400
It was nice.

524
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,500
It was Disney quality.

525
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:43,260
It was bright colors, you know, beautifully clean head to toe.

526
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,660
It felt it felt like an experience.

527
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,440
And the kids really got a kick out of it.

528
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,600
Super high ceilings.

529
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:48,600
Awesome.

530
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,520
You know, check in the.

531
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,780
Checking counter again, something comparable to what you'd see at the Disney Resort.

532
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,820
So they were pumped up right then because they had no idea.

533
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,980
And they didn't even care if we were going.

534
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,980
They just love hotels.

535
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,920
So they didn't care if we were going to the park.

536
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,320
They didn't care.

537
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,120
We're going to city walk.

538
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,460
They were just there's a big Christmas tree because it was like there too after Christmas.

539
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,560
So they were they were jacked up and we take them into the room.

540
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,100
We get them kind of dressed around.

541
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,340
We get them in some warmer clothes because we know we're going to be walking.

542
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,860
And then we hop on the bus.

543
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,260
The transportation is awesome.

544
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,480
It's like a two minute ride.

545
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,460
It's right outside.

546
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,400
It's more convenient than almost any Disney resort, maybe besides Polynesian contemporary.

547
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,280
You know, those Magic Kingdom ones like it is hop, skip and a jump.

548
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,940
You're maybe a mile away entrance to entrance.

549
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:39,320
So already this is this is great that, by the way, bodes well for the epic universe situation where there's been the concern about

550
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,580
will the transportation be complicated sending people a little further away?

551
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,900
But if you had a good, pretty sound situation, maybe that bodes well for the future.

552
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:47,900
Yeah.

553
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,860
And the road design over there.

554
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:55,040
So the endless summer used to be wet and wild and wet and wild.

555
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,860
You know, it was isn't a relative.

556
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,980
It seems kind of relatively inconvenient.

557
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,420
It's off I drive it or was.

558
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:09,780
But the way they siphon the traffic and create a new traffic patterns actually worked out really well.

559
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:14,300
So it's right off I for you know, if you go left, you're at the summer.

560
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,680
If you go right, you're at Universal.

561
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,380
You know, can't recommend it enough.

562
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,140
And it was affordable.

563
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,100
I think it was only for a room Christmas week.

564
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,800
It was like, you know, one twenty five or one forty nine or something around there.

565
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:27,740
Yeah.

566
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,840
And so we got the kids ready.

567
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,060
We told them we were going for dinner.

568
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,440
And I'm telling my wife, I said, I don't know if they're going to like this.

569
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:38,240
It's you know, I looked at the menu and there's a lot of Cajuny things.

570
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,580
And it's about the movie Forrest Gump and which which came out.

571
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,060
Let me just do some quick math here.

572
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:48,720
I think forty nine years before they were born.

573
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,300
That's right.

574
00:30:50,760 --> 00:31:00,180
And then the irony of it is that I saw it in the theater in Florida with my parents and my brother.

575
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,820
So this is all coming full circle.

576
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,440
I'm having like a crazy like, you know, every everything setting off a memory.

577
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:12,520
Even driving from my parents' house, we stopped at the Turkey Lake Service Plaza, which used to have an awesome kind of

578
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,000
retro Burger King that has since been remodeled to Wendy's and a Dunkin Donuts.

579
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,040
But it's still there.

580
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:24,300
So all those memories, like the time I shot my dad with ketchup and I thought I was going to die because it's the maddest I've ever seen him.

581
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,640
Whoa, whoa.

582
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,260
Yeah.

583
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:33,560
So I'm just like, this is beyond belief and everything's going wonderful.

584
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,200
So we get there and they couldn't have been nicer.

585
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:42,120
And you walk in and it it feels like you're in the movie.

586
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:49,720
I can't stress enough the attention to detail, you know, within Bubba Gump Shrimp.

587
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,760
Now, is anybody going to talk about the parking garage?

588
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,380
Because I have some fond memories of that as well.

589
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,080
I believe that is the plan.

590
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,000
You know, the Sector Keeper hasn't divined it all for us.

591
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,200
But I think it's I think it's worth mentioning here.

592
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,340
Yeah, you were alluding to this, like the the fond feelings just in the buildup of the garage.

593
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,660
I say go for it.

594
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,580
Yeah, it's again.

595
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:21,480
I didn't know this was kind of in me, but I kind of flashbacked when I was the first time I went to Universal was 1995.

596
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,060
I was sort of an eight.

597
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,880
And I just remember seeing all the different monster movie characters and Jaws.

598
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,580
And they just started to put up like a Jurassic Park parking section.

599
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,400
If it wasn't that trip, it was the trip after.

600
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,560
But you start to hear all the scores from the different Universal movies.

601
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:47,440
So they drop you off on the bus just under the parking garage and you take an escalator up to the garage where they security and your ticketing and stuff like that.

602
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,800
So you go through security and then there it is.

603
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,000
The beauty of that city walk and Bubba Gump is on the left.

604
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,260
And I'm still feeling this.

605
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:03,140
I have endorphins and nostalgia and stuff I haven't felt in years, which I didn't know I had for Universal.

606
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,040
I knew I'm addicted to Disney.

607
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,280
Like I have it for Disney.

608
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:07,980
Absolutely.

609
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,820
But this experience unlocked it.

610
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,480
I'm almost sitting here thinking like there must be like years and years of built up.

611
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,380
But it's almost yeah, they like unlocked it.

612
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:20,380
Yeah, because we only as a family went to Universal maybe two or three times.

613
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,260
I mean, ninety five, two thousand.

614
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:29,260
And, you know, I've gone I've gone with my wife on kind of a solo trip like 13 or 2013 or 14.

615
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,500
So, yeah, with the kids and then we 2020.

616
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:39,740
So, yeah, there wasn't a whole lot of memories, but this time it was just like, there it is.

617
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,760
And it was really cool, but I never I'd never eaten a single Bubba Gump shrimp.

618
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,940
I lived in New York City for four years.

619
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,080
I never went to the one in Times Square.

620
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,740
I had always been kind of curious.

621
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:57,440
But Bubba Gump's the kind of place where you can't really say like, hey, guys, you want to go to that hot new restaurant, Bubba Gump?

622
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,960
Like, it's never something that could be suggested.

623
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,720
But now I had an excuse and I'm so glad I did.

624
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,000
You have to.

625
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,760
You could tell your family a ghost child's life depends on it.

626
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:10,920
Yeah.

627
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:17,160
And they they were fully understand they from the jump when they heard the sector keeper was involved, they knew.

628
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:21,820
And so we walked down, we went to the left and it's right there.

629
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,040
It's one of the one of if not the first things you see.

630
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,860
And it's I think physically the first thing you can choose to do.

631
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,120
It's right on the aisle.

632
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,180
It is a dramatic.

633
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:35,480
It's like it's a prime position in the city.

634
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,120
Well, for sure.

635
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,360
Yeah, it is.

636
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,640
This whole stretch is like stuff tempting you.

637
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,320
Like early in the day, it's Starbucks and Bubba Gump.

638
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,680
And then when you're leaving, it's like, oh, do we need another meal?

639
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:50,160
Should we go to Bubba Gump or should we get ice cream on the way out?

640
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:56,140
You know, yeah, in a lot of ways, these are like the sirens on the cliff calling to the sailors.

641
00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:00,180
Are there dangers that lie in these places sometimes?

642
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,380
Yes.

643
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,100
Yeah.

644
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,120
And there was nothing, no danger involved in Bubba Gump.

645
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:13,380
I mean, we walked in, you know, there it had the cool.

646
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,060
I don't know if you guys remember the old school Long John Silver's that used to have all the details.

647
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:18,620
Yeah.

648
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,300
So it was it was that but better.

649
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:30,280
You know, the wood floors, wood panels, the ropes, the the safety buoys on the wall,

650
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:38,680
the pictures of a forest with different folks, license plates across the walls from the different spots that he was in the movie.

651
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,660
There was just left and right.

652
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,900
Everything was detailed.

653
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,200
Pictures of Jenny everywhere.

654
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,360
So you know what I'd forgotten about was like the the folksiness,

655
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:55,540
like I'm looking at photos where there's a lot of like kind of grandma knickknacks,

656
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,740
like that, you know, pots and little ceramics and, you know, whatever.

657
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,240
There's like metal, those platters or whatever that you put up on the wall.

658
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,600
You know, things reminiscent of mama.

659
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,400
I think mama's spirit is especially strong in this location.

660
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,900
Yeah, I would I would have to agree with that.

661
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,820
And it was I'm trying to put my finger on it.

662
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,860
It's almost this is going to sound like the craziest thing that's ever come out of my mouth.

663
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,080
It's almost indescribable.

664
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:27,260
It's it's just it made me really happy to be there.

665
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,160
They treated and I think it was, you know, they treated my kids really nice.

666
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,680
They made a big deal about making sure that they were taken care of.

667
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,580
Well, there was there's this cool thing.

668
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:43,340
It's it's almost like Foa de Chow where instead of where they have the green and the red for the meat,

669
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,680
they have a thing you can flip over if you need service or if you need help,

670
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,420
which made it really convenient, especially with kids,

671
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:52,860
because you didn't have to flag anybody down and chase them down.

672
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:58,980
And my kids really got a kick out of just everything involved.

673
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,600
They had a they had a menu.

674
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:07,120
And I'm going through my pictures now where you could draw yourself next to Forrest Gump.

675
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:10,600
And for some reason, both my son and my daughter just gravitated.

676
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,960
They wanted to put themselves next to Forrest.

677
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,320
What is what is Forrest to them, though?

678
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:20,440
Did you have to explain and is the explanation because the explanation is complicated?

679
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:25,400
Well, he sort of he's this like cipher who appears in all of history.

680
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,340
And, you know, and you got to be careful with certain aspects of it,

681
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:36,200
given that it's an actor playing a type of person that he is not, which we don't see as much these days.

682
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:41,700
Was there any difficulty in explaining to children what the hell this franchise is?

683
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,800
Say like, you remember the Polar Express?

684
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,520
Is that where you start from?

685
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,220
Is it an easier explanation?

686
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,540
Well, he's kind of that guy.

687
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:57,460
We we explained Forrest as a nice character from the movies that really wanted to help his friend.

688
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,920
And he made a restaurant in the movie to commemorate his friend that he had a boat with.

689
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,620
And that was that's really sweet.

690
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,580
That is.

691
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Yeah.

692
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,920
You didn't have to get in the hole.

693
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:17,860
Like, well, he kind of journeys through the second half of the 20th century and represents a lot.

694
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,420
And encounters a lot.

695
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:20,260
Yeah.

696
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:24,300
There's a weird sequel book where he meets Tom Hanks and it's kind of a metathagos.

697
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,060
That's not that's not an important thing to tell your children at all.

698
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,140
There's a script.

699
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,040
There was a script.

700
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:34,960
They were going to make a sequel and then some events occur that kind of made it like inappropriate.

701
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,840
And a lot of people kind of agree.

702
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,140
It probably should have been pulp fiction.

703
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,120
So history doesn't look too kindly on it because that was like the new Daring movie.

704
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,440
But it's still I don't know.

705
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,960
Wait, wait, did it did it really get delayed because the 9-11?

706
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:58,260
Supposedly the legend now is that like, oh, yeah, we had a script ready to go and then we were going to go of meeting about it on September 11, 2001.

707
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,620
Oh, my goodness.

708
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:05,840
But who knows how much that's apocryphal, like how much that's like it just seems a little too perfect.

709
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,020
Well, this is I'm seeing it.

710
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:14,700
Eric Roth screenwriter did say he turned it in the day before 9-11 and that it had.

711
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,300
Wait, I saw what happens in it like OJ's in it.

712
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,560
Oh, my God.

713
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,140
He's he had Forrest in the back of OJ's.

714
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,480
No, no.

715
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,860
What do you mean?

716
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,760
He was in there.

717
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,340
OJ's in the back.

718
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,120
He can't be in the back.

719
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:31,980
That's where OJ is.

720
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,340
Al Cowlings is driving.

721
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:33,960
AC.

722
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:34,540
Yeah.

723
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,520
Does he?

724
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:46,660
I don't we're getting close because he said I think he may have been in the federal building in Oklahoma.

725
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,320
No, no.

726
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,240
Yeah, that's what this is.

727
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:50,980
This is bonkers.

728
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,880
This is so not now.

729
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,780
We got to read this.

730
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,780
He danced with Princess Diana.

731
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,480
Not on the night of he wasn't like in a tragedy.

732
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,360
It's all far as wandering.

733
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,420
So is the first everybody dies.

734
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,160
That's true.

735
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,500
Everyone has topical illnesses and illnesses or wars.

736
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,860
Yeah, boy.

737
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,140
Oh, oh, oh, Jay's Bronco makes no sense, though.

738
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,760
Wait a minute.

739
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,520
Wait, wait, hang on.

740
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,000
I had forced in the back of his Bronco.

741
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:21,500
He would look up occasionally, but they didn't see him in the rear view mirror and then he'd pop down.

742
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:27,500
He was back there and they didn't know what events would possibly transpire.

743
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,240
And they were going to play a murder as a site gag.

744
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,440
Like, yeah, Peter's.

745
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,240
He was he was a gun to his head in that moment.

746
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:36,620
Right.

747
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:44,760
If he misfired, he's like, OK, I won't kill myself accidentally pulls trigger while putting gun down, goes right through the seat into forest gum skull.

748
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,860
Well, was what was that?

749
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,480
Was he hanging out with OJ that night?

750
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,940
Then like, why was he there?

751
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,740
He like just stumbled into the car.

752
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,160
Maybe he do Kato.

753
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,280
You think I think he was friends with Kato Kailin.

754
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,880
Oh, I could see that.

755
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,220
Maybe he's trying to start an acting or modeling career.

756
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,020
Yeah.

757
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:07,960
And his buddy has like, I'm staying in this guest house right now.

758
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,700
OK, what are the odds?

759
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:14,060
Do they cast Kato or do they get an actor to play Kato?

760
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:21,000
I think if his price is right, you just get him, get the real guy.

761
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,180
Yeah, nothing has ever had a lot of trouble getting Kato Kailin if they want him.

762
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:31,140
If you Irishman Kato Kailin, so he's more era appropriate, I think it would be fine.

763
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,320
So you age him down at this point.

764
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,880
Yeah, Dial of Destiny face thing to Kato Kailin.

765
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,060
And I think you use them.

766
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,440
I think it's because it's the technology is perfect now.

767
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,600
So you may as well.

768
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,280
So nuts.

769
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,200
I'm really glad I know about this now.

770
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:46,980
I just don't.

771
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:50,520
I feel like we could spend the rest of the time trying to figure out what

772
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,940
what logical way for us could end up in this car.

773
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,840
But we can't do that.

774
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,460
We've now distracted from what was a nice meal.

775
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,260
Yeah, I know.

776
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:58,660
Sorry.

777
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,680
No, it's wonderful.

778
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,240
I didn't explain.

779
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:09,240
I haven't yet broached the topic of OJ with my kids or, you know, Jenny's untimely demise.

780
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:17,280
And, you know, it's crazy because as I get older, I almost appreciate my parents or things

781
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,940
like that, because they did take me to see Forrest Gump when it came out.

782
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,340
And they did give me reasonable explanations that weren't outright lies.

783
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:30,440
And so I think one of the parenting skills over time, I think that is super valuable,

784
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:36,680
is the ability to not not lie to children in you don't have to tell them everything.

785
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:41,820
But if you start to explain something and give them enough, like this was a man who was

786
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,460
in the army with someone and they had a shrimp boat.

787
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,460
And then his friend passed away and he started a restaurant like that.

788
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,540
You can kind of leave it there.

789
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:56,180
And my dad always seemed to be really good at that, you know, just giving you just enough

790
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:56,860
information.

791
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:02,440
And the one thing I couldn't explain was why they gave my kids light up flashing

792
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,680
glasses because they heard the kids drink.

793
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,700
But by the end of the trip, which is only a day and a half, we did.

794
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,540
We ended up doing the park the next day.

795
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,160
We ended up with six total light up glasses.

796
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:15,660
Wow.

797
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:16,300
Wow.

798
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,740
That's like Mike's kitchen.

799
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:18,720
Yeah.

800
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:24,140
Well, yeah, I mean, yeah, my kitchen five to seven years ago, maybe.

801
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,800
Well, yeah, because now you have a lot of catching up to do is what I'm saying.

802
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,440
What's the new what's the latest in your kitchen?

803
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,540
My you're talking about me?

804
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,220
Yeah, yeah.

805
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,840
Oh, I don't actually know.

806
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:39,800
I think we have two spaghetti factory glasses from San Diego that are fairly recent.

807
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,360
They're kind of nice glasses, too.

808
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,560
They're not plastic, but they don't light up.

809
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,240
They don't light up.

810
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:44,540
Sorry.

811
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,360
But they are novelty restaurant glasses.

812
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:53,440
We just got some nice Disney on ice ones when we saw the number two Calypso artist of all time, Sebastian performance.

813
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,920
It's not just the girl.

814
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:56,900
Oh, what a callback.

815
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:57,460
Yes.

816
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:58,240
Yeah.

817
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,440
Buffett number one.

818
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:00,540
Yeah.

819
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,600
Sebastian the crab number two.

820
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,200
You're the archivist.

821
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:04,380
Wow.

822
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:05,420
That's right.

823
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,960
That'll go on the record.

824
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:14,100
Let me ask you, when you went to Bubba Gum, did you guys meet the mascot?

825
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:30,100
I wish I if you go through my Instagram pictures at any length, you will see that it is either me and my family with mascots, me and my family at theme parks or me at a wrestling event.

826
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,140
Those are your three choices.

827
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,780
And unfortunately, we did not meet the mascot.

828
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,660
I was aware of the mascot existing.

829
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,840
We did meet Bumblebee, the transformer the next day.

830
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,480
Oh, wow.

831
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,520
That's pretty good.

832
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,620
Yeah, we met the Blues Brothers.

833
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,400
So we did.

834
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,460
How do you begin to explain that to your children?

835
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,480
That's tougher than 9-11.

836
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,500
Yeah, there are two guys that came out of jail and they hated Nazis.

837
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,740
And then they had to raise money.

838
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:01,840
Yeah, I don't think I could simplify that.

839
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,380
No, it's too complicated.

840
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:07,300
Daddy, was this did they think this was funny or cool?

841
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,940
Well, both both kids.

842
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:20,720
Well, it's like when you do get around to explaining, oh, yeah, you you know, do it gradually and you start with the dancing Edo's.

843
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,700
I'd forgotten about that.

844
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:24,140
Yeah.

845
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,220
What led to this?

846
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,460
So what inspired this for this classic sketch, Dad?

847
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:38,560
Okay, I'm going to jump to one of the naked gun movies as I buy some time to think about how to explain this.

848
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,900
I do need to jump in.

849
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:48,810
I when reading about public, I figured out I had once again convinced myself of something incorrect.

850
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,570
The mascot's name is not scampi.

851
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:53,670
It is Shrimp Louie.

852
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:59,820
It is a different dish that I was confusing with Shrimp Scampi.

853
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:00,420
Whoa.

854
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:01,320
Okay.

855
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:01,850
Scampi.

856
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,300
Yeah, I know.

857
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,700
It came up.

858
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,540
It's come up recently.

859
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:06,780
Now we couldn't remember it.

860
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,960
And then we all believed it was scampi.

861
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:16,580
And look, if you maybe you might hear episodes where different names are used in different sectors, depending on when these come up.

862
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,980
So let's I get the confusion about this is never going to end.

863
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:20,780
No one's.

864
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,080
Yeah.

865
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:27,560
Let's just keep making up names for him to change it every time and then never mention it from here on out.

866
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,600
Yeah, because he's in he's in a top hat.

867
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,820
So, you know, I would.

868
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:32,920
What is that?

869
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:39,940
You know, the fancy, fancy lad, our friend fra Diablo.

870
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,600
Everyone, everyone loves it.

871
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,300
Call him Pinky.

872
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,920
I guess his name is Pinky.

873
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:48,900
It is surprising.

874
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,060
Pinky is simpler than Shamp Louie.

875
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:52,060
Yeah.

876
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:57,320
Oh, wait, maybe like Hat and Tails, you know, because he's these fancies got both.

877
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:57,800
Mr.

878
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:58,280
Hat and Tails.

879
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,220
But he brings the tail no matter what.

880
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,580
Yeah, that's good.

881
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:02,340
All right.

882
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:04,600
From here on out, we'll be we'll just try to add more confusion.

883
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,220
Yeah, no, different, different name every time.

884
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,940
That's the rules of a name.

885
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,580
I already shrimp shrimp Louie you're saying, but we may bail on Louie.

886
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:13,920
Huh?

887
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,400
It's really for that.

888
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:19,000
It's it's an impossible mythology to find.

889
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:19,540
Really?

890
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,360
Like nobody's I don't know.

891
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:25,460
Maybe there's maybe there were some like coloring pages for kids to clarify.

892
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:28,540
But I think there's a reason they have not like hammered this into our heads.

893
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,080
Yeah.

894
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:35,480
I'm looking at I've just blown up on my screen a picture of my son coloring in the coloring guide.

895
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:43,020
He colored in forest and he put himself they have a box of chocolates that you can color in, which is pretty neat.

896
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:48,600
You can circle the Bubba Gumps that you've been to in the United States.

897
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:48,940
Yeah.

898
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:49,360
Oh, wow.

899
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,680
Well, that's pretty neat.

900
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,260
And then it has all the locations from the movie, which is pretty cool.

901
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,240
And what was neat about that?

902
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,600
We like to drive down.

903
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,640
It's cheaper, but also it's fun.

904
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,940
The kids play their switches and tablets.

905
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,100
And so that map was kind of cool, too.

906
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:15,720
My my son realized what the states looked like on the map because they're and so he said, Daddy, when you said Georgia, where is it?

907
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,240
And so I pointed to Georgia.

908
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:23,660
And so we had a brief geography lesson about some of the states that we just drove through earlier that week.

909
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,820
Oh, geez.

910
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,000
It was an educational man.

911
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:27,420
Wow.

912
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:27,880
Wow.

913
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:28,940
That's that's great.

914
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:29,680
Yeah.

915
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,620
This is informative and fun.

916
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,020
What did everybody think of the food?

917
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,180
Because you had the risk of like Cajun.

918
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,740
Does that not make any sense?

919
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:37,140
Right.

920
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:45,600
So the kids, thankfully, and again, we had a server that was terrific on top of the kids drinks and everything.

921
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:49,660
And they got the special drink, which was kind of a Shirley Temple thing, but not really.

922
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,160
I think they did it custom that night.

923
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:54,300
It went in the collectible cup.

924
00:48:55,320 --> 00:49:02,440
So I think what they did, they put the cherry ice with Sprite and did like a little mixer thing that wasn't on the menu.

925
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:03,880
So we got like a secret menu item.

926
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,620
And yeah.

927
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:11,600
And they got Zach got the chicken strips and Nora got the I'm sorry.

928
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,500
Let me look here.

929
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,780
Nora got the chicken.

930
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,360
Zach got the mac and cheese, which is fine.

931
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,160
Like no Cajun.

932
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:23,080
What you default to is the parents bread and butter right there.

933
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,060
Yeah.

934
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,080
And our literal bread and butter also.

935
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:27,780
You can't go wrong with that.

936
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,500
And I got the what was it called?

937
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,160
Of course, we have scampi.

938
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,780
I think is the official name of it.

939
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:35,660
I wrote it down here and I love the menu.

940
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:38,100
But not of course, the character's name is scampi.

941
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:38,560
Right.

942
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,480
It's not an of course.

943
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:40,260
Yeah.

944
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:40,840
Yep.

945
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:44,080
It's called Of Course We Have Scampi and my wife got the jambalaya.

946
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,880
So we both really liked it.

947
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:53,080
We again, it was it was crowd.

948
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,980
It was busy, but we were able to kind of eat at our own pace.

949
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,280
We didn't feel rushed.

950
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,880
The service was great.

951
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:03,260
Everything about it.

952
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:09,000
I took a picture of so this is how to the detail this restaurant is.

953
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:16,720
I took a picture of an Ed Hardy thing to send to my brother and laugh because Ed Hardy is objectively hilarious at this point.

954
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:17,560
And 2024.

955
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:29,020
However, I didn't realize that Ed Hardy designs were in the Forrest Gump movie because of the year at Hardy started designing things.

956
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:29,520
Wow.

957
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,740
Oh, yeah.

958
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:35,940
So if you look up at Hardy, Ed Hardy design stuff came out.

959
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:37,380
Where is it?

960
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:50,660
It came out in the in the 70s and it would have been around the time that Forrest Gump was in was doing his thing coming out of the coming out of the armed services.

961
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:56,320
And there was Ed Hardy stuff and Ed Hardy tattoos and things in the movie.

962
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,880
And like there's little Easter eggs like that.

963
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,280
And then there's the restaurant where seemingly untied together things.

964
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:10,580
The attention to detail is so great that if you look at the license plates, they're all from places that he was at.

965
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:14,840
If you look at the the end, Hardy stuff, it's all from something that was tied in the movie.

966
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:23,300
Like if you were if you were a super fan of AEW and you had an AEW restaurant, you would you'd want this level of detail.

967
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,040
I'm sure there is a Forrest Gump super fan somewhere.

968
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,740
And I don't think they'd be disappointed.

969
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:35,340
They just every like everywhere he went in this place was just little Easter eggs.

970
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:40,600
And if if I'd seen the movie within the last 10 years, I probably would have picked up even more.

971
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:41,900
It was it was nuts.

972
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:53,580
It's really weird that there's there's just not any equivalent to like, you know, it's it is a it was a huge movie and an Oscar winning movie and a big box office box office success, too.

973
00:51:53,580 --> 00:52:01,560
But there isn't like it's not a franchise and franchises are like the only thing that inspire any physical spaces.

974
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:08,180
So it's so unique because there isn't like I'm trying to think of like an equivalent hit like this is weird.

975
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,480
It's similar tonally, but of course it wouldn't make a good restaurant.

976
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,900
Like I'm thinking about the Shawshank Redemption.

977
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:15,800
There's no maybe it would.

978
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:16,260
I don't know.

979
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,380
It might be interesting being Shawshank.

980
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:24,560
But like it just if you were just told again, this is whole chain and they don't know.

981
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,380
And it's like you're like you're in a prison.

982
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,160
But it's fun, though.

983
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:32,100
And this fact's about making the movie and, you know, like Tim Robbins shirt and whatever.

984
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,580
It's just like you buy that almost as much.

985
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,800
It's just it's it's so singular and strange, the existence of this place.

986
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,380
Yeah, yeah.

987
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,460
It's really why it's like I'm a big Joe's Crab Shack fan.

988
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:51,800
And this is like basically you could it's like a more detailed Joe's Crab Shack.

989
00:52:51,840 --> 00:53:02,020
Now, I haven't been to every Joe's Crab Shack, but the one in San Diego, it feels like, oh, like Joe's Crab Shack is the unlicensed for a scump restaurant.

990
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,040
They just don't have the they don't have the attention to detail.

991
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,620
They don't have the little touches.

992
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,000
Who's Joe?

993
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,580
We don't know anything about him.

994
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:14,280
Did Joe ever meet any presidents or inspire any famous rock stars moves?

995
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,160
Right.

996
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,840
Joe is no one and nothing.

997
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:29,100
So so yeah, I guess my point is just that like it's so weird because it's the movie and then it also just feels like it's almost like a better version of an existing chain restaurant or a more specific version of it, I should say.

998
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:34,240
Yeah, I think the only time in history that's happened was was Arby's and Roy Rogers, right?

999
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,340
I think we all agree Arby's is the punched out version of Roy Rogers.

1000
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:41,460
Oh, I don't know about Roy Rogers to weigh in.

1001
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,880
I've never had Roy Rogers.

1002
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:43,620
It's good.

1003
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,340
But in my opinion, Arby's is better.

1004
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:46,800
Really, Jason, what do you think?

1005
00:53:47,580 --> 00:54:07,240
I there used to be a Roy Rogers up the street from where I grew up that eventually flipped to a McDonald's and then Roy Rogers became like only president at East Coast rest stops, much like the famous Allentown, Pennsylvania rest stop.

1006
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:11,740
Very centrally located off of I-95.

1007
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:12,820
Is that right?

1008
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:14,360
Four seventy six.

1009
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:15,380
Four seventy six.

1010
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:15,960
Okay.

1011
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:24,440
So I was always excited to eat at Roy Rogers because it was like a rare white elk.

1012
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:26,600
You'd only see them at rest stops.

1013
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:27,940
Right.

1014
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:28,540
Right.

1015
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:28,920
Interesting.

1016
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,060
But do you think it's better?

1017
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:30,920
What do you think about it?

1018
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:31,840
First is Arby's.

1019
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,640
I think Arby's is probably more consistent.

1020
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:35,520
Sure.

1021
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,740
I know Roy Rogers has gotten me sick a few times.

1022
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:40,900
Oh my god.

1023
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,800
More fondness about places that get you sick.

1024
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,820
I don't think Arby's has.

1025
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,760
I think I've been okay.

1026
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:58,440
I've not eaten Arby's in a long time, but definitely at the end I was eating the chicken strips a lot more than the roast beef, which I always liked.

1027
00:54:58,760 --> 00:54:59,560
At the end.

1028
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,790
At the end of your Arby's?

1029
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,600
At the end of my Arby's run.

1030
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,980
Towards the end.

1031
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:04,760
That's what you're talking about.

1032
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:05,300
A parent.

1033
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,820
And you know, and at the end, you know, there were some rough times, but also a lot of perspective.

1034
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:09,660
Well, because.

1035
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:10,960
And a lot of roast beef.

1036
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:16,780
Arby's would go on to open up the street from where I lived.

1037
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:22,420
And so in high school it was often a quick go-to spot.

1038
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:23,300
Right.

1039
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:23,980
Right.

1040
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:25,780
The glory days.

1041
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:34,380
Let me bring up something that I've learned about Bubba Gump that we didn't get into the first time we did it in the first sector.

1042
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:39,060
And that is the founder of the person who we have to thank for this chain.

1043
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:41,840
Do you mean Tom Hanks or Robert Zemeckis?

1044
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,800
I mean in some way, yes.

1045
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:54,280
But no, I'm talking about environmentalist, entrepreneur, consultant, author, motivational speaker, and of course restaurant founder Anthony Zelezzi.

1046
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,700
I'm going to share my screen and show you this.

1047
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:01,100
This this info is all courtesy of friend of the show, BugmaneBuzzBuzz.

1048
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:06,640
Here I'm going to share my screen and you will see something from his website.

1049
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:13,800
And there's a picture of him putting his finger to his temple next to a Bubba Gump sign as if to say that I thought of it.

1050
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,600
I thought it up.

1051
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:23,640
Anthony Zelezzi was a like worked in food in all manner like packaged food, frozen food.

1052
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:30,700
And then he got a job for something called Meridian Products, the world's largest shrimp lobster and crab consolidation company.

1053
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,280
Sounds good, right?

1054
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:32,860
Wrong.

1055
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,960
Meridian Products fortunes were dwindling.

1056
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,640
Their sales and margins were declining.

1057
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:45,020
So they brought in Zelezzi, a genius from other companies, to help them find new growth vehicles.

1058
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:48,840
And he had seven months of very little traction or change.

1059
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,860
Things were not working out at Meridian.

1060
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:58,620
And then one day he put on the movie Forrest Gump and had the aha moment as seen in that picture.

1061
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,140
When this is where his own website gets confusing.

1062
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:07,500
When he saw the character nicknamed Bubba Gump reciting a list of the well, that's not true.

1063
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,060
No, Bubba Gump is the two names.

1064
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,340
Even he doesn't get it right on his site.

1065
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:18,680
Anyway, the part where Bubba is doing the big list of all the shrimp, all the ways that you can cook shrimp.

1066
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:24,660
He reminiscent of what Jason did the other day with hot dogs when Sector Keeper put him on the spot.

1067
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:29,740
Anyway, that big list happened and he's like, wait a minute, we could do all those kinds of shrimp.

1068
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:38,200
And the next morning he headed straight to Paramount Pictures where he's, I assume he just walked up to the gate and knocked on it.

1069
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,520
Anthony Zalazze here.

1070
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:45,620
But he did secure the licensing deal for both shrimp and chocolates, all of it.

1071
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:49,400
So for a while, and I don't remember this era that Bubba Gump was frozen shrimp.

1072
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,200
It was a grocery item first.

1073
00:57:51,360 --> 00:58:01,380
And then the California restaurant, the Rusty Pelican, he worked with them to create the brick and mortar establishment, which was a tremendous success.

1074
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,840
So now we know we have a guy here.

1075
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,420
I think this is a guy, but a guy for good.

1076
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:07,620
Wow.

1077
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:09,040
Thank you, Mr.

1078
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:09,700
Zalazze.

1079
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,940
We now we know who specifically to thank for your nice meal.

1080
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:14,500
You can thank Zalazze.

1081
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:26,460
I have a lot of respect for his tan, but also his apparent care for eye care because he has a tremendous tan, but he has like the aviator block out around his eyes.

1082
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:34,120
So that tells me this is a man that he knows how to look sharp, but then also got to protect those eyes.

1083
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,660
Got to protect the eyes.

1084
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:43,540
Maybe he was pointing to his eyes in that photo, actually.

1085
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:45,360
I'm protecting them.

1086
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,500
Check once or twice a year.

1087
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:48,460
Get them checked.

1088
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:55,060
We can all take a cue from Zalazze, his creativity, his self-care.

1089
00:58:55,880 --> 00:59:02,380
In telling that story, we missed before we move on to the last restaurant of the sector, do we miss anything about your very wonderful experience?

1090
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:03,080
Sounds really nice.

1091
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,340
I can't stress enough.

1092
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:07,720
Again, this was also reasonable.

1093
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,080
We got the big sampler.

1094
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,820
Let me look up the official name here.

1095
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:18,300
It is the and it was plenty of food for every for all four of us run across America.

1096
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:25,040
It had shrimp, hush puppies, chicken tenders, Bubba's far out dip, chip sauce.

1097
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:27,260
And it was really good.

1098
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:33,040
And it was what you'd expect from that level of restaurant.

1099
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,360
Yeah, I think I have an idea of what it would be like.

1100
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:37,240
Yeah.

1101
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:41,020
And then the kids meals came in boats and little paper boats.

1102
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:43,320
So it was really neat.

1103
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:47,700
Again, if you have kids, the kids stuff in particular was very reasonably priced.

1104
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,520
It helps really balance out the meal.

1105
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,220
The portions were pretty gigantic.

1106
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:58,180
So don't go on anything but an empty stomach because you will get a lot of food.

1107
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:00,420
And it just overall.

1108
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,700
Yeah, just a really, really great time.

1109
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:16,460
And that was the point where my wife and I looked at each other and said, we have to take the kids to the park tomorrow because we thought that by walking around City Walk, they realized there was a giant theme park.

1110
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:18,820
But they didn't because they got too into the water fountain.

1111
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:21,700
So we probably could have let we probably could have went to the hotel and just drove back.

1112
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:25,940
But I think it was my wife and I at that point that were like, yeah, we're in for tomorrow.

1113
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:27,520
We better make sure there's tickets.

1114
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:29,320
Wow.

1115
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:34,700
You like us had a whole world of fun, not even involving the theme park.

1116
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,700
And the main thing is there's a recurring thing with guests of this saga.

1117
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,100
A lot of guests have been having trouble with food and or getting sick.

1118
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:50,240
Yesterday was Eva, who we haven't revealed what happened to her and where yet.

1119
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,120
But there's a real bad pattern forming.

1120
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:58,080
So, Ian, please tell me that you and your family made it through your City Walk experience without our curse.

1121
01:00:58,620 --> 01:00:59,580
Oh, yeah, it was.

1122
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:00,780
Yeah, we were fine.

1123
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:07,420
Yeah, yeah, we we ended up stopping at Turkey Lake back on the way home from the theme park the next day.

1124
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:09,440
Again, we got Dunkin Donuts there.

1125
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,240
It was just every everything went well.

1126
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:19,240
We got to see my brother briefly even before we, you know, before we left Orlando, he came down to Ocala.

1127
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:20,320
It was a great trip.

1128
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:27,760
But really, the the exclamation, the kicking it off at City Walk with the convenient transportation,

1129
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:33,420
just the the nicely priced and good food.

1130
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,060
Yeah, that really set the tone.

1131
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:36,860
Wow.

1132
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:37,280
Wow.

1133
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:39,020
It's well, that's beautiful.

1134
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:46,080
And this this might provide rationale of why this this fact I'm about to say is true.

1135
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,060
And I don't know if everybody realizes this.

1136
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:54,380
Bubba Gump is the only restaurant that is present at every single City Walk across the globe.

1137
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,200
Oh, wow.

1138
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:59,400
The only thing this was a lot of things are a lot of establishments are at three.

1139
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:05,120
But Bubba Gump's the only one which is at Hollywood, Orlando, Osaka and Beijing.

1140
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:13,960
So it's really this is kind of this is our this this restaurant has been our gift to the world, our gift to Asia.

1141
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:18,480
And it has to serve as an ambassador of American culture.

1142
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,940
And it seems like Ian thinks that that is justified.

1143
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:23,480
Yeah, absolutely.

1144
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,420
And I do.

1145
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,840
It did leave me with some regrets, though.

1146
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:29,160
You know, you reflect on your life as you get older.

1147
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:31,680
Like I said, I lived in New York for four years.

1148
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:35,600
I had bad meals at the TGI Fridays in Times Square.

1149
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:39,380
I had bad meals at Hard Rock.

1150
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,800
There Bubba Gump was there the whole time.

1151
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:54,380
I could have just went to Bubba Gump and and save myself the gastroenteritis, you know, the gastropane that came from the other meals and probably save some money, too.

1152
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,980
I mean, you could that's that's something that will haunt you.

1153
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:01,220
But I don't want you to beat yourself up too badly about it.

1154
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:02,580
Just a little bit.

1155
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:03,620
I appreciate that.

1156
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:14,260
It's you know, a lot of it was resolved by good memories going to the Toys R Us across the way in Times Square and and and check checking the wrestling action figures.

1157
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,660
Yeah, those were never on discount, though, were they?

1158
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:17,260
At that point?

1159
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:18,660
Yeah, not in the Times Square.

1160
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,500
Yeah, that was not a discount heavy location.

1161
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,720
No, no, no, they clearanced out the game.

1162
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,140
They clearance out GameCube games, though, right as I got to college.

1163
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:32,320
So I had a big score of a couple of games for four dollars there.

1164
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:33,620
But wow, that's pretty good.

1165
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:34,620
Yeah, something.

1166
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:35,640
All right.

1167
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:39,400
Those are bad memories that outweigh the years of the loss of Bubba Gump.

1168
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:45,180
Well, you know, probably the nice thing would have been to like, you know, go soaring out on this high note of Bubba Gump.

1169
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,600
We do have to address red oven pizza.

1170
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,260
Let's put at least a minute on the clock.

1171
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:51,420
Red oven pizza.

1172
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:54,140
OK, I've been there on two trips and it has been fine.

1173
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:54,980
It's fine.

1174
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:55,800
And you know what?

1175
01:03:55,980 --> 01:04:01,140
Fine is saying a lot given some of the other things that we experienced during this saga.

1176
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:03,380
I've had pizza there, salad there.

1177
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,120
It is fine.

1178
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,140
Jason, agree?

1179
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:07,480
Yeah, I ate a mushroom pizza.

1180
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,880
It's like a larger personal pizza.

1181
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:12,780
I don't know.

1182
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,400
I like 12 inches across.

1183
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,500
I was headed into the airport.

1184
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:21,060
I ate some of it there and then I took some of it with me and ate it at the gate.

1185
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:22,260
Wow.

1186
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:23,500
Oh, you took it through security.

1187
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:24,920
You took a pizza through security.

1188
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,880
Well, it was in like a tiny box at that point.

1189
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:30,960
We might have to bump up the rating.

1190
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:36,080
I find it's my delineation whether or not I pack it in the bag to go through security.

1191
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:37,980
I think that's probably better than fine.

1192
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:46,560
I bet you and Jason have a different scale when it comes to saving food, if it's based on how good it is.

1193
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,260
Well, this was pretty good.

1194
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:55,920
I mean, the Orlando airport is certainly not lacking in culinary options, but I was like, this was good.

1195
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,580
And it was pretty easy on the stomach.

1196
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:02,480
So good for flying because, you know, I have a question.

1197
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,260
This is actually I don't know if I've ever done this.

1198
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:06,740
Do you have you ever taken leftovers on a plane?

1199
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:08,680
Yes.

1200
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:10,760
Did you travel a lot?

1201
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:11,420
I do.

1202
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:18,540
So I've snuck things out of AEW catering and other others have as well.

1203
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:20,700
So I've taken some cookies.

1204
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:26,860
They have these nice boxes because at AEW you could you could be there just to have an interview.

1205
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:30,180
And then you might be able to just sit back and watch the show for the night.

1206
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:31,460
You might be there to have a match.

1207
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,580
It might not be later earlier.

1208
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:39,380
So they have these nice boxes that as they're putting the catering away, they'll kind of give a last call.

1209
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:43,380
You can fill up a box to take back to your room or to hang out, watch the rest of the event.

1210
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:52,000
So when I'm there for dynamite or for anything like that, I will normally fill up a box because I don't know if I'm done.

1211
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,780
But the time for dynamite or if I have to go in for a ring of honor or whatnot.

1212
01:05:55,120 --> 01:06:02,320
So I'll have something and there's good enough desserts where I've snuck that that's not but I've taken the desserts back on.

1213
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:07,020
Checked it through, not checked it through, had it on my carry on, got it through security.

1214
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:13,280
And would this food be accessible if like, I don't know, a friend or podcaster came to visit you?

1215
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:16,120
You shared fond memories of Allentown.

1216
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:22,940
Would that would that particular person maybe be able to also sneak away with a box or two or five?

1217
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:27,080
Could you say, Ian, could you just say like, I need an intern?

1218
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:29,480
It doesn't have to be college age.

1219
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,000
I just need a guy to help me out.

1220
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:38,540
And then he's just going to kind of come with me backstage and have access to all the areas, especially the areas sort of with all the layout, the food and stuff.

1221
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,240
Are we trying to get Jason to smuggle some food out?

1222
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:45,220
Yeah, look, I just saying hypothetically, I don't want to say who specifically.

1223
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:47,760
I'm just saying, is that a possibility?

1224
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:52,130
Sometimes in wrestling, getting stuck in catering, that's a negative connotation.

1225
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:57,240
I'm like begging, like just drop me in catering.

1226
01:06:57,970 --> 01:07:04,920
I also like Jason Sheridan, food smuggler and Indiana Jones type adventure.

1227
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:05,660
That's cool.

1228
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:13,420
With the plane, the plane line going from dot to dot internationally freeing food to its rightful owner, him.

1229
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,100
Smugglers run, Jason Sheridan, smugglers run.

1230
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:23,940
Some of my coolest wrestling memories have been in AEW catering.

1231
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:27,260
That's how I met Ric Flair and talked to Ric Flair.

1232
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:27,800
Whoa.

1233
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:32,840
By the way, is the most amazing smelling person you'll ever meet.

1234
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:34,020
What?

1235
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:41,660
He smells like a it's kind of like a like a fireplace mango.

1236
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:44,740
And it's wonderful.

1237
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,480
And I don't have the nerve.

1238
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:49,400
I didn't have the nerve to ask him, hey, where do you get that cologne?

1239
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:53,080
Because I don't wear cologne, but I'd wear that because it was it was pleasant.

1240
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:54,740
It was welcoming.

1241
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:59,100
But it was also like it had like a it had like a hey, I'm here.

1242
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:00,600
The kind of vibe to it.

1243
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:00,900
So.

1244
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:01,220
Okay.

1245
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:02,100
Yeah.

1246
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:07,800
But, you know, I've gotten to, you know, I've sat and eat, you know, I don't want to drop too many names, but.

1247
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:08,180
Go ahead.

1248
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:09,500
Oh, yeah.

1249
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:13,860
You know, Paul White has become a friend of mine when we've done commentary together, the big show.

1250
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:23,060
And so it's fun to sit and have some more private moments with with folks that otherwise I just kind of work with here and there and just kind of move on.

1251
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:25,420
So, you know, the A.

1252
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:27,340
K.

1253
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:25,700
W.

1254
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,340
room is a fun place to be.

1255
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:30,080
And yeah, I've still I've still a lot of cookies.

1256
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:30,680
I'll be honest.

1257
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:32,260
Let's come clean.

1258
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,020
Yeah, I've still cookies and brownies.

1259
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:35,040
My cheesecake.

1260
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:35,960
Yeah.

1261
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:36,500
Wow.

1262
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:37,380
They got a full.

1263
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,700
They got how many cheesecakes are back there?

1264
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:40,540
Oh, geez.

1265
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:41,800
These are people that can eat a lot.

1266
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:45,660
These are these are very strong people that can consume a lot of calories, I assume.

1267
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:46,520
Absolutely.

1268
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:46,880
Yeah.

1269
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:52,040
You know, they they watch what they eat in a lot of ways.

1270
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:58,000
But in other times, you know, depending on where you are in your diet, you want carbohydrates to make your make you look more vascular.

1271
01:08:58,500 --> 01:08:58,900
So, sure.

1272
01:08:59,240 --> 01:08:59,640
Yeah.

1273
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:02,580
There's a lot of cheese when there's cheesecake.

1274
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:03,880
There's a lot of it.

1275
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:05,860
This is the place to be.

1276
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:06,540
I got to get in there.

1277
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,620
God, I mean, I don't want to brag.

1278
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:09,660
I'm in a web A.

1279
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:10,320
W.

1280
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:11,260
web series.

1281
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,060
I play a dog's agent.

1282
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:14,600
I'm Johnny loves tie.

1283
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:15,720
I want to look at that.

1284
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:16,220
Right.

1285
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:18,060
Well, you haven't plugged that properly.

1286
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:19,320
May as well get me back.

1287
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:20,620
I may as well be back there.

1288
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:21,920
I'm basically on the roster.

1289
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:26,680
Let's let's throw that plug at the at the end to after the just tag that on.

1290
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,840
So, yeah, I know people can find that.

1291
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:29,060
Sure.

1292
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:35,420
But for now, we probably should head to that point, especially because, oh, my God, now the stone is appearing.

1293
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:36,560
There it is.

1294
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:37,200
My God.

1295
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:38,260
It's it's incredible.

1296
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:39,860
Well, this one looks like.

1297
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:40,240
Wait.

1298
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:40,540
OK.

1299
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,620
I think it's OJ Simpson.

1300
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:48,760
But he's wearing an Ed Hardy shirt and light up flashing glasses.

1301
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:50,160
Wow.

1302
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:53,900
Well, that may seem so much more fun that way.

1303
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:54,500
Wow.

1304
01:09:54,600 --> 01:10:01,160
What a great tribute to the great time that you had in and in Rick Bani.

1305
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:01,560
Oh, my God.

1306
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:06,080
You survived podcast, the ride, the city walker, Orlando Saga, multiverse of madness.

1307
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:07,900
Let's exit through the plug portal.

1308
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:09,300
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

1309
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:14,800
Yeah, Mike mentioned Johnny TV, who was recently on Ring of Honor.

1310
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:16,660
He's been on a W's been on Ring of Honor.

1311
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:19,500
He recently won custody of Dalton Castle's boys.

1312
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:23,860
It was one of the most heartbreaking moments that we've ever seen in Ring of Honor history.

1313
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:28,580
So we have a big, huge event called Supercard of Honor.

1314
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,660
It's on April the 5th.

1315
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:31,940
It's at the Leah Kora Center.

1316
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:33,200
It's going to be that Friday night.

1317
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:34,780
There's a big weekend that weekend.

1318
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:36,540
And we're a part of it.

1319
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:38,680
It's on Temple University's campus.

1320
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,180
Tickets are moving real fast.

1321
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:44,520
Mike, you were you were able to come to last year's version in Hollywood.

1322
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:45,960
Oh, yeah.

1323
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:46,540
Yeah.

1324
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,000
Yeah.

1325
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,100
So this year, tickets are moving just as fast.

1326
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,240
So if you go to our R.

1327
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:53,340
X.

1328
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:51,440
O.

1329
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:51,600
H.

1330
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:51,700
T.

1331
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:51,840
I.

1332
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,340
dot com, you can get your tickets there.

1333
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:59,580
And I have a feeling that Johnny TV is not going to be let off the hook and that Mr.

1334
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:03,840
Castle might, you know, be willing to try and punch his face in again.

1335
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:05,660
Seems likely.

1336
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:14,700
And any details released about the catering, the catering situation back there?

1337
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:16,740
What's the access going to be like?

1338
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,240
What's the cheesecake scenario?

1339
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:19,620
Yeah.

1340
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:21,060
Strawberries on the top of the cheesecake.

1341
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:21,700
Oh, yeah.

1342
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:22,300
For the strawberry boys.

1343
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:23,860
Yeah, we've had that.

1344
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:24,800
Yeah.

1345
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:25,340
Yeah.

1346
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:26,640
So.

1347
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:27,260
Hell yes.

1348
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,560
Just to screw Jason, I'm doing the internship.

1349
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:31,680
All right.

1350
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:33,300
Boy, I had the idea.

1351
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:34,260
That's my idea.

1352
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:38,620
It's going to be it's going to be a blast, though.

1353
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:43,880
And then, yeah, every Thursday, myself, Caprice Coleman, where the voices of Ring of Honor, I pop up on A.

1354
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:44,080
W.

1355
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,240
from time to time.

1356
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:51,460
Little Matt Excalibur, he beat me again in the Wrestling Observer Newsletter voting for announcer of the year.

1357
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:56,020
But but that's all in good fun until I steal his mask and then he won't be able to do it anymore.

1358
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,280
That's right.

1359
01:11:57,620 --> 01:11:59,180
I'm coming for you Excalibur.

1360
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:07,480
But yeah, we're but we have a blast and I hope everyone can join us on for Supercard of Honor.

1361
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:08,540
It's going to be live on Honor Club.

1362
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:10,920
So if you got the Honor Club subscription, it's only nine ninety nine.

1363
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,200
It's yeah, it's one of our biggest events of the year.

1364
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:14,940
It's fantastic.

1365
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:17,680
Well, yeah, that that sounds great.

1366

And so glad you could join us for this.

1367
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:25,080
Somebody with some true city walk affection and nostalgia and recent memories seeming like the best ones.

1368
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:25,960
That's great.

1369
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,040
And I'm happy we didn't make your family sick.

1370

1376
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:55,280
We'll see where we end up going tomorrow as we head into the I believe the seventh of these.

1377

1379
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,880
But again, what is the Web series, Mike?

1380
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:05,440

YouTube channel.

1384
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:11,980
It's a reality show, reality show.

1385
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:17,320
But I play the dog Johnny and Ty as dogs agents.

1386
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:18,440
Wow.

1387
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:18,880
Show.

1388
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:28,520
So we should put we should put like somehow tie our universe to that universe so that sure the next episode only makes sense if you go watch that.

1389
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:29,440
Oh, that's smart.
