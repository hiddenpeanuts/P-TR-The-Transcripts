1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,720
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,752 --> 00:00:24,992
Hold on, let me...

3
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:28,972
Shove a full protein bar in your mouth?

4
00:00:30,872 --> 00:00:32,372
I'm putting this in.

5
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:38,852
Waiting for you to finish eating a protein bar. You just show- you couldn't have casually like nibbled on it during the show?

6
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,032
I guess that's bad form.

7
00:00:40,132 --> 00:00:49,372
You've got a full mouth. I am putting this in. This is the start of the episode.

8
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:51,852
Podcast the Ride the Second Gate

9
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:55,572
for our very first character meet-and-greet.

10
00:00:55,832 --> 00:00:59,132
Welcome to the character meet-and-greet. Yes.

11
00:00:59,832 --> 00:01:02,432
You know, we talk about

12
00:01:02,432 --> 00:01:08,092
rides for hours and hours, but in the course of doing so, skip, pass, getting to spend

13
00:01:08,092 --> 00:01:11,992
quality time, right, with highly

14
00:01:11,992 --> 00:01:19,092
developed characters and get like really getting to know them and getting to know what they're all about.

15
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:22,512
Consider this if the, you know,

16
00:01:22,692 --> 00:01:28,612
if the main show is a talk show, this is more of the sit-down, the one-on-one.

17
00:01:28,632 --> 00:01:35,372
This is like the very popular out of the gate Alec Baldwin show where he sits down and has a

18
00:01:35,372 --> 00:01:39,372
great in-depth one-on-one conversation with one of his favorite people. Right, yeah.

19
00:01:39,372 --> 00:01:44,212
This is exactly like the Alec Baldwin show. So Alec Baldwin show of podcasts.

20
00:01:44,392 --> 00:01:48,012
Now this is just Alec Baldwin talking to Paul Simon every week, is that correct?

21
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:50,932
Every week it's Alec and Paul.

22
00:01:51,172 --> 00:01:56,112
Lauren's refuse, the people Lauren was willing to relinquish the numbers of.

23
00:01:56,572 --> 00:02:02,312
And in that spirit, every time we do a character meet-and-greet, it will be about botanicus.

24
00:02:02,312 --> 00:02:05,592
Teacher botanicus.

25
00:02:06,012 --> 00:02:07,772
So every time we do a character meet-and-greet, just botanicus.

26
00:02:07,772 --> 00:02:11,052
It seems possible that we just keep doing it.

27
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:16,792
The only thing, only thing preventing this potentially is the lack of meat on the bone.

28
00:02:16,912 --> 00:02:20,652
Yeah, we don't know a lot as you have said.

29
00:02:20,652 --> 00:02:23,132
There is not a lot of

30
00:02:23,132 --> 00:02:27,692
backstory, but as opposed to other barely there

31
00:02:27,692 --> 00:02:32,452
theme park characters who just appear in quick scenes, there's a whole book that delves into.

32
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:35,852
Yes, let's start with just a

33
00:02:35,852 --> 00:02:39,232
brief summing up of both of our histories with botanicus.

34
00:02:39,532 --> 00:02:45,412
Yes, just briefly, some people probably know this and we've talked a little bit about it on the show. Me personally,

35
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:53,092
I became associated with botanicus from doing a show on the internet called Screen Junkies Movie Fights.

36
00:02:53,772 --> 00:02:54,832
Where you know, people.

37
00:02:55,232 --> 00:02:57,812
What ended up happening with Screen Junkies Movie Fights?

38
00:02:58,032 --> 00:03:02,052
Nothing, because it's still going and everything was fine and nothing is going weird or wrong.

39
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,432
And that's so yeah, it's fine. Everything's existing.

40
00:03:04,972 --> 00:03:08,892
Yeah, everything exists. So yeah, everything is great with them.

41
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:15,392
And this is about four years ago, and I don't know. I think, no, I was on a show, it was Nick Monday.

42
00:03:15,392 --> 00:03:23,272
And I and Hal Rudnick and hosted by Dan Murrell at the time. Just the four of us, no one else.

43
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:31,312
We were pitching TV shows based on things we liked. So Monday, of course, said Demolition Man.

44
00:03:31,872 --> 00:03:34,452
And because he loves Demolition Man, he loves Stallone movies.

45
00:03:34,912 --> 00:03:39,672
And I said that I would like a full show based on ET and the ET ride

46
00:03:39,672 --> 00:03:45,372
specifically and that a big part of it, I wanted for a big part of the show would be about

47
00:03:46,072 --> 00:03:50,092
ET's teacher, Botanicus, from the ET Adventure Ride.

48
00:03:50,212 --> 00:03:50,552
Right.

49
00:03:50,852 --> 00:03:55,192
And I signed off, I think the show sang hashtag Botanicus.

50
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:56,472
And it is.

51
00:03:56,752 --> 00:03:59,952
If you had anything to promote, you can promote your own wares.

52
00:04:00,092 --> 00:04:00,672
You can promote it.

53
00:04:01,252 --> 00:04:04,552
I'm assuming this episode is going to be called hashtag Botanicus.

54
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:06,972
Yeah, we might as well. I think we may as well do it.

55
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:07,512
Solid idea.

56
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:13,192
Because people will say, yeah, so it is a thing like that people will say to me,

57
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:15,552
like, which is embarrassing, I guess.

58
00:04:16,592 --> 00:04:17,892
Yeah, I've seen it.

59
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:21,712
Yeah. When we started hanging out, it was almost a guarantee that somewhere

60
00:04:21,712 --> 00:04:23,712
that somebody would say hashtag Botanicus.

61
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:26,492
And then some people, some people would miss what it was.

62
00:04:26,512 --> 00:04:28,392
They just kind of liked the sound of it, I think.

63
00:04:28,392 --> 00:04:32,112
And then some people would like be like, hey, hashtag Botanical or something.

64
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,632
Or like that botanical thing is really funny.

65
00:04:34,632 --> 00:04:36,892
And be like, oh, you know what I'm talking about?

66
00:04:36,932 --> 00:04:38,112
Hashtag Mazebo.

67
00:04:38,372 --> 00:04:39,752
Yeah. So so.

68
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:41,812
And it was kind of I think it probably

69
00:04:42,832 --> 00:04:44,812
you know, you were you were starting to you.

70
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:48,952
You had that platform of the screen junkies thing and that you were starting to like

71
00:04:48,952 --> 00:04:52,392
you were kind of like outing yourself as a big old theme park nerd.

72
00:04:52,412 --> 00:04:55,072
Yeah. And I think probably a lot of people, it seems like from comments

73
00:04:55,072 --> 00:04:59,532
and message boards were endeared to your mentioning of this and the idea.

74
00:04:59,572 --> 00:05:03,832
And like, oh, he's that he's obsessed with this odd little fragment of this ride

75
00:05:03,832 --> 00:05:06,072
that a lot of people forget about.

76
00:05:06,232 --> 00:05:11,592
And this and but long before you had outlets to do nothing but talk about.

77
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:13,332
Jason's taken some of his photos.

78
00:05:13,552 --> 00:05:15,012
Selfie of themselves.

79
00:05:15,852 --> 00:05:17,952
No, I'm listening.

80
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:19,612
At least on the slide.

81
00:05:19,732 --> 00:05:20,052
Hold on.

82
00:05:20,192 --> 00:05:21,092
How are you?

83
00:05:21,092 --> 00:05:23,932
You put it back up and let me take a photo of what it looks like.

84
00:05:24,232 --> 00:05:27,052
No, no, no. You put your phone back up and I'm going to post this.

85
00:05:27,352 --> 00:05:27,952
I'm trying not to.

86
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,092
And this is what it looks like and I'll post it.

87
00:05:30,092 --> 00:05:33,572
And it looks like you're selfieing while we're talking.

88
00:05:33,932 --> 00:05:37,112
Well, I was trying to get all of us talking to post like a follow up to the anniversary.

89
00:05:37,112 --> 00:05:38,292
I think that's a great idea.

90
00:05:38,852 --> 00:05:44,812
Just to the to the naked eye, it appeared that you were like a 15 year old on a roller coaster.

91
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,692
But you had this you had this going.

92
00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:47,752
You had it's fine.

93
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:48,992
Yes, everything is fine.

94
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:49,872
We'll post it.

95
00:05:49,912 --> 00:05:52,152
I'm just going to show I'm just going to show what it looked like.

96
00:05:52,272 --> 00:05:54,052
I am happy with how my selfie came out.

97
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:56,532
We were both too distracted to not.

98
00:05:56,892 --> 00:06:00,332
Because I think we both thought you could see both of our heads going like,

99
00:06:00,572 --> 00:06:01,052
should we ignore that?

100
00:06:01,672 --> 00:06:03,052
Should we ignore that?

101
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:06,672
Because there was like two solid beats, I think, in both of our heads and went,

102
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:09,312
I guess we can ignore whatever he's doing today.

103
00:06:10,352 --> 00:06:13,672
OK, I understand Jason had a run in with a clerk at a 7-Eleven.

104
00:06:13,912 --> 00:06:19,292
All right, let's get this out of the way before Mike could talk about the Z-Bow.

105
00:06:19,652 --> 00:06:21,712
We're in the guy wasn't even there and I just heard about it.

106
00:06:21,752 --> 00:06:24,132
I was trying to buy a protein bar at 7-Eleven.

107
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:30,372
It was on there on on the box attached to the box was a bunch of coupons,

108
00:06:30,712 --> 00:06:35,032
as in like take take the protein bar and then take the coupon with you.

109
00:06:35,032 --> 00:06:37,052
You can use it when you buy the bar.

110
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:42,252
And the guy looked like I paid in in some Eastern European

111
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:44,872
country that doesn't exist anymore as currency.

112
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:49,572
And then a line started to form as he's figuring out he's like someone down.

113
00:06:49,612 --> 00:06:54,732
So that was a great way to come off our Haunted Mansion episode

114
00:06:54,732 --> 00:06:56,152
and roll into this episode.

115
00:06:56,592 --> 00:06:57,412
It was funny.

116
00:06:57,532 --> 00:07:01,632
It was just a funny reveal to me because I was long through the 7-Eleven line.

117
00:07:01,632 --> 00:07:02,592
I was outside.

118
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:04,152
I'm outside and then I watch it.

119
00:07:04,712 --> 00:07:05,872
What's going on?

120
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:09,732
And Jason looks frustrated and then the clerk is like waving around a coupon.

121
00:07:09,872 --> 00:07:10,652
What's going on?

122
00:07:10,852 --> 00:07:12,932
And you can clearly see the text.

123
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:15,092
Seventy five cents off.

124
00:07:15,092 --> 00:07:16,772
Realizing that was the sort of thing.

125
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:20,092
I mean, the prices of those protein bars anyway, go back.

126
00:07:20,532 --> 00:07:22,972
So great that Jason was all doing a coupon for me.

127
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:24,972
You're distracting in a million ways today.

128
00:07:25,032 --> 00:07:26,392
So this is where we're at.

129
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:30,032
This is the level of snipping is now a year in and this is funny.

130
00:07:30,252 --> 00:07:34,032
We tweeted about this, but we did one one year ago

131
00:07:34,072 --> 00:07:37,312
today, the first as we record this, not as you're hearing it,

132
00:07:37,312 --> 00:07:41,192
one year as we record this was the first episode of podcast, The Riot,

133
00:07:41,272 --> 00:07:43,272
which was about the ET adventure.

134
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:46,012
And we chose that partially because of your connection to it

135
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:47,412
and my connection to it as well.

136
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:51,292
And I think it's a nice sign of where we're at now

137
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:56,372
that we feel comfortable enough to ramble and rail about the just,

138
00:07:56,412 --> 00:07:59,892
the single character that we already covered that we're going back for sure.

139
00:07:59,892 --> 00:08:00,672
We only did-

140
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:03,692
We'll overlap material here, I think, but maybe not.

141
00:08:04,532 --> 00:08:05,992
There's a lot of new stuff.

142
00:08:06,392 --> 00:08:10,052
We only did five to 10 minutes about Botanicus before.

143
00:08:10,232 --> 00:08:12,352
I feel like that's the audience craves more.

144
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:13,952
Time standards changed.

145
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,772
Yeah. So just to sum up.

146
00:08:16,072 --> 00:08:20,452
So yeah, I periodically, if I appeared on that show, Movie Fights,

147
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:24,592
on like once or twice a year, I would reference this and I would

148
00:08:24,592 --> 00:08:28,312
pitch another Botanicus show or something and I'll tease for the end.

149
00:08:28,312 --> 00:08:34,872
So remind me if I don't that something I performed on a Movie Fights,

150
00:08:34,992 --> 00:08:38,732
I found on the internet a cover of.

151
00:08:39,832 --> 00:08:47,712
So something I did a year or two ago, I found my, I'll just say a song I wrote

152
00:08:47,712 --> 00:08:52,972
very quickly and to throw off some, a band covered it.

153
00:08:52,972 --> 00:08:53,412
What?

154
00:08:53,772 --> 00:08:56,532
It's on YouTube and it's been, so we'll play it at the end.

155
00:08:56,532 --> 00:08:58,212
We never see that, do you?

156
00:08:58,332 --> 00:08:59,952
No, I've never seen it before.

157
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:03,632
I've just Googled ET Botanicus and up like the seventh,

158
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:09,372
like the seventh result or something, it says Botanicus, won't you love me?

159
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:14,232
And I looked at it and it says Botanicus from the Botanicus solo movie,

160
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:16,632
which I've honestly forgotten what I did.

161
00:09:16,892 --> 00:09:20,892
Like I make this crap up very fast when I'm doing Movie Fights.

162
00:09:20,972 --> 00:09:27,352
So I, he wrote, there's a link to the original song of my appearance and then it says,

163
00:09:27,512 --> 00:09:29,672
Just a goof song by Mike Carlson.

164
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:30,332
Whoa.

165
00:09:30,632 --> 00:09:33,392
And it's been viewed 265 times.

166
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:36,192
But you've been covered, that's amazing.

167
00:09:36,472 --> 00:09:41,532
That after, like there were some nice covers of your composition, the City Walk.

168
00:09:41,532 --> 00:09:46,192
Yeah, that was crazy and I was not expecting that and that was very lovely and thank you

169
00:09:46,192 --> 00:09:47,232
everyone who did that.

170
00:09:47,692 --> 00:09:49,052
Off covered artists.

171
00:09:49,052 --> 00:09:53,132
But those people made it a show, people were like, here, look what I did.

172
00:09:53,332 --> 00:09:54,592
This, this is just sitting here.

173
00:09:54,712 --> 00:09:56,572
No one tweeted this at me.

174
00:09:57,272 --> 00:10:00,492
Well, there wasn't yet a great hub for Mike Carlson fandom,

175
00:10:00,692 --> 00:10:03,492
which we're now deep within here in the second gate.

176
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:07,612
So yeah, that's a little bit about me and hashtag Botanicus.

177
00:10:07,652 --> 00:10:11,092
And then of course on the City Walk episode with your wife, Erin,

178
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:15,732
we delved into your personal relationship and the tragedy of Botanicus.

179
00:10:15,732 --> 00:10:23,472
You may have heard if we, if you heard that episode, but yeah, the first that my wife,

180
00:10:23,592 --> 00:10:29,212
my now wife and I hung out in what became us dating and having a relationship,

181
00:10:29,532 --> 00:10:34,252
she came to take my Universal tour and I was like, how can I spice this up for these guys

182
00:10:34,252 --> 00:10:36,552
and my other friends who I was excited were there?

183
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:39,292
Why don't I go show them something that I got to see backstage,

184
00:10:39,332 --> 00:10:43,432
which was the rotting corpse of the Botanicus robot.

185
00:10:44,252 --> 00:10:45,292
Missing its skin.

186
00:10:45,492 --> 00:10:51,732
If you're listening, you may now have seen the photo where like, you know, skull eyes,

187
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:59,452
robotic innards and the big platform that he's on, but everything else is not present.

188
00:10:59,652 --> 00:11:00,332
I think there was another one.

189
00:11:00,332 --> 00:11:04,232
There was another one of ET's friends, like mushroom guy also in a similar state.

190
00:11:04,652 --> 00:11:09,032
And I, you know, I also, first of all, before showing Erin this,

191
00:11:09,532 --> 00:11:13,412
getting to like walking around the corner with a couple of tour guide friends.

192
00:11:13,432 --> 00:11:18,212
And being given no warning and like the exact dream of what you would want to find.

193
00:11:18,272 --> 00:11:20,852
If I were to go, you would say, if I went backstage Disneyland,

194
00:11:20,952 --> 00:11:23,552
I'd want to see like a bunch of Lincoln's all in a pile.

195
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:26,972
A mass grave of Lincoln's.

196
00:11:27,012 --> 00:11:29,952
Unclothed, just like body parts all splayed out.

197
00:11:30,132 --> 00:11:32,372
And that was backstage at this place.

198
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,532
We joked about this when we went backstage at Knott's.

199
00:11:35,652 --> 00:11:40,112
You got very excited for dilapidated dusty rapids rides.

200
00:11:40,552 --> 00:11:42,272
Yeah, I was dragging and then seeing,

201
00:11:42,272 --> 00:11:46,152
yeah, three rapid cars sitting around.

202
00:11:47,152 --> 00:11:47,892
Yeah, I don't know.

203
00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:50,632
You want it to be, you want the backstage theme parks to be like

204
00:11:50,632 --> 00:11:55,032
that really cool ad from a couple of years ago for the Main Street Religious Parade

205
00:11:55,032 --> 00:11:59,312
where it's this magic warehouse where everybody where Rex lights up and makes a sound

206
00:11:59,312 --> 00:12:00,752
and the monster roars.

207
00:12:00,932 --> 00:12:05,312
And that was a rare case of that, except that Botanica is not in pristine condition.

208
00:12:05,312 --> 00:12:09,512
It's rotting out there, but he was this, it was this like

209
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:16,292
centerpiece to what became the primary relationship in my life.

210
00:12:16,532 --> 00:12:19,872
And I think like, I mean, you and I started hanging out, Mike,

211
00:12:20,612 --> 00:12:24,292
from mutual theme park fandom, but I think I'm sure that I remember the

212
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:28,852
Botanicus thing being on my radar and like, no kidding, but he's a big Botanicus guy.

213
00:12:29,412 --> 00:12:34,992
So it's like, so Botanicus is a spirit of benevolence who brings people together.

214
00:12:35,452 --> 00:12:41,392
If you knew Botanicus, there you're in a certain level of weirdo nerd.

215
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:47,272
Yeah. And to me, it's like everything that all of this stuff is about, like not to be too

216
00:12:47,272 --> 00:12:50,492
pretentious about it, but then I feel like it's like the level is why I'm glad we started with

217
00:12:50,492 --> 00:12:52,072
that episode of the podcast.

218
00:12:52,312 --> 00:12:59,252
Like the taking a little shred of mythology and taking it extremely seriously, perhaps

219
00:12:59,252 --> 00:13:03,392
more seriously than the people who actually made the for sure more seriously.

220
00:13:03,392 --> 00:13:07,612
That's part of what's funny to me about Botanicus or anything like this is like it's there and it's

221
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:12,292
alluded to, but it's not really, it's not really explained super well.

222
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:19,712
It's a little bit rushed past and you know that what it results in for 95% of the guests on the

223
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:23,772
ride, they end up leaving the thing and going like, oh, that was cool.

224
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:29,792
And we saw the old ET, like nobody, and we're the only psychopaths who recall and like, no,

225
00:13:29,812 --> 00:13:31,752
we have to think about this for longer.

226
00:13:31,832 --> 00:13:33,152
What is he? Who is he?

227
00:13:33,152 --> 00:13:33,832
And why?

228
00:13:34,132 --> 00:13:38,872
Millions of people wrote ET and it's gotta be-

229
00:13:38,872 --> 00:13:40,592
They know Botanicus, but they don't know him.

230
00:13:40,592 --> 00:13:43,652
They don't know him, but they also just don't know his name.

231
00:13:43,932 --> 00:13:44,052
Yeah.

232
00:13:44,052 --> 00:13:49,612
And it's like, it is funny to me that millions of people have seen it and it has a name, but

233
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:54,532
there's, what do we think in the world, the amount of people that know the name Botanicus?

234
00:13:55,272 --> 00:13:59,032
It can't be a lot because I was looking up hashtag Botanicus, I was looking it up on

235
00:13:59,032 --> 00:14:01,332
Twitter and a lot of it's related to you and before-

236
00:14:01,332 --> 00:14:02,872
And it hasn't happened as much lately.

237
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:10,352
Sure, sure. But before you were popularizing this was, yeah, you're one of the Google image

238
00:14:10,352 --> 00:14:11,772
results is-

239
00:14:11,772 --> 00:14:11,912
Yes.

240
00:14:12,312 --> 00:14:17,452
Based on you. There's very little to go off of. So a number of people who know,

241
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:19,132
who think about, I don't know, 10,000?

242
00:14:19,232 --> 00:14:22,152
I was going to say it's gotta be like 10, 20 at the most maybe.

243
00:14:22,432 --> 00:14:27,212
I remembered him as like a kid, like if not the first ride I would have written at,

244
00:14:27,212 --> 00:14:32,732
like my family went down to Universal when we were in Orlando, like 91, 92,

245
00:14:33,192 --> 00:14:37,692
and that probably would have been like the main, that and back to the future were the

246
00:14:37,692 --> 00:14:39,212
main things I remember riding.

247
00:14:39,772 --> 00:14:45,112
So did you as a kid recall the name Botanicus or were you more like the old ET?

248
00:14:45,312 --> 00:14:47,052
Didn't go on until I was a little older.

249
00:14:47,132 --> 00:14:47,512
Oh, okay.

250
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:51,732
Didn't go on as a kid. So yeah, so, and even the first time though I went on ET,

251
00:14:52,212 --> 00:14:57,192
did not know the name Botanicus. I think I was only when I started getting way into it

252
00:14:57,192 --> 00:15:01,372
in the last 10 years when I was reading about stuff and I went, his name is Botanicus?

253
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:02,712
Like, huh?

254
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:08,912
And it's really, it's really something and you, and what it does is like open up this whole,

255
00:15:09,712 --> 00:15:12,752
where I, I don't want to go out of order. I mean, we should stay focused on the ride,

256
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:20,972
but Botanicus is like the key that unlocks the expanded ET universe, which only exists in this

257
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:25,612
one, in this other book and has never been included in a film and is not really present

258
00:15:25,612 --> 00:15:28,272
in the main movie ET, The Extraterrestrial.

259
00:15:28,312 --> 00:15:29,652
No, there's no hint.

260
00:15:29,692 --> 00:15:30,132
No.

261
00:15:30,352 --> 00:15:34,732
Of any of this, which of course means it was all created after and it was an afterthought.

262
00:15:34,912 --> 00:15:40,592
And probably in the efforts to capitalize on stuff like, I mean, from what I can tell,

263
00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:48,572
obviously ET, the film, giant blockbuster when it came out, the soundtrack,

264
00:15:48,892 --> 00:15:50,352
John Wayne soundtrack, massive deal.

265
00:15:50,852 --> 00:15:52,612
T-shirts, stuffed ETs.

266
00:15:52,612 --> 00:16:00,132
The Michael Jackson narrated record of the ET story of a huge deal.

267
00:16:00,452 --> 00:16:00,552
What?

268
00:16:00,552 --> 00:16:06,292
So the single film, yeah. This is, this is like a bit, this sold a lot. This was a huge deal.

269
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:09,712
Oh, I had no idea. I just, I feel like I just thought, oh, that's a picture.

270
00:16:10,072 --> 00:16:14,892
Like I can picture the picture of them, but isn't that for reading? Does it say like read on it?

271
00:16:14,992 --> 00:16:17,932
Did they make that picture of the two of them? Like a library photo?

272
00:16:17,952 --> 00:16:22,592
I think from that session, but no, there's a whole, yeah, there's a record of him

273
00:16:22,612 --> 00:16:27,812
telling the story of ET. I have to be honest, I've never listened to it. I have it. I've never

274
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:30,552
listened to it. So maybe that would have been good prep for this.

275
00:16:31,052 --> 00:16:38,452
Sure. Is this song, is the song on it? The one where ET like, like has a little talk in the middle

276
00:16:38,452 --> 00:16:41,812
or like either there's an interlude. What do you mean? I don't know. There's a song,

277
00:16:41,912 --> 00:16:45,752
I'm like, oh man, this is stuff we really, there's actually a lot more than I thought there would be,

278
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:51,532
but there's a Michael Jackson song with ET like appears on the song.

279
00:16:51,532 --> 00:16:51,952
What?

280
00:16:51,952 --> 00:16:56,392
He doesn't sing, but he has like a, I always, my sister and I would always be like joking that

281
00:16:56,392 --> 00:17:01,872
he was like, thank you, Michael in the middle of the song, but it's not, let me find it here.

282
00:17:01,872 --> 00:17:10,032
I'll cut this out. Probably ET song. It's a, and somewhere, someone in the dark.

283
00:17:10,812 --> 00:17:16,712
Oh, that's from, okay. I know that it's not on that album released later as a thriller,

284
00:17:19,232 --> 00:17:26,052
bonus track. But I actually don't, I don't know. I shouldn't have read it, but the, but like the,

285
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:31,452
the point is clearly they were thinking this is a, this is a big franchise that we've had multiple

286
00:17:31,452 --> 00:17:38,492
like take home items and records and bits. So like we have to keep this going and which is where we

287
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:44,912
end up with this book. Yeah. And they did it in such a lazy way too, cause there's like talk of

288
00:17:44,912 --> 00:17:49,092
a second movie too, we can talk about, which has, does not have botanicals anywhere in any story

289
00:17:49,092 --> 00:17:54,132
treatments. It's mostly on earth and it's bizarre and dark and it's called nocturnal fears and it's

290
00:17:54,132 --> 00:17:58,552
readily available to see the actual story, like outline or proposal. Jason, you want to look at

291
00:17:58,552 --> 00:18:07,592
this book? Maybe we don't get into the book yet. Or should we talk about how he is like what we

292
00:18:07,592 --> 00:18:13,152
see him doing in the ride? Okay. Yeah, that's good. We can start with that. But just for full

293
00:18:13,152 --> 00:18:17,952
setting the scene in context. Cause it really, even though the ride comes after the book,

294
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:23,792
but your first, most people's first introduction to him is on, is on the ride. Yeah. So let's say

295
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:31,112
through the presence of specifically botanicus within this attraction, the first that you hear

296
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:37,392
of him is when Steven Spielberg himself is giving you a warning and giving you essentially your

297
00:18:37,752 --> 00:18:43,652
permission for what you have to do during the ride. The first time around was him saying,

298
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:47,452
you're going to be in a movie and this is what's happening. Then it became you, you have to actually

299
00:18:47,452 --> 00:18:56,872
have to save VT. So he explains that ET is in trouble. Scientists are after him, but it's even

300
00:18:56,872 --> 00:19:01,512
worse on the green planet, which is where he is from. There's maybe something you don't know in

301
00:19:01,532 --> 00:19:06,132
film. Do you, is the green planet named? I don't think the green planet is named.

302
00:19:06,632 --> 00:19:10,932
Yeah. And it has many names too. It's other prominent name is Brodo Ezoge.

303
00:19:11,512 --> 00:19:17,732
And that makes the ET race Brodo Ezogeans. Yes, exactly. Yeah. So that's what, if you're

304
00:19:17,732 --> 00:19:23,352
wondering what ET is, they are not ET's, they are Brodo Ezogeans. They just kept hitting it out of

305
00:19:23,352 --> 00:19:32,792
park when it came to ET stuff. Clean, simple mythology. So the green planet is dying. You

306
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:42,532
look at a very terrifying early CGI depiction of a planet just being stripped of its color.

307
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:50,172
What's going to happen to our planet of earth in apparently 20 years. We should learn,

308
00:19:50,352 --> 00:19:54,872
we should read, maybe the book of the green planet has the clues that we need to deal with our own

309
00:19:54,872 --> 00:20:00,192
crisis. I think that's true. Everyone does. It's very important that everyone read this book. So

310
00:20:00,192 --> 00:20:09,132
the green planet is dying. Only ET's healing touch can save it. And ET's teacher Botanicus.

311
00:20:09,152 --> 00:20:16,412
Botanicus, as Steven still very stultedly says. ET's teacher Botanicus. And that's really what

312
00:20:16,412 --> 00:20:23,432
it's all about because you were hearing the director of the real movie ET say this word

313
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:30,772
with something between unfamiliarity and boredom all the way up to potential disdain. I don't think

314
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:36,912
Spielberg ever signed off on the concept. Maybe he signed off on it. I don't think Botanicus is his

315
00:20:36,912 --> 00:20:41,192
idea. I don't think it was the idea of the screenwriter of the movie. This is the question

316
00:20:41,192 --> 00:20:47,892
that I should have done this months ago, years ago. I did email William Cotswinkle,

317
00:20:48,352 --> 00:20:53,392
the book, the guy who wrote the book, his blog. There's no response yet. So if something for some

318
00:20:53,392 --> 00:20:59,152
reason comes up and he wants to answer an insane question, we'll add an addendum to this episode.

319
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:05,232
And if there's no addendum, just assume he never emailed back. But yes, it's unclear who is actually

320
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:10,932
Botanicus' creator because it says based on a story by Steven Spielberg, but that could just mean

321
00:21:10,932 --> 00:21:20,012
he gets the credit and those sweet book publishing dollars that come in. Who knows, really? Or it is

322
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:24,272
possible. Steven was like, well, of course ET heals things. So of course his whole planet is just

323
00:21:24,272 --> 00:21:33,192
his vegetation. Maybe he just shit something out. And this guy, William, just came up with Botanicus

324
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:40,072
because it's a botanical. It's very lazy. It's not particularly interesting. I mean, I disagree.

325
00:21:40,072 --> 00:21:44,472
That actually is a better, there's some shitty names in this book. And Botanicus is actually one

326
00:21:44,472 --> 00:21:48,912
of the better ones. But it's funny. It's based on a word from Earth for sure. Yeah, of course.

327
00:21:49,092 --> 00:21:53,172
Whereas everything else is named the flop, gloppel and teakley and all of these things.

328
00:21:53,172 --> 00:21:58,392
Yes. And like Orbitron, I think is the mushroom man. Orb-a-don. Orb-a-don. Oh, that's right.

329
00:21:58,412 --> 00:22:04,112
Confusingly similar to Orbitron, which is a Disney, Disneyland thing. And which is the one that screams?

330
00:22:05,212 --> 00:22:13,972
That's Magdol. Magdol, yeah. No fan of Magdol. So Botanicus is a good name. I apologize to Botanicus.

331
00:22:14,012 --> 00:22:19,312
But it's funny also that Spielberg says it wrong or not. Or just kind of odd. I don't know. Like

332
00:22:19,312 --> 00:22:24,292
not confidently in the pronunciation of it. Because I was always just botanical, botanicus.

333
00:22:24,412 --> 00:22:29,852
And he goes botanical. Like a sheep or a baa. Like if someone says chaperoon.

334
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:36,372
Sure. Someone says something very strange. That's something you said on the show. Yeah.

335
00:22:36,412 --> 00:22:41,332
We haven't. Maybe there are people that are just listening to the Patreon episodes

336
00:22:41,332 --> 00:22:45,132
and they don't know that you said that on the main show. That is true. Yeah. Well,

337
00:22:45,132 --> 00:22:49,352
because it was in the middle of the City Walk Sock Us. So they may have tapped out for that

338
00:22:49,352 --> 00:22:53,932
extra content and they tapped back in for this extra content. I think the legend of Jason's

339
00:22:54,252 --> 00:22:59,872
chaperoon looms large. I think everyone knows. Chaperone mixed with a macaroon.

340
00:23:00,572 --> 00:23:06,672
I love a macaroon. That would be a good character for the E.T. ride. Like a

341
00:23:06,672 --> 00:23:13,412
chaperone that's also a macaroon. A little. Same chaperoon. You must save chaperoon.

342
00:23:14,772 --> 00:23:18,032
He's friends. Chaperoon. Chaperoon. Bouguette de Peppo.

343
00:23:18,752 --> 00:23:24,612
Bouguette de Peppo. Jason's mispronunciations are also a good E.T. character. They all fit right

344
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:28,012
next to each other. And then one of my favorite E.T. characters. Oh, sorry. Can I say one thing?

345
00:23:28,392 --> 00:23:33,932
Yeah. Also, in addition to Spielberg saying it kind of odd, if you want, it's still, this ride

346
00:23:33,932 --> 00:23:38,772
is still there in Florida and it's kind of permanently closed captioned. And so the words

347
00:23:38,772 --> 00:23:43,852
of everything Spielberg is saying are on the screen and it's spelled botanicus with two T's.

348
00:23:43,852 --> 00:23:48,792
Yes. Right, right, right. Yeah. So even so, no, Spielberg doesn't know how to say it. The closed

349
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:54,792
captioners don't know how to spell it. It's all, this is such a clumsy mythology and it's all

350
00:23:54,792 --> 00:24:01,692
based on not the film, but a book that no one, no theme park goer can write.

351
00:24:02,632 --> 00:24:06,712
Here's a secret about closed caption. I used to work at a post-production house.

352
00:24:07,152 --> 00:24:12,572
Closed caption files would show up well into the 2010s on floppy disks.

353
00:24:12,972 --> 00:24:19,672
They would just show up and everyone and when they were needed, it was very important.

354
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:24,132
But a lot of times they're just like, enter it in the system, throw it in the box. Like people

355
00:24:24,132 --> 00:24:30,172
are annoyed by it. And eventually the company transitioned to, oh, they're just going to email

356
00:24:30,172 --> 00:24:36,052
it to us because dot cc file are so tiny, like tiny, tiny, like, yeah, what do you have to

357
00:24:36,052 --> 00:24:40,992
transport them physically? It's tech with some sort of, but it was just like, yeah, that it,

358
00:24:41,212 --> 00:24:47,392
they arrived and that people were immediately annoyed by the, like, this is, this is really

359
00:24:47,392 --> 00:24:53,612
important for the people who need these to enjoy entertainment. Like probably wouldn't be jazzed

360
00:24:53,612 --> 00:24:59,552
that everyone's so annoyed by the cc disks. Right. And there are people that they can't

361
00:24:59,552 --> 00:25:04,072
hear very well that now spell botanic is the wrong way. Oh, God. That's a tragedy.

362
00:25:04,592 --> 00:25:07,072
You must correct them. That's the public service we're providing. Yeah. I'm sorry.

363
00:25:07,212 --> 00:25:10,732
Wait. I didn't have something years ago. What was I saying? I don't even remember. Oh,

364
00:25:10,732 --> 00:25:16,512
my favorite. I don't think this is not created in the same time, but my favorite et character,

365
00:25:16,712 --> 00:25:23,472
maybe the other than botanic is an et is in attack. No, no, it's in a revenge of the Sith.

366
00:25:23,992 --> 00:25:31,472
Oh yes. The Senator, Senator greeble, greeble, which is Spielberg spelled backwards. Yeah.

367
00:25:31,472 --> 00:25:37,352
And it's not Spielberg himself. No, it's not like when George Lucas is in makeup in one of those,

368
00:25:37,392 --> 00:25:43,972
no, it's just an et. They cut to like a Senate hearing thing and there's a like a group of ets

369
00:25:43,972 --> 00:25:51,932
there, a group of ag bar. Yeah. Ignacians. What are they? Brotozogean. Brotozogean. But I didn't

370
00:25:51,932 --> 00:25:57,932
read. I think maybe we talked a little bit about this, but I didn't realize the voting record of

371
00:25:57,932 --> 00:26:05,612
Senator greeble. Wait, wait, wait. Can you run by me? There's just a shot of a bunch of ets.

372
00:26:05,612 --> 00:26:09,652
Two or three ets on one of the little pods in the Imperial Senate in revenge of the Sith.

373
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:15,452
How did they square that? Okay. What are you upset about? I'm just confused. I didn't,

374
00:26:15,652 --> 00:26:22,992
I don't know. It seems legally dicey. In 32 BBY, Queen Amidala of Naboo called for a vote of no

375
00:26:22,992 --> 00:26:29,272
confidence in Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum. Greeblebs and his delegation were present,

376
00:26:29,312 --> 00:26:33,952
joining the fracas that ensued throughout the grand convocation chamber. Shortly before the

377
00:26:33,952 --> 00:26:39,492
wars, Greeblebs funded an extra galactic survey. As the war neared its end, he became part of

378
00:26:39,492 --> 00:26:45,612
delegation of 2000 legislators who filed a formal protest against Valorum's successor, Palpatine,

379
00:26:45,852 --> 00:26:49,832
for actions they perceived as unconstitutional. When Palpatine turned the Republic into the

380
00:26:49,832 --> 00:26:55,472
galactic empire, Greeblebs was arrested by Imperial intelligence on charges of conspiracy

381
00:26:55,472 --> 00:27:03,932
and treason for plotting with the Jedi order to remove Palpatine from office. So Greeblebs is a

382
00:27:04,112 --> 00:27:09,852
great resistance. Yes. Wow. So I think Greeblebs should be in some of these new Star Wars movies.

383
00:27:10,252 --> 00:27:19,172
Yeah. And Senator Greeblebs persisted. Greeblebs was, he was no, he was not some interstellar Jeff

384
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:25,292
Flake. No. He was on the right side of things. Yeah. Oh man. And the next one, you know, Ray and

385
00:27:25,292 --> 00:27:30,772
Finn and the Luke's force ghost are just standing around and you just hear like, I think I can help.

386
00:27:30,832 --> 00:27:34,852
It's just, and they go Senator Greeblebs.

387
00:27:36,052 --> 00:27:46,592
Another one of JJ's puzzle boxes or whatever the fuck he calls it. Greeblebs is spelled G-R-E-B-L-E-I-B-S.

388
00:27:46,812 --> 00:27:50,832
So just in case, cause Scott is pronouncing a little different than I am. I'm not exactly sure.

389
00:27:51,012 --> 00:27:58,392
I have no, I just took a swing at it. Greeblebs. When Senator Greeblebs died, was there a lot of

390
00:27:58,452 --> 00:28:01,932
back and forth? Some people were like, well, they don't make them like Senator Greeblebs anymore.

391
00:28:01,952 --> 00:28:07,372
And other people were like, yeah, but he wasn't a real. Senator Greeblebs was a maverick though.

392
00:28:08,212 --> 00:28:14,332
A lot of people don't know that about him. I mean, standing up to Palpatine. Yes. Yeah. Very much so.

393
00:28:14,852 --> 00:28:21,372
And Greeblebs' daughter is an excellent talk show. She's on the Intergalactic View. Megan Greeblebs.

394
00:28:24,692 --> 00:28:30,652
So, all right. So then you get, all right. So Spielberg mentions, that's really the only time

395
00:28:30,652 --> 00:28:37,892
you hear the name Botanicus. Then you go into the line. And this is a crazy, this is for sure one of

396
00:28:37,892 --> 00:28:43,452
the things that makes the ET adventure great. I mean, the line is so amazing in general,

397
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:47,612
and we talked all about it in our first episode. You can go back to that. But the, you know,

398
00:28:47,612 --> 00:28:53,212
the smell and the forest and the sounds and the, the speak and spell, it's an incredible mood in

399
00:28:53,212 --> 00:28:59,252
there. But the biggest thing that happens in the line is that out of nowhere from the ground,

400
00:28:59,812 --> 00:29:08,052
Botanicus springs forth in essentially like a laser rave scenario. There is smoke and there is like,

401
00:29:08,612 --> 00:29:13,372
it's very like 90s, like the laser show that would come to your elementary school or that kind of

402
00:29:13,372 --> 00:29:21,312
thing. It's very like laserium. And he rises up and he delivers a message, which I have the script

403
00:29:21,312 --> 00:29:28,072
of. I don't need to like, I need to read it all. But, you know, just essentially, but I like the

404
00:29:28,072 --> 00:29:37,492
style. Earth people, Earth people, our planet is dying. Find the one you call ET. Bring him home

405
00:29:37,492 --> 00:29:46,732
to the green planet. His friend Teakley needs the healing touch. Hide ET from the scientists who

406
00:29:46,732 --> 00:29:54,752
seek him. Bring him on a spaceship or carry him on your bikes. And then ending with ET, help us.

407
00:29:56,092 --> 00:30:04,552
So I didn't, that Teakley is mentioned in the book. In the book too. I believe, yeah. In case you

408
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:09,132
know, they, they made this a lot more clear in a later, the, when they remade the video with

409
00:30:09,132 --> 00:30:14,252
Spielberg, but he says, here, remember what ET's friends look like. So you can find them when you

410
00:30:14,252 --> 00:30:23,112
get to the green planet. And those are, that's Teakley, Orbanon and Magdol. And, but also,

411
00:30:23,432 --> 00:30:28,692
why Teakley then, I didn't realize that the Teakley is pulled out specifically and is in

412
00:30:28,712 --> 00:30:34,612
Botanicus' dialogue. So you were like tasked specifically with remember Teak, go find Teakley.

413
00:30:34,952 --> 00:30:39,952
Yeah. That's, you have to carry that into the ride with you. And we were saying 95% of people

414
00:30:39,952 --> 00:30:45,432
don't remember Botanicus. Within, we don't even know that Botanicus says go find Teakley. Right.

415
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:49,552
I forgot. Yeah. I didn't know that. And his voice is like hard. It's echoey. It's hard to hear.

416
00:30:49,632 --> 00:30:56,132
And he doesn't sound like an ET. No. He doesn't sound like, also, by the way, ET's name is Zrek.

417
00:30:57,132 --> 00:31:03,652
Zrek. His name is Z-R-E-K. Z-R-E-K. Uh huh. Zrek. Why are you texting? What are you doing over there?

418
00:31:03,672 --> 00:31:09,852
I'm looking up Teakley. I wanted to get a picture of Teakley. I'm always fiddling with you.

419
00:31:09,972 --> 00:31:12,972
That exact argument was probably had between Jason's parents and,

420
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:17,152
like, why aren't you doing your homework? I'm learning about Teakley.

421
00:31:18,052 --> 00:31:24,712
My friend Teakley. Yeah. So, so he sounds, Botanicus sounds different than ET. Yeah, why is that?

422
00:31:24,732 --> 00:31:31,572
ET is out. He barely speaks English. Botanicus is fluent in English. Yeah. He sounds like Splinter,

423
00:31:31,852 --> 00:31:35,752
Master Splinter or something. Yeah. But even more so, even Splinter is a little broken English,

424
00:31:35,792 --> 00:31:40,372
a little bit. That's true. Yeah. And Botanicus is like. Botanicus is like a scholar of the English

425
00:31:40,372 --> 00:31:48,272
language. Yeah. Another question I have is why is Botanicus on earth? That is a very good question

426
00:31:48,272 --> 00:31:52,692
because he appears to you. He disappears to you in a puff of smoke. So I don't know if, I think

427
00:31:52,692 --> 00:32:00,192
they're trying to act like it's a projection. Now, if you read this book, ET, The Green Planet by

428
00:32:00,192 --> 00:32:08,672
William Kotzwinkl, ET, like force projects himself constantly onto earth. Oh. So maybe

429
00:32:08,672 --> 00:32:13,572
that is what Botanicus does because he does disappear and reappear in a puff of smoke.

430
00:32:13,592 --> 00:32:17,732
There's no question about it. So I think that's gotta be what it is because if Botanicus was on

431
00:32:17,732 --> 00:32:22,412
earth, you would just go get him, I think. Yeah. You would think. Yeah. If he got there, you can get

432
00:32:22,552 --> 00:32:28,532
ET. Right. Yeah. And he probably has the sense, or unless we do. In this thing, do we all have the

433
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:36,732
Elliot ET connection? Like, we know where he is and can feel what he's feeling. But

434
00:32:36,732 --> 00:32:41,312
instead of Elliot, I think that might be the, that might be right. Everyone in that line has the

435
00:32:41,312 --> 00:32:47,512
special connection. Has the special thing. Yeah. And just so I'm clear, when he tells you find ET,

436
00:32:47,692 --> 00:32:52,092
that's when he shows up at the start of the ride or in the line. That's in the line.

437
00:32:52,092 --> 00:32:55,912
That's in the line. Yeah. Cause there was controversy cause they took him out for a while.

438
00:32:55,992 --> 00:33:00,412
And the last time we went to ET, we were walking through the line and I went, did I miss him?

439
00:33:00,572 --> 00:33:03,612
Where's my friend? Where's my friend? Cause I was going to like, I'm gonna take a picture. It's

440
00:33:03,612 --> 00:33:08,552
gonna blow up on the social media. And I was like you with the selfies earlier. I was going to be

441
00:33:08,552 --> 00:33:11,592
like, this is going to be, this is a good picture. It can be a good picture of me, good angle with me

442
00:33:11,592 --> 00:33:15,052
and Botanicus. And then it was not there. And I was like, what the hell? And then I looked at

443
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:21,372
everyone was like, where's Botanicus? And like, I think he's back now, but at the time he was gone.

444
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:26,732
And I think there was like a furor. There was an uproar. Yeah. It was a lengthy refurb for the

445
00:33:26,732 --> 00:33:30,792
Botanicus animatronic. Cause that ET adventure, it's always, it seems like it's always on the line.

446
00:33:30,932 --> 00:33:36,812
The rumor is like, it's always like, well, it's, it's going to go, oh no, it got saved. But I don't

447
00:33:36,812 --> 00:33:45,032
know that that was, I don't know that they were like signaling that they were going to take the

448
00:33:45,032 --> 00:33:49,572
ride. Cause his head is cut off and that's an omen that the ride is going away in the next couple

449
00:33:49,572 --> 00:33:54,992
months. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I mean scaling back effects and that kind of thing isn't a good sign.

450
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:59,772
That's true. So, so he appears in the line. So you're right, it's a horse projection kind of thing.

451
00:34:00,152 --> 00:34:06,912
And so he kind of, I don't know, he sort of just essentially reiterates what Spielberg already said

452
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:12,352
and told you about Teakley, but it's, I didn't retain that knowledge. Yeah. You got on your

453
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:20,372
bunch of boring non-Botanicus shit. Then you arrive movie like shit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

454
00:34:20,372 --> 00:34:27,112
Yeah. Yeah. The cops and whatever. Yeah. Who cares? Then you get to the green planet. And I'm sure we

455
00:34:27,112 --> 00:34:32,992
talked about it in the episode that round of the corner is so awful. Like, all right, we're flying

456
00:34:32,992 --> 00:34:43,092
with ET. It's the score. And then like smoke doom, no color, hot, humid air blast death.

457
00:34:44,492 --> 00:34:50,432
And then you, then you see the, the other Botanicus appearance. And I'm curious by the way,

458
00:34:50,492 --> 00:34:55,172
if I, I want to say that the one that I saw and that brought my wife and I together,

459
00:34:55,612 --> 00:35:01,032
I want to say that it was the line. It looks like the line Botanicus for sure advanced. And I think

460
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:04,352
the other way, and he had this whole platform with them, which must've been what rose out of the

461
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:10,092
ground. I think the one in the line or I'm sorry, the one in the actual ride was more minimal. And

462
00:35:10,092 --> 00:35:16,192
I hope he's safe. Unlike his friends. I hope they kept the skin on. I bet he looks just like those

463
00:35:16,192 --> 00:35:22,012
leaked pictures of Stitch. If not worse. That's my biggest fear. If God, if anyone out there is

464
00:35:22,012 --> 00:35:27,392
listening and knows where Botanicus is please. Stitch at least has bodies somewhere, you know,

465
00:35:27,612 --> 00:35:34,092
committed sins before that movie. He was a killer. That is fair. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

466
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:39,452
Botanicus didn't do nothing to nobody. He creates life. Also, uh, I, I'm not actually sure you

467
00:35:39,452 --> 00:35:44,872
helped me out on this where the John Williams has a Botanicus theme that he wrote. Oh, you're right.

468
00:35:44,872 --> 00:35:52,072
And that's the score of the ride. I guess the name of the track is Botanicus theme, Botanicus theme.

469
00:35:52,572 --> 00:35:58,572
Right. Um, he composed that for the ride. Yeah. So, and I don't, I think it's not actually like

470
00:35:58,572 --> 00:36:02,632
commercially available, but you can find it on YouTube. Just literally search Botanicus theme

471
00:36:02,632 --> 00:36:07,452
and it's like black and white photo of John Williams composing a theme for Botanicus.

472
00:36:08,552 --> 00:36:12,232
That was a quick clock in and clock out. Oh yeah. He's looking at like a little model.

473
00:36:12,552 --> 00:36:16,732
Yeah. Not of Botanicus, but of the ride. Right. Yeah. So that's crazy. I don't think I realized

474
00:36:16,732 --> 00:36:20,292
he did original stuff. Yeah, I didn't know. That's really cool. But he's like pointing,

475
00:36:20,292 --> 00:36:27,872
like he's pointing at like the gaudy, uh, Brodo is OG plant life. Yeah. John Williams had to

476
00:36:27,872 --> 00:36:33,692
pretend to be interested in that. Oh, wow. Wonderful. Do you think composing for rides,

477
00:36:33,812 --> 00:36:38,432
I mean, I'm sure the, the people making the rides take a lot of the brunt work, but like,

478
00:36:38,672 --> 00:36:44,172
do you think that's a pleasure or like a pain in the ass of like, no, it's a half a second,

479
00:36:44,312 --> 00:36:48,232
it's a second too early. We actually need it because then it comes around the corner.

480
00:36:48,232 --> 00:36:53,572
It needs to hit here. I mean, I'm sure it depends. I bet that's like satisfying in its own right,

481
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:59,432
but I also bet that, uh, I bet John Williams is never dealing with that. I don't know. It's like,

482
00:36:59,832 --> 00:37:03,652
certainly not. Yeah. Someone else in the composer mill. I would believe that's a time.

483
00:37:03,892 --> 00:37:09,632
I would believe for like the overlay, uh, Monsters After Dark, which has the original Monsters After

484
00:37:09,632 --> 00:37:15,532
Dark song that they just gave him the amount of time, cause it's a different ride, another ride

485
00:37:15,592 --> 00:37:19,632
from a different song. So they just gave him like the time, like, all right, 30 seconds here.

486
00:37:20,052 --> 00:37:24,872
Then like whatever the chorus is like, so he probably had, I bet he had like exactly how much

487
00:37:24,872 --> 00:37:30,432
he needed and where it all came in. So it probably depends. Sure. Sure. There's like hard music cuts

488
00:37:30,432 --> 00:37:35,412
in this ride though, that I, that I bet like, you know, this doesn't have like, we were talking

489
00:37:35,412 --> 00:37:40,932
about Haunted Mansion. It's, it's not like a seamless transition from room to room. And I

490
00:37:41,152 --> 00:37:46,652
guarantee that John Williams had nothing to do with the like synth marimba version that's playing

491
00:37:46,652 --> 00:37:53,332
during the celebration at the end. Probably not. Um, yeah, he's not like, he's not playing a, uh,

492
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:59,752
Roland. He's not frustrated throwing the marimba against the wall. Like get it together people.

493
00:38:01,172 --> 00:38:07,292
I'd like to imagine he is though. It says no Island spirit. I'm John Bleep and Williams. Get it.

494
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:10,892
I like the idea of him like riding the ride over and over again and be like, it's not,

495
00:38:10,912 --> 00:38:17,432
score is not perfect yet. And he's like, just like in like consumed by getting the ET ride score.

496
00:38:17,492 --> 00:38:23,112
Perfect. Yeah. The bassoons back in. Yeah. It's probably not the case. Bring them to me. Firing

497
00:38:23,112 --> 00:38:30,572
squad. He executes two of them. He's a real, yeah. I got, I got Joe is his number. He's not a, he's,

498
00:38:30,572 --> 00:38:35,452
he's a spec. He's a Phil Spector. He would force, you know, we'll play it, play it one day.

499
00:38:37,292 --> 00:38:43,472
John Williams pulling a gun on an orchestra. You were not leaving until we finished this.

500
00:38:43,472 --> 00:38:51,472
I got a whole box of bullets. Cause there's a lot of you. 70 piece orchestra has 70 by so many

501
00:38:51,472 --> 00:38:57,332
bullet boxes. Specter only did it one full round. Right. There's only like five Ramones.

502
00:38:57,332 --> 00:39:02,552
There was one left for him in the chain. He needed it.

503
00:39:02,552 --> 00:39:07,412
They were recording. He was producing the Ramones, uh, the alternate version of the

504
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:13,932
Marvel McFay song. Oh yeah. Well, it was written for the Ramones and then, uh,

505
00:39:13,932 --> 00:39:24,972
they decided to keep it for Astro world. Um, so you pretty quickly see botanicus on the,

506
00:39:24,972 --> 00:39:31,032
on the dying green planet and the most upsetting part of it. And his, like the other, like flower

507
00:39:31,092 --> 00:39:37,112
creatures are, are wilting. Yeah. And he, he looks weird there too. Like if you didn't know

508
00:39:37,112 --> 00:39:41,652
who you were looking at, you'd go like, is that just a different ET? You know? Cause he looks so

509
00:39:41,652 --> 00:39:47,092
Royal and regal when he's on in the line. But then when you see this one, I truly like, it took me

510
00:39:47,092 --> 00:39:52,672
a few rides and looking up to be like, that's botanicus as well. Well, he's projecting the

511
00:39:52,672 --> 00:39:58,652
best version of himself, the green planet he's been trying to keep together. So he's all fucked

512
00:39:58,652 --> 00:40:05,572
up looking. Now I didn't know this and I bet you don't know this. Uh, I, I took a sec to watch the

513
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:11,892
ride through of the Japan version. Oh, I don't know. This is open in Japan as well. Um, first

514
00:40:11,892 --> 00:40:18,192
of all, hearing ET speak in Japanese is a real delight and all of the other, the he is home,

515
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:25,812
or he's on a ride. Hearing that in Japanese is so much fun, but botanicus in his ride appearance

516
00:40:25,812 --> 00:40:33,212
in the dying planet looks so much shittier. And I don't mean a shitty animatronic. I mean,

517
00:40:33,332 --> 00:40:40,932
they made him emaciated and dying. He is very pale. He is wearing less clothes. He's not wearing

518
00:40:40,932 --> 00:40:49,452
even his wilting, fake, iconic collar of Palm leaves or whatever it is. He is, he, there's like

519
00:40:50,932 --> 00:40:56,792
veins busting out of his chest. He is saying his face is much more haggard. They, for some reason

520
00:40:56,792 --> 00:41:02,572
took the time in Japan to make die botanicals much more sickly. That's interesting. And this is,

521
00:41:02,652 --> 00:41:08,252
we haven't talked too much about my Japan trip yet, but, uh, this is, I'm very, very minor. So I

522
00:41:08,252 --> 00:41:12,852
hope you won't be upset with me. Indiana Jones at the end of the Indiana Jones ride in Japan

523
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:19,472
is much more fucked up. Really? He's like, his clothes are way ripped. He's like bruised.

524
00:41:19,572 --> 00:41:24,572
Like we noticed that specifically like, Whoa, he's way more hurt than he is. And I just went on indie

525
00:41:24,572 --> 00:41:29,452
out here two nights ago and I'm like, Oh yeah, he looks great here. And in Japan, I mean,

526
00:41:29,452 --> 00:41:33,472
in what you're saying, the animatronic is perfect, but he's like, they made him more beat up for

527
00:41:33,472 --> 00:41:39,492
whatever reason. I don't know what that is. Yeah. People are more comfortable with people in pain.

528
00:41:39,492 --> 00:41:43,572
They're just committing to the stakes more. The green planet is essentially

529
00:41:43,572 --> 00:41:50,452
going through like a Krypton level. That's true. Like ET essentially stops Krypton from exploding.

530
00:41:50,452 --> 00:41:55,892
That's a good point. Because none of them, none of them else, none of the other ones have powers.

531
00:41:57,232 --> 00:42:02,372
That's what's a little unclear about the whole mythology because botanicus is very much

532
00:42:02,372 --> 00:42:08,112
like the guy, the teacher, the one who's in charge and ET as we'll find out is just,

533
00:42:08,412 --> 00:42:15,712
and this happens a lot. He's just called doctor by many people in the book. He's just a regular

534
00:42:15,712 --> 00:42:21,032
doctor. So botanicus will call him doctor. He, there is a part in the book. I was, I have a

535
00:42:21,032 --> 00:42:28,212
copy as well and I was leafing through it today and he at some point says, says, uh,

536
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:36,332
but I'm a scientist, a scholar ET says the character ET who we've only seen say,

537
00:42:40,092 --> 00:42:47,652
and ready. So I guess, should we start on the book? Yeah. I mean, that's all in the ride.

538
00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:52,932
And he, in the last year, so you see him twice. One, he's very worried and one he's essentially

539
00:42:52,932 --> 00:42:58,812
dying, especially in Japan. He is fucked up and you don't, and I'm going to give a little plus up

540
00:42:58,812 --> 00:43:05,672
for him here, which is that in the celebration, you should see botanicus having a blast because

541
00:43:05,672 --> 00:43:12,372
everything got fixed. He should have big sunglasses on. He should have like, like this, his like,

542
00:43:12,372 --> 00:43:19,292
you know, plant wreath around his neck, but it should have led lights. Uh, maybe it's weed.

543
00:43:19,312 --> 00:43:25,292
Maybe he's getting blazed now. ET's healing touch made his like, you know, his flat little leaves.

544
00:43:25,332 --> 00:43:33,532
You know, he turned it into bomb Kush, the green planet, baby. Let's celebrate doctors. Rec puff

545
00:43:33,712 --> 00:43:43,252
pass my man. And then ET, botanica should thank you too, at the end and then pass that dupe.

546
00:43:43,392 --> 00:43:49,692
Yeah. He should light a dude with his finger. Oh, whoa. Jason, you've got a lot of great ideas.

547
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:56,572
And then he's, and then botanica's ET says goodbye to all of you. And the botanica says like,

548
00:43:56,572 --> 00:44:05,472
want to hit this Mike, Scott, Jason, and he wants to listen to some Harry Nielsen records.

549
00:44:05,832 --> 00:44:15,292
Yeah, that'd be great. Absolutely. You should get, yeah. Why don't just save this thing in Florida

550
00:44:15,292 --> 00:44:20,092
as if there's a final scene where you get blazed with botanica. Oh my God. Yeah. There has to be

551
00:44:20,092 --> 00:44:24,132
a whole, at the very least, obviously this it's probably unlikely that they'll add a botanica

552
00:44:24,132 --> 00:44:29,932
that smokes weed on the ride. But I feel like we still, still kind of prosecuted in Florida,

553
00:44:30,132 --> 00:44:33,612
right? Like Florida hasn't done too much legalization. Am I wrong?

554
00:44:34,852 --> 00:44:40,252
Jimmy Buffett was pushing for it. The last election cycle as a proponent. Yeah. We tried

555
00:44:40,252 --> 00:44:45,132
a couple of years ago, we tried to, there's a star Wars character named yaddle or yaddle. I forget.

556
00:44:45,492 --> 00:44:49,532
Yeah. Exactly. Yaddle. We were calling her. We tried to start memes with her like,

557
00:44:49,712 --> 00:44:54,352
looking like high, like hashtag four 20 and stuff with the adult and just try to see if it would

558
00:44:54,352 --> 00:44:59,812
catch on. It did not. But I think botanica's memes where he's high or like kind of a weed,

559
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:05,112
like connoisseur. It's right there. Hashtag pot tannicus. Yeah. Cause botanica is like plants,

560
00:45:05,112 --> 00:45:12,592
man. And like green planet. I think maybe. Botanicus. Oh, sounds better. You are both

561
00:45:12,912 --> 00:45:15,012
pot tannicus. Botanicus.

562
00:45:15,592 --> 00:45:20,632
We're going to sell the tannicus shirt and a botanicus shirt.

563
00:45:20,872 --> 00:45:25,792
We found a new hashtag. Hashtag pot tannicus. Botanicus. I mean, this is,

564
00:45:26,232 --> 00:45:31,152
we maybe we'll have to just release this section on the main feed so we can get this out to as

565
00:45:31,152 --> 00:45:37,012
many people as possible. We'll reference it. We'll say like, yeah, we do here a special mission from

566
00:45:37,732 --> 00:45:42,712
from within the second gate. A preview of what lies behind the second gate. And it's us talking

567
00:45:42,712 --> 00:45:48,932
about pot tannic. Hashtag pot tannicus. We're getting crazy and innovative over in the second

568
00:45:48,932 --> 00:45:53,172
gate. You got to see what they're up to. They get real experimental in the second gate. Forever

569
00:45:53,172 --> 00:45:57,692
Dog has dropped us and somehow iTunes has too. I didn't know they could do that.

570
00:45:59,012 --> 00:46:05,492
Suggesting that a comical alien be seen smoking a joint. This is beyond the pale podcast, The Ride.

571
00:46:05,632 --> 00:46:12,832
You are banned. But we all own and operate a dispensary now. What? What is that? Well,

572
00:46:12,872 --> 00:46:20,892
we were lost. We were kicked out of the kingdom by those people, but then we're rewarded by the

573
00:46:20,892 --> 00:46:25,312
constantly growing marijuana industry for innovation. Well, I would think that the next

574
00:46:25,312 --> 00:46:29,552
step from we are embraced by theme park fans, let's just get embraced by the weed community.

575
00:46:29,552 --> 00:46:33,492
Sure. Yeah, I think that's a great idea. Yeah. Yeah. This is part of making the crossover and

576
00:46:33,492 --> 00:46:40,312
it will be the first weed collective slash podcast slash Patreon. We're only one of the

577
00:46:40,312 --> 00:46:48,632
three of us. Enjoy it. Who doesn't love going to a store with a million locked buzzer doors

578
00:46:48,632 --> 00:47:03,472
and security guards in full squat team outfits now with a blue lies matter patch right in the

579
00:47:03,472 --> 00:47:09,652
way. These and that'll be great. It'll put you right to sleep. Cut to me. Why awake at 5 a.m.

580
00:47:10,032 --> 00:47:16,912
I don't remember how language works. That was I over. I kind of overdosed on I took too many of

581
00:47:16,912 --> 00:47:21,252
these gummies, which now I just take half of and it's great. Helps me sleep. It's wonderful. Yeah.

582
00:47:21,252 --> 00:47:27,052
But I drew I had to go into my job the next day and I was so fucked up from the two or maybe the

583
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:32,772
one and a half gummies are especially potent for whatever reason. Gummies hit harder than like

584
00:47:33,192 --> 00:47:39,532
chocolate. Oh, OK. I don't know what it is. That's been my experience at least. The half perfect.

585
00:47:39,672 --> 00:47:46,412
The one and a half. I thought I was going to have to call my coworkers at the writing job that I

586
00:47:46,412 --> 00:47:52,092
have and say I don't remember how the English language works anymore. That was actually

587
00:47:52,092 --> 00:47:56,332
something that happened to me. That's like in a movie where a 15 year old smokes too much weed.

588
00:47:56,332 --> 00:48:00,632
I don't remember language, man. Does this sound like words?

589
00:48:01,632 --> 00:48:08,472
And then I'm just on the street like what happens to Barkhud Opti and good time happens to me and

590
00:48:08,472 --> 00:48:15,052
just cart it off to an insane asylum. That's had your instinct to call in and call ahead and like

591
00:48:15,052 --> 00:48:21,512
check in and let people know still puts you a mile ahead of most stereotypes of dirtbag comedy writer.

592
00:48:21,572 --> 00:48:27,292
I feel like most people that would happen to just wouldn't just you just wouldn't hear from them

593
00:48:27,292 --> 00:48:31,912
for like a day or two. Also, if I called work and I said, hey, how's everything going? A real quick

594
00:48:31,912 --> 00:48:36,352
thing. I can't be in today because I don't remember how the English language works because I got too

595
00:48:36,352 --> 00:48:42,772
high. They'd be like, that sounded fine. Why don't you come in? What am I? What am I talking about?

596
00:48:43,152 --> 00:48:47,552
Look, I'm not as at ease with this with this stuff as as as pottinger.

597
00:48:47,552 --> 00:48:51,892
Yes, I got a mellow out like old botanical.

598
00:48:52,252 --> 00:48:57,692
But Potana Kush, if this is an alternate character, wouldn't if there was a green

599
00:48:57,692 --> 00:49:03,132
planet emergency, he'd be like, it's fine. Yeah, don't worry about it. Yeah, somebody.

600
00:49:03,672 --> 00:49:10,872
I don't know, man. Also, he's a little no with the orb on it is definitely a bong.

601
00:49:10,872 --> 00:49:12,252
Oh, of course.

602
00:49:13,032 --> 00:49:15,172
Bonsai, a giant bong.

603
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:20,132
And like if he was going to force project himself, he just forced project himself into a dead concert.

604
00:49:20,132 --> 00:49:28,832
Yeah, on stage, he's shaking a big like gourd with beads on it. Potana Kush did do a few shows with

605
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:35,592
the dead and friends that John Mayer fronted. Yeah, great. Potana Kush. John Mayer needs my help

606
00:49:35,592 --> 00:49:37,712
to turn this jam up a notch.

607
00:49:40,672 --> 00:49:44,132
Well, back to the back to the actual canon character, right?

608
00:49:44,232 --> 00:49:47,452
Tanaka, so I think we've now arrived at maybe now we get into.

609
00:49:47,612 --> 00:49:51,312
So if you've been if you didn't know this, if you've been wondering where did all this come from this

610
00:49:51,312 --> 00:49:55,492
botanicals character and the denticly and what is all this? What are we talking? Oh, wait, I forgot

611
00:49:55,492 --> 00:50:02,532
something that when when you see him on the planet, the thing he says is fine, teakley. Yes. Right.

612
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:08,712
It's all about teakley. This is sort of I don't know what gender teakley is, but this is kind of a

613
00:50:08,712 --> 00:50:16,812
well, in our world, the Helen test. What's the actual thing? The Bechtel test? Yeah. Yeah. This

614
00:50:16,812 --> 00:50:21,812
is botanicals is a character who only shows up to talk about teakley. He does not pass the teakley

615
00:50:21,812 --> 00:50:26,972
test. There's not one scene where he's not talking about teakley or ET for that matter. What does

616
00:50:27,212 --> 00:50:33,652
botanicals want? Yeah, we're deciding for he wants to get blazed. He wants to get blazed and you have

617
00:50:33,652 --> 00:50:38,292
to read the book that came out six years earlier than the ride to find out kind of, but not really.

618
00:50:38,532 --> 00:50:46,352
Now, can we talk about chronology for the audience? Yeah. The ride, the movie, the book.

619
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:55,252
The ride is 90 originally and later in the other parts. You're saying what the

620
00:50:56,192 --> 00:51:00,212
storyline chronology? Yeah, I'm saying storyline. Well, OK. Well, even still, the book was like 85,

621
00:51:00,452 --> 00:51:06,172
correct? The book is 85 for sure. Between the film and the ride within. OK. Within the world. Yeah.

622
00:51:06,172 --> 00:51:11,052
OK. Sorry. Yeah. The ride, I don't know. The ride's like an alternate. That's just like some other

623
00:51:11,052 --> 00:51:15,012
thing that happened. The ride is confusing because, yes, it started out as the sequel,

624
00:51:15,012 --> 00:51:20,732
but like you're not sure exactly why ET is back on Earth. So because ET doesn't go.

625
00:51:21,312 --> 00:51:24,772
Does he go back to the Earth at the end? I forgot. You're also not sure when bikes

626
00:51:24,952 --> 00:51:31,052
started coming in packs of 12 that all ride in tandem and fly through the atmosphere.

627
00:51:31,932 --> 00:51:38,332
Maybe the ride is kind of like for any DC comics readers, it's like an Elseworlds. Earth 2. Yeah.

628
00:51:38,432 --> 00:51:43,392
That's the story. It's like, oh, the events of Batman happened, but it happened in the Old West

629
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:48,812
or Superman, but he landed in the Soviet Union. Because this is a direct sequel. This is ET on

630
00:51:48,932 --> 00:51:55,312
the ship coming back from Earth. It's like New Hope right after Rogue One. It happens in the

631
00:51:55,312 --> 00:52:00,792
moments immediately after the film. Right. So this is, yeah, we know where this is. We know where the

632
00:52:00,792 --> 00:52:09,492
book is. We're not quite sure where ET, the adventure, takes from. So because we didn't

633
00:52:09,492 --> 00:52:13,292
subject ourselves to this, although I leafed through it a little bit, but you clearly,

634
00:52:13,312 --> 00:52:18,572
Mike, have done the biggest dive into ET book of the green planet. I took too many little passages

635
00:52:18,572 --> 00:52:23,932
here. And at a certain point, if I feel like I've taken too much, you guys just go, you know what,

636
00:52:24,392 --> 00:52:28,112
maybe this is enough. I'm going to do that halfway through the first one.

637
00:52:28,172 --> 00:52:33,352
So I know the tenor of this book and you can open here. How about this? I'm going to open to some

638
00:52:33,352 --> 00:52:38,452
random page that's not about Botanicus and read the first thing I see, which will tell you generally

639
00:52:38,452 --> 00:52:45,392
where what this thing is like. Dagon Sabad, who draws lightning from the clouds. Sabad,

640
00:52:45,492 --> 00:52:53,112
who stirred the primal atoms, giving birth to the galaxies and to Reese's Pieces. Imagine how many

641
00:52:53,112 --> 00:53:02,232
269 pages of this, the last page of which has stuff about Sinistro and Occulta and Electrum.

642
00:53:02,232 --> 00:53:08,552
This is a truly time waste, patience trying book. It's a very patience trying book.

643
00:53:09,672 --> 00:53:12,752
I'm just going to read a couple real quick. I'm going to go through some slacks and these are not

644
00:53:12,752 --> 00:53:16,272
necessarily about Botanicus. I'm just trying to, as Scott is doing, paint a picture of the book

645
00:53:16,272 --> 00:53:24,632
and how it fits into the canon of ET. So like ET is getting questioned by other botanists on the

646
00:53:24,632 --> 00:53:30,512
ship. We should say he's like he goes, he's on the ship. He's just left Elliot and he's going

647
00:53:30,512 --> 00:53:36,432
back to the green planet. Now he's getting, everybody's curious what happened to him on Earth.

648
00:53:36,772 --> 00:53:42,552
Yeah, and everyone, he's also like, everyone's mad at him. Everyone's so mad at ET for like

649
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:46,272
wandering off. Fun. Which is fun. Yeah, I don't know why everyone like.

650
00:53:46,592 --> 00:53:49,972
Oh, because they were all with him. He was with like a pack of Godot gazovians.

651
00:53:49,992 --> 00:53:54,592
And I think we talked about this in the other one. ET always seemed like a kid. He was like Elliot.

652
00:53:54,592 --> 00:54:00,112
But in this bizarre world, he's like a couple hundred years old and he's a doctor.

653
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:06,492
He's hundreds of years old. That's so weird. And he just, and none of the language issues.

654
00:54:07,572 --> 00:54:14,252
He's clearly a kid in ET. It's a connection between two children. Why would he be a hundred?

655
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:21,712
It doesn't make any fucking sense. Unless, you know, Botanicus has been alive for 5,000 years.

656
00:54:22,872 --> 00:54:27,252
They allude to is that he has been, so I guess you could say in, if we're, everything's relative,

657
00:54:27,352 --> 00:54:30,732
that he's young in his, but he's still like a doctor. He's nine years old essentially.

658
00:54:31,132 --> 00:54:35,252
An accomplished doctor. It's sort of like when we witnessed in front of our very eyes,

659
00:54:35,352 --> 00:54:40,572
the sector keeper go from a gross child to like a 30 something year old guy who goes like,

660
00:54:40,672 --> 00:54:46,532
I'm feeling great. I'm doing well. Yeah, yeah, very similar transformation. And he'd like also,

661
00:54:46,732 --> 00:54:53,112
he's a doctor, but he's a naked doctor. It's a doctor who wears zero, not even like a necklace.

662
00:54:53,412 --> 00:54:57,472
Not a name badge. He's the naked doctor on CBS.

663
00:54:59,692 --> 00:55:03,472
So like they're asking ET questions and then one of the other botanists,

664
00:55:03,772 --> 00:55:07,592
but what did you do on earth that was so wonderful? And he goes, ate candy.

665
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:14,672
And then he's talking about like, I made a true friend on earth. He told the plants, he saved my

666
00:55:14,672 --> 00:55:20,532
neck. He raised his neck further to a greater height. He, we went through all kinds of doodly

667
00:55:20,532 --> 00:55:27,932
squats together. Doodly squats. I was like, what? What's this book written for adults or children?

668
00:55:27,972 --> 00:55:34,032
Children. It's a children's book. But probably if you're into like fantasy. Yeah. I think it's

669
00:55:34,032 --> 00:55:40,812
courting like a fantasy audience, a never ending story kind of audience. Yeah. He also, he says

670
00:55:40,812 --> 00:55:45,512
there's a thing called, am I stepping on one of your quotes? No, no. Like he says, there's a thing

671
00:55:45,512 --> 00:55:51,052
called, where they all dress up in costumes called hollow bean. Yes. There's a lot of that shit.

672
00:55:51,312 --> 00:55:55,672
Like fucking nailing it left and right. Just like the backboard keeps exploding.

673
00:55:56,332 --> 00:56:05,052
So there's a lot of that. And then the weirdest, really the plane of the book is that ET is like

674
00:56:05,852 --> 00:56:12,472
projecting himself to earth to help Elliot like kiss a girl for the first time. That's really the

675
00:56:12,472 --> 00:56:18,172
plot of the book. Oh. Everything else is like, is like kind of just. But you already, you kissed a girl in the movie.

676
00:56:18,592 --> 00:56:24,292
Yeah. It's weird. It's like everything else is sort of meandering. Like all the green planet stuff is

677
00:56:24,292 --> 00:56:34,852
very meandering and doesn't have much place, much like there's nothing going on is really what I'm

678
00:56:34,852 --> 00:56:40,472
like, it's like a feeling in his head. And it's like, he sees Elliot and there's this girl he likes,

679
00:56:40,692 --> 00:56:47,572
Julie. And then he's like, he's seeing, he's seeing Elliot at the arcade and he sees Julie.

680
00:56:47,992 --> 00:56:53,892
Hi Elliot, she said. And Elliot felt a very odd sensation run through him as if his knees had turned

681
00:56:53,892 --> 00:57:03,652
to soft ice cream and a bird had flown out of his heart. So he's like, part of it is Elliot meeting

682
00:57:04,792 --> 00:57:13,432
Julie and then ET trying to help him woo Julie. You've got this my man. So what's bizarre is, and

683
00:57:13,432 --> 00:57:18,852
I have too many notes here, I should have organized this better, is that ET will like force project

684
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:24,632
himself into situations on earth and he'll always like knock over something on a counter. So apparently

685
00:57:24,632 --> 00:57:31,192
he's a solid projection. So in between just getting yelled at by everybody for what he did on earth in

686
00:57:31,192 --> 00:57:37,692
the first movie, he's like appearing on earth again and like knocking something off of a table.

687
00:57:37,832 --> 00:57:44,852
And it doesn't make any sense. Oh, fuck. ET yelled realizing he knocked over a vase.

688
00:57:44,952 --> 00:57:52,792
His stethoscope falling off his force projection neck. Elliot wanted to say something really cool

689
00:57:52,792 --> 00:57:57,552
and brilliant to Julie, maybe even remind her that he was the one who'd known the extraterrestrial,

690
00:57:57,552 --> 00:58:01,512
but he wasn't able to say anything cool or brilliant because he just swallowed his gum

691
00:58:01,512 --> 00:58:07,292
while looking at her and it was lodged sideways in his throat. Hi, Julie, he croaked, but the

692
00:58:07,292 --> 00:58:11,932
noise of the arcade was so loud she seemed not to hear, or maybe she heard and just pretended not to,

693
00:58:12,032 --> 00:58:16,992
which was a thing girls did. He was discovering that girls did many strange things as strange

694
00:58:16,992 --> 00:58:26,712
and remote to Elliot as ET had been. Girls are from another planet, he said to himself now as he

695
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:26,772
was looking at the world.

696
00:58:26,792 --> 00:58:33,492
I mean, it's weird like coming of age novel too. It's bizarre. Not a fan. Not an inner spinner,

697
00:58:33,492 --> 00:58:41,512
like back and forth a bunch of crap about the flop global. Yes. So here's a hollow bean.

698
00:58:42,092 --> 00:58:49,632
They have an important celebration called hollow bean. Everyone carves faces in fruit squashes

699
00:58:49,632 --> 00:58:56,692
and dresses up in sheets. I myself dressed up in one. This is all ET still not botanicals.

700
00:58:57,252 --> 00:59:03,412
Have you heard this? Have you heard this one? This guy knows. My man knows.

701
00:59:06,032 --> 00:59:12,092
Then one of the botanists asks him like, did you meet the ruler of earth? And ET goes,

702
00:59:12,412 --> 00:59:21,272
Elliot. And he goes, Elliot is the ruler. How old is he? Has he 10,000 years? He's 10. 10. And he

703
00:59:25,272 --> 00:59:25,912
assaults each one of these gentries. A man turns out. Some people on his team knowinya

704
00:59:25,912 --> 00:59:25,932
Gaams Yeah, you see no buck back on you those.

705
00:59:25,932 --> 00:59:27,792
But this writer went almost 40 million miles here just beetle wild. So they bring back

706
00:59:27,792 --> 00:59:32,232
OK, you see budget on this to that man speechclapping? So you have to do that. So only

707
00:59:32,232 --> 00:59:41,492
three days to do that. So on three days to go back and forth. Okay. But like we're in

708
00:59:41,492 --> 00:59:41,672
flap tacks, pretending, we decided to like, not spend the money, but you really can't

709
00:59:41,672 --> 00:59:43,572
even leave it out, you know, swell balls? I don't even remember like how to actually

710
00:59:43,572 --> 00:59:51,252
So. So they did this that day. They said, Well, this is Bill Wyatt, Ingredients,

711
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:58,152
Proceed said ET wanting to admit that he'd been. Oh yeah, they're talking about these

712
00:59:58,152 --> 01:00:03,012
characters called the beeper beans here too. And they all like beep and that's basically

713
01:00:03,012 --> 01:00:08,152
their deal. Then they mentioned like ET's parent and they call it just the great parent.

714
01:00:08,432 --> 01:00:16,872
And he has like a single entity parent. And it's like the queen in an ant colony. Yeah, kind of.

715
01:00:16,872 --> 01:00:21,732
And they say this parent, sole creator of ET's form out of its own nature was both

716
01:00:21,732 --> 01:00:27,812
father and mother to him. And ET was bathed in the healing force of this and in its stern

717
01:00:27,812 --> 01:00:32,412
judgment because the parent is mad at ET too. Everyone's just mad at him. Cause he just didn't

718
01:00:32,412 --> 01:00:40,972
show up to work for a few days. Like Scott after taking a. He's a highly respected doctor.

719
01:00:41,332 --> 01:00:48,292
So then we've talked a lot about the flop gop, gloppel and the technical term for the flop

720
01:00:48,292 --> 01:00:58,552
gloppel is the Igigi, Jirum, Hadda, Haba, Deba, meaning 600 vertebrae in the spine. But everyone

721
01:00:58,552 --> 01:01:04,072
on the green planet just called them flop gloppels for one of their modes of travel was to flop

722
01:01:04,072 --> 01:01:10,312
around like a long gloppy length of something with a tripodial arrangement of feet at the bottom.

723
01:01:10,392 --> 01:01:14,992
Of all things, they perhaps resembled most closely a pile of gray floppy socks.

724
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:20,372
They were very fast, very agile, very stupid and very loving.

725
01:01:21,712 --> 01:01:28,732
That is, I don't know. Now I'm starting to get upset. I was on board with the language in that.

726
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:33,652
So don't like tell us what it's called. What do you mean? They, it's called this,

727
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:38,092
but it's really called this. Shut up and say what it's called. It is trying to make it seem

728
01:01:38,092 --> 01:01:45,512
like it's real. Uh huh. But there's the genus name and here's the hamburger sometimes abbreviated as

729
01:01:45,512 --> 01:01:53,872
burgers further as birds or I look this, when does botanicals come back?

730
01:01:53,992 --> 01:01:59,052
You're right. We got it. We got a, hold on. Let me do a couple more and then we'll go to botanicals

731
01:01:59,052 --> 01:02:03,992
and then we'll finish this thing up. There are some green planet scientists who say that flop

732
01:02:03,992 --> 01:02:09,132
gloppels are old and very wise. However, this has never been proven as flop gloppels enjoy

733
01:02:09,132 --> 01:02:16,592
giving silly answers on intelligence tests. So a thing about this whole species.

734
01:02:16,612 --> 01:02:21,052
So they're funny. Okay. I'm back on board. I love to laugh.

735
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:24,872
So that they're all doing tests. Like that's, that comes up with ET too, that he's,

736
01:02:24,872 --> 01:02:33,812
he's doing tests. They talk about his exams and in general the poll, but the, all the,

737
01:02:34,032 --> 01:02:40,612
in and of itself that ET had a teacher and he went to school. He had the LSATs and the GREs.

738
01:02:40,812 --> 01:02:44,432
Parent and teacher. Yeah. Who do we need? His tutor?

739
01:02:45,772 --> 01:02:52,792
ET tells flop, his flop gloppel that he doesn't want to meet anyone right now and flop gobble,

740
01:02:52,932 --> 01:02:58,432
which I assume by the way, flop gobble, I think, and then the ride maybe sounds like Edwin.

741
01:02:58,632 --> 01:03:05,332
I'm assuming it sounds like this, but that's because it's silly. He goes, why not? And then

742
01:03:05,332 --> 01:03:11,152
ET goes, because I'm a in dis, I'm in disgrace. And then flop gobble tells him that's, oh,

743
01:03:11,152 --> 01:03:16,592
that's nothing. It's nothing for you because it is, it is your nature. Oh, no, no, wait,

744
01:03:16,612 --> 01:03:21,052
I screwed this up. He's all a flop gobble tells him he's always in disgrace for racing through

745
01:03:21,052 --> 01:03:26,032
villages and otherwise acting up. And that's when ET says it's nothing for you because it is your

746
01:03:26,032 --> 01:03:32,512
nature, but I'm a scholar, a scientist. This is sort of like if they wrote a follow-up to

747
01:03:32,512 --> 01:03:39,112
Close Encounters and like Richard Dreyfuss tried to go back to work, like it was just navigating

748
01:03:39,112 --> 01:03:47,632
everything at his job. Like, I know, you know about, you saw the news, it's worldwide. The ship

749
01:03:47,632 --> 01:03:52,592
came, it's like, yeah, okay, man, but we gotta, right. We still gotta do graphic design.

750
01:03:52,592 --> 01:03:58,052
I feel like a jobless. If there's not, I would be willing to write the novelization of the sequel

751
01:03:58,052 --> 01:04:04,552
of Close Encounters and add some sort of a planet, maybe a blue planet full of water or something

752
01:04:04,552 --> 01:04:09,792
with different characters. I mean, there's a whole, there's a lot of things we could do,

753
01:04:09,792 --> 01:04:13,532
I bet, with those characters. All right, here's the stuff. This is where we're,

754
01:04:13,532 --> 01:04:19,852
this is what we're waiting for. Okay. Then ET himself felt a higher wave, far higher than his own,

755
01:04:20,312 --> 01:04:25,732
an emanation partaking directly of the solar and lunar forces, the wavelength of his teacher,

756
01:04:26,452 --> 01:04:32,872
Botanicus. Oh, the first utterance. It spreads through the field, touching all the growing things,

757
01:04:33,172 --> 01:04:39,572
a power like ET's, but amplified many times the radiance of an adept in agriculture.

758
01:04:40,052 --> 01:04:44,292
There were only a few such on the planet and one of them, Botanicus, was the greatest,

759
01:04:44,332 --> 01:04:48,192
which doesn't make any sense why he couldn't heal the planet then, if he's clearly more powerful

760
01:04:48,192 --> 01:04:54,192
than ET. Oh yeah. His glittering thought wave, like a stream of diamonds, broke along the road,

761
01:04:54,452 --> 01:05:00,852
dazzling all who stood there and dazzling still more those rooted there. So like, it sounds like

762
01:05:00,852 --> 01:05:06,372
he's one of a chosen few that are the most powerful of all the characters on this planet.

763
01:05:06,892 --> 01:05:13,312
This is you, you read that like with the tone of somebody reading and like,

764
01:05:13,792 --> 01:05:20,672
now we're reading from the book of John. Like that was you doing the homily.

765
01:05:21,352 --> 01:05:25,332
It's my ET, the green planet by William Cotswinkle is my holy book.

766
01:05:25,332 --> 01:05:32,532
And the different translations, you know, put in all this messed up shit. People misinterpret

767
01:05:32,532 --> 01:05:39,492
these texts and it's a weird part of the green planet where they imply that male

768
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:44,412
Godot, Asobians shouldn't get married. But yeah, I'm not, I'm a very progressive

769
01:05:44,412 --> 01:05:51,552
green planet book reader. Mostly your services are short and it's a lot of acoustic guitar music.

770
01:05:51,932 --> 01:05:55,972
It's a progressive sect of the green planet. Look, I don't want to come down on you with

771
01:05:55,972 --> 01:06:03,012
some rules. I just want to read a cool book to you. I turn the chair like around and I get on it like

772
01:06:03,012 --> 01:06:08,712
Slater, EC Slater. You used pastor 101, sit in the chair. Well, number one, sit in the chair. Cool.

773
01:06:08,932 --> 01:06:15,172
Number two, bracelet or earring. You want to earn their trust. They'll never trust you if you sit in

774
01:06:15,172 --> 01:06:21,572
a chair regularly. That's what priests do and priests are molesters. You have to earn their trust.

775
01:06:23,812 --> 01:06:28,572
So I guess you're wondering probably like how he would be described here in the book.

776
01:06:29,012 --> 01:06:33,612
Following in the wake of this powerful thought wave, which is a different thing that I won't read,

777
01:06:33,692 --> 01:06:39,332
botanicus appeared. His form was like the parent tall and slender of the advanced growth cycle.

778
01:06:39,372 --> 01:06:43,932
He was wrapped in a robe made of a large leaf whose tips were tucked around his shoulders

779
01:06:43,932 --> 01:06:49,792
and under his arms. It clung to him undying, sustained by his emanation. His walk was slow

780
01:06:49,792 --> 01:06:55,692
and stately and a large jade skinned lizard accompanied him forked tongue flickering as he

781
01:06:55,692 --> 01:07:02,512
waddled along beside his master. He's got a lizard pet that has forked a forked tongue.

782
01:07:03,092 --> 01:07:08,852
The thing is like botanicus does not have a ton to do in this book. So all we get are these great

783
01:07:08,852 --> 01:07:15,752
little moments of him, but he isn't, it's again, it's mostly about Elliot and Julie.

784
01:07:17,412 --> 01:07:24,532
So this ancient, this 10,000 year old creature is mostly tending to some kid and Silmar getting his

785
01:07:24,532 --> 01:07:30,132
first kiss. Why doesn't he just ask her out? What does he have to lose? They don't know each other

786
01:07:30,132 --> 01:07:37,992
that well. This relationship will last five weeks tops. Just get it over with. People are going to

787
01:07:37,992 --> 01:07:43,752
talk about you anyway at that age. Don't be scared to take chances. The stakes are so low.

788
01:07:44,132 --> 01:07:46,392
The kids making fun of you are just jealous.

789
01:07:48,892 --> 01:07:54,652
So ET appears on earth and he's like talking to kids and it's very confusing why it happens.

790
01:07:54,892 --> 01:07:58,832
And then he says here, and he says, botanicus solved the riddle of life.

791
01:07:58,852 --> 01:08:05,452
Here he learned the innermost secrets of all that grows above and below around botanicus was a

792
01:08:05,452 --> 01:08:10,692
Corona of shimmering light and plants swooned as he passed some falling, some rising, some reaching

793
01:08:10,692 --> 01:08:15,372
out to touch him and draw more of his concentrate where his footsteps fell seedling suddenly

794
01:08:15,372 --> 01:08:20,812
sprouted quickened by his impress and where his gaze landed there, a plant would tremble with

795
01:08:21,092 --> 01:08:27,252
rapture. Most learned supreme scientist, Lord of the fields, botanicus.

796
01:08:27,832 --> 01:08:38,112
Lord of the field. He sounds so cool and then they don't do anything with it. Like everyone just

797
01:08:38,112 --> 01:08:43,592
kisses his ass, the author included. And then like he doesn't really move heaven and earth.

798
01:08:43,592 --> 01:08:51,192
This is like wild, wild country where like the Raj Nish is like barely, you don't really get

799
01:08:51,192 --> 01:08:56,872
a sense of what he is and he just waves from a limo. They just, they cart botanicus around the

800
01:08:56,872 --> 01:09:04,072
fields in a limo and he waves once a day. But you know, ET or what's his real, Zrek. It's mainly

801
01:09:04,072 --> 01:09:07,652
Zrek's story. Like it's mainly the story of that mean lady.

802
01:09:08,652 --> 01:09:13,612
Uh, uh, so botanicus finally turns his gaze now falling on his students and then on ET,

803
01:09:14,212 --> 01:09:21,212
his large limpid eyes blinked slowly. Prize pupil. He extended his hand to ET. Come here,

804
01:09:21,552 --> 01:09:31,292
pride and joy. You know, no, no, no. Don't all your, all your teachers, uh, for through your life,

805
01:09:31,392 --> 01:09:37,472
call you pride and joy. And then when you guys run into the UCB program,

806
01:09:37,472 --> 01:09:42,332
isn't he said pride and joy and give you a big hug. Oh yeah. He was a real men to our

807
01:09:42,332 --> 01:09:46,512
figurative. I think I've got Matt Vester down. I think I get the character. Uh,

808
01:09:47,432 --> 01:09:53,852
ET moved in front of botanicus botanicus put his leathery pole on ET's head and closed his eyes.

809
01:09:53,852 --> 01:10:01,692
Uh, resume resume resume. What is that word? R H I Z O M E boy, new words in this book.

810
01:10:02,472 --> 01:10:08,512
Home blocked sap down in the toes. What's wrong? That says botanicus. So botanicus can feel that

811
01:10:08,512 --> 01:10:13,752
ET is in, is in turmoil. Uh, and then ET tells him that he got kicked off the ship and whatever.

812
01:10:14,432 --> 01:10:19,812
Um, and he's a real sad ET, a real sad sack. And he says that he was weeded out and kicked off the

813
01:10:19,812 --> 01:10:26,832
ship. Um, and then there's more of this, like him like misinterpreting things on earth. And he tells

814
01:10:26,832 --> 01:10:31,252
the botanicus about toys and they have like, he's like, there are other creatures on earth.

815
01:10:31,252 --> 01:10:36,872
They are called toys and have definite spiritual qualities. And indeed frequently spoke to me in

816
01:10:36,872 --> 01:10:42,232
the silence of the closet. I believe them to be very advanced as our great meditative sages,

817
01:10:42,312 --> 01:10:47,652
the mind holders. He paused to gather more profundities for his young listeners who had,

818
01:10:47,752 --> 01:10:52,932
whose head moss was again beginning to glow amber and silver as they leaned toward him.

819
01:10:53,252 --> 01:10:57,332
So he's not, I think now I'm remembering the context more. There's a group of students in

820
01:10:57,332 --> 01:11:01,252
the room that had transitioned to ET and botanicus and now ET is telling them about

821
01:11:01,252 --> 01:11:07,172
the stuffed animals in the closet. They spoke to me in the silence, but then in other sections

822
01:11:07,172 --> 01:11:12,992
of this book, he's like, maybe smart. Like this is totally inconsistent. It doesn't make any sense.

823
01:11:13,052 --> 01:11:21,512
Toys are geniuses and Elliot is president. Vice president. Also, how does everyone have a copy

824
01:11:21,512 --> 01:11:26,272
of this book? I thought Mike was, this was one of Mike's weird ex-sensibilities. Okay. So Jason,

825
01:11:26,472 --> 01:11:32,352
be sure to bring your copy. I want to see it highlighted. I want to see notes in the

826
01:11:32,352 --> 01:11:37,432
botanicus would have given you a D. You've given me, you've shown me that book. And I had totally

827
01:11:37,432 --> 01:11:41,312
for, I thought it was like more of a storybook. I thought there was more pictures or something,

828
01:11:41,352 --> 01:11:51,772
but this is a full YA novel. Worst pupil dunce cap for you, Jason. We were expecting to record

829
01:11:51,772 --> 01:11:55,912
a shorter amount of time than we've gone here today. So I'll just, I'll leave on that. I mean,

830
01:11:56,552 --> 01:12:01,812
more botanicus, get the book. We could be here for another hour. And just, just because we alluded

831
01:12:01,812 --> 01:12:07,292
to it, the sequel to ET that was never made. Oh, hold on, hold on. I have a little quote here,

832
01:12:07,292 --> 01:12:10,952
and then we'll talk about nocturnal fears. The sequel to ET that was never made.

833
01:12:12,652 --> 01:12:17,672
This is one of my friends. This is not botanicus, but ET says to his friends about Elliot,

834
01:12:18,092 --> 01:12:24,432
my friend is in danger. He is about to become the most terrible thing of all. He is about to become

835
01:12:25,572 --> 01:12:33,352
man. My friend, the fucking virgin. That is sort of what he's saying. We gotta get him laid.

836
01:12:34,432 --> 01:12:40,392
It's Elliot's prom night. Elliot must get his rocks off. I tried to get him the kush to help

837
01:12:40,392 --> 01:12:47,632
him relax. It did not work master. That is a good sequel is like pre-teen Elliot or teenage Elliot,

838
01:12:47,912 --> 01:12:52,952
and ET comes back and he's also a teen and they're going on like teen hijinks together.

839
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:57,472
It's like the dirty back to the future that was never made where they were like bootlegging VHS

840
01:12:57,472 --> 01:13:02,552
copies and getting high and stuff. Yeah. And like some like Cyrano kind of stuff where like,

841
01:13:02,612 --> 01:13:08,212
tell me what to say. And he's hiding in the bushes and tell her she shines brighter than

842
01:13:08,212 --> 01:13:17,312
all of the cut. She's more intelligent than the toys. Tell her she has the spirit of a pile of

843
01:13:17,432 --> 01:13:23,372
gray socks. She has a bright smile like the wah-wah sign.

844
01:13:26,332 --> 01:13:32,472
Yeah. So there's plenty more where that came from. If this was enticing to you,

845
01:13:32,712 --> 01:13:38,092
if this is like a little reading rainbow. Yes. So if you want to hear more, check it out at

846
01:13:38,092 --> 01:13:43,932
your local library. Unless the library threw the copy away after four months.

847
01:13:45,372 --> 01:13:53,732
Yeah. So we're waiting on any word from the author. I have emailed his blog or his website

848
01:13:53,732 --> 01:14:02,532
and we'll see if I said, Hey, I'm one of the hosts of a theme park podcast. We're doing a special

849
01:14:02,532 --> 01:14:13,912
episode about the ET ride. We just wanted to know, did William Cotswinkle create the character of

850
01:14:13,932 --> 01:14:19,052
I have something to tell you that is similar to this. Oh really? And I was hoping that this

851
01:14:19,052 --> 01:14:24,472
could be a surprise that I could spring on you, but I might as well be forthcoming where it's at.

852
01:14:24,812 --> 01:14:34,132
I was hoping that during this episode that I could surprise you with a, the tease of a eventual

853
01:14:34,132 --> 01:14:42,732
interview with the voice of Botanicus, Ron Knight. But I cannot officially do that at this time. I

854
01:14:42,732 --> 01:14:49,892
did send an email. I found that he's a professional VO artist and I found his website, which is like

855
01:14:49,892 --> 01:14:58,512
KnightMediaCom.com and I emailed him and I did get a response, but it was rather vague and I have to

856
01:14:58,512 --> 01:15:03,492
keep pursuing. Right. But I am hoping to be, my dream of dreams was to come into this episode

857
01:15:03,492 --> 01:15:09,892
and tell you, or even like, and now behind the door and then he's in your house. But this is not

858
01:15:09,952 --> 01:15:17,552
true, but there's, I will say there's a possibility. I'm hoping there was a response. I don't want to say

859
01:15:17,552 --> 01:15:23,192
much more than that, but I'm hoping that Ron Knight, the voice of Botanicus will someday appear on the

860
01:15:23,192 --> 01:15:28,732
show. And also, and I'll send goodwill. I'll send my healing touch to you to hopefully in hopes that

861
01:15:28,732 --> 01:15:39,872
William Cotswinkle may soon appear. There's a little, little bit of hope for Ron Knight. I'm just going to

862
01:15:40,232 --> 01:15:46,852
be on show friends. Cotswinkle. Speak to us. William Cotswinkle. Unknown entity.

863
01:15:48,792 --> 01:15:52,372
What else we got? Well, you said Nocturnal Fears, which was in a, but you can read all about this.

864
01:15:52,472 --> 01:15:58,452
Just look up ET Nocturnal Fears and it's a horrifying story. No Botanicus in it where ET,

865
01:15:58,772 --> 01:16:05,992
evil aliens come down to the earth and they capture all the kids and torture Elliot. And excuse me,

866
01:16:05,992 --> 01:16:12,532
ET has to come back and save Elliot from just being tortured. Like it's. God. Elliot eat shit in all these movies.

867
01:16:12,532 --> 01:16:19,692
I don't, that scared me as a kid. Elliot stripped to his underwear by like a man. Oh my God. I hated that.

868
01:16:20,172 --> 01:16:24,932
I didn't watch the movie for years because of that. Yeah. Over the Spielberg filmography, perhaps I would

869
01:16:24,932 --> 01:16:30,672
watch Schindler's List first before I would re-watch the, that's, that's not accurate and I have not seen

870
01:16:30,672 --> 01:16:35,972
Schindler's List. So I, I just wanted to be a big man and say that there's a, but it's one of the

871
01:16:36,632 --> 01:16:42,192
entire filmography and I wouldn't willingly, I wouldn't love to watch it. There is also, and it's not

872
01:16:42,192 --> 01:16:50,752
available on the, in the Apple store anymore. There was an iOS game called ET The Green Planet.

873
01:16:50,992 --> 01:16:55,212
Yeah. Have you watched this? And I've watched a little bit of it. I believe Botanicus is involved.

874
01:16:55,532 --> 01:17:01,112
Botanicus gives you all the commands in it. I have some screenshots on my phone. I can read you some

875
01:17:01,312 --> 01:17:05,232
of the brilliant Botanicus dialogue. Oh great. That's great. The game is called I think, the green,

876
01:17:05,232 --> 01:17:09,912
ET The Green Planet. It was, yeah. It was an iPhone game. Some pretty, and he looks, he looks very odd.

877
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:13,932
I can show you guys this photo later, but he's wearing, he's wearing that wreath, but he doesn't

878
01:17:13,932 --> 01:17:18,572
look like he does in the ride. He's a lot more kind of, honestly kind of like ape-like. Yeah.

879
01:17:18,612 --> 01:17:24,772
And kind of, and like, like big, big doofy smile. Not, not the Botanicus we know from the ride.

880
01:17:24,792 --> 01:17:29,732
Right. Some standard stuff. The planet is dying. Only ET's healing touch can save us. We must work

881
01:17:29,732 --> 01:17:35,432
quickly to restore beauty to our world. So, oh, interesting. Oh yes. Well, I'd love to help ET,

882
01:17:35,572 --> 01:17:40,432
just like in the ride. Please let me help save the planet. Next line. First, clear away some of these

883
01:17:40,432 --> 01:17:46,252
blighted rocks to make way for new life. Tap on the blighted rock and clear it. Tap the XP symbol.

884
01:17:46,532 --> 01:17:50,292
So this is, it's essentially, and there's a couple ET games that are like this that are essentially

885
01:17:50,292 --> 01:17:55,112
gardening. Yes. That's what they're like. They're sort of like pseudo farmvilles. Right. This one's

886
01:17:55,112 --> 01:17:59,532
pseudo farmville. And it's so boring. There's these other creatures who I think are in the book

887
01:17:59,532 --> 01:18:06,312
too, that are called like, oh, what are they? They're like mini something or others. I don't

888
01:18:06,312 --> 01:18:12,112
know, but you like plant these little creatures. Microtechs. Oh yeah. They're like your little

889
01:18:12,112 --> 01:18:16,712
slaves who tend to your garden so you don't have to. Right. They're like picking strawberries for

890
01:18:16,712 --> 01:18:22,472
you. And it's, I don't know, it's very weird and slow and depressing. And then you get, I just,

891
01:18:22,472 --> 01:18:28,192
I got like 10 minutes in and I saw this. Would you like to pay a microtech 50 nutrients to tend

892
01:18:28,192 --> 01:18:34,912
the lotta sapling? It will take two months to grow the next phase. Wow. Does that mean literally

893
01:18:34,912 --> 01:18:41,072
two months? In real time or in game time? I don't think it is. It's like this shore. You have to

894
01:18:41,072 --> 01:18:47,372
keep this garden. This thing was a couple of years old and it's not hard to see why it didn't last.

895
01:18:47,372 --> 01:18:53,892
This is still around. This is like how Mike is still committed to Simpsons Tap Out. I do still

896
01:18:53,892 --> 01:18:58,852
play Simpsons Tap Out. Somehow. Six or seven years later. Six or seven years later. Which I think I

897
01:18:58,852 --> 01:19:05,312
tapped out after a few months. You go to your Simpsons Tap Out, Springfield, and it's just a

898
01:19:05,312 --> 01:19:10,052
vacant field and it's still there. Because it lost the data and I never was able to log back in.

899
01:19:10,392 --> 01:19:15,692
I think I lasted a little longer on the Riverdale Rescue, the Archie one. And I can't redownload

900
01:19:16,212 --> 01:19:20,212
developers. Oh, it's gone. It closed. It closed. Yeah, because we were playing that for a long time

901
01:19:20,212 --> 01:19:25,232
and that's a whole... There's no reason to do a play train episode about the Archie comics

902
01:19:25,232 --> 01:19:33,552
tap to game. But I'd like to. Just pay some microtechs to rebuild your Springfields. I'm sure you

903
01:19:33,552 --> 01:19:38,972
can cart them over. Use the Wreck-It Ralph like Depot where all the video game characters change

904
01:19:40,532 --> 01:19:49,112
games and yeah. Well, now that's just that. Depot is now just different three letter stock names.

905
01:19:49,112 --> 01:19:54,172
All the video game stuff has been replaced by portals to different publicly held companies.

906
01:19:54,852 --> 01:19:58,532
Kids love that shit. Right. Ralph's going to go.com.

907
01:20:01,052 --> 01:20:06,192
Just to sum up, Botanicus is a character that has not fully been explored. It's the same thing I've

908
01:20:06,192 --> 01:20:12,032
been saying on Screen Juggies for four years. When are we going to get a definitive story about

909
01:20:12,032 --> 01:20:18,312
him? His origin story, who he was as a young man. Let's really learn about him. And they're trying...

910
01:20:18,312 --> 01:20:23,512
These are all very lazy versions of it, this iOS game. And that's very strange that all of a sudden

911
01:20:23,512 --> 01:20:29,052
like 2009, they're like, let's make an app that has the ET. Yeah, finally we got to bring... People

912
01:20:29,052 --> 01:20:33,112
are demanding the flop couple and the microtechs and the gourds. If an original movie, like an

913
01:20:33,212 --> 01:20:41,472
original IP, like ET, like a movie was a smash hit, there would be so... Instantly, there would be

914
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:48,592
so much stuff and probably very safeguarded stuff or some cheapy license stuff. But it is odd, this

915
01:20:48,592 --> 01:20:53,672
super successful movie has the weirdest modern day merch. It's bizarre. It doesn't make any sense and

916
01:20:53,672 --> 01:20:58,672
it doesn't hint the movie, as we said before, the movie doesn't hint toward this actual mythology.

917
01:20:58,832 --> 01:21:04,972
Doesn't make any sense. There was an idea floating around the Screen Junkies offices for a long time

918
01:21:04,972 --> 01:21:12,012
that I would get to interview Spielberg on a junket and ask him about all this stuff. And that would

919
01:21:12,012 --> 01:21:16,732
be all. I wouldn't talk to him about like Bridge of Spies or anything. I would just over and over

920
01:21:16,732 --> 01:21:21,832
ask about Botanicus and pitch him ideas for things, but that never came. I'm sure he would have been down to play ball.

921
01:21:21,832 --> 01:21:27,332
Oh yeah, he would have loved that. I'm sure that would have been a fun part. As all Screen Junkies,

922
01:21:27,332 --> 01:21:34,032
press junkets did, he would have ended up seeing over your wedding. Just like Mundy in the Rock.

923
01:21:34,052 --> 01:21:38,012
That's true, that's a good point. Yeah, he would have been your efficient. And Botanicus would have

924
01:21:38,012 --> 01:21:47,312
been my best man. You may now kiss my orb. You will be united in time forever. What's that music coming?

925
01:21:47,472 --> 01:21:54,752
What's that? It sounds like Andriks coming for the lobby. Oh, it's Pot Tanakush. He's crashing the wedding.

926
01:21:54,772 --> 01:22:03,412
But he's got enough edibles for everyone. Only have one bite of this wedding cake or you'll be freaking out.

927
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:11,152
We jamin. I mean, there's never been a thing that needs more merch than Pot Tanakus.

928
01:22:11,672 --> 01:22:16,492
Yeah, yeah. Pot Tanakush. Pot Tanakush. Excuse me, I'm sorry. You've been recording a lot today.

929
01:22:16,492 --> 01:22:22,492
In the great tradition of like Pothead, Rasta, Bart Simpson. Yes. I want some knockoff. We should,

930
01:22:22,492 --> 01:22:28,772
maybe that's the idea. Maybe we make a Pot Tanakush shirt that's like of the quality of knockoff parts.

931
01:22:28,772 --> 01:22:39,992
Well, we need to make a hashtag Botanicus shirt. Sure, there'll be a traditional flavor. A traditional flavor Botanicus shirt and then a really dirt like truck stop shirt.

932
01:22:39,992 --> 01:22:45,912
Which is just kind of the same shirt, but it's just like a really janky looking joint sticking out his back.

933
01:22:47,472 --> 01:22:55,312
Yeah. Oh, well, we'll get right on that. Yeah, I like that idea. Any other feelings you guys have to sum up about our friend Botanicus?

934
01:22:56,812 --> 01:23:07,432
I love him, want to see more of him and I want him to mellow out. I can't wait to see him in his true state.

935
01:23:08,152 --> 01:23:14,252
All right, Jason. I also can't wait to see you in his true state. Fucking baked.

936
01:23:14,252 --> 01:23:21,052
All right, so as the final thing now, I will play you a cover of a Botanicus song that I wrote.

937
01:23:21,092 --> 01:23:28,812
Oh. By a pop punk band and I'm not even sure. Let me see if I can find the name of the band because it's not prominently.

938
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:36,892
The YouTube, there's a, it's a YouTube channel called Pierced Liquid Nipples and there are three videos.

939
01:23:36,892 --> 01:23:48,532
One looks like it's a Simpson shitposting type video. One is a man in a misfits like half shirt playing guitar in a bedroom and the other is my song.

940
01:23:49,052 --> 01:23:57,872
Wow, that's crazy. Well, so to sign off, I guess this will play us out. So you survived podcast The Ride The Second Gate.

941
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:02,612
And Mike, anything you'd like to plug?

942
01:24:03,112 --> 01:24:08,372
Oh, no, I mean, hashtag Botanicus and hashtag pot Tanacush.

943
01:24:08,952 --> 01:24:13,232
Yeah. Wow. We didn't know we were going to come out of this for the second hashtag.

944
01:24:13,552 --> 01:24:21,372
And it feels great. We're creating IP every, every episode, but this IP, I think is right caught above even the stuff we've created at this point.

945
01:24:21,592 --> 01:24:28,772
The money. And yeah, now here to play us out the song about your original hashtag. Take it away.

946
01:25:10,404 --> 01:25:16,864
Guys, this is late breaking news. I said that this would happen if I got a response, but I did get,

947
01:25:16,924 --> 01:25:23,144
after we recorded this Botanica's episode, I got an email from the book, the author of The Green

948
01:25:23,144 --> 01:25:29,084
Planet, William Kotzwinkle. I emailed his blog. I didn't know if he was running it or whatever,

949
01:25:29,084 --> 01:25:35,304
but I got an email from him. This is the man, this was like a week later. And this is, so basically

950
01:25:35,304 --> 01:25:42,084
I asked him, I said, I have a question. We're doing some podcasts about the ET ride. I just wanted to

951
01:25:42,084 --> 01:25:47,864
know, did you create all the characters, specifically Botanicus? And he, and he has responded,

952
01:25:48,344 --> 01:25:53,904
dear Mike, thanks for your email, except for ET himself. I created all the characters in the book

953
01:25:53,904 --> 01:26:00,304
of The Green Planet and that includes Botanicus exclamation point. Good luck with your podcasts.

954
01:26:00,404 --> 01:26:11,684
Best wishes from ET and me, Bill. I mean, a fun, sweet email from this man. He created Botanicus.

955
01:26:12,104 --> 01:26:12,944
This man-

956
01:26:12,944 --> 01:26:14,544
You corresponded with the creator of Botanicus.

957
01:26:14,704 --> 01:26:20,224
Yes, this man did it. He created all of this and then they just used all this IP he created

958
01:26:20,224 --> 01:26:24,504
for the ride, which is pretty crazy. So it's sort of what we suspected, but I was still thinking

959
01:26:24,504 --> 01:26:31,344
there was some Amblin think tank or whatever, and here's some other concepts or ideas. No, no,

960
01:26:31,504 --> 01:26:37,164
just this man made everything up. And then they were like, yeah, let's use that crap for the ride.

961
01:26:37,624 --> 01:26:42,224
That's how it used to be done. And not like nowadays where they put like 20 people in a

962
01:26:42,224 --> 01:26:45,824
writer's room of like, all right, what are these Transformers going to do next?

963
01:26:46,224 --> 01:26:46,384
Sure.

964
01:26:46,384 --> 01:26:53,524
That's very true that all of pop culture now is like very stiff corporate keep up of a mythology

965
01:26:53,904 --> 01:27:01,484
that was shit out by an old man 45 years ago. It was like, try to get off work to go to the bar.

966
01:27:01,504 --> 01:27:08,024
Everyone sit the fuck down. We're not going home until we figure out what kind of car,

967
01:27:08,384 --> 01:27:10,844
strawberry shortcake fucking drives.

968
01:27:12,964 --> 01:27:13,384
So yeah.

969
01:27:13,424 --> 01:27:14,224
Strawberry mobile.

970
01:27:14,504 --> 01:27:15,804
Sure sounds good. Everybody go home.

971
01:27:16,124 --> 01:27:22,304
There is a very good chance that Botanicus gets used in like a high profile something in the next

972
01:27:22,664 --> 01:27:23,244
50 years.

973
01:27:23,624 --> 01:27:26,364
Being the, oh, they'll, they'll exploit ET in some further way.

974
01:27:26,484 --> 01:27:27,724
Right. As soon as everyone's.

975
01:27:27,724 --> 01:27:31,104
That's the, I mean, one of the highest grossing films ever. Just sitting there with nothing to

976
01:27:31,104 --> 01:27:31,544
be done.

977
01:27:31,744 --> 01:27:35,264
Yeah. I mean, a lot of the Spielberg stuff is sitting there until he dies or a couple other

978
01:27:35,264 --> 01:27:39,464
people die and then it's, it's open season. But at that point, I think they'll be going

979
01:27:39,464 --> 01:27:45,264
through the archives. And again, like this gentleman, William Kotzwinkle created Botanicus

980
01:27:45,264 --> 01:27:51,044
and perhaps, you know, we'll see movie after movie after movie exploring all of his characters.

981
01:27:51,044 --> 01:27:52,704
So credit him properly.

982
01:27:53,084 --> 01:28:01,224
Based on characters created by William Kotzwinkle and let's have ET at the end of the ride after

983
01:28:01,224 --> 01:28:04,104
he says, goodbye to all of you.

984
01:28:04,524 --> 01:28:07,404
Mom, my friends were created by William Kotzwinkle.

985
01:28:07,404 --> 01:28:09,364
Thank you, Bill.

986
01:28:09,764 --> 01:28:10,524
Thank you.

987
01:28:10,944 --> 01:28:12,424
You created everyone but me.

988
01:28:12,584 --> 01:28:13,564
Thank you, daddy.

989
01:28:13,864 --> 01:28:14,984
Kotzwinkle.

990
01:28:15,584 --> 01:28:17,344
Botanicus said, thank you, daddy.

991
01:28:17,464 --> 01:28:18,364
Kotzwinkle.

992
01:28:18,544 --> 01:28:20,884
When you walk through the queue, that would be the greatest.

993
01:28:21,724 --> 01:28:25,664
Man. So it seems like, you know, it's also nice. It seems like he has some affection for this

994
01:28:25,664 --> 01:28:28,584
or he just thinks I'm like a nine-year-old.

995
01:28:28,584 --> 01:28:31,044
Including Botanicus.

996
01:28:31,044 --> 01:28:34,904
Right. He's like, best wishes from ET and me. And then he's like, a dumb kid.

997
01:28:35,264 --> 01:28:39,524
He's not like, oh, there must be a 34-year-old man on the other side of this email.

998
01:28:40,124 --> 01:28:41,984
No, he's just like, oh, that's great.

999
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:45,904
But he could tell you're not a nine-year-old kid because what nine-year-old kid would give a

1000
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:47,484
fuck about the ET adventure.

1001
01:28:47,604 --> 01:28:52,424
It's a good point. So he must know that I'm of a certain age, you would hope.

1002
01:28:52,944 --> 01:28:54,464
So anyway, very exciting.

1003
01:28:55,084 --> 01:28:58,444
We're going to have probably more Botanicus scoops after this episode comes out.

1004
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:02,684
But you know, for now, that's the most up-to-date scoop we have.

1005
01:29:02,784 --> 01:29:06,504
And I exchanged one more email with voice of Botanicus, Ron Knight,

1006
01:29:06,524 --> 01:29:08,384
but I have nothing further to report yet.

1007
01:29:08,484 --> 01:29:09,584
I hope that changes.

1008
01:29:09,584 --> 01:29:12,744
But I swear to you guys and to the audience, I'm trying.

1009
01:29:13,144 --> 01:29:14,204
Thank you. We appreciate it.

1010
01:29:14,204 --> 01:29:17,204
Jason, if you could do a little more work on this Botanicus stuff,

1011
01:29:17,204 --> 01:29:18,664
I think we would appreciate it.

1012
01:29:18,664 --> 01:29:21,724
So I don't know what the angle is, but just think about it.

1013
01:29:22,184 --> 01:29:25,224
Find the man who sewed his big leaf.

1014
01:29:25,604 --> 01:29:26,424
Yeah, sure.

1015
01:29:26,684 --> 01:29:27,604
Find the leaf man.

1016
01:29:27,844 --> 01:29:27,984
Bonnet.

1017
01:29:28,084 --> 01:29:31,764
Find where his staff was manufactured.

1018
01:29:32,364 --> 01:29:35,404
Yeah, if you could find the staff manufacturer, that would be really good.

1019
01:29:35,564 --> 01:29:36,644
So please.

1020
01:29:37,044 --> 01:29:39,464
Anyway, that's been the end of the addendum.

1021
01:29:40,064 --> 01:29:42,824
You've survived the podcast, the Ride Second Gate addendum.

1022
01:29:43,964 --> 01:29:46,424
And yeah, we'll see you on the Green Planet.
