1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:24,520
Hey, that little screen in front of you, it's not just for playing little ping pong games,

3
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,520
okay?

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,960
It's a cockpit on a jet fighter that's pointed at a place called the Information Superhighway.

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,240
So if you're a cyber nut like me, strap yourself in, hang on tight and try not to wet yourself.

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,240
That's my little intro, that's my little cyber intro for today's podcast.

7
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,040
The podcast is the ride of the cyber gate.

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,120
I'm Scott Gardner, cyber Scott Gardner.

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,120
Mike, I don't know how to do this fast enough.

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,720
I'll just put all those things on.

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,320
Mike cyber, yeah, yeah, mainframe, cyber.

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,320
Mainframe, Mike Carlson.

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,160
Great, mainframe, Mike Carlson and Jason Superhighway then.

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,160
Why not?

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,200
Yeah, I was going to say jacked in Jason.

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,200
Oh, that's good.

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Jacked in Jason.

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,440
Well, that's the attitude.

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,560
That's the grit.

20
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,560
That is the attitude.

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,800
This special has that we're talking about today.

22
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,480
It seems very likely like one that you have not heard of, but we're excited to talk about

23
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,480
it.

24
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,320
It's called Cybermania 94, the ultimate gamer awards.

25
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:37,800
It is just, it is a wonderful two hour mess of cyberpunk and hacker culture and that information

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:46,280
superhighway shit and CD-ROMs and the future is here and the future is now and the craziest

27
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,760
graphics and the most camera moves you've ever seen.

28
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,880
This special is something.

29
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,960
This is a real time capsule, a very specific type of 90s.

30
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,960
It's a masterpiece.

31
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,960
Hell yeah.

32
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,240
I'm so glad you feel the same way.

33
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,320
Yeah, as I kept saying today, I watched it honestly this morning.

34
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,880
I kept saying there's a little treat for me around every turn.

35
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,680
Yeah, there's a new fun thing from all the different things that I like or I'm intrigued

36
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,680
by.

37
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,640
All of a sudden it hits you, oh, it's an old, old actor that suddenly appears or his picture

38
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,760
appears.

39
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,240
There's a younger actor.

40
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,000
All of a sudden there's just some completely head scratching little documentary in the

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,920
middle of it about hackers.

42
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,240
You go, what is this?

43
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,200
It's just like every, because these things tend to like, anytime we've done some one

44
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,080
off award show or whatever, you're like, ah, there's some funny stuff in there and we like

45
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,080
it and it's great.

46
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
They can drag.

47
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
But they can drag.

48
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,520
They certainly drag and you try to find the highlights.

49
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,360
There was just one I already don't remember.

50
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,520
This thing we're talking about today filmed at Universal Studios Hollywood.

51
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,280
So you get your shots, you get your overhead helicopter shots, all that stuff.

52
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,320
I like anything that was shot at Universal Hollywood in the 90s.

53
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,160
But we just watched one that started so strong.

54
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,600
I forget what it was called even.

55
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:12,240
It was like some Olympics that included every kid from every show of that era.

56
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:19,680
All the TGIFs and all the Nickelodeons and like the Fox, whatever.

57
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,960
So we're like, oh, we are amped on this thing.

58
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,680
And then it just got a little boring.

59
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,600
Of course it's exciting when they're playing games on the Miami Vice stunt show set.

60
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,720
But after the fourth round of the same thing, you kind of know all the tricks up this thing's

61
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
sleeve.

62
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,440
This, we didn't finish it.

63
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,840
This thing, I cannot wait.

64
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,720
It's around every turn.

65
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
They keep spicing up.

66
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,320
This is an innovative award show entertaining at all times.

67
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
Yeah, you're right.

68
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,560
It doesn't have one thing that it does.

69
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,840
Oh, it's just funny that it drags an old actor out.

70
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,840
We haven't seen.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,800
It's got 10 moves.

72
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,920
If it's a ride, I talk about moments or types of moments.

73
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,840
It has 20 types of moments.

74
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,680
An old person using technology terms wrong or clearly they're using the term and they

75
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,760
don't know what they're talking about.

76
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,760
This happens regularly, but that's not all.

77
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,760
It's so much more.

78
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,760
Yeah.

79
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,720
An impersonator of a famous woman gets burnt in the face.

80
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
Why?

81
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
What?

82
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,720
Right off the bat.

83
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
Pointlessly.

84
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,080
When this thing came on, I didn't think that would happen.

85
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,080
No.

86
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:27,240
You know, when you first told us this, I think within 15 seconds of you saying it, I went

87
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,520
in, I think when you told us the host, I was like, I'm on board.

88
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,960
And I was like, and then you kept talking about it.

89
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,560
And I think at the time I was like, oh, I don't, I think we're on board.

90
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,000
I don't think he has to sell it to.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,880
And then I realized looking back, I'm like, I think you were just so excited, but didn't

92
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,920
want to spoil any of this because there's some stuff where I was like, not in a million

93
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:55,920
years would I have expected some of these appearances by people who would be bigger,

94
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,480
people who were big at the time, people who continue to be big.

95
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,080
There's no way to predict.

96
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,400
Like, if you're watching the MTV movie awards from the same year, you maybe know who you're

97
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
getting.

98
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,680
You know, who is in big movies at the time or who is gettable or on MTV a lot.

99
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,400
This thing, there's no way to predict.

100
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,960
If you put a gun to my head at every every before every presenter announcement and said,

101
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,480
name a thousand names, I would probably not guess some of who's coming.

102
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,520
I almost think that if you've made it this far here, go watch this.

103
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,600
If you like watching this type of weird and old nostalgia type entertainment of something

104
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,480
you never saw before, actually watch the whole thing before listening to us.

105
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
Yes, this one's good.

106
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,440
This is I don't think this is one where we're like rescuing the fun moments.

107
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,600
As we said, it doesn't really drag.

108
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
It is really good.

109
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
It's on YouTube.

110
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,760
The user is learned to counter easy to find.

111
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,040
And I totally agree.

112
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,480
So then this can be kind of a kind of a talk along.

113
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
I absolutely agree.

114
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,480
Go finish it.

115
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,200
Aaron felt that Aaron was devouring this thing.

116
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
We could not wait to.

117
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,080
I'm so glad we have more of this special left.

118
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,240
I wanted to drag it out all week.

119
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,920
Yeah, 17 notes.

120
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,080
I want it like 17 bullet points in addition of clips.

121
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,440
I have so many clips.

122
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
I have so many.

123
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,720
I assumed you're writing down anything I was having a reaction to it and then I had to

124
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,520
start formatting it because I have to break this up or I'm going to forget.

125
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,520
Yeah, I know.

126
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,000
We're all coming in with the same energy.

127
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's a pile.

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,640
It's confusing, but just like the special itself.

129
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,640
We should clarify.

130
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,320
It is two hours in the YouTube video.

131
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,000
That includes the very good period appropriate 1994 commercials.

132
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,120
Yes, because they bought this other time.

133
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,960
They're all related.

134
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,200
This is all about like a lot of it is video games.

135
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,760
So there will be awards given to games that you know or grew up with unless you're younger

136
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,760
than people.

137
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,000
OK, unless you're a certain age and then you don't know any of it.

138
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,600
But, you know, it's relatively accessible, I think.

139
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:03,720
And the ads are for big games of the Arab to they're all planned or just about computers

140
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:10,160
or about movies stemming from video game franchises, which I forgot about.

141
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,200
I somehow never saw that movie.

142
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,880
Me neither. I kind of want to do it.

143
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,720
I want to track it down either.

144
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,560
Yeah, that is that is intriguing to me because I love those.

145
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,720
I spent hours on those video games.

146
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,400
Yeah, in that case, we just spoiled that one.

147
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,880
That is Double Dragon.

148
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,440
The movie with Scott Wolf and directed by a guy who directed most of the big Phil Collins

149
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,480
music videos.

150
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,320
Oh, my God.

151
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,880
Yes. All the credits were great.

152
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,000
He directed Dennis Miller's stand up specials.

153
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,480
It's an insane body of work.

154
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,640
I forgot his name.

155
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,520
By the way, if we haven't had this up, you said Dennis Miller and I'm just like,

156
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,720
Dennis Miller comes up in this fucking thing.

157
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,240
Like, there's so many people who come up in this thing.

158
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,240
Like I was saying before we started, I watched some of it yesterday and then I was going

159
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,760
to bed and I saw I had watched 90 minutes and there were still 30 left.

160
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,960
And that was a negative thing.

161
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,040
I was just like, I can't believe there's more.

162
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,880
Like, it's just kind of pummels you.

163
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,840
Yes, you're exhausted in a good way.

164
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,840
Exciting things.

165
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,800
Theme park day.

166
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,360
Well, let me now attribute all of this excitement to one of our listeners, one of our patrons,

167
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,400
Robert Denby, who alerted us to this.

168
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,360
I don't think even in a pitching an episode way, I don't think that was the intent.

169
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:33,760
It was related, honestly, to Charles Fleischer, who appears in this and we'll get to that

170
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,760
when it's his time.

171
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,480
But we just talked about Charles Fleischer and the weirdness of Charles Fleischer when

172
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,640
talking about another great special, the Disneyland 35th anniversary.

173
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,240
And thank you, Robert, for the paragraph explaining everything that was to come.

174
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:55,480
And I just like the phrase Cybermania 94 just jumped out at me and like, huh?

175
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,360
OK, that needs to be meditated on a little more.

176
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:05,160
And within the just just to say some of what Robert said, and I'll let him introduce

177
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,160
really the first big notable stars who call to you.

178
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:15,360
There's an amazing attempt at a video game award show called Cybermania 94, hosted by

179
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,080
Leslie Nielsen and Jonathan Taylor Thomas.

180
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,840
Did A.I. create this for me to watch?

181
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,640
That is exactly that is something that we said.

182
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,040
Like by the time a certain band who we talk about all the time appeared out of nowhere.

183
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,760
Erin and I said, I'm worried that we fell into an A.I.

184
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,520
trap and that it is being live created for us.

185
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,040
And we especially started thinking that when an award was accepted and two names were

186
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,040
said by whoever was accepting the award and Erin said, I know those names, my parents

187
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,080
know those people.

188
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,680
They were people like in the periphery of Warner Brothers.

189
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,960
They were like media executives at the time and they were thanked in a speech.

190
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,360
And Erin texted her mom and said, do you know these people?

191
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,760
And one of them, she said, yes, this guy, really nice guy.

192
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,280
Why are you asking? Is it because that person died last week?

193
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,400
Huh? What?

194
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:20,000
Somebody that Erin has never mentioned or or like once maybe has like and this person

195
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,080
passed away last week.

196
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,720
What do you mean? That made that got me freaked out.

197
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Maybe we are. And look, Robert, thank you for this.

198
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,440
And you're suggesting unless you are an A.I.

199
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,000
creation who's trying to snare us in some kind of A.I.

200
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,240
trap, I don't think so.

201
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,600
I trust you. You're a second gate subscriber.

202
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,480
So I trust you.

203
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,360
Or it's like it's like we are living in a simulation and the simulation realizes that

204
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,120
we've kind of like we're getting towards the end of YouTube crap that we haven't seen.

205
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,600
Yeah, it's like we've got to start just creating stuff for because they're going to

206
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,280
lose us. We'll stop watching.

207
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,920
We're almost out. We've almost fully.

208
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,640
This keg is tapped.

209
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,240
So we think until something like Cybermania comes.

210
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,080
This is a trick by the Google Corporation.

211
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,920
Giant Net is going to come over this garage and get us shit.

212
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:10,760
Shit. Well, this is the kind of like cyber paranoia that much of the special warns about.

213
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,680
And that is the tone of a lot of the games of this era.

214
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,880
But let me we'll get back to Leslie and J.T.T.

215
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,520
But another thing, Robert said, Cybermania 94 is a great time because it's trying to be a serious

216
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,160
celebration of video games when a lot of people thought FMV was the future.

217
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,400
But it has Kids Choice Awards sensibilities and bizarre interstitials to keep the audience's

218
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,440
attention, including a guy in a balloon suit who just wanders around stage while Leslie

219
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,680
Nielsen is talking.

220
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,200
I. Yeah, that's a great description.

221
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,600
Why does that happen?

222
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,080
I've now that I've watched it, I don't have any further understanding of why it happens.

223
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,920
No, because I was watching on my computer and I was like, oh, is there like a famous person

224
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,320
maybe? And I looked and I was like, I don't think so.

225
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,200
No. And once his balloon is popped, I didn't further recognize the balloon man.

226
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,680
No. Yeah. There are famous people later that do a little bit famous to me and Jason.

227
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,000
Yeah, I assume they would be.

228
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
Yeah, not to me.

229
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,440
Very excited. Again, that's a late third quarter, fourth quarter.

230
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,720
Oh, my God. They keep them coming.

231
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,000
I got a clip from the last sentence.

232
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,280
It's said in this thing.

233
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,680
It never stops. So thank you again, Robert.

234
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,560
And Robert mentioned something called FMV.

235
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,360
And I have to admit ignorance on this.

236
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,000
I didn't know what FMV was a phrase also used by my friend Tyler, who I sent this to

237
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,360
as a big CD-ROM guy who as he was watching this, he's like, I know every single game

238
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,960
that is being played. So he was excited about it.

239
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,000
But I had to I'm a dummy.

240
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,120
I wasn't paying attention in this era.

241
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,520
I feel like I missed the boy.

242
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,240
I wish I knew the CD-ROM era better.

243
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,120
But FMV is full motion video.

244
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,960
And so while some of these are more typical games, you know, like Street Fighter and

245
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,520
Mortal Kombat, there's also a lot of games that you've never heard of because the CD-ROM

246
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,080
era ended not too long after this.

247
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,240
I guess just general kind of Internet world superseded that.

248
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,040
And the CD-ROM boom went bust.

249
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,720
But full motion video is like if it is interactive, but there is also there are also

250
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,560
videos, usually very small and very tiny boxes that move the game forward.

251
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,960
If I am remembering correctly, it moves very choppy.

252
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,480
Like it looks a little it's very a thing that'll come up later.

253
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,360
It's very Revolution X.

254
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,680
Big time. You know.

255
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,480
Well, and also like if you if you guys ever have you made GIFs, have you like gone in

256
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,840
some GIF creator program?

257
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,120
It's when you're like trying to make the file small and you have to limit colors,

258
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,400
they kind of end up looking like this.

259
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,520
Like a lot. You can tell there is not the full wide range of color information that

260
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,720
a usual video would have.

261
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,720
I find the aesthetic very charming and I love seeing a big pile of that stuff here.

262
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,160
Yeah, I do, too. And I remember at the time being very like every people.

263
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,840
This would get people like if I was at a friend's house or they were at mine or be

264
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,800
in stores and be like, wow, look, a little movie on the computer.

265
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,600
Yeah, through like the 90s, I think the idea was like, OK, this is the future of like

266
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,640
video games and entertainment, which I guess is sort of like a way to do VR, which is

267
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,800
just shooting it. It's not graphics.

268
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,400
It's just actual video. Yeah.

269
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,960
Because like the sky, we talked about the Scottie Pippen Sega CD game, which had a

270
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,280
lot of like in like actual shot footage of Scottie Pippen.

271
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,560
Right. And I played a game called Star Trek Borg, which was just an episode of Star

272
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,960
Trek Voyager, essentially.

273
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,760
But then you would click on parts of the screen to decide what you were going to do.

274
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,520
Oh, so like good.

275
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,320
It was kind of I mean, it was kind of cool because it had John Delancey who plays Q

276
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,960
and he was like being like snarky toward you.

277
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,680
And then he'd ask you to do something or ask you what you wanted to do and you click

278
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,560
around. Oftentimes, I didn't know what I should be doing, but it was still kind of

279
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,160
cool to play like it did kind of live up to the idea of you're like in the game.

280
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:08,320
But ultimately, I don't think ultimately it wasn't so satisfying for like versus a

281
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,120
video game. Yeah, it was an interesting time because like even watching this, you can

282
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,320
see people like what is a CD realm?

283
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,680
Like what how far can we push this?

284
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,440
Should we try this? Should we try?

285
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,440
Should we try more of these M&MV videos or should we try more like gameplay gameplay?

286
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,360
Yeah, they're figuring it out.

287
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,200
And it's also a pretty crucial juncture, one that I don't think I was fully aware

288
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:40,040
happened, which is as with any big media trend, when when do you pull the trigger

289
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,240
and get celebrities in on this?

290
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,480
When do you start using recognizable actors?

291
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,800
And that's what happens.

292
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,040
That's what's happening here.

293
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,920
And I don't know how long it lasted for, but it really flashed me to how like it's

294
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,880
really it's just like every flash in the pan.

295
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,400
There's always the like and it's going to be the next big thing you'll see.

296
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,720
Oh, you'll see everybody's getting in on it, whether it's when all the celebrities

297
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,440
start doing podcasts and then abandon the field to die or the NFT.

298
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,920
No, it's all about NFTs.

299
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,040
And then by the end of the year, it's not even close to all that NFT.

300
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,920
Like we've lived through so many of the quibbys.

301
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
It's all about it's going to be all about quibbys.

302
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,240
Yeah, all about videos you watch in the bank line.

303
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,840
And it just just reminds you like, boy, I guess it's been this way for a long time.

304
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,880
There's always an insane boom.

305
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,440
And then the technology is left standing and it just sort of becomes integrated in

306
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,280
much more.

307
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,680
Yeah, somewhat reasonable way.

308
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:44,320
Friendly. Yeah. And like all of the things that are specifically for this media kind

309
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,800
of fade away and die.

310
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,080
You can sort of feel it happen.

311
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,760
Like, I don't I don't think we're I think things will be happening with VR and

312
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,840
Oculus and all that.

313
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,320
But like I remember a lot of people I knew took general meetings at some like we're

314
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,520
you know, we're doing interactive comedy videos for the Oculus.

315
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,080
Remember all those everybody?

316
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,520
Yeah, I do.

317
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,040
I'm sure you're all still in stitches that you're I don't even know if they got made.

318
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,480
And we're all rewatching them.

319
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,360
For sure.

320
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,400
And of course, with all these things.

321
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,880
Well, and as with your relatedly, aesthetically and the era like Disney quest, you

322
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,280
know, of course you're going back.

323
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,080
You're definitely doing it again.

324
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,560
Yeah.

325
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:18,960
Of course.

326
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:26,800
I think well, yeah, we have seen a lot of these, as you said, NFTs, VR, all of this.

327
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,520
We're seeing AI right now, which is now become clear.

328
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,360
It kind of sucks.

329
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,720
It pretty much sucks.

330
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,160
And there's a big article, I think just this week, a giant article of the sheer

331
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,680
amount of human labor that goes into, quote unquote, training these VR systems.

332
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,400
Oh, OK.

333
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,960
Are you are AI?

334
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,880
AI. Yeah.

335
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,680
I was an article about like AI school, essentially.

336
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,040
I feel like I saw it, but didn't read it.

337
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:58,320
I think it's it's a thing where it's like being farmed out to other countries.

338
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,720
And it's like this computer isn't learning.

339
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,120
Humans are doing massive amounts of data entry.

340
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,240
Yeah.

341
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,880
To try and like get the gist of something.

342
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,360
But I'm sure those humans doing the data entry are being fairly compensated and treated well.

343
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,080
Oh, yeah.

344
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,200
Pennies on the dollar.

345
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,440
That's a nice phrase.

346
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,560
People say that in a complimentary way.

347
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,440
People love a penny. It's lucky.

348
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:26,520
Yeah, we just I mean, I'm sure we've all seen the AI secret invasion credits,

349
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,800
which is like, oh, this looks like talk shit.

350
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,600
Like this looks so ugly.

351
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,160
And it's like this is it.

352
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,360
I is a new this.

353
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,120
So you're right. I thought about that.

354
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,760
And it's the crazy thing on that is that Marvel has published countless comics

355
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:47,800
called Secret Invasion, pages and pages of art that they could have just pulled from.

356
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,080
And it's just like, oh, no, you got this weird goo.

357
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,960
Our abstract muck.

358
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,560
Yeah. Well, to be fair, look, I from to my eyes, the Marvel films have always celebrated weird goo.

359
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,680
That's right. That's what every one of them is to me.

360
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,200
But you're right. This is even worse looking goo than usual.

361
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,240
This is even worse.

362
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,320
And it's always funny when Disney, a company that's so like hyper focused on their image

363
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,960
and their family friend, they're like they just step in it.

364
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,000
Or is this like you are missing the motion of the you're missing the ball so hard on this?

365
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,920
Yeah. Yeah.

366
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:30,440
Well, it's it's almost a relief to see this in this AI era that suddenly that doesn't feel like

367
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,360
you were not talking about AI all the time two months ago.

368
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:40,040
And now it is just all that we I hope that this is a flash in the pan.

369
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,560
And look, I will admit, I don't like any of it.

370
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,840
And we're fighting against it with the writer's strike right now.

371
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,120
But would I like a fully AI generated award show?

372
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,200
Absolutely. Yeah.

373
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,360
I would. If only they would do something.

374
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,760
If only there was something as fun and aesthetically bizarre as Cyber Mania 94.

375
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,240
Yeah, there's not there's there's there's a couple I don't want to be in.

376
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,560
I'm not going to be like I love AI or anything, but there are some Twitter accounts that make like

377
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,720
fake AI 80s movies.

378
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,240
And I go, have you seen these?

379
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,200
Not those now. I go, oh, this looks good.

380
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,720
There's stills. I mean, there's stills, but they don't look they don't look as gooey as

381
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,160
what we're talking about with the secret invasion.

382
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,760
But yeah, there's select select ways that AI will just be in our lives within the next decade.

383
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,080
If we can have it around a little bit, but kind of like supervised by smart people.

384
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,640
Sure. Then that's that's how we should be doing it.

385
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,240
You can make online bill pay like a little less annoying.

386
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,000
Like if you could just automate this, you know.

387
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,520
Sure. Yeah. Yeah.

388
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,360
I don't want AI paying my bills, but I don't either.

389
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,920
But I'm just like, what if it's working to earn the money and pay your bill?

390
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,360
Oh, sure. Then maybe like to get what do they call that?

391
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:58,440
The games where like and you earn you earn money when you play this this mobile game.

392
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,160
Oh, yeah. I don't know.

393
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,440
What are the? Yeah, I know what you're saying.

394
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,040
I've seen those before, but I'm going to I'm trying to find this AI just to see.

395
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,840
They're called they're called sure things is what they're called.

396
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,720
My investment you can make my ticket to the top is what I like to call them now.

397
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,520
So, yeah. All right.

398
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,920
This this show, November 5th, 1994, a magical day, a magical evening.

399
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,280
This is put together by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences,

400
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,880
which I guess is a real thing. It is still a real thing.

401
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,440
I think they do a different award show now.

402
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,480
They did not keep doing the manias.

403
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,240
Apparently, there was a Cyber Mania 95, but it was broadcast online exclusively

404
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,040
and it received much less numbers than it reminds you of it.

405
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,840
Is this not kind of like, oh, do the streaming movies not make us

406
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,560
the same amount of money or get the same amount of eyeballs?

407
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,040
And now I heard two hundred and ninety million people watched Red Notice.

408
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,400
Yeah, yeah. Well, that and Spencer Confidential.

409
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,120
Definitely I saw that on the list.

410
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,360
I know we've all been talking about Spencer Confidential.

411
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,320
Let's all just think about our favorite moment and star from Spencer Confidential,

412
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,640
a movie that we definitely know the existence of.

413
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,320
I mean, Robert, just the name Robert Cope's got to be in that too.

414
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,080
Yeah, he might be. What is it?

415
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,720
Oh, my God. Well, Spencer is Mark Wahlberg,

416
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,320
and it has Post Malone as someone named Squeeb.

417
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,480
Also, that feels very CD-ROM to me.

418
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,680
It feels like the name, the kind of generic title

419
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,720
that feels like a movie, but is a little bit off and somebody with a weird,

420
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,840
you know, bleep, bloop kind of name. Yeah.

421
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,360
They might have stolen it.

422
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,080
This might have been a CD-ROM in development and Waldo stole it.

423
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,880
Anyways, so this thing.

424
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,840
I mean, if I was skeptical at all,

425
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,800
my skepticism went away when I saw the first shot of the award show,

426
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:04,000
which is the devil starts with the devil

427
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,840
who like forms out of flame and you're like, oh, this is where we're starting.

428
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,280
This is some boring shot of Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.

429
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,120
Kicking it off with the devil.

430
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,280
And then you're and then immediately a title that says

431
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,880
the gate to the mind's eye. Yes, yes.

432
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,760
I love those minds. I compilation these compilations of insane

433
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,960
at the time cutting edge now, weird old CGI.

434
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,120
And then you just watch Minds Eye stuff.

435
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:35,600
You watch a digital knight flying through a flying through a tunnel.

436
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,360
And he's like he's like kind of a floaty mermaid creature.

437
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,840
But the back half of his body are like

438
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,000
chrome whisking tongs.

439
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,560
They're spinning around.

440
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,200
It's the weirdest. Whoa. All right.

441
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,080
We're off to the races here. I love it.

442
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,800
Hey, it's still the future to me.

443
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,640
So real to me. Oh, yes.

444
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,080
I'm still I'm waiting.

445
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,080
I like I want the early 90s future.

446
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,960
And who could object to it?

447
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,600
I am surprised of all the apps I use on my phone.

448
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,040
No one has like tried like, you know, a reminders app or a

449
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,720
notes app or something that involves you soaring over a digital city.

450
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,680
Get to do that.

451
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,400
It's like a big journey just to like punch in dentist four o'clock.

452
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,920
Yeah, milk, eggs, bread.

453
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,240
There was a whole everything, I think, starts out in a like,

454
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,520
oh, we're going to do it in a fun way.

455
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,440
And then it ends up just in like a very functional way, which is almost like

456
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,040
there was a program called Microsoft Bob in like 1996 or seven years.

457
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,360
Know what I'm talking about? No.

458
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,880
Microsoft Bob was something that came with our computer.

459
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,360
And it was like an animated like living room.

460
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,120
And there was a little dog, I think, in the room.

461
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,880
I could be wrong, but there was like a there was like I like cute icons and stuff.

462
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,080
And the idea was that you were going to like put your schedule in and you log

463
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:58,360
on to Microsoft Bob and maybe put like a CD in a drive and log in, click,

464
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,760
go into like the living room.

465
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,160
And then like you would like have all your stuff.

466
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,360
I mean, I'm misremembering some parts of it, but that the basic gist of it

467
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,720
was this like cute little way to organize your life.

468
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,400
We had something like as my family, we were like, all right,

469
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,720
we're going to get a home computer.

470
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,280
We're going to commit to it.

471
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,040
You have to be very careful with this.

472
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,440
You got to be very respectful with this.

473
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,600
My brother did do something to it that made a crash.

474
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,080
And eventually they got it working again.

475
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,080
But it ran, I believe it was Windows three point one.

476
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,760
So right before Windows 95 and it had a like very

477
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,840
it had a different kind of home screen that you could toggle

478
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,920
between different icons or a house.

479
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,840
Like each you would go through a house in each room would have

480
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,680
like games, software, you know, digital houses.

481
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,880
Yeah. So this is what I'm showing you guys right now.

482
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,800
You would go to this door and it would be like a knocker

483
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,760
and there would be a little dog in the corner.

484
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,160
And that was your dog. So that's your living room.

485
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,560
And then, you know, you'd go to your letter writer.

486
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,800
You could write a letter inside the program.

487
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,160
Checks, your checkbook, your financial guide.

488
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,680
You could go to an Internet like an explorer, a different.

489
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,560
Yeah. Well, you would have a calendar, you'd have a clock

490
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,680
and it would all be a fireplace.

491
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,000
You have yourself at the digital fireplace and you could like

492
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,840
customize, I think, the room a little a little bit.

493
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,680
This dog's giving you tips and hints.

494
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,160
Yes. So this was all like, OK, we're going to make all of this

495
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,080
sort of functional stuff fun and you're going to go into your little

496
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,400
digital room.

497
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,600
But of course, after a few years, people like this is a lot of work.

498
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,120
Yeah. So why not? Yeah.

499
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,080
Straight to my calendar, to the calendar.

500
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,440
By the way, your brother, did he break the computer

501
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,280
by creating the babe of his dreams within the digital realm

502
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,960
and then putting on his helmet and then like getting getting all the cyber way

503
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,520
with her and then the computer burst into steam and smoke?

504
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,320
No, I think he just typed something in DOS.

505
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,640
MS-DOS. Oh, damn.

506
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,080
Yeah. No one. Unfortunately, no cyber babes. Yeah.

507
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,880
OK, so intro has happened and then we enter the stage and it's at Universal

508
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,760
Hollywood. It's in the Conan, the barbarian stage,

509
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,320
much like Horror Hall of Fame.

510
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,960
And they use it.

511
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,400
It's it's like most of that stage is just so intact.

512
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,080
So there's big like stone snakes and there's lasers.

513
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,480
There's big, chuggy rock music.

514
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,800
And we welcome our hosts, Leslie Nielsen and Jonathan Taylor Thomas.

515
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,040
But like both in tuxes.

516
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,040
I like that, that it's all this like, yeah, don't go, don't go.

517
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,800
But then still just tuxedos for everybody.

518
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:48,920
Right. And it's also the oldest man that's the youngest actor.

519
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,280
Yeah. I mean, I guess Walter Mathau and Jack Lumbin are still alive, but he's,

520
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,920
you know, he's 70s at this point.

521
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,080
Picture of Mathau hosting this. Yeah.

522
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,120
Yeah. But the biggest movie star, the biggest old movie star

523
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,840
and one of the biggest young movies, these are movie star.

524
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,120
They really got relevant.

525
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,320
This is the year of the Lion King.

526
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,920
Naked Gun still right in the rear view. Yeah.

527
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,720
I it's I think it's a great host.

528
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,840
Love the host.

529
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,000
Yeah. Them together is very funny.

530
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,240
The classic comedy duo.

531
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,200
I don't know if there's any particular chemistry,

532
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,880
but I do like watching them together.

533
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,520
Anti chemistry.

534
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,080
I'm sure they got along. Sure. Yeah.

535
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,240
They do a good job individually.

536
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,120
Like it makes sense. Yes.

537
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,920
You know, JTT is so slick.

538
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,240
He is so slick together.

539
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,680
Charming kid.

540
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,080
His tux looks cool.

541
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,800
He's got this kind of like Southwest tie cut.

542
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,080
Yeah. I'm talking about how I got to I got to wear a tux

543
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,920
finally at a wedding soon.

544
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,240
I might go in and say, hey, give me the JTT.

545
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:56,120
JTJTT, I will say this, has so much inherent charisma.

546
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,240
And we haven't talked a ton about JTT.

547
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,040
I will say if you were just listening to his delivery,

548
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,280
he does have sort of like a bad early 90s kid delivery.

549
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,680
As far as things.

550
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,440
Dad, dad, dad. Yeah.

551
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,480
Dad, dad, dad, dad.

552
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,120
It's so funny now, because now I feel like any kid actor

553
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,800
has to be able to enunciate perfectly.

554
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,160
They're like these Disney Channel star kids.

555
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,080
They sound like adults.

556
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,000
There's none of that weird like

557
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,600
like that's as charming as a kid can be. Right.

558
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,640
Now you're just you got to be right at right to it.

559
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,520
You have to be just as good as an adult delivering comedy

560
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,880
and pausing, knowing what to do.

561
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,000
But yeah, JTT, I was like, oh, yeah, I can see JTT's charisma here,

562
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,400
but he sounds like a kid doing an award show.

563
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,880
It makes me miss that.

564
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,120
It makes me miss the the kid charisma ceiling.

565
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,000
We used to allow this.

566
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,600
And I think we drive kids crazier making them go above the ceiling.

567
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,280
Of course, because they have to like be adults or much earlier.

568
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,840
Yeah. Yeah. Too much.

569
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,440
Well, they're also like also kids are just on YouTube and like, yeah,

570
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,480
extremely popular on YouTube when they're six in certain cases or younger, probably.

571
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,160
Yeah. Yeah.

572
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,920
They get very polished at a very specific type of delivery.

573
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,640
Yeah. Some of it.

574
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,840
Some of it's OK.

575
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,120
Some of them are pretty good.

576
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,200
Yeah, a lot of them are good.

577
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,520
And then some of them do transition to like actual act like I.

578
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,160
Well, they were already actually acting.

579
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,720
Probably. But like Timothy Chalamet wasn't one of his big things was

580
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,240
was viewing like Xbox Game Controller.

581
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,920
Maybe I really I don't know.

582
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,080
I like that.

583
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,920
Yeah. Can we look at that?

584
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,680
You can find it.

585
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,040
Much old Chalamet. Wow. Sure.

586
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,920
Hmm. Was this like Tim?

587
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,520
It's Tim O3.

588
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,480
And then it's the two E's, but they're backward.

589
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,600
There's three.

590
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,040
I would love it when he was I didn't know he was a content creator.

591
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,960
I didn't know that either. Wow. Just like us.

592
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,080
Yeah. OK.

593
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,160
Well, there's hope for him starting really young and really handsome.

594
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,640
And there's hope for us.

595
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,880
Yeah, we're a couple of years now younger than he is when he started. Yeah.

596
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,200
Yeah. OK.

597
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,520
And then now to boot up CyberMedia 94,

598
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:07,520
a very special guest, please welcome the first lady of the United States.

599
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,080
And then a hell of a chief plays.

600
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,880
And then a Hillary Clinton lookalike comes out

601
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,200
and she tries to hit a button on a computer,

602
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,280
on a big desktop computer that will start CyberMedia.

603
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,400
But Leslie notices that it is not plugged in.

604
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,280
And I'm loving this because this is some classic naked gun.

605
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,280
Yeah. You can tell exactly what they're going like.

606
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,000
It was always impersonators of the big public figures.

607
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,840
Love this live on a stage at Universal Studios. Love it.

608
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,560
So he plugs in a wire and you can't really tell what's wrong with it

609
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,360
in particular, but maybe it's a surge.

610
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,360
There's too much power all at once.

611
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,680
Because after kind of an odd delay, then there's a big explosion

612
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:52,320
that's kind of clunky and seems to just actually hurt the lady.

613
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,640
Yeah. The first lady. Yeah. Yeah.

614
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,880
It's very just like it's it's kind of alarming, I would say,

615
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,280
you know, in a not funny way.

616
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,360
And she real quickly turns around and smears like grease paint on her face.

617
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,920
But like at the cartoon bomb.

618
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,280
Yeah. Yes. Yes.

619
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,920
I do like I like that.

620
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,280
Since everybody's fine, I'm allowed to like it.

621
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,280
But it is. But the way just how how big it is and how close it is to her.

622
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,120
For a minute, you're like, is this just the was this bunch of people who hate

623
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,960
Hillary's? It's just like we're going to work if we burn up Hillary on the stage.

624
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,960
I mean, I guess that's what they were going.

625
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,760
I don't know if they hated her at the time, but certainly they felt like

626
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,280
she was a funny celebrity to hurt.

627
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,720
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

628
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,880
I guess she's only mildly hurt cartoonishly.

629
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,600
Yeah. Yeah. Like coyote style. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

630
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,240
This is later the venue for the Bill and Ted

631
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,600
topical show where you could see it going further.

632
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,720
Where I don't know what would it have been like that?

633
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,640
Well, you know, that she gets like caught in a sharknado.

634
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,520
Yeah, that's better. Yeah.

635
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,240
Or like and it's and some sharks went down on her.

636
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,320
Leslie Nielsen swings his arms too wide and he's holding a club.

637
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,000
The car safety feature.

638
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,520
And he like smacks her off the stage with a club.

639
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,680
Oh, that's a good one. Yeah.

640
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,600
Oh, they should. Yeah.

641
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,320
If they'd some if the plugging in didn't work and then the backup was the clapper.

642
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,000
But the clapper is too powerful.

643
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,320
Yeah. Mm hmm.

644
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:25,520
What if Angelina Jolie came out and she stuck her leg out from the Oscar

645
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,840
dress and tripped her?

646
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,360
How about that? The famous leg? Yeah.

647
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,600
You know, that doesn't say that is inaccurate.

648
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,360
What they would Bill and Ted would have done. Yeah.

649
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,080
Oh, and then we do get a very good then things kind of taper off.

650
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,600
And those are the deal.

651
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,480
So says, I sure hope she has health insurance.

652
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:48,320
Hello. And then you and then they introduced the show.

653
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,880
And there's so much smoke from that gag that you can't quite see them

654
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,840
and they can't quite see the screen.

655
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,360
And what you get here is really, you know what?

656
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:05,880
Why this is such a great use of Leslie Nielsen is now we've,

657
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:11,000
you know, he's becoming a little too aware, like an AI has learned too much.

658
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:15,520
Yeah. By the end of by Naked Gun 3, we've gotten progressively broader every time.

659
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,200
And I still like Naked Gun 3.

660
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,240
But, you know, there's a little bit of a taper off in how much they work

661
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:28,760
because he's he starts to think I'm funny and which is making silly faces

662
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,560
and being a little too broad.

663
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,200
And then once he's out of the Zucker realm and we're doing spy

664
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,160
hard and wrongfully accused, we're way off the map.

665
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,320
It's not working anymore.

666
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,680
But here we've put Leslie Nelson right back where he belongs,

667
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,440
which is reading a bunch of stuff he doesn't really understand. Yes. Yeah.

668
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,800
So he's funny again. Yes.

669
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:53,240
And he tried like he kind of like smiles and laughs sometimes at the awkwardness too.

670
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,440
But yes, he is completely out of his depth here

671
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,600
in regards to the all the subject matter that he's talking about.

672
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,880
I'm going to play a clip that refers to something we'll loop back to.

673
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,000
But just as an example of that, this is the one I have wanted.

674
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,160
This is one of Leslie's introductions.

675
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,280
Viva Las Vegas.

676
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,640
The city of Las Vegas is now shedding its cable

677
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,720
or rather as gambling image for one of computer gaming

678
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,120
from two bit hoods to gigabyte hard drives from colorful

679
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,720
sociopathic characters like Bugsie Siegel to colorful

680
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,680
sociopathic characters like Goro the monster.

681
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,200
Ralphie. All right.

682
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,160
Yes. I don't know what I am.

683
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,160
Goro the monster.

684
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,880
Gigabytes.

685
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,400
Hard drives. Gigabytes.

686
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:49,040
Changing it's from cable to for gambling gambling to.

687
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,640
I mean, it is. It's and we've just done Naked Gun 3 where the Oscars get mucked up

688
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,680
because he's doing everything and he's Phil Donahue and he can't read the teleprompter.

689
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,320
Like it's that live on stage. It's great. Right.

690
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,560
Yeah. He's trying to get the words right.

691
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,880
Yeah. Yeah.

692
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:09,040
Or also, I like that they are so to pair with the characters like Bugsie Siegel.

693
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:13,640
I think Bugsie Siegel had been dead for a good 40 or 50 years at that point.

694
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,600
Well, yeah, he's a classic reference. Yeah.

695
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,400
That was I'm saying.

696
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,280
He's saying now that used to be Bugsie Siegel.

697
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,080
Now it's Goro the monster.

698
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,000
Goro the monster.

699
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,200
Goro the monster is as iconic was as iconic then as Spencer confidential is today.

700
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,600
So Spencer confidential.

701
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,160
Do you know what Goro the monster is?

702
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,680
Goro is from Mortal Kombat.

703
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,760
Oh, he's the four.

704
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,720
You see the movie Mortal Kombat? Yeah. OK.

705
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,400
Oh, so it's not a Las Vegas thing.

706
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,560
That's them saying that now that there's gaming in Vegas,

707
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,760
that now that we don't think of Bugsie, we think of Goro.

708
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,920
Yeah. Have you ever seen the first Mortal Kombat?

709
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,640
No, that feels like you should see that too.

710
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,040
The movie. Yeah. OK.

711
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,760
I think you should see it. I think you would like it.

712
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,440
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

713
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,240
Because it's got Christopher Lambert just doing this voice the whole time.

714
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,120
And he's got a funny wig on.

715
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,080
And Goro is the bad guy.

716
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,640
There's Shang Tsung and Goro.

717
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,240
And I only know really OG Mortal Kombat stuff.

718
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,920
But Goro has four arms or six arms?

719
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,840
I forget. I forget.

720
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,840
You have four or six arms. And he is a puppet.

721
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,920
He's a giant puppet.

722
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,000
So it kind of doesn't work.

723
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,240
And they clearly have to work the fight around his limitations.

724
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,520
So Johnny Cage, who's like the cool actor guy, fights Goro.

725
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,960
And it's gross. Goro is gross.

726
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,080
Goro is hideous.

727
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,000
Oh, boy. Yeah.

728
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,280
I think you would really I think there's there would be stuff in there

729
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,120
you would like.

730
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,720
Well, I got a double feature with double dragon, maybe.

731
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,600
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's perfect.

732
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,120
Yeah. Yeah.

733
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,640
That's really good.

734
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:42,240
As if I can watch two movies in a row and you might have lost that ability with parenting.

735
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,600
I that Mortal Kombat brings up a good point, which is

736
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,400
hell of a year for video games.

737
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,840
But the ones that I don't know about you, but I would say are like

738
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:59,560
foundational games that people still go back to or get on other platforms.

739
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,760
Stuff that's mentioned like Mortal Kombat, NBA Jam,

740
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,480
Doom. Yeah.

741
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,800
Those don't sweep these awards.

742
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,280
Yeah, true.

743
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,800
And the big ones are up for these.

744
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,120
The big ones that are nominated are, yeah, still feel like they loom really large.

745
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,520
And yet, yeah, it's a lot of a lot more obscure ones.

746
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,360
That's definitely true.

747
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,520
Mortal Kombat is a hundred Mortal Kombat's a new Mortal Kombat.

748
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:28,360
Like one is announced where it's like almost a prequel, I think, to the whole Mortal Kombat.

749
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:33,560
OK, so that yeah, the lasting power of some of these things is pretty crazy for them.

750
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:38,120
Yeah, not to the big ones are the best game award nominees are

751
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:42,720
are Doom, NBA Jam, Mortal Kombat, Super Street Fighter two and Myst.

752
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,400
And Myst was obviously very of its era, but it's like but we all know it.

753
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,240
I feel like that's like the one I didn't play a lot of these.

754
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,360
But I remember I don't I couldn't tell you one detail about it,

755
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,640
but I remember the vibe.

756
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,120
I remember getting very lost in it.

757
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,840
And that's sort of like that.

758
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,680
I don't know that what that CD-ROM feeling of just like

759
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,800
wandering and there's objects and and this was the mist was good.

760
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,520
And it gave you texture.

761
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,040
It gave you mystery.

762
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,280
Yeah, I think I have it on my laptop.

763
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,840
You can buy it in the Apple App Store.

764
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,880
Oh, really? Like five bucks or something.

765
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,000
You can buy it for like a tenth of the price or something.

766
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:28,000
Wow. Well, I mean, what this whole thing is about

767
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,480
is really just introducing you to opening you up to that.

768
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,200
It's it's not just games, you know, there's there's so much that

769
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,240
the consoles can do and computers can do.

770
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,680
And a lot of this is conveyed with an extremely inexplicable piece

771
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,760
hosted by by poor man's Dennis Leary.

772
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,480
I say that with both the guy in mind and also the style.

773
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,680
I mean, every interstitial video piece in this thing, it is like it is.

774
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,320
The camera is always zooming.

775
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,040
The camera is always shaking.

776
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,200
Yeah, it is always touching there.

777
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,840
It's that thing where it flips around and then there's a color tint

778
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,600
on the other side and there's a sound effect for everything.

779
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,840
Sometimes it's like a hannah barbaro.

780
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,920
And then like stock footage will illustrate something.

781
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,680
An old bomb going off.

782
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,080
It's the most this is such a celebration of hyperactive editing.

783
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:23,120
Yeah. And I almost feel like this is the like sometimes you see parodies of it

784
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,160
and then you watch something old and you go, oh, I can see.

785
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,520
It's maybe not as extreme as I remember it.

786
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,360
Not this whole special.

787
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:36,520
This whole special is like so aggressively that style of 90s in your face.

788
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,000
Yeah. Like this is the most 90s thing I can recall watching in a way.

789
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,520
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So relentlessly 90s, but not in that really specific.

790
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,080
It's it's like dark, grimy 90s.

791
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,560
It's as you get there's this like if you were doing, you know,

792
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,560
90s night on the cruise ship, you might be like a more neon

793
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,160
say by the bell thing. Right.

794
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,800
But I remember a lot of this.

795
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,320
I definitely remember a lot of like the Internet is coming.

796
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,600
Computers are coming and it's scary and it's like all green.

797
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,080
And we're zooming in and out.

798
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,800
And we're not just filming a person.

799
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,960
We're filming the monitor with a feed of the person.

800
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,800
And we're zooming in and out of that.

801
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,920
We're like it's it's about media and multimedia, man.

802
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,840
Yeah. Staring sitting in a comp, USA, staring at like a display computer

803
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,840
that is just you're not going to be able to do with this.

804
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,080
The display computer is just playing a loop.

805
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,720
OK, you're not going to be able to touch that now.

806
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,240
Like that will do nothing.

807
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,520
It's just set to play this loop of zooming over a digital city.

808
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,480
OK, yeah. Yeah.

809
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,960
And it's going to cost thousands of dollars for you to get anywhere near this.

810
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,480
But buckle it because it's coming. It is coming.

811
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,960
So if you're not, you know, you can't afford it right now.

812
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,760
But when it when it is here, if you're not ready, you're fucking you're dead.

813
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,760
You're gone.

814
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,920
Kill you.

815
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,080
You don't understand this advertising.

816
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:01,520
You will be ordered into Comp USA and you will be put into some kind of machine

817
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,000
and you will be sliced to bits.

818
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It's another thing where it's like we're trying to sell you on the idea of like

819
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,520
what the Internet will do, what can do in video games,

820
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,640
what future video games you'll play.

821
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,640
And it's like, by the way, you're going to kill you.

822
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,640
You're fucked.

823
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:20,560
Do you understand that the Internet's coming and we will dismember you?

824
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,640
You don't know. Yeah.

825
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,200
Yeah. Yes.

826
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,520
And how any of this was supposed to if really what needs the like hurl

827
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,600
it needs to be gotten over is your parents buying a computer.

828
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,880
Cybermania 94 is not going to help.

829
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,000
No, keep them scared.

830
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,320
Yeah, really?

831
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,160
The this the first PSA really is a couple of things.

832
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:47,280
One, it seems like it's about to tell you not to huff paint like,

833
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,640
and you don't want to huff paint.

834
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,240
That'll damage your brain.

835
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,520
Like the other thing is it's got this insecurity

836
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,160
like video games and comic books.

837
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,000
They have never shaken this where they're still doing like

838
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,920
and we're not just for kids anymore, you know?

839
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,920
Yeah, yeah.

840
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,560
There's a lot of PR going on during this award show.

841
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,280
They view this as the public coming out for our industry.

842
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,440
So we got a lot to explain.

843
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:18,640
Yes. And I think we have with video games, like video games, still

844
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,360
video games, pro wrestling.

845
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,960
There's all these different things that are still thought of as like porno

846
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,040
in a way when like especially video games is like way more successful

847
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,560
than movies and TV.

848
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,720
Billions of dollars.

849
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,920
Amount of money and the amount of like different things like rules,

850
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,320
union stuff that should now be implemented for the video game industry.

851
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,120
Yeah, like from people who actually program stuff to the voice

852
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,680
talent and writers and stuff.

853
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,720
I hear that there's some video games that have actually been played more

854
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,520
than people have watched Spencer confidential.

855
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,320
Oh, really?

856
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:54,040
Seems like that doesn't add up in my head, but it doesn't sound right.

857
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,360
But I guess it doesn't sound right.

858
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,960
Here's some of this this leery esk man.

859
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,080
There's a whole universe of interactive media available today

860
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,840
that'll let you do anything from learning French and a box and piloting a starship.

861
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,040
We the people of this show must try spark balls, please.

862
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,880
Does it? Shatner.

863
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,200
Ray Steller Shatner.

864
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,680
We've all heard him talk.

865
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,760
That is exactly how he talks.

866
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,240
Yes.

867
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,120
Did he dove that part?

868
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:25,520
Yeah.

869
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:31,080
That also that's all like black and white and with a blue tint and a boxing ring.

870
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:36,120
And that that tone you just heard listener, imagine that for five straight minutes.

871
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,400
That is such a long piece.

872
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,360
At some point, there's a reference to how like, you know, it used to be that,

873
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,800
you know, you do it for you,

874
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:48,360
play video game console or arcade game for 25 cents a pop.

875
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,400
And then two pieces of toast come out of a toaster.

876
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,880
And 25 cents is burnt into the toast.

877
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,560
What is this? A shoot had to be done for that.

878
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,560
That's just one little part.

879
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,760
They had to get the little kitchen corner and the toaster.

880
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,840
And that's just one of 500 cutaways in this entire thing.

881
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:08,600
This is so you compare this to an episode of comedians in cars getting coffee.

882
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,880
And, you know, you can see the straight line from how we got there

883
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,240
with all those inserts of the coffee being made.

884
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,760
And, you know, this is obviously like they started in a more aggressive place.

885
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,240
Now it's in a very calming place to calm you.

886
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,400
Yes. Yeah.

887
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,200
These cutaways are like as they feel as related as the

888
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,120
the coffee that Jerry and friends aren't drinking.

889
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:31,800
Of course.

890
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,760
Stars start to appear.

891
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,760
Well, can I say, do we did they put this impression in on purpose?

892
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,480
Oh, yeah. I don't know.

893
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,040
I don't know, because Bill Shatner, William Shatner is doing

894
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,760
the voiceover on this special when he announces categories.

895
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,400
That is a part I didn't want to tell you guys.

896
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,280
I wanted you to learn that to experience that on your own.

897
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,120
I got so excited when I heard the man's voice.

898
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,160
He's never really and he's uncredited.

899
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,040
Never. It's just a subtle thing that it's Shatner

900
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,720
reading a bunch of copy, a little like one sentence explainers of video games.

901
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,480
And he sounds angrier and angrier as this goes on.

902
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,400
A lot of the onstage, the presenters that get

903
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,880
feel like they have contempt in their voice.

904
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,560
For it's like they don't understand it.

905
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:26,560
And you get your gigabytes and mo mo dams like, you know, they

906
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,880
they didn't get prepped at all.

907
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,760
Like, you know, can we just do a little of William Shatner

908
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,080
announcing the best portable nominee?

909
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,720
Yes, please. Because this is just so great.

910
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,640
So I love this.

911
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,720
There's a couple of great things about this.

912
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,160
Can we hear that?

913
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,520
For the best portable are Aladdin.

914
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,880
Join one of Disney's most popular characters on a breathtaking journey

915
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,080
through fire, sand and air.

916
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,440
Wario land, Super Mario land.

917
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,160
Wario Super Mario.

918
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,200
World to explore and he's charging by the hour.

919
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,920
No life to this.

920
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,280
He's charging by the hour.

921
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,040
Just don't worry, he does.

922
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,080
Hold on, let me see if he gets out. Skip to.

923
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,160
He announces and home alone.

924
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,880
And then he says the wrong name for that.

925
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,120
You know what I'm talking about? No, no, no, no.

926
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:33,240
But Gameboy Donkey Kong.

927
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:38,360
He announces this game as Gameboy Donkey Kong.

928
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:41,680
Gameboy Donkey Kong. That is not the name of the game.

929
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,400
But it's probably how it was listed.

930
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,600
But nobody corrected him. Just snip that out.

931
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,560
There's a number of times where the reading of the nominees

932
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:52,200
and the text on screen do not match.

933
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:58,800
Yes. And so, yeah, he is just he sounds madder as they go along.

934
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,880
There's one where you can feel the very like the like annoyingness

935
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,720
of the copywriting, like he has the right energy for some of it.

936
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:12,000
Like the line he says in that one is he's big, he's mean, and he eats bananas.

937
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,200
Nuff said they made him say no.

938
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,360
You got an esteemed actor made him say no.

939
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,120
I feel like I've I've talked to someone who is directed.

940
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,560
I've talked to a couple of people who've directed him.

941
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:27,000
And can you imagine that he is somewhat of a difficult?

942
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,880
Well, you heard the outtakes.

943
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,920
Oh, wait, what is that famous outtakes?

944
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,280
Oh, I think it's a documentary of some kind. Yeah.

945
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,920
You see, it's incredible.

946
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:41,920
I mean, he's just I think he's a guy who doesn't suffer fools

947
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,560
and just wants to do his thing and not be noted.

948
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,080
And he is very aware that there is a thing that you want out of him.

949
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:55,240
And the thing is this I do, Shatner do that shit thing that is not real.

950
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
So he has to deal with directors who probably won't look him in the eye

951
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,640
because they grew up watching him and like, could you just do that thing

952
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:08,680
where your voice goes up and down and you are still still to them?

953
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,440
I is that what you want me to be?

954
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,520
That's what the outtake is.

955
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,920
The guy tries to know him, but I don't remember.

956
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,920
Guys should maybe I'll just I'll play it and I'll cut it if it's if it doesn't go

957
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,040
because I don't have this like a perfectly queued up.

958
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,400
But yeah, it's so it's so wonderful. Yeah.

959
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,200
OK, I'll cut this.

960
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,280
This is William Shatner,

961
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,440
and I would like to invite you to take a journey with me into the 21st century.

962
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:36,040
So take the next few minutes and listen very closely.

963
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,720
You'll be amazed at what you hear. OK.

964
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:45,440
Um, can there be a little more excitement in the beginning?

965
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,240
It's so scary.

966
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,280
It sounded like really laid down, really super laid back.

967
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:58,480
Well, I'm I'm I'm saying,

968
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,400
OK, I'll try and do that.

969
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,200
That's to take to.

970
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:06,840
This is William Shatner,

971
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:10,320
and I would like to invite you to take a journey with me into the 21st century.

972
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,440
So take the next few minutes and listen very closely.

973
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,720
Well, speak up.

974
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,920
And maybe you better do it.

975
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,120
Do it the way you hear it.

976
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,920
Tell me, do it for me at all.

977
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,520
I mean, just don't give him a read.

978
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,040
Don't give him a read.

979
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,560
Zasting him, though, he's trapped.

980
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,880
He's doing it.

981
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,760
You to take a journey with me into the 21st century.

982
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,280
So take the next few minutes and listen very closely.

983
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,720
You'll be amazed at what you hear.

984
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,520
Is that the way you'd like me to do it?

985
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,320
OK, ready? This is William Shatner.

986
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,640
And I would like to invite you to take a journey with me into the 21st century.

987
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,000
So take the next few minutes and listen very closely.

988
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,560
You'll be amazed at what you hear.

989
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,560
OK, so I think that came pretty close.

990
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,200
This is the scariest shit.

991
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,520
No, no, I was I believe that you asked that was about the way you did it.

992
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,160
I wasn't just.

993
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,400
God, this isn't worth it. Move on.

994
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,560
I insist.

995
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,400
Now, what I want you to do is on pay.

996
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,240
Is that a satisfactory to you?

997
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,400
I should have just kept my mouth shut.

998
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,720
No, because if your mouth were open, you'd have popped some pills in them.

999
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:29,320
So do the next paragraph for page two.

1000
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,560
Well, I don't know. I really don't want to.

1001
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,920
Because I think you're actually have a better, much better.

1002
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,600
No, I don't think I do.

1003
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,960
I would like to hear you read the second paragraph so I can do it that way.

1004
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
You know, I really felt I looked at the different things you did.

1005
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,280
I really like the first one.

1006
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,600
No, I like it better the way you did.

1007
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,840
Oh, please. Please replay.

1008
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,320
All right. All right.

1009
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,560
That's yeah, I think that's his thing.

1010
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:58,320
He like tries to he tries to snare you.

1011
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:02,400
Yeah, you'd be like he presents a little like a pit for you to fall in.

1012
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,960
Yes, I think I heard a story where he like did an entire session

1013
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:10,040
with a Scottish accent to see as like a test to see like,

1014
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:14,840
will this person stand up to me and tell me not to do a Scottish accent?

1015
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,560
If he's a man, he will.

1016
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:20,160
Everyone hates him.

1017
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,440
The original Star Trek.

1018
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,600
Walter Koenig, a couple of days ago,

1019
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:27,960
who played Chekhov on the original Star Trek, tweeted about how he liked

1020
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,920
William Shatner's performance on Boston Legal.

1021
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,440
But the first part of the tweet said Bill Shatner is not a friend.

1022
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:38,680
But, jeez, he had to say that he had to say it.

1023
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,080
I could not say it. Yeah.

1024
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,640
Here's I don't think he's right to behave that way.

1025
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,680
But those first two takes he did were pretty good.

1026
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,720
I know. Yes.

1027
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,280
That shows you why not to give the line reading.

1028
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,880
He's a pro. Yeah, that is why did he do it.

1029
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,480
Did that guy fall in that trap?

1030
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,440
Here's this is my favorite thing he says in the show.

1031
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,760
Return to Zork.

1032
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,240
Your world is falling apart and everyone is counting on you.

1033
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,160
Yeah, very good.

1034
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,120
He saved the underground.

1035
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,840
Return to Zork. Return to Zork. Return to Zork.

1036
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,640
Just Shatner saying Wario.

1037
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,080
Yeah, I'm like, this is worth the whole special. Yeah.

1038
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,720
I didn't know that William Shatner's ever said Wario before.

1039
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,000
And he said Mario. He's one of the guys saying Mario brothers.

1040
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,440
He says Wario, but then Mario. Yeah.

1041
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,760
So that that you can tell you could get sense him getting testy

1042
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,120
as it goes on and probably like we'd already did a return to Zork.

1043
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,400
Well, no, this is for the graphics.

1044
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,840
We're honoring the graphics. Oh, very well.

1045
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,080
Well, let's do another Zork then.

1046
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,240
You can really see.

1047
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,840
I wish they had the outtakes of that.

1048
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,120
Zork gets a couple nominated.

1049
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,120
Yeah, Zork was looming large.

1050
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,000
I was trying to figure out what was up with Zork.

1051
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,560
It is Robin Lively and Jason Hervey from the Wonder Years.

1052
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,880
Of course. Yeah.

1053
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,200
Oh, oh, wait. And I forgot.

1054
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,600
I totally forgot. I have a clip of Zork.

1055
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:00,160
This is a part of Return to Zork where you you enter a building

1056
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,920
that is labeled Old Mill and then this happens.

1057
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,120
Who are you?

1058
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:07,880
Don't matter.

1059
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,440
Won't you, Rob? Of course you do.

1060
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:16,760
You're given the opportunity to accept some rye whiskey

1061
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,360
from a hillbilly in a digital room.

1062
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:24,200
In this clip, the person just keeps accepting rye over and over.

1063
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,240
So it's just wants a bra.

1064
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,640
Of course you do.

1065
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,160
What's the bra?

1066
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,760
So that's something that happens in Return to Zork.

1067
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,520
Can we get Return to Zork on Steam?

1068
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,280
I got to see. Maybe.

1069
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,160
Maybe.

1070
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,360
Where they can download it on Switch, my Switch.

1071
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,280
Is there a return to Return to Zork?

1072
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,640
Some other things.

1073
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,560
Some of the bigger presenters of that particular award,

1074
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,800
Matthew Perry and the next Karate Kid, Hillary Swank.

1075
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,600
Yes. Soon to be Oscar winner.

1076
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,120
Really funny.

1077
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,360
Another thing about this award show that is unique,

1078
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,280
the winners are read off of Newton.

1079
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,200
The Newton. The Newton.

1080
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,160
I freaked out when I saw one.

1081
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,160
I didn't realize it at first.

1082
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,640
And then someone said it.

1083
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,920
And I was like, oh, my God, that is a Newton.

1084
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,960
These weird little, it's like an early Apple device

1085
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,640
and it has like a lid that has to be lifted.

1086
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,360
Yeah.

1087
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,200
And then once Charles Fleischer gets up there,

1088
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,960
he ruins the whole thing and says that the screens don't work

1089
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,160
and it's just written on tape.

1090
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,520
So it's just an unnecessary product tie in that doesn't work.

1091
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,640
And they kept it in.

1092
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,400
Yeah, they did.

1093
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,560
Which is funny.

1094
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:32,320
Well, I think at some point this was a live broadcast

1095
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,960
because there's too many screw ups.

1096
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,240
And they say taped in an earlier time,

1097
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,320
which means that it aired live somewhere once.

1098
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:39,680
Right.

1099
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,480
But there's too many weird lags for it not to be.

1100
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,040
Otherwise, they didn't cut it.

1101
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,120
The Newton.

1102
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,160
There was a bunch of generations of it,

1103
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,840
but it was like Apple's answer to the Palm Pilot.

1104
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:53,160
Yeah.

1105
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:57,680
You know, I was reading on the Newton Wikipedia

1106
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:01,800
and came across this one, which has come up recently

1107
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,840
in the 1995 under siege to dark territory.

1108
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,320
The main character, Casey Ryback, Stephen Seagal, of course,

1109
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:14,000
connects an Apple Newton PDA to the telephone network

1110
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,240
of the hijacked train on which the film is set

1111
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:21,160
and sends a fax to his workplace, which is then forwarded

1112
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:24,840
to Admiral Bates Ryback's contact at the Pentagon.

1113
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:25,600
Wow.

1114
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,440
Wow.

1115
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,800
The iconic film and iconic character, even more than Spencer,

1116
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,120
used a Newton on film.

1117
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:33,920
Wow.

1118
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,240
Yeah.

1119
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,080
Well, this was a big era for the Newton.

1120
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:42,000
Big TV placement, big film placement held by Hilary Swank.

1121
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:42,880
Yeah.

1122
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,640
It was quite a time to be a Newton.

1123
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:50,720
This is also it's a big it's a big night for a bunch of people

1124
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,920
you've never heard of because I mean,

1125
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,600
I understand this is going to be like game developers

1126
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,640
and software people, but they all kind of come up

1127
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:03,480
and are mostly not ID and they don't say who they are,

1128
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,560
what they are to the games up there.

1129
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,520
I don't know.

1130
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:10,080
Or like do that little accepting for doom.

1131
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,640
Otherwise it's doom.

1132
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,080
And you go, hell yeah.

1133
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,200
I can picture doom, blood, doom is cool.

1134
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,400
And then just some guy gets up, doesn't

1135
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,320
explain why he's important to doom, just talks,

1136
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,280
isn't interesting.

1137
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,440
I guess it's almost like did somebody just literally go,

1138
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,360
well, should we put their names up?

1139
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,960
And somebody goes, no one's going to give a shit.

1140
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:29,800
Who cares?

1141
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,640
Like that's what else would be the explanation.

1142
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,720
Every other award show has a title.

1143
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,240
A chiron.

1144
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,720
Yeah, a chiron saying something.

1145
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,400
They had already sent Shatner home for the day

1146
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,320
and they're like, oh shit, we forgot

1147
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,320
to have him read the names of the nominees.

1148
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:47,400
And he's already mad it was a cold lunch and not a hot lunch.

1149
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,880
Ha ha ha.

1150
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,480
Hey, can we give you a call if we need?

1151
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,120
No.

1152
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,040
No, you can't.

1153
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:54,560
No.

1154
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,200
Don't even finish the sentence.

1155
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,440
Don't call me for anything.

1156
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,920
When you just provide a club sandwich, that's what you get.

1157
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,000
I've mentioned many times I'm in many, many different Facebook

1158
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,160
groups where I lurk and I forget which Star Trek-based one it

1159
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,520
is where all these people were talking about going months ago

1160
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,480
to meet Shatner at a con.

1161
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,320
And you could see the fear or you

1162
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:18,240
could read the fear in everyone because they were like,

1163
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,120
you know what, he wasn't so bad.

1164
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:25,680
Every comment, people were terrified to pay $250

1165
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,520
and walk by him and take a photo and say something.

1166
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,440
He actually was nice.

1167
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,280
He asked me what my name was.

1168
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,400
All these comments were so sad because of the reputation

1169
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,120
he's got for being such a pain in the ass.

1170
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,440
The best he gets is actually.

1171
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,200
Actually was pretty good.

1172
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,640
He said he looked me in the eye.

1173
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,920
He did basic human pleasantries.

1174
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,120
OK.

1175
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,960
I played earlier this Viva Las Vegas.

1176
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,680
But the aftermath of that is something

1177
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,440
that happens a couple of times in this special.

1178
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,200
It becomes clear that we are not just

1179
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:02,960
watching one outpost of Cybermania at Universal City.

1180
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,360
Cybermania has spread across the nation.

1181
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:11,600
And our first stop is Las Vegas and specifically

1182
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:16,240
to somewhere called Virtual Land at the Luxor.

1183
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,400
Wait, let me remember where this.

1184
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,520
OK, this is him.

1185
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,800
This is the intro.

1186
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,600
Your intro.

1187
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,120
OK.

1188
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,120
Yeah.

1189
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,800
Well, if you tell me if I don't have what you have.

1190
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:28,560
But this is some JTT that taking you somewhere.

1191
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:32,120
First up is a brand new virtual and Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas,

1192
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:35,880
Nevada, where Sean Alex Thompson started the new series.

1193
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,600
The news is standing by with some avid gamers.

1194
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,120
Pause.

1195
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:45,880
Pause.

1196
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,200
Hi, we're here.

1197
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,560
Virtual Land, the world famous Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas,

1198
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,160
Nevada, where as the name implies,

1199
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,680
it's virtually a land filled with every conceivable

1200
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,120
interactive and video game known to man.

1201
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:59,480
But we're all presently glued to the TV, or a lot of us.

1202
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,880
And we're watching what?

1203
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,080
Cybermania.

1204
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,320
No cue needed there.

1205
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:08,200
Behind me are a lot of cyber punks,

1206
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,640
I guess you'd call them, whoever has the idea.

1207
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,360
Yeah, you definitely call them that.

1208
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:15,320
Yeah, a bunch of cyber punks.

1209
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,320
And there's all these correspondents

1210
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,360
who do these pieces from different arcades,

1211
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,960
none of whom, the kids do not really give them

1212
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,760
the time of day, they don't know what it is.

1213
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,920
They are, especially in this case,

1214
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,840
they all just stay with their backs turned,

1215
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,280
playing the games.

1216
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,160
Don't acknowledge that they're on television

1217
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,720
or the television host behind them.

1218
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,880
There's this old square bothering them,

1219
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,360
where it's like, I am almost done, stop.

1220
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,800
I have almost beat Goro.

1221
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:44,640
37.

1222
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,480
I'm at Goro.

1223
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,320
Get off my back.

1224
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,160
Goro the monster.

1225
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,000
I got Goro.

1226
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,160
Goro the monster's here, and I'm defeating him.

1227
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,400
Fuck off, turtleneck.

1228
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,560
This guy's probably 36, whoever that guy is.

1229
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,400
Yes, yeah.

1230
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:00,200
You could not know less of what he's talking about.

1231
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,000
You could not have more disdain for this job.

1232
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,320
Oh, he really hates it.

1233
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,960
Right after that, he makes a joke about,

1234
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,600
this kid's playing NBA Jam.

1235
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:13,400
Well, probably next up is gonna be NHL Jelly, a bet.

1236
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,440
Probably, and there's no response to that,

1237
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,320
or it gets what it deserves, that joke.

1238
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,680
By the way, he's from a series called The News,

1239
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,000
as JTT says.

1240
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,760
That apparently was a syndicated sketch show,

1241
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:30,160
filmed at Universal Florida in this era, right then.

1242
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:33,640
And that show aired nightly.

1243
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,840
That was a nightly sketch series.

1244
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,280
Was that available?

1245
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,760
There are some clips with the worst audio you've ever heard.

1246
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,000
A couple of people have preserved it,

1247
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,600
because of Who's Aligned cast member,

1248
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,080
Brad Sherwood is on it.

1249
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,680
Oh, wow. Okay.

1250
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,520
But otherwise, I don't think this is a particularly

1251
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,320
well-received show.

1252
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,160
Now, hold on a second.

1253
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,440
That's The News with a Z, I should say, by the way,

1254
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:54,280
if you're looking it up.

1255
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:58,280
And he is at the very new Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas.

1256
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,800
He is not at Universal Florida,

1257
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,920
but there is a segment from Universal Florida later.

1258
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:04,840
Oh, yeah, yes.

1259
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,440
Yeah, yeah, because CyberManias,

1260
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:07,520
they gotta go to the East Coast.

1261
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,720
It's spread over there.

1262
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:12,240
I think most of the arcades shown in this special closed,

1263
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,240
I don't think many of them made it big.

1264
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,720
This particular one, Luxor,

1265
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,000
Virtual and Luxor closed in 98.

1266
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,480
Oh, also, I forgot, there's also one of the kids

1267
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,320
who barely turns around to acknowledge him.

1268
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,080
So, now, what does that do?

1269
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,760
What'd you just do there that, I think this is about NBA Jam.

1270
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,880
What does that little plus up he did do?

1271
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:31,880
And the guy just says,

1272
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:35,040
it makes you have special people.

1273
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,200
And he just has to move on from,

1274
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,040
what is that?

1275
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,400
I have no idea what that means.

1276
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,800
We've talked about this before,

1277
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:43,880
where you watch Masked Singer,

1278
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:46,640
and it's like, that feels like AI generated

1279
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,480
in a lot of way too,

1280
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,640
because it's been edited to death,

1281
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,960
to the point of just like nothing feels real at all.

1282
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,720
Things have been cut and sweetened,

1283
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,600
and the Disney specials like that,

1284
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,240
and stuff like the recent Disney specials.

1285
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,560
Yeah, just nowhere.

1286
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,080
And then this thing is the complete opposite.

1287
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,440
You'd think they wanna prep a kid, maybe,

1288
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,120
for one or two of the interviews.

1289
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,240
Yeah, really, just like have a couple on hand.

1290
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,560
Yeah, we talk to them, they know what they're gonna say.

1291
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,600
But Local News does that.

1292
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,320
The Local News gets a person,

1293
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,920
and then they cut, and they ask,

1294
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,360
or it's a pre-take.

1295
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,360
It's weird that that would be the case.

1296
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,240
They would just, ah, we'll wing it.

1297
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,080
Oh, yeah.

1298
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:21,920
Oh, I was gonna say,

1299
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,600
the one from Universal Florida,

1300
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:27,640
I think because the presenter,

1301
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,840
or the mainland street person,

1302
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,280
I don't even know what to call them,

1303
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:36,880
the correspondent is relatively young,

1304
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,440
and a pretty lady, and just knows,

1305
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,640
all right, where are you from?

1306
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:42,760
Where are you from?

1307
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:44,480
She just keeps it moving.

1308
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,000
Are you talking about Andy Carvalhas, Jason?

1309
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,400
Yeah, I don't remember.

1310
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,560
I don't remember who that,

1311
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,400
well, the one in Paramus, New Jersey.

1312
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,240
Is she famous for something else?

1313
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,160
I don't know.

1314
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:55,840
I wrote down the throw to her.

1315
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:58,080
We go live to Andy Carvalhas in Orlando, Florida,

1316
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:01,360
for this report from the Namco Cybertainment

1317
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,960
Coney Island Arcade.

1318
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,200
What a mealy-mouthed thing.

1319
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,280
That's so crazy.

1320
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,840
Namco Cybertainment.

1321
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:12,680
She mostly gets lucky with the charisma of her kids,

1322
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:14,680
but then there's this kid in a shirt that says,

1323
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:15,800
Jesus freak.

1324
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1325
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,040
She says, who do you think's gonna win tonight?

1326
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:19,880
And he says, me!

1327
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,960
She says, no, what video game you think is gonna win?

1328
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,760
And he doesn't know what to say to that.

1329
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,120
And she has to keep asking a couple times.

1330
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,880
Yeah, that's a good segment, though, I think.

1331
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,000
That's a much, much better segment than the other one.

1332
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,760
Yeah, yeah, she gets more out of it.

1333
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,400
A better segment, but the first jump,

1334
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,560
what did they say?

1335
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:42,440
I had to go back was the Paramus, New Jersey.

1336
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,080
We now cut to Will Arnett.

1337
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:45,920
You know what?

1338
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:46,760
You said it.

1339
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,800
Well, I was just gonna say Jason, Andy Carvalis.

1340
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,520
It sounds like Jason has a little crush on Andy Carvalis.

1341
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,240
That's all I wanna say.

1342
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:56,240
Well, I just think she did a good job

1343
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,600
because she was not a tightwad in a turtleneck

1344
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,720
or a very overwhelmed Will Arnett

1345
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:04,760
that seems like he's about to be absorbed in a crowd.

1346
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,080
I wasn't saying you were being bad.

1347
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:06,920
I'm just saying.

1348
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:07,760
Okay.

1349
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:08,600
Sorry, you're gonna have a crush on Andy Carvalis.

1350
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,760
You're gonna have a crush on 1994 Andy Carvalis.

1351
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,240
It's being Pete Candy Carvalis.

1352
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:18,480
We're here live in Paramus, New Jersey.

1353
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,320
I'm Will Arnett.

1354
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,160
This sounds older.

1355
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,920
And we're in one of the biggest arcades in America

1356
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,840
and also one of the loudest sports world

1357
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,360
here in Paramus, New Jersey.

1358
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,200
Has also closed.

1359
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,080
It's a little unruly here.

1360
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:33,680
Now, who's gonna win for best game tonight?

1361
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:35,720
I'm feeling it.

1362
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:36,560
The way he's talking.

1363
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,520
It feels like Arnett before he developed the character,

1364
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,240
before he figured out that like,

1365
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,000
if I'm just this guy yelling, that's funny.

1366
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:43,840
Yeah.

1367
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,440
He just is this right now.

1368
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,720
Well, it's so much angrier than like,

1369
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:48,880
eventually he would settle on this

1370
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,760
and this is the guy kind of more delivering.

1371
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:53,000
They say, we're here in.

1372
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,640
Like he's got this much deeper like base,

1373
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,680
aggressive base sort of in his voice.

1374
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,120
I don't know what he was then.

1375
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,480
Was he just a hosty guy?

1376
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:02,320
I was shocked.

1377
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,440
Cause yeah, I was like, I really,

1378
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,920
he was not on my radar before Arrested Development at all.

1379
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:10,960
I've seen him doing a live report from Woodstock 94.

1380
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:13,480
That's the other early Will Arnett I've seen.

1381
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:17,720
He's in, I think a couple episodes of The Sopranos.

1382
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:18,560
Oh.

1383
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,400
I think he's an FBI guy.

1384
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,360
So yeah, he's like what, 24 here?

1385
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:23,240
He's really young.

1386
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,720
Yeah, yeah.

1387
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:25,840
Got that bronze.

1388
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,920
He's these looking bronzes ever.

1389
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,080
He also, then there's this thing

1390
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:33,040
that they make all of these arcade correspondents do,

1391
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,680
which is they give them exclusive tips

1392
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,160
that you're only gonna see here.

1393
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,320
So be sure to remember this from this live broadcast.

1394
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:44,560
Write this down, assuming that you own the game.

1395
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:49,400
So let's put these correspondents into loud rooms

1396
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,160
with uncooperative children

1397
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:54,760
and make them say big mealy mouthed game tips.

1398
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,360
And that's what this Arnett part is.

1399
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:59,760
Use the standing hard punch that always gets Billy Lee.

1400
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,440
Now secondly, to finish the Shadowmaster,

1401
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:05,360
get you standing hard kick.

1402
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,880
The Shadowmaster can't fight the standing hard kick.

1403
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,680
And third, to finish the ice pick,

1404
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,720
you gotta use the crouching medium punch.

1405
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:15,840
I don't know, this is better than the standing hard kick.

1406
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,120
The crouching medium punch gets him every time.

1407
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,760
And that's all I can tell you about tips

1408
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,120
on Double Dragon 5.

1409
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:25,080
And then they start rebelling again.

1410
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:28,480
Rawr, rawr, rawr, we've been quiet for too long, rawr.

1411
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,680
The kids are about to kill me.

1412
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,000
Meet me alive, I gotta go.

1413
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,600
Dump him in the Pine Barrens.

1414
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,840
They did, the kids did successfully eat

1415
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,320
much of his bronze skin.

1416
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,680
And what we see now in Will Arnett,

1417
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:41,920
that was reconstructive.

1418
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:44,640
That's all been added since this deadly day.

1419
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,200
Tasted like coconut oil.

1420
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,680
That's what helped them swallow it.

1421
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,000
They wouldn't have gone through it so fast otherwise.

1422
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,760
This is so funny too because I think JTT gives

1423
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:59,320
a cheat code tip at some point during the thing.

1424
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,560
Live on the theater.

1425
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:02,840
But that is at least,

1426
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,960
not that I think that's a good idea in the way they did it,

1427
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,000
but at least that's a simpler way.

1428
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,880
Here, Will Arnett is telling you an elaborate way

1429
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,560
to beat a boss in a game.

1430
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,360
And it is not easy to convey.

1431
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,200
Because at least you could say,

1432
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,280
oh, it's the famous Konami code,

1433
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,920
up, up, left, up, up, down, down,

1434
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,520
left, right, left, right, A, B.

1435
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,360
B, A, B, A, start?

1436
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:23,720
B, A, B, A, start, whatever.

1437
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:26,760
That sort of, in Nintendo land in the old days,

1438
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,240
that would be a code. That's a little catchy, you know?

1439
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:30,440
Yes, like a little cheat code makes sense.

1440
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,280
But this is just like, and then you're gonna,

1441
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:35,480
the medium punch, you're gonna use a medium punch

1442
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,120
because you can't deflect against it.

1443
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,960
And make sure that you're crouching

1444
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,560
before you hit him with that punch.

1445
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:42,800
So if you're a kid, you're like,

1446
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,120
I gotta get a piece of paper.

1447
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,480
You don't have a DVR.

1448
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,200
No one's taping this.

1449
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,520
Oh, my man screamed a tip at me.

1450
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:50,720
Everyone was screaming,

1451
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:53,560
but the loudest screamer screamed a tip at me.

1452
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:56,640
Yeah, I'm gonna do a run through of Mario 3,

1453
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,760
the first level for you.

1454
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:59,800
Okay, make sure you're writing this down.

1455
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,760
That second level of boxes,

1456
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,200
it's not one of the, I'm not talking about clouds.

1457
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,800
Those are clouds, not boxes.

1458
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,240
I know they have faces, but they're actually,

1459
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,480
there's more, I call them clouds.

1460
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,280
Tanooki suit, what is that?

1461
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,720
The Tanooki looks kind of like a raccoon, but it's not.

1462
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,000
It's not a raccoon.

1463
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,560
It's Tanooki, and that's on the third question block.

1464
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,400
Like, this is just not the venue.

1465
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,080
Yeah. Not the venue to be doing this.

1466
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,840
Also a questionable tip, because like Double Dragon,

1467
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,280
especially the earlier ones,

1468
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:29,000
there was only like three or four attacks you could do.

1469
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:29,840
Oh, is that so?

1470
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,120
I feel like if the ones don't work out,

1471
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,760
you just try the other one.

1472
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:34,600
Yeah. You know?

1473
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:39,240
So, yeah, insane thing to make people do on live television.

1474
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,680
The thing where you mentioned where JTT,

1475
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:48,640
as part of why he gives a tip is that it's kind of covering

1476
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:52,120
for Leslie to get back into the theater,

1477
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,560
because there's this sketch,

1478
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,640
and if you're craving theme park content,

1479
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:58,200
this is the theme parkiest thing that happens,

1480
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,720
that Leslie Nielsen's doing like a segue,

1481
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:03,480
and then a loud car alarm goes off,

1482
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,840
and he's like, oh, I think that's mine.

1483
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:09,200
I better go, and he does a big long walk backstage,

1484
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:13,760
and then he finds Doc Brown leaning on a DeLorean,

1485
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:16,600
theme park Doc Brown, off-brand Doc Brown.

1486
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,960
Another thing with that that we didn't know existed,

1487
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,520
and he says, hey, get off of that.

1488
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,120
That's my car.

1489
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,320
You're gonna scuff it.

1490
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:29,440
And then he hears gunshots and leaves that,

1491
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,360
so the car is, that's the end of the car bit.

1492
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:33,520
No more of that.

1493
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,520
Really, what it's all been about is to get him

1494
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:39,160
into the arena of the Wild Wild Wild West stunt show,

1495
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,480
a rare universal thing we haven't covered yet,

1496
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:46,880
and he, Leslie, while Naked Guns sounded like music plays,

1497
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:51,680
he does all of the bits you can do at that stunt show,

1498
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:56,320
which is pretty much just, he's firing a gun at cowboys

1499
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,200
to trigger their stunts.

1500
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,800
Yeah, all the, yeah, the fall, big fall.

1501
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,320
Fall, the buster Keaton trick.

1502
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:05,840
The front falling.

1503
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,360
Which I like to see him do, seeing Leslie Nielsen,

1504
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:12,160
a physical comedy master, do that, so that's cool.

1505
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,280
What does it have to do with video games, you might ask?

1506
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,680
I don't know, don't know.

1507
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:21,360
But you know, it's also nice to not get lectured

1508
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,560
for a minute, to just watch something without dialogue.

1509
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,920
It's a dialogue heavy thing, for sure.

1510
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:29,840
I also wanna point out that off-brand Doc Brown

1511
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,720
does not speak.

1512
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:32,560
No!

1513
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,120
I'm assuming they would have to pay him more

1514
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,120
if he set a line.

1515
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,640
That's gotta be a pay issue, yeah, yeah, big time.

1516
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:41,520
It's just very funny to see a silent Doc Brown.

1517
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,080
Yes, famously man of few words,

1518
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:47,760
with a chill energy, Doc Brown.

1519
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,160
So then he finishes that and then JTT says,

1520
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:51,880
now there's a guy who really knows

1521
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,880
how to get into the battle mode.

1522
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,040
By the way, here's a tip if you're playing

1523
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,960
Mortal Kombat 2 on Super Nintendo.

1524
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,800
And just does a big tip.

1525
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,040
So that all, there's a big, I do like seeing

1526
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,840
90s Universal Preserve by that,

1527
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,880
a little bit of a preserve like that.

1528
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:13,880
I skipped past something that is, okay,

1529
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:18,600
so JTT introduces somebody named Jeff Leibowitz

1530
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,600
who comes out on stage.

1531
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,080
He's a real guy from the academy

1532
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,520
that is putting this together.

1533
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:27,080
And then he does backstage bits.

1534
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:31,080
And his biggest backstage bit is that,

1535
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,480
well, it revolves around SimCity,

1536
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:38,160
another big iconic game of the era and up through today.

1537
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:42,440
And there are two computers with SimCity backstage.

1538
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,720
This is, this special really won my heart at this point.

1539
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:50,120
There's gonna be a SimCity duel that happens.

1540
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:55,120
And the duel is between a real mayor of a city,

1541
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:59,000
not a SimCity, but a real mayor of a real city,

1542
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,360
the mayor of Santa Barbara, Hal Conklin.

1543
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:05,200
And then, and going up against him,

1544
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,600
the smartest kid in America, Michael Kearney.

1545
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,080
So Michael, no further explanation.

1546
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,080
What does that mean?

1547
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,920
What do you mean the smartest kid in America?

1548
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:14,120
By what metric?

1549
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:15,960
Smartest kid in America?

1550
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,520
I guess that's a heavy thing to download really fast

1551
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:21,800
and then just move into a skit, but that's him.

1552
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:22,640
I looked him up.

1553
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:26,920
Apparently he had a college degree at 10 years old.

1554
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:29,880
He was the youngest college graduate of all time.

1555
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,560
That's who we're talking to there.

1556
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,760
And he does a bit about how he wants to be a game show host.

1557
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:36,840
And really, why do you wanna do that?

1558
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:39,580
Well, the models are pretty pretty.

1559
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:41,300
Okay.

1560
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:45,620
Found out that this kid actually did get his, after this,

1561
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:49,060
got his wish of auditioning to be a game show host.

1562
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:51,180
And they ran a test game show.

1563
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:54,300
And what they found is the contestants did not like

1564
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,500
when a kid was smarter than them.

1565
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,320
Yeah.

1566
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:59,100
So the show was never made.

1567
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:02,780
He did go on to win money on a number of game shows.

1568
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:04,140
Oh, he became a contestant.

1569
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:05,940
Yeah, he became a contestant.

1570
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:09,060
The funniest bit of his Wikipedia entry,

1571
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:12,540
in 2018 he was working for an improv theater group

1572
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:14,220
in Nashville.

1573
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:16,460
That's what he used his brain on?

1574
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:17,300
Yeah.

1575
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:20,060
No smart person should ever veer

1576
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:21,980
into the improv comedy path.

1577
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:24,600
He was homeschooled and then he got degrees

1578
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,460
at very young ages.

1579
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:28,900
And I just think it's very impressive.

1580
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:31,860
Again, like an AI or like he grew it in a lab.

1581
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:35,340
Somehow they find a way to make improvisers

1582
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:37,420
more socially male adjusted.

1583
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:40,060
I think it's just really impressive.

1584
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:40,900
Wow.

1585
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:45,500
By the way, the rules of this contest,

1586
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:48,040
this is this is big Sim City duel.

1587
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:52,780
And whoever wins will be the mayor of Santa Barbara

1588
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:53,740
for the day.

1589
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:57,660
So if the mayor wins, he gets to stay the mayor,

1590
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:00,320
but the smartest kid in America is gonna help him out

1591
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,300
for the day.

1592
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:03,380
But if the kid wins, he's the mayor.

1593
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:05,380
He becomes the mayor of Santa Barbara.

1594
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:06,220
That's not fair.

1595
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:10,300
The mayor should have become his parents' son for the day.

1596
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:11,540
Oh yeah, they should switch.

1597
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:12,900
They should Freaky Friday it.

1598
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:13,740
Yeah.

1599
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:16,820
Or maybe not switch just like he becomes his brother

1600
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:17,780
for the day.

1601
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:18,820
Oh yeah, that's good.

1602
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:19,660
Yeah.

1603
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:23,140
It's not to wear big clothes and a backwards cap.

1604
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:23,980
Yeah.

1605
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:26,220
And he gets cooked, his mom or dad cook for him

1606
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:28,660
and tucked in.

1607
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:29,940
I feel like at some point.

1608
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:32,620
He usurps the brother's girlfriend.

1609
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:33,620
Sure.

1610
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:34,460
She's mine now.

1611
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:35,380
She's mine now.

1612
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:36,740
We are in love.

1613
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:38,780
I proposed.

1614
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:42,260
I feel like, was it Mr. Lebowitz?

1615
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:43,820
Is that Paul Lebowitz?

1616
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:44,820
Is that the guy's name?

1617
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:45,660
Who's doing the backs?

1618
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:46,500
Jeff.

1619
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,340
Jeff Lebowitz.

1620
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:49,460
I believe, I feel like at one point he said like,

1621
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:53,500
and if the mayor wins, he gets this kid services

1622
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:54,420
for the day.

1623
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:55,660
And I was like, what?

1624
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:56,500
Services.

1625
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,060
The fuck are you talking about?

1626
01:15:58,060 --> 01:15:59,180
What does that mean?

1627
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:00,700
Cook for ya.

1628
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:04,060
It is, some people in this special have a lot of charisma

1629
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:06,260
and then the people who don't have charisma

1630
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:08,300
really don't have charisma.

1631
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:10,060
Yeah, yeah, it definitely shows.

1632
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:13,340
Yeah, backstage Jeff is not the most charismatic.

1633
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:15,140
He has a pretty awkward moment later.

1634
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:17,420
One question I had, my friend Tyler,

1635
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:19,180
when I sent this to him was like,

1636
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:20,580
and when I explained this bit,

1637
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:23,460
he was like, how do you, like,

1638
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:27,380
one-on-one play somebody at SimCity?

1639
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:28,780
It's a very good question.

1640
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:32,060
This is not exactly a versus game.

1641
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:32,900
Yeah.

1642
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:36,260
It's a long game where you build a city

1643
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:37,620
and I guess you could say like,

1644
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:40,180
oh, I guess you could put a time limit on it

1645
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:41,380
and see who makes,

1646
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:44,660
who's city like makes the most money, I guess.

1647
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:45,500
Yeah.

1648
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,340
It's not as fun as like,

1649
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:47,940
we're gonna play Mortal Kombat.

1650
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:48,820
Yeah, not really,

1651
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:50,260
but I guess they're using what these people,

1652
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:53,740
oh, they really wanted to shame the Santa Barbara maker.

1653
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:54,700
Yeah.

1654
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:56,580
Like, we'll see, we'll see how good this is.

1655
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:57,860
Probably the guy,

1656
01:16:57,900 --> 01:17:00,300
the producer like lived in Santa Barbara

1657
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:03,420
and there was some like zoning ruling that he didn't like,

1658
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:04,980
something he had to take off his lawn.

1659
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:05,820
Yeah.

1660
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:06,660
All right, I'll get him.

1661
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:08,900
Hey, I got an award show coming up in three months.

1662
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:10,940
Let's put this guy to the ultimate test.

1663
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:13,700
Plus mayor of Santa Barbara, it's like a part-time job.

1664
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:14,660
Come on.

1665
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:15,860
It's surfing most of the time.

1666
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:17,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1667
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:19,300
Partying with the college kids.

1668
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:22,180
So, probably easy.

1669
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:23,180
Probably easy.

1670
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:26,460
SimCity, you gotta deal with like an earthquake

1671
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:28,740
and Godzilla shows up.

1672
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:29,580
Yeah.

1673
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:30,420
That's what I remember.

1674
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:32,060
I remember playing a SimCity where Godzilla comes.

1675
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:32,940
I loved that.

1676
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:33,780
Yeah, that's great.

1677
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:36,820
And I think it's a SimCity with all the like cut scenes.

1678
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:39,820
Because there was original SimCity

1679
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:41,740
that was just I think a top-down look,

1680
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:44,620
but I feel like there was enhanced SimCity

1681
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:46,780
with like the FMV.

1682
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:48,740
Oh, yeah, they showed some clips of that.

1683
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:50,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1684
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,620
Stressed out Fire Chief or something.

1685
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:58,580
Around this time, we move to why Robert alerted us to this,

1686
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:02,820
which is another appearance of Charles Fleischer.

1687
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:06,220
And we pose the question in the 35th anniversary,

1688
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:08,220
what is up with this guy?

1689
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:11,620
Why do we not see that much Charles Fleischer?

1690
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:14,220
And this further answers the question.

1691
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:16,180
We needn't dwell on this for too long,

1692
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:19,780
but I believe every word he says

1693
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:22,340
is done in a problematic voice.

1694
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:26,460
And he's got that compulsive need

1695
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:28,900
to keep changing his voice,

1696
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,220
which is an interesting thing.

1697
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:32,940
I don't know if there's a name for it in the,

1698
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:34,620
what's the psychology?

1699
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:35,700
DSM, thank you.

1700
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:37,700
Maybe five, four, five.

1701
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:39,020
Anoia-philia.

1702
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:44,340
So I think it's combined of like,

1703
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:46,820
oh, I think he maybe can't talk in his normal voice

1704
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:50,380
and every voice he chooses is a problem.

1705
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:52,540
Yeah, so because the main,

1706
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:55,940
certainly he veers into a couple of specific accents

1707
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:57,660
that are very not cool,

1708
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:59,820
but even the bass that he talks in,

1709
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:00,900
I'm wondering the whole time.

1710
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:01,740
You know, I go, oh no.

1711
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:03,140
This is kind of not good, right?

1712
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:03,980
No.

1713
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:04,820
Isn't it?

1714
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:05,660
Is he sort of doing?

1715
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:08,340
It's weird, because is he stealing?

1716
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:11,460
Because look, Robin Williams, we like in a lot of stuff,

1717
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:13,780
but Robin Williams also has sometimes,

1718
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:15,820
depending on what mode he was in,

1719
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:16,660
the voice is.

1720
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:17,500
Mr. Switch's voice.

1721
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,980
The voice is the hardest thing.

1722
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:20,820
I say even at the time, they were,

1723
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:22,980
I don't want to pretend I was ahead of these things,

1724
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:25,780
but the voices were not my favorite thing

1725
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:27,500
about Robin Williams for quite a while.

1726
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:30,060
No, and the switching voice is very fast,

1727
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:32,220
and it would be, yes, it would be a different.

1728
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:34,100
Look, I'll take him doing a Reagan

1729
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:36,660
or cartoon characters or whatever,

1730
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:41,220
but we know the voices that were definitely go-tos for him.

1731
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:42,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1732
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:46,620
And he was doing them at UCB in 2010, 2011.

1733
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:48,420
And he had those voices.

1734
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:51,300
So there is a compulsive, yeah, so anyway,

1735
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:52,860
we don't have to dwell.

1736
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:53,700
No, we don't.

1737
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:55,780
I also remember, so you get a sense of,

1738
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:57,780
because he gets a lot of time.

1739
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:58,620
They give him a lot of time,

1740
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:01,500
because he was of course a star in this world at the time.

1741
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:02,340
Yes.

1742
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:04,420
Him having been shunned by the feature film world,

1743
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:07,780
why he took his talents elsewhere to the gaming world.

1744
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:11,260
We of course know that he had just created the new CD-ROM,

1745
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:15,100
The Universe According to Virgil Reality,

1746
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:17,780
which was like a living encyclopedia

1747
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:20,060
where he's like a German professor.

1748
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:22,260
That's what he was doing at the time.

1749
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:23,740
I watched some clips of that

1750
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:26,600
and gained nothing particularly to talk about.

1751
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:33,900
He also, I remembered another thing that's a clue of what,

1752
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:37,060
okay, if we're annoyed just watching his voices,

1753
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:39,300
we're forgetting a big thing about him.

1754
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:41,180
Obviously he's Roger Rabbit.

1755
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:42,860
Have you guys ever seen any of those clips

1756
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:45,100
that are behind the scenes of Roger Rabbit

1757
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:50,140
that show how he was there in the Roger Rabbit suit?

1758
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:51,660
He was on set.

1759
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:52,500
Oh, I don't think I have.

1760
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:55,660
Or he didn't really need to, yeah, he was there.

1761
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:56,500
Oh wow.

1762
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,580
But like blocking those scenes

1763
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:00,940
or just like trying to be a part of it

1764
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:03,740
or like bring it to life in the physical space.

1765
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:06,700
And maybe that was a helpful guide for Zemeckis

1766
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:08,900
on some level, but then there's these clips

1767
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:12,100
you could find of Bob Hoskins going like,

1768
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:15,860
then you got Charlie Fleischer and he's around

1769
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:17,820
and he's doing the voices and he's yelling,

1770
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:19,660
yelling, going amuck.

1771
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:24,660
Oh, it's Charlie Fleischer, yeah, he's quite a fella.

1772
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:28,100
Like you're just dripping with hostility.

1773
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:30,900
Like where Bob Hoskins is looking like

1774
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:32,140
he hasn't slept in days.

1775
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:32,980
Yeah, yeah.

1776
01:21:32,980 --> 01:21:34,420
That Fleischer.

1777
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:37,100
Wow, I haven't seen that.

1778
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,620
Yeah, yeah, look at those.

1779
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:41,720
You get a sense of, yes, that maybe the chemistry

1780
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:46,720
between old Roger and Eddie was not as much

1781
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:48,920
as it is between the characters.

1782
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:50,200
Right, right.

1783
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:53,680
So a bunch of Charles Fleischer business

1784
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:56,240
and Charles Fleischer presents what to me

1785
01:21:56,240 --> 01:22:01,240
is the key category, which is the comedy game category.

1786
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,760
This is an onslaught.

1787
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:06,680
I have heard of a little of this,

1788
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:11,200
but not all these things are insane.

1789
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,360
The first one up is called I'm Your Man

1790
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,960
and it's an interactive movie.

1791
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,520
This was a thing for a little bit.

1792
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,640
I've been obsessed for a little while.

1793
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,400
This is called Mr. Payback.

1794
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,160
There was an interactive movie about a guy

1795
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:23,400
who got revenge on people.

1796
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:26,040
This is from Bob Gale of, speaking of Zemeckis,

1797
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,600
Bob Gale of Back to the Future.

1798
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,840
Fame, Christopher Lloyd is in it

1799
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,540
and you can watch these great trailers

1800
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:36,880
of the entire audience laughing and bobbing around

1801
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:39,760
and swinging their joysticks everywhere.

1802
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,600
We're making the movie.

1803
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,440
And meanwhile, in reality, this thing was so badly received.

1804
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:47,280
It was Siskel and Ebert's worst movie of the year.

1805
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,560
So I think I'm Your Man is from the same world,

1806
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:53,040
but this one is written by Michael Ian Black and Ben Grant.

1807
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:53,880
Wow.

1808
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:54,960
And they're in it too.

1809
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,440
And A. Whitney Brown from S7.

1810
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,600
The big picture, my friends.

1811
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,720
An inexplicable old SNL.

1812
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:02,880
Yeah.

1813
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,920
Joe Jackson did the music.

1814
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:08,040
That Joe Jackson, 70s singer-songwriter.

1815
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,640
That's a big recurring thing of a lot.

1816
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:15,160
I feel like this is like, 70s musicians are like, I'm in.

1817
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,360
Because you get Thomas Dolby later in this.

1818
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:21,000
CD-ROM is definitely a world where we can explore.

1819
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,360
And we'll get to big ones a little later.

1820
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,000
I'm gonna go in order of insanity.

1821
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,920
We have to end with the craziest one.

1822
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,600
There's a Bugs Bunny one,

1823
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,560
where one of the most mad shatners in the whole thing,

1824
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,840
where he has a copy for this one is just,

1825
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:38,920
Wascoly Wabbit runs amok.

1826
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:41,600
And boy, you can like, can we get a second on that one?

1827
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,760
Absolutely not.

1828
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:43,800
Not in your life.

1829
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,720
And then there's a game made by Comedy Central

1830
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:49,640
called Dating and Mating.

1831
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,640
I think I was writing, I missed the Comedy Central note.

1832
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,360
But like, ooh. I had to look that one up.

1833
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:58,360
I was not in the, I was like, what the hell is this?

1834
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:00,200
Cause it's standup clips.

1835
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,600
And the copy of the game build it as like,

1836
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:06,680
you're the club, whatever, promoter, owner, whatever.

1837
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:09,680
So you're someone at a club and you pick who goes up there

1838
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:12,520
and does their bits about dating and mating.

1839
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:16,400
So like, it has clips from Richard Lewis and Mark Curry

1840
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:20,760
and Adam Sandler, hey, and Ellen Cleghorn.

1841
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:23,240
So you prog, you choose your own set

1842
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:27,040
of wacky 90s dating standup, this sounds so dreadful.

1843
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:30,320
I know, I guess they're just trying stuff out, I guess.

1844
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,360
They're trying stuff out, they don't know what it is yet.

1845
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:34,560
So they're figuring it out.

1846
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:35,400
It got nominated.

1847
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:36,240
It got nominated.

1848
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:37,080
We got on the board.

1849
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:37,920
It got on the board.

1850
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:39,960
Yeah, you're gonna call that a failure?

1851
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:41,280
Yeah, I shouldn't, I'm sorry.

1852
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,160
Okay, further comedy games,

1853
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,600
the wacky world of miniature golf.

1854
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:50,360
Eugene Levy is an animated golf ball

1855
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:53,920
in the craziest mini putt course never built.

1856
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:57,480
Yeah, this almost looked like a Saturday TV fun house

1857
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:58,960
or something, like footage of it.

1858
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:03,200
It looked so bad on purpose, even though it was not.

1859
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,160
Yes, really, yeah, yeah.

1860
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,000
But who, like these ones, who, again,

1861
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,960
and just like the, it feels so reminiscent of like,

1862
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:15,320
there's a podcast with what and who has one,

1863
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:19,880
and like, what do you mean Eugene Levy has an animated,

1864
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:22,280
and this one wins, by the way,

1865
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:25,320
which feels like a real upset because

1866
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,080
it feels like the one to beat

1867
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:31,720
would have to have been Dennis Miller, That's News to Me.

1868
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:32,560
Yeah.

1869
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:37,560
The Dennis Miller weekend update style joke CD-ROM game.

1870
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:39,880
Yeah.

1871
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:40,760
This is insane.

1872
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,280
This is insane that this exists.

1873
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:46,800
Yeah, this, he's in like, I guess it's,

1874
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:49,600
I'm trying to think, it's not like a futuristic,

1875
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,160
like, I'm trying to describe this.

1876
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:54,960
It's like he's on a screen on a computer,

1877
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:59,480
and then there's almost like Family Feud style title cards

1878
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:02,240
for like topics, essentially, next to him.

1879
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,440
Yes.

1880
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:06,360
And it is so bizarre.

1881
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:07,520
How did this happen?

1882
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:10,040
It's like pre-Dennis, he's like clean shaven,

1883
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,400
it's pre-Dennis Miller show on HBO,

1884
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:16,160
but it's like obviously a weekend update ripoff,

1885
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:19,160
and is, yeah, is the idea you just clicked on him

1886
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:20,680
telling a joke?

1887
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:23,840
I think so, because they didn't have space for rants.

1888
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,800
Just like they can't do big videos.

1889
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:26,640
Yeah.

1890
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:29,680
Just literally, we couldn't fit one rant on the DVDs.

1891
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:31,520
It's gonna have to be little bite sized jokes.

1892
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,960
Your computer couldn't handle a rant.

1893
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:35,560
Yeah, the video had to be.

1894
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:38,000
Your brother, maybe he opened up a rant

1895
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,200
on your computer at home.

1896
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,000
Maybe he pirated a secret rant.

1897
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,200
Pirated a rant, the videos always had to be tiny

1898
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:47,360
in the corner, and then there was a lot of text

1899
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:49,000
that is not moving around.

1900
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,960
Yeah, or it pops up and pops away.

1901
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:53,000
So that doesn't take up a lot of memory.

1902
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,200
Really quick, I found a YouTube video.

1903
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:57,440
It's got all of it, I found, yeah.

1904
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:58,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go for it.

1905
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:00,720
Well, this is one specific thing,

1906
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:05,120
which is like topical year end jokes from 1993.

1907
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,040
So this is what you want.

1908
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:09,240
You know, I watch Weekend Update on SNL,

1909
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:12,440
and I hate that they pick the jokes for me.

1910
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:15,640
I don't get to tell them a topic and then hear a joke back.

1911
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:17,520
And I really hate that I put it on,

1912
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:20,360
and I have to hear a joke about this week.

1913
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,880
What if I wanna hear a joke about February?

1914
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,720
Yeah.

1915
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:25,800
Well, finally, that, Dennis Miller,

1916
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:29,840
that snooze to me lets you be in charge of the comedy news.

1917
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:32,680
And I ask you guys right now to pick a number

1918
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:35,680
between one and 23,

1919
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:38,360
and I will play a corresponding joke.

1920
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:42,400
That'll be the time code of the joke.

1921
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:43,600
Mike, let's start with you.

1922
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:44,680
Eight.

1923
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:45,840
All right, eight.

1924
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:50,200
And that gets us to, oh, you'll like this.

1925
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,280
It's a music one, a showbiz.

1926
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:54,440
This is, oh, well, you know what?

1927
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:57,520
I was gonna do one about Michael Jackson,

1928
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,480
but it looks like there's one about Euro Disney.

1929
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:01,280
So I think I have to do that, right?

1930
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:03,960
Let's see.

1931
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:07,000
And nevermind, I can't find it.

1932
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,560
All right, we're gonna have to do Michael Jackson.

1933
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:09,480
Okay, fair enough.

1934
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:15,400
Paul McCartney expressed his dissatisfaction

1935
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:16,240
with Michael Jackson,

1936
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:19,800
who won't talk to Paul about changing his royalty structure.

1937
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,560
But this fray has been going on for a long time,

1938
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,440
ever since Jackson delayed production

1939
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,080
of their first record together.

1940
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:27,440
It seems Michael couldn't decide

1941
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:30,280
if he wanted to be Ebony or Ivory.

1942
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:32,040
I thought Michael always said it didn't matter

1943
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,400
if you were black or white.

1944
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:35,480
Ooh.

1945
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:36,320
I mean.

1946
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:37,160
Ah.

1947
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:39,880
Put a chill on the room.

1948
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:43,080
He doesn't even have the juice.

1949
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:43,920
No.

1950
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,640
The Miller juice is like gone out of that delivery.

1951
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:47,200
No, because the Miller had juice?

1952
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:48,760
I liked the Miller weekend update.

1953
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:50,360
I know we were supposed to hate him now

1954
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:51,480
because he's conservative.

1955
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:53,720
But I liked the Miller weekend update.

1956
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,080
Let's see if we can save it.

1957
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,120
Jason, do you have a,

1958
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:58,920
what do you think is gonna be a better number?

1959
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,480
I'm gonna say 21.

1960
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:01,600
21, all right.

1961
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,680
Well, it'll be more, you know.

1962
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:04,520
Oh, good.

1963
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:07,400
Jason, you'll be happy to hear that we landed on

1964
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,040
abortion pill.

1965
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,600
Plans to bring the French abortion pill

1966
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,080
to the United States have stalled

1967
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:15,440
because the pill maker is afraid

1968
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:17,840
of anti-abortion groups' opposition.

1969
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,440
They wanna get those pills into the country.

1970
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:20,840
They should just smuggle them in

1971
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:23,080
inside French people's armpits.

1972
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:25,680
Not even the right-to-life movers are that committed.

1973
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,320
It didn't even sound like him.

1974
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,960
It sounds like an AI doing his voice.

1975
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:35,240
It's, what if a show was hosted by dying Dennis Miller?

1976
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:37,480
Wow.

1977
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:38,320
Yikes, all right.

1978
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:41,720
Well, that's Dennis Miller and that's news to him.

1979
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,080
That is so insane that that game exists.

1980
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,040
Dennis Miller is all, like,

1981
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:48,440
I watch old clips of Dennis Miller's show sometimes

1982
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:52,880
and I think 75% of Dennis Miller is attitude.

1983
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,600
Because sometimes I listen to something he said

1984
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:56,920
and I go, well, that wasn't funny at all.

1985
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:58,640
No, I didn't understand what it meant to you.

1986
01:29:58,640 --> 01:29:59,880
Right, I don't know what it meant.

1987
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:01,720
And the rhythm was, I guess, kind of funny.

1988
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:05,760
Or, honestly, I think people thought he was cool.

1989
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,040
It's a very cocky kind of delivery,

1990
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:09,720
but it was very cool.

1991
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:11,600
People thought it was cool, I think.

1992
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,360
And do you think less so now?

1993
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:15,880
I do think less so now.

1994
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,080
Some of the cool is depreciated.

1995
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,000
I do think so.

1996
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,400
There was a clip of Norm MacDonald a couple years ago

1997
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:22,240
saying, he goes,

1998
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:25,280
Dennis doesn't even know what those references are.

1999
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:26,240
It might be the trick.

2000
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:27,200
Yeah, yeah.

2001
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:30,040
Just jam them together.

2002
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:35,960
Hey, not like, look, when we reference name after name

2003
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:39,520
after name as we're doing here today,

2004
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:42,240
it's because we're gonna do something with them.

2005
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:43,960
We don't just reference and move on.

2006
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:46,000
We have stuff to say about Herbie Hancock.

2007
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:47,800
That's right.

2008
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,800
Before we get into Herbie Hancock,

2009
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:53,320
some of the reoccurring commercials are pretty good.

2010
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:57,000
Panasonic 3DO game console.

2011
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,840
I kind of remember this 3DO.

2012
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:00,400
I remember seeing Fry's Electronics is what I remember.

2013
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:01,400
Oh, okay.

2014
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:04,920
I remember one kid I knew who, like,

2015
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:08,080
his family always seemed to get the other game consoles,

2016
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:10,320
like 3DO or Jaguar.

2017
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,160
Yeah, yeah.

2018
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:15,600
The other commercial, oh, there's an IBM commercial

2019
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:18,040
with, it's Paul Reiser.

2020
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:19,280
Paul Reiser, yes.

2021
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:23,240
Yeah, Paul Reiser, a little more lively

2022
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:26,040
in this commercial, certainly than Dennis Miller.

2023
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:27,320
In his CD-ROM.

2024
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:28,720
In his CD-ROM.

2025
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:29,560
Yes, that's the-

2026
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:31,640
Specifically in Dennis' CD-ROM.

2027
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:33,320
That's the rubric, yeah.

2028
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:37,080
But yeah, Paul Reiser popping up,

2029
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:40,760
haunting somebody on computer screen after computer screen.

2030
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:44,480
Another extremely 90s ad, the 90s techno ad.

2031
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:47,560
They're all well-paired for sure with the special.

2032
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:48,400
Yeah.

2033
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:51,680
If we're talking about who was cool then,

2034
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:54,720
if that's the, you know, an attitude,

2035
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:57,880
there is a group of people who,

2036
01:31:57,880 --> 01:31:58,920
what could have been cooler,

2037
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,680
what could have been more of the moment,

2038
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:04,080
and had to be addressed in this special.

2039
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:05,240
It's been alluded to earlier,

2040
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:09,120
but I will let Leslie Nielsen do the full setup.

2041
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:13,400
You know, cyberspace has given us a whole new breed of pirate.

2042
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,920
Drawing number of dedicated, highly skilled individuals

2043
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,440
who borrow through the cyber underworld

2044
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:22,920
to seek out information and access highly sensitive material.

2045
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:25,000
Now these people don't take no for an answer.

2046
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,360
And it's not the FBI, it's not the CIA.

2047
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:30,440
We're talking about hackers.

2048
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:34,120
When you don't know what's coming there.

2049
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:34,960
Yeah.

2050
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,080
What do you mean?

2051
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:39,440
Leslie Nielsen is setting us up to learn about hackers?

2052
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:40,800
Hackers?

2053
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:41,640
What?

2054
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:44,520
They burrow in there and they see what there,

2055
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:48,280
what is, if they can find what is to be found.

2056
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,200
This is such a strange.

2057
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:55,600
So yeah, now cybermania presents a tribute to hackers.

2058
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,400
And I don't leave it with any further understanding

2059
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,240
of what a hacker is or why.

2060
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:02,000
It's a pro hacker piece.

2061
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,760
Very pro hacker and it's expelling all the myths.

2062
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:07,360
You know, you only hear about hackers

2063
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:09,040
when there's a problem with hackers.

2064
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:11,480
The media never does any nice stories

2065
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,680
about the nice things that hackers do.

2066
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:16,320
Maybe it was like at the time people were like,

2067
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:17,520
I don't know about this internet

2068
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:20,200
because I think I'm gonna be hacked.

2069
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:22,120
So maybe there was an idea of like,

2070
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:24,880
that people would just be scared of that term.

2071
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:28,600
So they were like, let's put a happy face on the hacker.

2072
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:31,640
The hacker is virtuous, is good.

2073
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:33,400
White hat hackers are virtuous.

2074
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:36,800
Black hat hackers are suspicious operators.

2075
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:37,640
Oh, uh oh.

2076
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:39,200
Do they say those distinctions in the thing?

2077
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,720
They don't say that in the thing.

2078
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:42,760
That's just a thing I know.

2079
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:43,680
Black hat?

2080
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:44,520
Black hat.

2081
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:45,360
Black hat.

2082
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:49,880
Like the Michael Mann Hemsworth movie, Black Hat.

2083
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:50,840
Is that about hackers?

2084
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:54,520
That's about a hacker who also kicks ass, I believe.

2085
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:56,480
Okay, so this is a,

2086
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:59,800
knowing your extensive knowledge about hackers.

2087
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:00,640
I know a little.

2088
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:02,640
I had to read a book called Hacker Crackdown in college.

2089
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:05,160
Would you say though this is a,

2090
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:06,000
That sounds like an anti-hacker.

2091
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:06,840
I think it's more than I know about hackers.

2092
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:08,560
It sounds like I didn't watch the special.

2093
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:12,600
Well, the government kind of went nuts prosecuting people.

2094
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:16,000
I think they reference the 80s.

2095
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,400
And it's people getting into databases

2096
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:21,640
and a lot of it was they say in this thing,

2097
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:24,280
it's people just doing it to see if they could.

2098
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:27,080
And then of course doing midnight raids at MIT

2099
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:30,800
to find garbage that they could maybe hack.

2100
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:31,860
It's quite a special.

2101
01:34:31,860 --> 01:34:36,740
You follow some real hackers on a midnight MIT raid.

2102
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:40,100
So doesn't that demystify hackers for you, mom and dad?

2103
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:44,820
This is, but it is straight propaganda for pro,

2104
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:46,140
because you can hack anything you want.

2105
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:47,180
You can be a bad hacker.

2106
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:49,160
Obviously you can use a black hat hacker.

2107
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:50,500
We're learning about now.

2108
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:52,900
And this is not, this is portraying only one side.

2109
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:54,180
This is very one sided.

2110
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:56,040
What if these are white hat hackers,

2111
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:58,420
but then as soon as the cameras aren't rolling,

2112
01:34:58,420 --> 01:35:01,620
they flip that hat inside out and what's on the other side?

2113
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:03,060
Or they own two hats.

2114
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:03,900
Yeah.

2115
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:04,720
Oh, that's it.

2116
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:06,060
That's how they get us.

2117
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:08,740
They hacked the system, how to dress themselves.

2118
01:35:08,740 --> 01:35:11,900
Mr. Rogers would call come home and take off his one sweater

2119
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:13,100
and put a different sweater on.

2120
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:15,260
And this is the same way with their hats.

2121
01:35:15,260 --> 01:35:16,100
Bastards.

2122
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:18,460
I don't tend to put on my killing sweater.

2123
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:21,380
But it's so fascinating because it has to be,

2124
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:23,420
because they want to be a pot,

2125
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:26,260
put a positive spin on computers.

2126
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:31,260
Well, Emanuel Goldstein and death vegetable and count zero.

2127
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:33,540
I love count zero.

2128
01:35:33,540 --> 01:35:34,820
Count zero is cool.

2129
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:35,740
Count zero is cool.

2130
01:35:35,740 --> 01:35:38,260
These are all some cool, you can see there's,

2131
01:35:38,260 --> 01:35:40,860
once you see these are people like you and me.

2132
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:42,780
They have goatees like you and me.

2133
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:43,860
Yeah.

2134
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:48,860
They have cow skull bolo ties and wear sunglasses

2135
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:52,100
and doors next to screens like you and me.

2136
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:52,940
Yeah.

2137
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:53,860
I love these hackers.

2138
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:54,700
You know what?

2139
01:35:54,700 --> 01:35:56,160
I'm gonna marry a hacker.

2140
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,000
Yeah.

2141
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:57,840
Yeah.

2142
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:58,700
If I could do it all over again,

2143
01:35:58,700 --> 01:36:00,980
I would have a baby with a hacker.

2144
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:01,820
Well, yeah.

2145
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:04,020
And you still have a chance to make that baby a hacker.

2146
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:04,860
Oh yeah.

2147
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:06,940
You're lucky if she applies herself.

2148
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:07,780
Yeah.

2149
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:10,660
A white hat or a black hat.

2150
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:11,540
Up to her.

2151
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:12,780
I'm letting her decide.

2152
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:13,620
Yeah, yeah.

2153
01:36:13,620 --> 01:36:14,440
Totally open.

2154
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:16,540
You can be any type of hat hacker you want.

2155
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:19,420
Wear any type of hacker hat.

2156
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:20,700
I said this at the start,

2157
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:22,500
where the hell does this come from?

2158
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:26,100
This is so bizarre in this five minutes or whatever it is.

2159
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:29,500
I think it's trying to dispel like the negative.

2160
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:30,860
Like they're called hackers

2161
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:32,340
and they're coming for your computer.

2162
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:33,180
Right, that's what I said.

2163
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:34,020
Like local news.

2164
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:35,980
I love propaganda because there are bad hackers.

2165
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:36,820
Yeah, sure.

2166
01:36:36,820 --> 01:36:37,660
And I don't,

2167
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:38,480
I don't.

2168
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:39,320
Straight up propaganda.

2169
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:40,500
Look, I'm saying that I love these hackers,

2170
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:41,340
but I also don't,

2171
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:44,560
I don't see how this piece dispels what you just said

2172
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:46,280
that the news reports say.

2173
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:49,020
Like the hackers are coming and that these guys are like,

2174
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:50,100
yeah, we are coming,

2175
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:51,980
but we're just gonna poke around.

2176
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:52,820
What's the problem?

2177
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:53,660
Yeah, just poking around the bottle.

2178
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:54,480
Yeah, I'm cool.

2179
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:55,420
I'm Dr. Who.

2180
01:36:55,420 --> 01:36:56,540
You can trust me.

2181
01:36:56,540 --> 01:36:58,780
I'm the name of something that you like.

2182
01:36:58,780 --> 01:37:00,660
And they're lying to you.

2183
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:02,140
It's not all like these guys.

2184
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:03,580
Oh, they might be lying to you.

2185
01:37:03,580 --> 01:37:05,740
And also they have some of the worst vibes

2186
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:06,580
you've ever seen.

2187
01:37:06,580 --> 01:37:08,880
I'm saying the special is lying to you.

2188
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:10,060
Yeah, these guys, yeah.

2189
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:11,500
These guys could be big liars.

2190
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:13,260
Count Zero could be a big liar.

2191
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:14,180
I have no idea.

2192
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:16,340
I don't know who's a good hacker and who's a bad ass.

2193
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:17,980
They just showing me them.

2194
01:37:17,980 --> 01:37:20,900
I mean, the main way they try to get the hackers

2195
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:23,380
into your heart is by showing that one of them

2196
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:26,900
eats a slice of pizza,

2197
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:30,060
which he picks up using a power glove.

2198
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:34,140
That's what you have to do if you're a hacker.

2199
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:35,780
I do like that though.

2200
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:39,660
How does that, that power glove is filthy.

2201
01:37:39,660 --> 01:37:44,160
The other, the palm side of the power glove is cloth.

2202
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:48,220
And how do you wash a power glove?

2203
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:50,100
It has electronics in it.

2204
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:51,740
And you just don't, no fact,

2205
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:53,900
no power glove has ever been washed.

2206
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:56,420
You probably, Nintendo would have said like,

2207
01:37:56,540 --> 01:37:59,140
hey, take a, just take like a cleaning,

2208
01:38:01,740 --> 01:38:03,260
take some little napkin or something,

2209
01:38:03,260 --> 01:38:04,820
get it wet, pat it down.

2210
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:08,020
Fucking Count Zero is not cleaning his power glove.

2211
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:10,460
It is cake and pizza grease.

2212
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:12,740
How to de-louse your power glove.

2213
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:14,100
How to fumigate your power glove.

2214
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:17,620
I did not know how to take apart my zapper gun

2215
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:21,060
and clean it and make sure everything was working

2216
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:22,860
and then put it back together.

2217
01:38:22,860 --> 01:38:24,700
That was never part of any of the sitting stuff.

2218
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:26,540
Nintendo Gun Military School.

2219
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:29,180
I didn't, I could not assemble my zapper gun in two seconds.

2220
01:38:29,180 --> 01:38:30,160
They had to assemble it for me.

2221
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:31,620
I never took it apart.

2222
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:36,100
There was a legion of duck hunt dogs coming for America

2223
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:38,460
and you were drafted.

2224
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:40,460
The gun better be assembled.

2225
01:38:40,460 --> 01:38:42,020
If it's assembled, I'll do well.

2226
01:38:42,020 --> 01:38:45,660
And somebody got to clean it for you, but that thing breaks.

2227
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:46,500
The war is over.

2228
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:47,340
Yeah, yeah.

2229
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:50,420
They also do a lot of,

2230
01:38:51,860 --> 01:38:54,020
they sure say a lot of times,

2231
01:38:54,020 --> 01:38:56,940
when you hear about hackers, they can move satellites.

2232
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:57,780
Guess what?

2233
01:38:57,780 --> 01:38:59,220
Hackers can't move satellites.

2234
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:00,860
That would never happen.

2235
01:39:00,860 --> 01:39:02,220
Oh, I believe you.

2236
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:04,940
Well, why did you bring this up at all?

2237
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:06,920
You really made a good case for now.

2238
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:08,300
I'm suddenly afraid that hackers

2239
01:39:08,300 --> 01:39:09,540
are gonna move all the satellites.

2240
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:11,020
Yeah, why'd you put that in my head?

2241
01:39:11,020 --> 01:39:12,220
Why are you making me think about that?

2242
01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:15,140
This is two, or one year away from GoldenEye

2243
01:39:15,140 --> 01:39:18,980
where Boris would hack into satellites.

2244
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:19,820
Oh, sure.

2245
01:39:19,820 --> 01:39:21,740
Or hack into the GoldenEye itself.

2246
01:39:21,740 --> 01:39:26,740
I think we're also about a year or so from the movie hackers.

2247
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:30,700
And do you think the screenwriters that were watching this

2248
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:32,540
and go like, I'm gonna make some tweaks.

2249
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:34,460
I'm gonna give them weird sunglasses.

2250
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:35,300
Maybe.

2251
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:36,140
You know what?

2252
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:36,960
I think they might have,

2253
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:39,060
because I believe that the first hacker you meet,

2254
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:43,260
Immanuel Goldstein, that is from,

2255
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:45,420
the name is maybe from 1984.

2256
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:48,020
I'm sorry if I'm dumb and I got that wrong.

2257
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:49,620
But that is also the name

2258
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:52,180
of one of the major characters in hackers.

2259
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:54,380
Wow, so these are the hackers from hackers.

2260
01:39:54,380 --> 01:39:56,540
Well, he doesn't play him,

2261
01:39:56,540 --> 01:39:58,340
they just used that name again

2262
01:39:58,340 --> 01:40:02,680
because it has Orwellian connotations.

2263
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:04,740
Maybe that was just a thing that hackers,

2264
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:09,100
oftentimes hackers would adopt things from Orwell

2265
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:10,900
or 1984 specifically.

2266
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:12,260
Yeah, probably, yeah.

2267
01:40:12,260 --> 01:40:13,780
Cause he called it,

2268
01:40:13,780 --> 01:40:15,580
Orwell was the original hacker.

2269
01:40:15,580 --> 01:40:16,420
Yeah.

2270
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:17,540
You know what?

2271
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:19,620
I like to think that I'm sort of part

2272
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:21,060
of the lineage of hackers.

2273
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:23,500
I'm not really a hacker, but I'm a checker.

2274
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:24,340
You're a checker.

2275
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:25,180
So I'm in the family.

2276
01:40:25,180 --> 01:40:26,460
Kind of a cousin, yeah.

2277
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:29,220
I like to think I'm a white hat checker,

2278
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:30,060
not a black hat checker.

2279
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:32,220
You are, because you use your checking for good.

2280
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:35,380
You get nice things for people and help them get on rides.

2281
01:40:35,380 --> 01:40:36,580
You have to wear a white hat.

2282
01:40:36,580 --> 01:40:39,740
Discount on toy, like I have my glitch Twitter account

2283
01:40:39,740 --> 01:40:43,660
popped up with a very good discounted baby toy today

2284
01:40:43,660 --> 01:40:45,620
and I grabbed it before it sold out.

2285
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:50,060
Sometimes you send me links to discount Twitter accounts

2286
01:40:50,060 --> 01:40:54,540
of like you can get 40 Andy Cap hot fry bags.

2287
01:40:54,540 --> 01:40:56,500
Yeah, for a great discount.

2288
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:57,460
And I hope you did it.

2289
01:40:57,460 --> 01:40:58,300
I hope you took advantage.

2290
01:40:58,300 --> 01:40:59,500
I did a hot fry bag.

2291
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:00,620
I can't say I took advantage.

2292
01:41:00,620 --> 01:41:02,460
Wait, that free package snack you mean?

2293
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:03,300
Yeah, yeah.

2294
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:04,300
Andy Cap's hot fries.

2295
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:05,900
Yeah.

2296
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:09,600
Well, you absolutely do use your powers for good,

2297
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:13,420
but I fear the day you decide to use them for evil.

2298
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:14,980
The day Mike turns black hat.

2299
01:41:14,980 --> 01:41:15,820
It depends.

2300
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:18,740
You don't think you can check your way into a satellite,

2301
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:21,740
but I'm saying maybe you can.

2302
01:41:21,740 --> 01:41:22,580
Maybe it is possible.

2303
01:41:22,580 --> 01:41:23,980
At least you're being honest about it,

2304
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:25,420
not like these filthy hackers.

2305
01:41:25,420 --> 01:41:26,260
Yeah.

2306
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:27,740
No, I never touch a satellite.

2307
01:41:27,740 --> 01:41:31,020
No, I never, never check a satellite.

2308
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:32,860
You can't power glove your way in.

2309
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:34,980
Mike did a little eyebrow raise when he said that.

2310
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:35,900
Never.

2311
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:38,020
I don't know if that communicated.

2312
01:41:38,020 --> 01:41:38,860
I think it did.

2313
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:39,700
You did?

2314
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:40,980
I think that sounded in my voice.

2315
01:41:40,980 --> 01:41:42,300
I acted it and I performed it.

2316
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:44,180
I think, yeah, we heard the eyebrow.

2317
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:46,100
Can we do it one more time where we kind of like

2318
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:47,380
hear your eyebrow raise?

2319
01:41:47,380 --> 01:41:48,940
Well, can you, you do it for me.

2320
01:41:48,940 --> 01:41:49,780
Oh, I'd rather not.

2321
01:41:49,780 --> 01:41:51,460
Show me how you want me to do it.

2322
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:52,540
Is it okay if I don't?

2323
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:54,380
I immediately regret saying what I just said.

2324
01:41:54,380 --> 01:41:56,720
No, no.

2325
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:59,780
I'd love for you to show me how you want me to do it.

2326
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:03,020
Raise your eyebrows.

2327
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:05,460
I can't check my way into a satellite.

2328
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:06,540
Okay, I'll do it like that.

2329
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:07,380
I can't.

2330
01:42:07,380 --> 01:42:08,220
Just do a raise.

2331
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:10,140
Okay, well then now you're just being silly about it.

2332
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:11,700
Wait, I'm sorry I said that.

2333
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:17,140
I felt as scared as that engineer.

2334
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:17,980
Yeah, you should.

2335
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:22,940
Boy, you know, if you're gonna have a music performance

2336
01:42:22,940 --> 01:42:24,460
in your Cybermania show.

2337
01:42:24,460 --> 01:42:25,420
Oh, this music performance.

2338
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:26,900
We're halfway through the goddamn special.

2339
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:29,700
I know, it's the long, we're gonna have to do,

2340
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:32,340
it's gonna have to be part one and two.

2341
01:42:32,340 --> 01:42:34,460
The long episodes are back.

2342
01:42:35,820 --> 01:42:40,420
Performing a specially composed piece just for this night

2343
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:42,940
is Herbie Hancock.

2344
01:42:42,940 --> 01:42:43,820
Herbie Hancock.

2345
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:45,300
Wow.

2346
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:46,140
We associate him with this kind of thing

2347
01:42:46,140 --> 01:42:47,780
with his rocket video,

2348
01:42:47,780 --> 01:42:51,860
with all those computer creatures dancing around.

2349
01:42:51,860 --> 01:42:54,420
Of course, this is up Herbie Hancock, Sally,

2350
01:42:54,420 --> 01:42:58,020
and he does a big song that he plays on a keyboard

2351
01:42:58,020 --> 01:42:59,660
or a keytar rather,

2352
01:42:59,660 --> 01:43:00,780
and the song goes,

2353
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:05,100
Cyber generation, cyber generation.

2354
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:06,580
It also then later it goes,

2355
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:08,180
cyber generation.

2356
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:10,460
It pretty much only goes, cyber generation.

2357
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:12,300
This is, the tone of this,

2358
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:14,860
also the fact that this is in kind of a castle set.

2359
01:43:14,860 --> 01:43:16,780
As soon as the song started,

2360
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:21,780
this show transmogrified into a Bible man touring show.

2361
01:43:22,740 --> 01:43:25,620
The song, I listened to some Herbie Hancock,

2362
01:43:25,620 --> 01:43:26,460
I like Herbie Hancock,

2363
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:27,660
this is maybe not his finest work

2364
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:30,300
that he cranked out for Cybermania.

2365
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:33,260
He made his point, there is a cyber generation coming.

2366
01:43:33,260 --> 01:43:34,260
Yes, he's right about that.

2367
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:37,700
And they're gonna dance at us, but maybe also kill us.

2368
01:43:37,700 --> 01:43:39,660
But yeah, it's a little chintzy, right?

2369
01:43:39,660 --> 01:43:40,500
It's a little silly.

2370
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:42,020
Three dancers on the stage.

2371
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:43,260
Not filling the space.

2372
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:44,100
Not filling the space.

2373
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:47,300
Even Beetlejuice's Graveyard Review later had like five.

2374
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:50,700
Yeah, and there's like one contortionist kind of dancer,

2375
01:43:50,700 --> 01:43:53,700
and they just do a lot of angles and video filters.

2376
01:43:53,700 --> 01:43:54,620
They put so many,

2377
01:43:54,620 --> 01:43:58,420
they put that secret invasion AI muck all over the screen

2378
01:43:58,420 --> 01:44:00,620
so that you think something's happening,

2379
01:44:00,620 --> 01:44:02,220
but it's just in the way.

2380
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:03,780
Yeah, oh God.

2381
01:44:03,780 --> 01:44:06,020
This is a little bit trying,

2382
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:07,500
but I love the existence of it.

2383
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:09,260
And then he goes straight from the performance

2384
01:44:09,260 --> 01:44:10,180
into a speech.

2385
01:44:10,180 --> 01:44:11,060
Yeah, yeah.

2386
01:44:11,140 --> 01:44:16,140
And he, in which he shouts out a bunch of like the musicians

2387
01:44:16,660 --> 01:44:19,900
who are exploring possibilities in this area,

2388
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:22,460
in the music realm of CD-ROM.

2389
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:23,540
And I was excited about this

2390
01:44:23,540 --> 01:44:25,220
because there's a quick shout out to Todd Rungren.

2391
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:29,140
Todd at the time was doing something called TRI,

2392
01:44:29,140 --> 01:44:31,580
which is of course T-R Interactive.

2393
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:35,860
Just one of the dopiest titles, acronyms for a thing.

2394
01:44:35,860 --> 01:44:38,100
Yet I've poked, I love that there are these artists.

2395
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:38,940
He mentions Bowie.

2396
01:44:38,940 --> 01:44:41,260
I don't really know what Bowie was doing with CD-ROMs.

2397
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:42,580
I'd like to find out.

2398
01:44:43,580 --> 01:44:47,660
But Peter Gabriel, who's nominated for this music award

2399
01:44:47,660 --> 01:44:48,700
that they're gonna do,

2400
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:52,860
it feels like they have to mention these musicians

2401
01:44:52,860 --> 01:44:54,580
who are exploring kind of the gaming space

2402
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:55,500
and the interactive space.

2403
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:57,580
And it was a big thing at the time.

2404
01:44:57,580 --> 01:45:00,820
But then he says, one band shattered,

2405
01:45:01,780 --> 01:45:03,300
what the fuck is this sentence meaning?

2406
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:06,620
But one band shattered virtual vision

2407
01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:08,460
seen around the world.

2408
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:11,260
And then there's a little piece about Aerosmith.

2409
01:45:11,260 --> 01:45:13,180
This is where I started getting paranoid.

2410
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:15,620
This AI is making this for us.

2411
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:17,260
What do you mean, Aerosmith?

2412
01:45:17,260 --> 01:45:18,780
Now there's a big Aerosmith part.

2413
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:24,340
Aerosmiths have been on the cutting edge of rock and roll

2414
01:45:24,340 --> 01:45:25,180
is a statement that's made.

2415
01:45:25,180 --> 01:45:26,340
Since the beginning.

2416
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:27,180
Since the beginning.

2417
01:45:27,180 --> 01:45:28,740
Since the beginning.

2418
01:45:28,740 --> 01:45:30,700
Cutting it, that's definitely what I think

2419
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:33,460
when I hear walk this way is how cutting it is

2420
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:34,900
and how edgy it is.

2421
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:36,420
Cutting edge.

2422
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:39,380
Who even would you say is on the cutting edge

2423
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:40,460
of rock and roll?

2424
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:43,300
What would that mean technologically?

2425
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:44,140
TRI.

2426
01:45:44,140 --> 01:45:45,820
TRI I guess.

2427
01:45:45,820 --> 01:45:47,860
I don't think there's any answer besides TRI.

2428
01:45:47,860 --> 01:45:50,140
Whoever he first used, I guess you could say the Beatles.

2429
01:45:50,140 --> 01:45:52,140
They used multi-track or Beach Boys.

2430
01:45:52,140 --> 01:45:53,820
Who used multi-track recording first?

2431
01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:54,660
Probably Beatles.

2432
01:45:54,660 --> 01:45:56,180
Probably Beatles.

2433
01:45:56,180 --> 01:45:57,860
Cutting edge of popular music.

2434
01:45:57,860 --> 01:46:00,260
I would probably say Herbie Ancock.

2435
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:03,180
Herbie Ancock had a lot of phases in his career.

2436
01:46:03,180 --> 01:46:05,140
And as technology went on,

2437
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:07,780
I feel like he had, he kept evolving.

2438
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:09,980
You feel like almost like synthesizers

2439
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:11,780
have to be a part of this discussion

2440
01:46:11,780 --> 01:46:14,540
because that is literally technology.

2441
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:15,740
Yeah.

2442
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:16,580
But it's so it's hard.

2443
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:18,900
So it's weird to think about this pretty pure

2444
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:22,180
rock and roll guitar band being on the cutting edge.

2445
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:23,020
I get it.

2446
01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:25,660
Look, they made it to hair metal land, I suppose.

2447
01:46:25,660 --> 01:46:29,220
Like Eros must have survived the 70s to make it into

2448
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:31,700
the 80s and had some like hits alongside

2449
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:32,900
like hair metal bands.

2450
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:34,580
Doesn't mean it's cutting edge.

2451
01:46:34,580 --> 01:46:35,420
No, I agree.

2452
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:37,660
It means they were kind of chasing a trend

2453
01:46:37,660 --> 01:46:38,740
a little bit more.

2454
01:46:38,740 --> 01:46:40,660
Well, it's clearly it's all just in there

2455
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:42,340
because they have these video games.

2456
01:46:42,340 --> 01:46:43,180
Of course.

2457
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:45,540
Which all they do have three video games.

2458
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:48,260
I mean, we gotta do Revolution X.

2459
01:46:48,260 --> 01:46:50,780
Yeah, we should cover full Revolution X.

2460
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:51,660
Yeah, I agree.

2461
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:53,780
I don't even know what the second one they mentioned is

2462
01:46:53,780 --> 01:46:55,780
and virtual guitar, which I think we talked about

2463
01:46:55,780 --> 01:46:57,340
forever ago, but they're in there.

2464
01:46:57,340 --> 01:46:59,060
They're on the cutting edge of cyberspace

2465
01:46:59,060 --> 01:47:00,660
and interactive gaming.

2466
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:03,180
They are just built up and touted.

2467
01:47:03,180 --> 01:47:04,980
And of course they made that music video

2468
01:47:04,980 --> 01:47:08,180
with where Alicia Silverstone is the cyber babe.

2469
01:47:08,180 --> 01:47:09,100
That's cutting it.

2470
01:47:09,100 --> 01:47:13,500
They clearly, that shows me that Bradley Whitford

2471
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:16,500
understands technology and CD-ROMs

2472
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:19,260
because there was like a kid getting a boner

2473
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:21,580
in a virtual helmet.

2474
01:47:21,580 --> 01:47:24,620
Well, don't forget the robot, the sexy lady robot

2475
01:47:24,620 --> 01:47:26,780
on the cover of Just Push Play.

2476
01:47:26,780 --> 01:47:27,860
Oh, of course, yes.

2477
01:47:27,860 --> 01:47:28,700
Yeah, yeah.

2478
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:29,540
So that's a future thing.

2479
01:47:29,540 --> 01:47:31,460
That was probably, they went to Aerosmith Labs

2480
01:47:31,460 --> 01:47:33,860
and saw the early prototypes of that.

2481
01:47:33,860 --> 01:47:34,860
They couldn't film it.

2482
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:36,420
They sent us a camera to film that,

2483
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:38,660
but that early robot went haywire

2484
01:47:38,660 --> 01:47:40,140
and crushed the camera.

2485
01:47:40,140 --> 01:47:40,980
All right.

2486
01:47:40,980 --> 01:47:42,940
And so there's so much buildup.

2487
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:46,140
Aerosmith, the most cutting edge band that has ever been.

2488
01:47:46,140 --> 01:47:48,140
They also can't be here tonight.

2489
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:50,020
And then, oh shit, deflating.

2490
01:47:50,020 --> 01:47:50,860
Yeah.

2491
01:47:50,860 --> 01:47:54,500
And then it cuts to what I am just gonna call

2492
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:56,220
a video riddle.

2493
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:57,060
Oh my gosh.

2494
01:47:57,060 --> 01:48:01,020
By Tom Hamilton, Aerosmith's member Tom Hamilton.

2495
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:03,720
To be there or not to be there?

2496
01:48:04,660 --> 01:48:05,740
What is the question?

2497
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:10,140
In cyberspace, we're all here.

2498
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:13,260
He's, it's a still shot and he's popping all around a room.

2499
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:14,100
It's very Alice in Wonderland.

2500
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:16,420
Aerosmith is the band that said,

2501
01:48:16,420 --> 01:48:19,460
we're all here because we're not all there tonight.

2502
01:48:21,180 --> 01:48:23,020
Hi, I'm Tom Hamilton from Aerosmith

2503
01:48:23,020 --> 01:48:24,280
and on behalf of the whole band,

2504
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:28,560
I'd like to say congratulations to Cyber Mania 1994,

2505
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:31,880
the first annual interactive gamers awards.

2506
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:33,520
Yes.

2507
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:34,480
Yes.

2508
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:36,000
Yes.

2509
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,600
That is somehow an FMV.

2510
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:42,160
It is a segment filmed with cameras,

2511
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:46,520
but it acts like a FMV that would go on a CD-ROM

2512
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,440
because it's just odd.

2513
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:49,680
It's very short.

2514
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:50,720
Does nothing.

2515
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:53,840
It does not have enough time to tell a story.

2516
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:56,160
Elements on the screen stay still.

2517
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:57,680
Yeah.

2518
01:48:57,680 --> 01:49:00,520
Yeah, what purpose does this serve?

2519
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:04,120
Digital riddles and then, sorry,

2520
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:06,280
are we honoring them or, but then it finishes

2521
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:08,920
and he says, hey, congratulations Cyber Mania.

2522
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:10,440
Yeah, I don't know.

2523
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:13,840
So it's them, Aerosmith is giving them an award.

2524
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:15,560
Well, the bassist of Aerosmith is.

2525
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:17,800
The bassist, I can't remember what instrument he is.

2526
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:18,640
Yeah.

2527
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:22,160
Yeah, the bass player from Aerosmith made a...

2528
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:25,600
I guess maybe the third most popular Aerosmith member.

2529
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:28,120
I don't know what you would rank the other three.

2530
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:29,840
I don't know, isn't Joey three?

2531
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:33,200
Joey three, Joey Kramer, what do you think?

2532
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:37,600
Tom Hamilton, I believe is sweet emotion,

2533
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:39,760
like kind of rote sweet emotion,

2534
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:41,080
or had the most to do with it.

2535
01:49:41,080 --> 01:49:41,920
Okay.

2536
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:43,560
Is that cutting edge because it's got like,

2537
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:46,680
rawr, rawr, the thing Peter Frampton was already doing.

2538
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:49,200
Yeah, Joe Perry was playing the, whatever that tube

2539
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:50,560
that Peter Frampton uses.

2540
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:51,400
The vocoder?

2541
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:53,800
I don't know if you call it that.

2542
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:55,920
It's called a vocoder, but it's called something.

2543
01:49:55,920 --> 01:49:57,280
It's a voice box, voice changing.

2544
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:58,120
The talk box.

2545
01:49:58,120 --> 01:49:59,080
Yeah, talk box.

2546
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:00,640
Well, that's not cutting edge,

2547
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:02,960
because I like sweet emotion, but.

2548
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:03,800
Yeah.

2549
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:04,720
It's not, I don't know.

2550
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:07,000
This premise is strange.

2551
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,160
Anyway, but they had to, again, we had to do,

2552
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:11,200
okay, the show's filling up.

2553
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:13,320
We got five minutes on hackers.

2554
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:16,920
We got Dennis Leary, nobody's heard of,

2555
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:20,080
doing beat poetry, and then we got to give 30 seconds

2556
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:23,600
to Tom Hamilton to pop around a room like the Cheshire Cat.

2557
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:29,040
He seems like not, he's, I feel like he's doing his best

2558
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:31,520
here actually, in as far as performance wise.

2559
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:32,440
Yeah.

2560
01:50:32,440 --> 01:50:33,840
He's like kind of into it.

2561
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:35,480
Can you do a little more energy, Tom?

2562
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:36,320
Yeah.

2563
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:38,360
Oh, more energy. Of course, I'd love to.

2564
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:41,440
Thank you, of course, thanks for the suggestion.

2565
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:43,280
Do you want to hear me play sweet emotion on the bass?

2566
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:44,640
It's a treat for him to act.

2567
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:45,480
Yeah.

2568
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:46,920
I like Shadner, Shadner does do it so often.

2569
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:47,760
Right.

2570
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:51,000
This is so strange, and then you see a bunch of music,

2571
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:54,640
CD-ROMs is presented by Thomas Dolby in a dumb beret.

2572
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:56,800
I had no idea there was a Prince one.

2573
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:57,640
I know.

2574
01:50:57,640 --> 01:51:00,480
This one, this is a whole, this, it opens up so many avenues.

2575
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:01,320
Yeah.

2576
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:03,880
This is a Prince CD-ROM where you explore different rooms

2577
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:07,080
of Paisley Park, which itself seems to look like

2578
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:10,800
a mist type early 90s VR space.

2579
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:11,640
Yeah, yeah.

2580
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:13,840
So that's what you do, and you walk up to like,

2581
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:16,680
here's a torch, and then you click it with your mouse,

2582
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:19,280
and then it lights with fire, and then at some point

2583
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:22,240
you see a, you click on a metronome,

2584
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:25,960
and the little needle on the metronome is Prince.

2585
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:28,680
I think I saw it called a pointless scavenger.

2586
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:31,600
More marketing than gaming.

2587
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:33,520
I think that's probably right.

2588
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:34,360
Yeah.

2589
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:35,200
Yeah.

2590
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:38,960
This is a very strange, I liked the screen that I saw

2591
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:41,320
where he says, the title says,

2592
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:43,160
are you sure, with the Prince language,

2593
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:47,480
are you sure you want to exit the experience?

2594
01:51:47,480 --> 01:51:49,600
I bet people were, yeah, I mean,

2595
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:50,760
I want to play the whole thing, but.

2596
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:52,680
Can I ask a stupid question?

2597
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:55,280
Is Thomas Dolby have something to do

2598
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:57,400
with Dolby sound systems?

2599
01:51:57,400 --> 01:51:59,960
I don't think so, unless he's somehow in the family,

2600
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:02,080
but I don't believe so.

2601
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,240
Okay.

2602
01:52:03,240 --> 01:52:04,600
No, he just has something to do

2603
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:07,400
with Buzz Aldrin and silence.

2604
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:08,680
Silence!

2605
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:10,080
Bad hats, you know.

2606
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:13,360
Um, so, yeah, but is he a bad,

2607
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:15,640
is he a bad head or a good head?

2608
01:52:15,640 --> 01:52:17,240
Then there's something that happens

2609
01:52:17,240 --> 01:52:19,440
where we check back in on the SimCity people

2610
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:22,840
and we check in on the celebrities who are playing,

2611
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:25,800
you can actually talk to Jenna Von Oy

2612
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:27,320
in our Prodigy chat room.

2613
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:32,080
Again, the most just hyper 90s on top of 90s.

2614
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:35,040
And the real guy from the academy

2615
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:37,440
is saying a bunch of boring academy stuff,

2616
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:40,920
and then a girl comes up and puts his arm,

2617
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:42,160
you guys notice this part too?

2618
01:52:42,160 --> 01:52:43,560
Yes, I noticed this part.

2619
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:44,400
The hard line.

2620
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:45,520
This is really weird.

2621
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:47,440
It's really odd.

2622
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:49,760
So she, like, he's just trying to say

2623
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:51,320
it's boring president stuff,

2624
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:54,160
but then she comes up and puts her arm,

2625
01:52:54,160 --> 01:52:57,760
locks arms with him, and we've met her earlier.

2626
01:52:57,760 --> 01:52:59,880
She's from My So-Called Life, you know,

2627
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:01,960
a show about high school.

2628
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:05,520
So then this guy, north of 40 probably,

2629
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:07,160
gets a little flustered.

2630
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:10,200
He gets a little distracted by the, again,

2631
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:12,240
high school actress.

2632
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:14,200
I looked it up and she's 20, so okay,

2633
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:16,560
but still, this is very strange,

2634
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:18,440
and then he stops his speech cold,

2635
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:21,720
and he says, I think a lot more than my voice

2636
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:23,880
is about to crack.

2637
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:25,680
I know, so what does that mean?

2638
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:26,520
What does that mean?

2639
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:27,360
What does he mean?

2640
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:30,400
Well, okay, I realized on second viewing,

2641
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:32,680
he might have been alluding to something

2642
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:33,720
that happened earlier in the show

2643
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:35,800
when he was on stage in front of the audience,

2644
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:38,680
and he did get nervous and his voice cracked.

2645
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:39,880
You of course remember that.

2646
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:41,840
We're paying close enough attention to remember that.

2647
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:44,080
Yes, that was awkward and he covered okay,

2648
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:47,320
but he may have been calling back,

2649
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:49,200
it's that thing that's an elephant in the room

2650
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:52,600
in your mind, but you did not need to mention it ever again.

2651
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:53,600
So it's just confusing.

2652
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:55,400
But taking that aside,

2653
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:57,280
a pretty girl is making you flustered,

2654
01:53:57,280 --> 01:53:59,640
and you say, I think a lot more than my voice

2655
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:00,480
is about to crack.

2656
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:01,400
His boner cracks?

2657
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:04,120
Is that when it extends into a boner?

2658
01:54:04,120 --> 01:54:05,440
You're saying that a boner,

2659
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:07,760
and I'll go, I know you're just trying to

2660
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:09,040
come up with whatever for him.

2661
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:10,320
You're just trying to help him out.

2662
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:12,960
But the idea that a boner is cracking,

2663
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:14,640
is that like?

2664
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:17,640
Yeah, you gotta get to the emergency room that happened.

2665
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,960
I don't think, I can't think of anything

2666
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:26,960
in any sexual process where cracking is a good thing.

2667
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,160
Shaky bed frame?

2668
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:35,040
Yeah, but I guess if your sex is so powerful

2669
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:39,480
that it cracks pieces of the bed off,

2670
01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:41,240
then sure, maybe.

2671
01:54:41,240 --> 01:54:43,320
That's still pretty, that might be too powerful.

2672
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:45,200
It's still not something I want to happen.

2673
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:47,480
The Twilight sex scene.

2674
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:50,760
The Bella and Edward film sex scene.

2675
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:51,600
I don't know this one.

2676
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:52,440
Have you ever seen this?

2677
01:54:52,440 --> 01:54:54,480
It's really funny.

2678
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:55,320
Cause he's got the power.

2679
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:57,920
With Pattinson and Kristen Stewart,

2680
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:00,600
he destroys a four-post man.

2681
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:01,920
Cause he's such a powerful vampire.

2682
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:02,920
He's so powerful.

2683
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:03,760
Yeah. Yeah.

2684
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:05,760
Okay, well that makes some sense at least.

2685
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:06,600
All right.

2686
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:07,880
But that's not what he's talking about.

2687
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:08,720
That's not what he's talking about.

2688
01:55:08,720 --> 01:55:09,720
What is he talking about?

2689
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:12,400
He's so turned on that he's going to crack.

2690
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:15,400
Well, wait, can I say her line that sets this up?

2691
01:55:15,400 --> 01:55:16,240
Yeah.

2692
01:55:16,240 --> 01:55:17,080
Yes, please.

2693
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:18,760
And it gets a little muffled,

2694
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:20,720
but I think what she says is,

2695
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:22,880
can I play in your chat room?

2696
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:24,760
Ooh.

2697
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:25,600
What?

2698
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:26,440
Ew.

2699
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:27,260
Ew.

2700
01:55:27,260 --> 01:55:29,320
And then he keeps saying boring president stuff

2701
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:31,120
and then says like, you know what?

2702
01:55:31,120 --> 01:55:32,560
We'll be right back.

2703
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:34,600
And then he kind of turns back to get with her

2704
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:36,440
and then thank God it cuts away.

2705
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:37,280
Yeah.

2706
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:38,400
I mean, I think this was just a skit

2707
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:40,520
and nothing happened, but this is weird.

2708
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:41,840
He's the president of the thing.

2709
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:43,260
And then he writes himself a skit

2710
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:45,680
where he's got a big crack and boner

2711
01:55:45,680 --> 01:55:48,200
for a girl who plays high school student.

2712
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:50,120
He's doing a hummin' a hummin' a bit.

2713
01:55:50,120 --> 01:55:50,960
Yeah.

2714
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:55,000
Maybe something, maybe there is something wrong with him.

2715
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:58,520
He thinks, you know, that thing where you get turned on

2716
01:55:58,520 --> 01:55:59,720
and then your penis cracks.

2717
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:02,220
It's like a reverse glow stick.

2718
01:56:02,220 --> 01:56:04,400
You know, when a glow stick,

2719
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:06,840
you crack it to make it light up.

2720
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:09,000
But with him, it's like, it's almost,

2721
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,280
his boner's in two pieces

2722
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:13,740
and it's sort of a reverse crack to assemble it.

2723
01:56:13,740 --> 01:56:15,320
It makes a crack to go back together.

2724
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:16,160
Crack.

2725
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:17,160
Yeah.

2726
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:19,920
If that happens, does it make a big sound, you think?

2727
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:22,600
Like a signal flare, a reverse signal flare.

2728
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:23,840
Like that.

2729
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:24,680
I don't know.

2730
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:25,880
Look, what else would it crack?

2731
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:28,080
I guess he could crack under pressure.

2732
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:28,920
Is that, yeah.

2733
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:29,760
Maybe that's his like.

2734
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:30,580
Yeah, we were thinking, we were like,

2735
01:56:30,580 --> 01:56:32,780
does he mean, is he saying that he's gonna,

2736
01:56:32,780 --> 01:56:35,080
like he's gonna crack on his marital vows?

2737
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:36,120
I'm gonna cheat on my wife.

2738
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:36,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2739
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:37,780
I'm cracking.

2740
01:56:37,780 --> 01:56:39,520
Yes, he's cracking under pressure.

2741
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:41,720
The engagement ring snapping in half.

2742
01:56:41,720 --> 01:56:42,840
That's sad. The wedding ring.

2743
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:43,760
The wedding band.

2744
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:44,600
Oh, okay.

2745
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:47,600
So I think a lot more than my voice is about to crack.

2746
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:50,000
By that, I mean my wedding ring

2747
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:54,040
because I'm getting engorged as are my fingers.

2748
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:56,460
Because blood is just going everywhere.

2749
01:56:56,460 --> 01:56:59,280
And so my fingers are getting thick

2750
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:01,880
and my wedding ring is gonna crack apart.

2751
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:04,240
Yeah, it's like when the Hulk transforms.

2752
01:57:04,240 --> 01:57:05,600
Everything bursts.

2753
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:07,440
This guy gets so horny,

2754
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:09,960
he transforms into a Hulk-like monster.

2755
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:10,800
Yeah.

2756
01:57:12,120 --> 01:57:14,680
Again, this guy's name was what?

2757
01:57:14,680 --> 01:57:15,520
Jeff.

2758
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:16,360
Hulk.

2759
01:57:16,360 --> 01:57:17,180
Lebowitz?

2760
01:57:17,180 --> 01:57:18,200
Jeff Lebowitz.

2761
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:23,200
When video game Academy president Jeff Lebowitz

2762
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:26,800
gets turned on, he hulks out.

2763
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:28,280
He hulks out, yeah.

2764
01:57:28,280 --> 01:57:29,740
Ah, crack.

2765
01:57:29,740 --> 01:57:32,680
Wow, his wedding ring went flying.

2766
01:57:32,680 --> 01:57:34,340
It's in my eye now.

2767
01:57:35,180 --> 01:57:36,020
A 20 year old.

2768
01:57:36,020 --> 01:57:37,580
Hulk can now cheat on wife.

2769
01:57:37,580 --> 01:57:40,760
You're fucking out of your eye for you.

2770
01:57:41,700 --> 01:57:44,980
A 20 year old actress like real quick delivered this line

2771
01:57:44,980 --> 01:57:46,780
and she's like, all right, if I hurry,

2772
01:57:46,780 --> 01:57:49,740
I can get back to my North Hollywood apartment

2773
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:53,020
before the rush, you know.

2774
01:57:54,460 --> 01:57:56,740
Oh my God.

2775
01:57:56,740 --> 01:57:58,340
Anyway, we gotta pick up the pace

2776
01:57:58,340 --> 01:58:01,260
because this is, I mean, we're getting down there.

2777
01:58:01,260 --> 01:58:02,380
Although we're not in a way.

2778
01:58:02,380 --> 01:58:03,820
There's so much fucking shit.

2779
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:06,340
Just real quick, I gotta point out right after this,

2780
01:58:06,340 --> 01:58:08,140
there's two commercials.

2781
01:58:08,140 --> 01:58:12,060
One is the Big Mac deal, two Big Macs for $2.00.

2782
01:58:12,060 --> 01:58:13,860
And I'm like, oh, that's such a bargain.

2783
01:58:13,860 --> 01:58:16,140
RIP, fairly departed.

2784
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:20,020
The other one is an ad for a TNT special

2785
01:58:20,020 --> 01:58:25,020
called In Search of Dr. Seuss, which looks so horrific.

2786
01:58:25,540 --> 01:58:28,020
Yeah, Robin Williams and Kathy and Jimmy

2787
01:58:28,020 --> 01:58:30,980
and Christopher Lloyd and they're all dressed like

2788
01:58:30,980 --> 01:58:32,820
Seuss people.

2789
01:58:32,820 --> 01:58:34,460
Yeah, it's really insane.

2790
01:58:34,460 --> 01:58:36,700
Shelley Duvall says some educational stuff

2791
01:58:36,700 --> 01:58:38,300
and she's got a big flower hat.

2792
01:58:38,300 --> 01:58:40,460
One of the games, a dog says,

2793
01:58:40,460 --> 01:58:42,940
it was time for my Sunday bone.

2794
01:58:42,940 --> 01:58:45,820
That's all I need to say about that part of it.

2795
01:58:45,820 --> 01:58:47,380
It's kind of the sake of time.

2796
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:51,540
Now to present Best Sports, would you please welcome

2797
01:58:51,540 --> 01:58:54,580
Miss Marla Gibbs and the stars of the upcoming film,

2798
01:58:54,580 --> 01:58:57,580
The Babysitters, The Barbarian Brothers.

2799
01:58:58,860 --> 01:59:01,380
Now a true mystery walks on stage,

2800
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:03,780
The Barbarian Brothers.

2801
01:59:03,780 --> 01:59:05,580
Oh, hold on, before The Barbarian Brothers,

2802
01:59:05,580 --> 01:59:08,980
the Shelley Duvall thing, the educational documentary

2803
01:59:08,980 --> 01:59:11,780
is even weirder than the hackers one.

2804
01:59:11,780 --> 01:59:14,500
Because it's got a bunch of assholes in it.

2805
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:19,340
And the one guy says, research shows that networking,

2806
01:59:19,340 --> 01:59:22,500
oh no, he says, in the last few decades,

2807
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:25,980
we've seen a dramatic decline in the quality of education.

2808
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:27,260
Who are you?

2809
01:59:27,260 --> 01:59:28,820
What is this?

2810
01:59:28,820 --> 01:59:32,380
It says a man and a woman that keep going back and forth.

2811
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:36,260
There's a really weird text card that says,

2812
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:39,740
research shows that networking improves social skills

2813
01:59:39,740 --> 01:59:42,180
and decreases ethnic tension.

2814
01:59:42,180 --> 01:59:43,100
Oh, right.

2815
01:59:43,100 --> 01:59:44,540
I forgot about that.

2816
01:59:46,340 --> 01:59:48,580
Why are they dumping on education

2817
01:59:48,580 --> 01:59:51,220
and then they're just talking about CD-ROMs

2818
01:59:51,220 --> 01:59:54,300
that appear to just bring up encyclopedia entries?

2819
01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:55,620
It is weird.

2820
01:59:55,620 --> 01:59:58,860
I think that, yeah, well, time will certainly prove

2821
01:59:58,860 --> 02:00:00,380
that the internet will be a tool

2822
02:00:00,380 --> 02:00:02,340
that decreases ethnic tension.

2823
02:00:03,420 --> 02:00:04,260
Yeah.

2824
02:00:05,900 --> 02:00:07,740
Anyway, back to The Barbarian Brothers.

2825
02:00:07,740 --> 02:00:09,980
The Barbarian Brothers, what is this?

2826
02:00:09,980 --> 02:00:12,260
Then two big bodybuilders come out.

2827
02:00:12,260 --> 02:00:14,140
They're fucking massive.

2828
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:15,860
Yes, what are they?

2829
02:00:15,860 --> 02:00:17,220
What's the babysitters?

2830
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:19,700
They've been in a lot of movies.

2831
02:00:19,700 --> 02:00:20,540
If you look.

2832
02:00:20,540 --> 02:00:23,100
Two weird Jack Thicke guys.

2833
02:00:23,100 --> 02:00:25,220
Yeah, they're very weird.

2834
02:00:25,260 --> 02:00:27,300
One of them just passed away a couple years ago.

2835
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:28,580
Oh, no.

2836
02:00:28,580 --> 02:00:30,300
But yeah, I was like, wait a minute.

2837
02:00:30,300 --> 02:00:33,260
Why don't I know The Barbarian Brothers?

2838
02:00:33,260 --> 02:00:37,460
I was, my first thoughts was wrestler, but yeah.

2839
02:00:37,460 --> 02:00:39,460
No, they're bodybuilders, I think?

2840
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:40,300
Yeah.

2841
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:41,140
They're bodybuilders.

2842
02:00:41,140 --> 02:00:42,700
No, the wrestlers have yet to show up.

2843
02:00:42,700 --> 02:00:44,380
That's right, there are wrestlers to come.

2844
02:00:44,380 --> 02:00:47,060
Double Trouble is a movie from 1992

2845
02:00:47,060 --> 02:00:49,100
starring The Barbarian Brothers.

2846
02:00:49,100 --> 02:00:50,780
Think big.

2847
02:00:50,780 --> 02:00:53,580
They're in DC cab.

2848
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:54,900
Oh.

2849
02:00:54,900 --> 02:00:57,500
They're in Natural Born Killers apparently too.

2850
02:00:57,500 --> 02:00:59,140
Oh, really?

2851
02:00:59,140 --> 02:01:02,940
There's a movie called in 1994 called Twin Sitters.

2852
02:01:02,940 --> 02:01:04,180
How do I not know?

2853
02:01:04,180 --> 02:01:07,820
Twin Sitters I discovered is the babysitters.

2854
02:01:07,820 --> 02:01:08,660
Oh, it is?

2855
02:01:08,660 --> 02:01:10,300
There were a couple of titles for this.

2856
02:01:10,300 --> 02:01:11,140
Okay.

2857
02:01:11,140 --> 02:01:13,500
For this Barbarian Brothers feature film.

2858
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:16,860
This trailer also, this will really vex you.

2859
02:01:16,860 --> 02:01:19,860
Oh look, and they tried to like steal the tagline

2860
02:01:19,860 --> 02:01:20,700
for the game.

2861
02:01:20,700 --> 02:01:24,180
You're never home alone when you're a twin.

2862
02:01:24,180 --> 02:01:26,260
They're trying to just kind of usurp.

2863
02:01:28,260 --> 02:01:30,620
I don't know, it is too much of a conundrum

2864
02:01:30,620 --> 02:01:33,580
to solve at this time, The Barbarian Brothers.

2865
02:01:33,580 --> 02:01:35,780
There will be more Barbarian Brothers content

2866
02:01:35,780 --> 02:01:36,620
coming to the show.

2867
02:01:36,620 --> 02:01:39,020
I don't know what for me yet, but that is not.

2868
02:01:39,020 --> 02:01:42,300
Wait, another tagline, move over Mary Poppins.

2869
02:01:42,300 --> 02:01:44,500
Here come the Barbarian Brothers.

2870
02:01:44,500 --> 02:01:45,980
I mean, I'm on board of that.

2871
02:01:45,980 --> 02:01:47,180
That I like.

2872
02:01:47,180 --> 02:01:48,020
Yeah.

2873
02:01:48,020 --> 02:01:48,860
I know everything.

2874
02:01:48,860 --> 02:01:50,460
I've seen plenty of Mary Poppins.

2875
02:01:50,460 --> 02:01:52,380
My Mary Poppins chapter is over.

2876
02:01:52,380 --> 02:01:54,220
Barbarian Brothers, you're welcome in.

2877
02:01:54,220 --> 02:01:57,340
Yeah, no, there's a, just for time,

2878
02:01:57,340 --> 02:01:59,700
we're gonna keep moving here.

2879
02:01:59,700 --> 02:02:02,540
There are a movie called The Flamingo Kid as well.

2880
02:02:02,540 --> 02:02:03,380
That seems kind of familiar.

2881
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:06,220
Which is, I think it's, is it Matt Dillon?

2882
02:02:06,220 --> 02:02:07,060
Yeah, Matt Dillon.

2883
02:02:07,060 --> 02:02:07,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2884
02:02:07,900 --> 02:02:08,740
It's a very martial movie.

2885
02:02:08,740 --> 02:02:09,580
I've heard of that.

2886
02:02:09,580 --> 02:02:10,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2887
02:02:10,420 --> 02:02:11,260
They're not the stars, I don't believe

2888
02:02:11,260 --> 02:02:12,820
of The Flamingo Kid though.

2889
02:02:12,820 --> 02:02:15,420
We'll check out, we'll go into Barbarian Brothers.

2890
02:02:15,420 --> 02:02:18,140
I'm even gonna cut, I'm gonna cut the clip of them

2891
02:02:18,140 --> 02:02:19,820
where there's just a 30 awkward,

2892
02:02:19,860 --> 02:02:23,300
30 second awkward pause where the package doesn't play

2893
02:02:23,300 --> 02:02:24,380
and they don't know what to do.

2894
02:02:24,380 --> 02:02:25,220
Yeah.

2895
02:02:25,220 --> 02:02:27,580
And they try to spike a football pantomime

2896
02:02:27,580 --> 02:02:31,260
and it doesn't, this is all exceedingly strange.

2897
02:02:32,140 --> 02:02:33,660
And then they present a sports award

2898
02:02:33,660 --> 02:02:36,180
that NBA Jam doesn't win.

2899
02:02:36,180 --> 02:02:37,780
What are you talking about?

2900
02:02:37,780 --> 02:02:40,420
Some Caesar's Palace boxing game?

2901
02:02:40,420 --> 02:02:41,340
Caesar's World of Boxing.

2902
02:02:41,340 --> 02:02:42,180
Oh, we're all talking about it.

2903
02:02:42,180 --> 02:02:43,180
Caesar's World of Boxing.

2904
02:02:43,180 --> 02:02:45,540
It stood the test of time.

2905
02:02:45,540 --> 02:02:46,460
Insane.

2906
02:02:47,380 --> 02:02:50,500
Okay, yeah, then there's more of these things

2907
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:52,980
where Leslie Nielsen has a speech to give,

2908
02:02:52,980 --> 02:02:55,020
but they make other things happen next to the speech

2909
02:02:55,020 --> 02:02:56,420
because the speech is dry.

2910
02:02:56,420 --> 02:03:00,140
And in this case, it involves, wait, no,

2911
02:03:00,140 --> 02:03:03,020
actually the setup is that there's two,

2912
02:03:03,020 --> 02:03:06,020
two actual wrestlers are gonna play WCW Super Brawl.

2913
02:03:06,020 --> 02:03:06,860
Yes.

2914
02:03:06,860 --> 02:03:07,780
And who are they?

2915
02:03:07,780 --> 02:03:11,900
So you're talking about back then Lord Steven Riegel,

2916
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:14,540
which is William Riegel is what the name he's gone by

2917
02:03:14,540 --> 02:03:16,940
in the last 15 or 20 years,

2918
02:03:16,940 --> 02:03:19,540
and flying Brian Pillman,

2919
02:03:19,540 --> 02:03:22,300
who was a maniac who has passed away.

2920
02:03:22,300 --> 02:03:23,700
Yeah, he was a crazy man.

2921
02:03:23,700 --> 02:03:26,540
He would die three years later at 35.

2922
02:03:26,540 --> 02:03:30,500
Yes, and was a drugs and stuff wild man.

2923
02:03:31,460 --> 02:03:33,380
And this is so they see,

2924
02:03:33,380 --> 02:03:35,500
yeah, the bit is that they're playing against each other

2925
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:36,900
while Leslie Nielsen is doing the speech.

2926
02:03:36,900 --> 02:03:38,140
And then they slowly just,

2927
02:03:38,140 --> 02:03:40,420
it devolves into them actually wrestling each other

2928
02:03:40,420 --> 02:03:41,500
on the stage.

2929
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:47,500
And then, yeah, they're doing most body slams,

2930
02:03:47,780 --> 02:03:50,060
slamming heads into walls and stuff.

2931
02:03:50,060 --> 02:03:53,180
And then Leslie Nielsen pulls a gun out

2932
02:03:53,180 --> 02:03:56,220
to try to get them to calm down,

2933
02:03:57,180 --> 02:03:58,020
which is wild.

2934
02:03:58,020 --> 02:04:00,020
There's a lot of guns in this special.

2935
02:04:00,020 --> 02:04:03,100
The speech he's giving is anti-violence, right?

2936
02:04:03,100 --> 02:04:06,100
So that's the twist is that then he just use violence.

2937
02:04:06,100 --> 02:04:08,340
It's anti-violence in video games.

2938
02:04:08,340 --> 02:04:11,860
And someone earlier had read a message from Al Gore,

2939
02:04:12,860 --> 02:04:15,780
talking about the importance of the information

2940
02:04:15,780 --> 02:04:20,220
super highway and interactive content in media.

2941
02:04:20,220 --> 02:04:21,700
And I'm like, wait a minute,

2942
02:04:21,700 --> 02:04:25,220
wasn't Tipper like complaining about music,

2943
02:04:25,220 --> 02:04:27,860
found music and violent video games.

2944
02:04:27,860 --> 02:04:31,460
And then they do a violent video games bit shortly later

2945
02:04:31,460 --> 02:04:33,700
in the thing.

2946
02:04:33,700 --> 02:04:38,300
I think they're pretty clean in their pro violence approach.

2947
02:04:39,140 --> 02:04:41,260
Pro hackers, pro violence.

2948
02:04:41,260 --> 02:04:45,740
And yeah, so he scares Regal and Pillman away.

2949
02:04:45,740 --> 02:04:48,020
There's a really, one of the most famous Pillman clips

2950
02:04:48,020 --> 02:04:53,020
is on Raw when he pulled a gun on Steve Austin in a house,

2951
02:04:53,340 --> 02:04:54,860
which is a stage.

2952
02:04:54,860 --> 02:04:56,900
It was not a real, but it's a.

2953
02:04:56,900 --> 02:04:58,740
That's a spoiler.

2954
02:04:58,740 --> 02:05:00,420
Yeah, nobody died.

2955
02:05:01,460 --> 02:05:03,140
Big Regal, I wasn't watching back then.

2956
02:05:03,140 --> 02:05:04,420
Pillman was a really good wrestler.

2957
02:05:04,420 --> 02:05:05,260
I love Regal.

2958
02:05:05,260 --> 02:05:06,380
I'm a big Regal guy.

2959
02:05:06,380 --> 02:05:07,220
Yeah.

2960
02:05:07,980 --> 02:05:09,380
He's still great.

2961
02:05:10,700 --> 02:05:14,500
And then Leslie Nielsen gives a like,

2962
02:05:14,500 --> 02:05:16,300
ah, don't worry about all this stuff.

2963
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:17,580
You know, there's ratings.

2964
02:05:17,580 --> 02:05:18,420
Don't worry.

2965
02:05:18,420 --> 02:05:19,860
Video games have ratings now.

2966
02:05:19,860 --> 02:05:22,740
So just check the ratings.

2967
02:05:22,740 --> 02:05:25,900
He basically hand waves the idea that violence

2968
02:05:25,900 --> 02:05:28,260
or any content is a problem.

2969
02:05:28,260 --> 02:05:30,420
And he basically just goes, he very throwaway,

2970
02:05:30,420 --> 02:05:31,820
just goes, ah, check the ratings.

2971
02:05:31,820 --> 02:05:32,660
Check the ratings.

2972
02:05:32,660 --> 02:05:33,500
Check the ratings.

2973
02:05:33,500 --> 02:05:34,340
Check the ratings.

2974
02:05:34,340 --> 02:05:35,420
Don't worry about it.

2975
02:05:35,420 --> 02:05:37,420
There's a throwaway line earlier with him

2976
02:05:37,420 --> 02:05:38,860
and Jonathan Taylor Thomas.

2977
02:05:38,860 --> 02:05:40,940
And Jonathan Taylor Thomas says,

2978
02:05:40,940 --> 02:05:43,540
you ever wonder how the games are made?

2979
02:05:43,540 --> 02:05:46,220
And Leslie Nielsen goes, no, not really.

2980
02:05:47,220 --> 02:05:48,060
That is pretty good.

2981
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:48,900
I mean, that's funny.

2982
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:50,260
Yeah, yeah, that's just, that's actually funny.

2983
02:05:50,260 --> 02:05:52,300
Yeah, that's a good laugh.

2984
02:05:52,300 --> 02:05:53,140
Okay.

2985
02:05:53,900 --> 02:05:56,980
There are some best actor awards.

2986
02:05:56,980 --> 02:05:59,100
Yeah, I forgot all about this.

2987
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:04,100
By the way, I sent this link to past guest Pat Cassels.

2988
02:06:04,180 --> 02:06:05,940
And I sent it to him because I discovered

2989
02:06:05,940 --> 02:06:07,500
that this entire thing was covered

2990
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:11,580
on a CollegeHumor show called Bleep Bloop 10 years ago.

2991
02:06:11,580 --> 02:06:13,940
And Pat was a guest on that.

2992
02:06:13,940 --> 02:06:16,980
So I haunted him with something from his past

2993
02:06:16,980 --> 02:06:17,820
by bringing this up.

2994
02:06:17,820 --> 02:06:19,180
And he's like, yeah, I kinda remember this.

2995
02:06:19,180 --> 02:06:20,580
And he's flipping through it and he's like,

2996
02:06:20,580 --> 02:06:21,500
sorry, I'm just skimming,

2997
02:06:21,500 --> 02:06:24,380
but how come everyone I'm landing on is like an old man?

2998
02:06:25,380 --> 02:06:28,180
And never does it get more old manny

2999
02:06:28,180 --> 02:06:30,260
than in this neck of the woods.

3000
02:06:30,260 --> 02:06:32,420
We present best actress,

3001
02:06:32,420 --> 02:06:34,820
and this is presented by one of the models Inc.

3002
02:06:35,780 --> 02:06:38,140
Oh, I got so excited when I heard models Inc.

3003
02:06:38,140 --> 02:06:40,140
Models Inc, yeah, it takes you back.

3004
02:06:40,140 --> 02:06:41,380
Very of the era.

3005
02:06:41,380 --> 02:06:42,660
And then Robert Culp.

3006
02:06:42,660 --> 02:06:43,500
Culp?

3007
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:45,300
From I Spy, Culp is there.

3008
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:50,500
And they, I mean, I don't have a lot about this,

3009
02:06:50,500 --> 02:06:52,220
but you discover that Culp is there

3010
02:06:52,220 --> 02:06:55,980
because he's also in a game called Voyeur.

3011
02:06:56,940 --> 02:07:01,500
This seems like a big, this is a prestige FMV game.

3012
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:04,140
I've never heard of it till now.

3013
02:07:04,140 --> 02:07:06,580
But it sweeps the,

3014
02:07:06,580 --> 02:07:08,260
this is the everything everywhere all at once.

3015
02:07:08,260 --> 02:07:11,260
It sweeps the acting categories,

3016
02:07:11,260 --> 02:07:14,580
although which that movie did not do Brendan Fraser.

3017
02:07:14,580 --> 02:07:15,900
You know what I'm saying, it swept some of them.

3018
02:07:15,900 --> 02:07:17,140
It swept a couple of them.

3019
02:07:18,860 --> 02:07:20,260
I recognize Culp

3020
02:07:20,260 --> 02:07:23,060
because I've been picking random Columbus recently,

3021
02:07:23,060 --> 02:07:24,380
watching them and he's-

3022
02:07:24,380 --> 02:07:26,420
The first one, he's number one.

3023
02:07:27,980 --> 02:07:30,620
I think the book, the authors are number one.

3024
02:07:30,780 --> 02:07:34,140
He's the private detective agency.

3025
02:07:34,140 --> 02:07:35,420
Here's the thing about Robert Culp.

3026
02:07:35,420 --> 02:07:37,300
He is in four Columbus.

3027
02:07:37,300 --> 02:07:39,420
Yes, extremely recurring.

3028
02:07:39,420 --> 02:07:40,740
I've seen one of them.

3029
02:07:40,740 --> 02:07:43,460
Yeah. Yeah, he's in, yes.

3030
02:07:43,460 --> 02:07:46,420
That's a special slot, the Columbo villain role.

3031
02:07:46,420 --> 02:07:49,100
Some of the finest actors of all time have done it.

3032
02:07:49,100 --> 02:07:50,140
Leslie Nielsen, I think.

3033
02:07:50,140 --> 02:07:51,180
Am I making that up?

3034
02:07:51,180 --> 02:07:52,540
I think maybe.

3035
02:07:52,540 --> 02:07:55,820
Culp, also notable, the murderer in the pilot episode

3036
02:07:55,820 --> 02:07:58,180
of Mrs. Columbo with Kate Mulgrew.

3037
02:07:58,180 --> 02:08:00,260
Oh, they even brought him in for Mrs.

3038
02:08:00,260 --> 02:08:03,900
Yes, the weird Mrs. Columbo where you never saw Columbo

3039
02:08:03,900 --> 02:08:05,220
and they never crossed paths.

3040
02:08:05,220 --> 02:08:06,060
Yeah, don't worry about it.

3041
02:08:06,060 --> 02:08:07,740
Yeah, no, separate lives.

3042
02:08:07,740 --> 02:08:10,580
They're both busy. Two seasons, two seasons on Tubi.

3043
02:08:10,580 --> 02:08:11,860
God, really? Wow, really?

3044
02:08:11,860 --> 02:08:14,220
Wow, I didn't know he was that long.

3045
02:08:14,220 --> 02:08:18,220
So yeah, Culp is good and they had to bring in him,

3046
02:08:18,220 --> 02:08:22,420
a big dog for this game because this game sounds good.

3047
02:08:22,420 --> 02:08:27,300
He stars as Reed Hawk, the evil CEO of Hawk Industries

3048
02:08:27,300 --> 02:08:29,700
and he is going to run for president,

3049
02:08:29,700 --> 02:08:31,580
but he is a bad guy.

3050
02:08:31,580 --> 02:08:36,540
He is a black hat and he cannot be the president.

3051
02:08:36,540 --> 02:08:40,380
At this time, evil CEOs were not allowed to be president.

3052
02:08:40,380 --> 02:08:45,020
So you, the player, has to stop him.

3053
02:08:45,020 --> 02:08:47,380
You have to sneak around his house

3054
02:08:47,380 --> 02:08:49,220
and the houses of his family.

3055
02:08:49,220 --> 02:08:54,220
And it's all done like very rear window through blinds.

3056
02:08:55,020 --> 02:08:56,820
You have to like leer.

3057
02:08:56,820 --> 02:08:57,660
You have to be a voyeur.

3058
02:08:57,660 --> 02:08:58,860
You have to be a voyeur.

3059
02:08:58,860 --> 02:09:01,580
You're the voyeur and find some evidence

3060
02:09:01,580 --> 02:09:04,860
to stop evil Reed Hawk from becoming president.

3061
02:09:04,860 --> 02:09:08,220
And the best part about this game, it has sex in it.

3062
02:09:08,220 --> 02:09:09,980
There's sex in the game.

3063
02:09:09,980 --> 02:09:13,100
There's even a part where two girls,

3064
02:09:13,100 --> 02:09:15,980
two girls are in 1994.

3065
02:09:15,980 --> 02:09:16,820
1994.

3066
02:09:16,820 --> 02:09:19,100
Are standing next to each other in their underwear

3067
02:09:19,100 --> 02:09:21,100
and they touch each other lightly

3068
02:09:21,100 --> 02:09:23,540
and then there's a phone call that interrupts the whole thing.

3069
02:09:23,540 --> 02:09:25,140
But it seems like if there's no phone call,

3070
02:09:25,140 --> 02:09:26,220
maybe they were gonna kiss or something.

3071
02:09:26,220 --> 02:09:27,260
Oh my God.

3072
02:09:27,260 --> 02:09:29,260
This is an edgy game.

3073
02:09:29,260 --> 02:09:33,060
So it had to, clearly it had to win the acting awards.

3074
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:34,340
And I forget the name of the actress,

3075
02:09:34,340 --> 02:09:36,180
but she gives the most sexual,

3076
02:09:36,180 --> 02:09:38,980
she gives the most horny speech.

3077
02:09:38,980 --> 02:09:41,820
Yeah, Grace, Grace Zabrinsky.

3078
02:09:41,820 --> 02:09:43,540
Grace Zabrinsky.

3079
02:09:43,540 --> 02:09:45,380
She wants Robert Culp.

3080
02:09:45,380 --> 02:09:48,180
It is heavy sexual tension.

3081
02:09:48,180 --> 02:09:49,420
Wait, which is this?

3082
02:09:49,420 --> 02:09:53,060
Which was the actress who played Susan's mom on Seinfeld?

3083
02:09:53,060 --> 02:09:54,540
That's a different category.

3084
02:09:54,540 --> 02:09:55,380
The idea.

3085
02:09:55,380 --> 02:09:56,220
That was the other one.

3086
02:09:56,220 --> 02:09:57,060
She's in this?

3087
02:09:57,820 --> 02:09:58,940
She accepts an award.

3088
02:09:58,940 --> 02:09:59,900
She what?

3089
02:09:59,900 --> 02:10:00,740
Wait a minute.

3090
02:10:00,740 --> 02:10:01,580
Now I gotta go back to my-

3091
02:10:01,580 --> 02:10:02,420
Is she Grace Zabrinsky?

3092
02:10:02,420 --> 02:10:04,060
My phone is, that's what I'm trying to figure out

3093
02:10:04,060 --> 02:10:06,260
is my phone is almost dead.

3094
02:10:06,260 --> 02:10:08,540
We're doing the longest episode we've done in a long time.

3095
02:10:08,540 --> 02:10:10,260
The phone is dying.

3096
02:10:10,260 --> 02:10:11,940
Look, in terms of Sexy Gay,

3097
02:10:11,940 --> 02:10:16,860
I was already choked up from the multiple airings

3098
02:10:16,860 --> 02:10:21,660
of the women's gel deodorant commercial

3099
02:10:21,660 --> 02:10:24,980
about the most important thing I put on.

3100
02:10:24,980 --> 02:10:27,220
And there's a sleazy narrator going,

3101
02:10:27,220 --> 02:10:28,380
is it red?

3102
02:10:30,100 --> 02:10:31,380
Talking about her lipstick.

3103
02:10:31,380 --> 02:10:33,020
And she's like, no.

3104
02:10:35,020 --> 02:10:36,420
This really loomed large in your head.

3105
02:10:36,420 --> 02:10:37,740
Yeah, was it tantalizing?

3106
02:10:37,740 --> 02:10:39,220
That's what I'm saying.

3107
02:10:39,220 --> 02:10:41,060
I was like, I can't think about a sexy game.

3108
02:10:41,060 --> 02:10:44,180
There's already sexy ads in here for deodorant.

3109
02:10:44,180 --> 02:10:45,380
I'm learning about hackers.

3110
02:10:45,380 --> 02:10:46,780
I'm getting turned on.

3111
02:10:46,780 --> 02:10:51,180
Well, and then plus we can't forget Andy Carvalhas.

3112
02:10:51,180 --> 02:10:54,220
And cute Andy Carvalhas is in it.

3113
02:10:54,900 --> 02:10:56,300
The sky's cracking boners.

3114
02:10:56,300 --> 02:10:59,860
The last 1% of my phone was dedicated to finding that name

3115
02:10:59,860 --> 02:11:00,900
so I could say that.

3116
02:11:00,900 --> 02:11:05,340
And it completely shut down before I could find the actress.

3117
02:11:05,340 --> 02:11:07,100
What a techno nightmare, Mike.

3118
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:09,340
Oh, gosh.

3119
02:11:09,340 --> 02:11:12,860
Anyway, the woman who plays Susan's mother on Seinfeld,

3120
02:11:12,860 --> 02:11:15,180
who's like that very dismissive lady,

3121
02:11:15,180 --> 02:11:17,660
like maybe 50s or early 50s or something,

3122
02:11:17,660 --> 02:11:19,220
wins an award.

3123
02:11:19,220 --> 02:11:20,900
And I'm trying to remember if it's this award.

3124
02:11:20,900 --> 02:11:21,740
Maybe it is.

3125
02:11:21,740 --> 02:11:23,900
Yeah, she's got kind of, she's got a very sexual energy.

3126
02:11:23,900 --> 02:11:27,020
Is she like 50-ish, late 40s maybe?

3127
02:11:27,020 --> 02:11:27,900
It could be.

3128
02:11:27,900 --> 02:11:29,340
Oh my gosh.

3129
02:11:29,340 --> 02:11:32,020
OK, then we bring it up and give me your iPad.

3130
02:11:32,020 --> 02:11:35,060
Then it's the main, then it's the actor award.

3131
02:11:35,060 --> 02:11:36,620
And this is all old men.

3132
02:11:36,620 --> 02:11:37,900
It's nothing but.

3133
02:11:37,900 --> 02:11:38,820
It's Robert Culp.

3134
02:11:38,820 --> 02:11:41,140
It's Leonard Nimoy.

3135
02:11:41,140 --> 02:11:44,260
And then my favorite part about it, Mickey Rooney.

3136
02:11:44,260 --> 02:11:45,340
Oh, I got so excited.

3137
02:11:45,340 --> 02:11:48,900
There's a CD-ROM where Mickey Rooney does a voice?

3138
02:11:48,900 --> 02:11:49,500
I know.

3139
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:50,700
Shocking.

3140
02:11:50,700 --> 02:11:52,900
I was watching this in the kitchen and I went,

3141
02:11:53,260 --> 02:11:55,100
I went like this because Lindsay was like,

3142
02:11:55,100 --> 02:11:56,060
she's like, what is this?

3143
02:11:56,060 --> 02:11:57,340
What are you watching?

3144
02:11:57,340 --> 02:11:58,700
What is happening?

3145
02:11:58,700 --> 02:12:01,260
You're taking a walk to look at Jason's iPad?

3146
02:12:01,260 --> 02:12:01,780
Yeah.

3147
02:12:01,780 --> 02:12:03,620
You're dragging the recorder around.

3148
02:12:03,620 --> 02:12:06,500
I have to cut some of the noise on this.

3149
02:12:06,500 --> 02:12:08,020
Crunch, crunch, crack.

3150
02:12:08,020 --> 02:12:09,780
That's not Mike's boner cracking.

3151
02:12:09,780 --> 02:12:10,420
No, it's not.

3152
02:12:10,420 --> 02:12:14,380
Oh, Grace Zabrinsky was also in Charmed in Ray Donovan.

3153
02:12:14,380 --> 02:12:16,580
Why do you have to go over there to see this, Mike?

3154
02:12:16,580 --> 02:12:17,460
Show me a picture.

3155
02:12:17,460 --> 02:12:18,740
Take Jason's word for it.

3156
02:12:18,740 --> 02:12:19,980
I just pulled up her Wikipedia.

3157
02:12:19,980 --> 02:12:21,180
It's an audio medium.

3158
02:12:21,260 --> 02:12:23,100
Why are you looking at a picture?

3159
02:12:23,100 --> 02:12:24,180
I wanted to see.

3160
02:12:24,180 --> 02:12:25,420
I wanted to make sure.

3161
02:12:25,420 --> 02:12:26,940
You want your boner to crack because you're

3162
02:12:26,940 --> 02:12:28,340
attracted to Grace Zabrinsky.

3163
02:12:28,340 --> 02:12:29,780
We're all horned up.

3164
02:12:29,780 --> 02:12:30,940
We've been here for hours.

3165
02:12:30,940 --> 02:12:31,820
Yeah, there she is.

3166
02:12:31,820 --> 02:12:33,620
She was on Seinfeld.

3167
02:12:33,620 --> 02:12:36,020
But you didn't trust your friend's word?

3168
02:12:36,020 --> 02:12:37,500
He was trying to tell you.

3169
02:12:37,500 --> 02:12:38,300
First paragraph.

3170
02:12:38,300 --> 02:12:39,460
No, let me see a photo.

3171
02:12:39,460 --> 02:12:40,700
If I pulled it up, it was just going

3172
02:12:40,700 --> 02:12:42,700
to be all pictures of Andy Carvalhas.

3173
02:12:42,700 --> 02:12:43,220
OK?

3174
02:12:43,220 --> 02:12:45,620
You can't trust this guy when he finds a lady pretty.

3175
02:12:45,620 --> 02:12:46,220
Tab after tab.

3176
02:12:46,220 --> 02:12:48,980
As George's fiancee, Susan's mother.

3177
02:12:48,980 --> 02:12:50,060
That's right.

3178
02:12:50,060 --> 02:12:50,860
Wait, we knew that.

3179
02:12:50,860 --> 02:12:52,180
Why'd you have to say that part?

3180
02:12:52,180 --> 02:12:53,020
I'm just saying.

3181
02:12:53,020 --> 02:12:53,780
He's confirming it.

3182
02:12:53,780 --> 02:12:55,340
It's in the first paragraph.

3183
02:12:55,340 --> 02:12:56,620
He's getting too worked up.

3184
02:12:56,620 --> 02:12:58,460
Like, I got a lady's doing that.

3185
02:12:58,460 --> 02:13:00,420
Playing over here.

3186
02:13:00,420 --> 02:13:02,740
He said that to cover the fact that he was just scrolling

3187
02:13:02,740 --> 02:13:06,540
through Carvalhas' photos from Google Image Search.

3188
02:13:06,540 --> 02:13:11,380
Your iPad is overheating from too much Carvalhas.

3189
02:13:11,380 --> 02:13:12,860
Again?

3190
02:13:12,860 --> 02:13:15,220
That's how the crack got in there.

3191
02:13:15,220 --> 02:13:15,860
OK.

3192
02:13:15,860 --> 02:13:18,940
That proves it, how Jason cracked his screen.

3193
02:13:18,940 --> 02:13:20,900
Wait a minute.

3194
02:13:20,900 --> 02:13:22,100
He cracked his screen.

3195
02:13:22,100 --> 02:13:22,620
Yeah.

3196
02:13:22,620 --> 02:13:24,620
He cracked his screen from cracking a boner?

3197
02:13:24,620 --> 02:13:25,660
Yeah, well.

3198
02:13:25,660 --> 02:13:29,460
My point, let's get things as unsexy as they can be

3199
02:13:29,460 --> 02:13:30,860
and talk about Mickey Rooney.

3200
02:13:30,860 --> 02:13:37,020
Because the clip that they play, it is a CD-ROM about race

3201
02:13:37,020 --> 02:13:39,020
tracks, and they play a clip.

3202
02:13:39,020 --> 02:13:42,300
And in the clip, it seems as though Mickey Rooney

3203
02:13:42,300 --> 02:13:44,540
is a guy betting on the horses.

3204
02:13:44,540 --> 02:13:47,860
And in the clip, he says this.

3205
02:13:47,860 --> 02:13:51,300
There's a long, very quiet walk home

3206
02:13:51,300 --> 02:13:55,340
when you lose the whole bundle.

3207
02:13:55,340 --> 02:13:57,900
So this is a CD-ROM where Mickey Rooney

3208
02:13:57,900 --> 02:14:01,260
is a sad man going broke at the race track,

3209
02:14:01,260 --> 02:14:04,060
and we haven't heard of it till 2023?

3210
02:14:04,060 --> 02:14:04,980
This is madness.

3211
02:14:04,980 --> 02:14:07,220
And then I try to look it up, and all the emulators

3212
02:14:07,220 --> 02:14:08,060
are broken.

3213
02:14:08,060 --> 02:14:09,500
They're all bright red.

3214
02:14:09,500 --> 02:14:10,780
That means error.

3215
02:14:10,780 --> 02:14:11,900
Means I can't play them.

3216
02:14:11,900 --> 02:14:16,300
I want a copy of A Great Day at the Races, the sad Mickey

3217
02:14:16,300 --> 02:14:18,380
Rooney horse racing game.

3218
02:14:18,380 --> 02:14:20,500
We got to do an episode on it.

3219
02:14:20,500 --> 02:14:24,940
Another day, another dollar lost.

3220
02:14:24,940 --> 02:14:28,980
I guess I'll have to steal my booze today.

3221
02:14:28,980 --> 02:14:31,500
There's many games where you root around

3222
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:33,460
for tickets on the ground.

3223
02:14:33,460 --> 02:14:35,820
Maybe someone dropped a winning and didn't know.

3224
02:14:35,820 --> 02:14:36,320
Yeah.

3225
02:14:39,980 --> 02:14:41,020
Maybe I'm little.

3226
02:14:41,020 --> 02:14:44,060
Maybe I can pose as a child and try

3227
02:14:44,060 --> 02:14:45,980
to appeal to somebody's sympathies

3228
02:14:45,980 --> 02:14:47,900
to buy me my first beer.

3229
02:14:47,900 --> 02:14:50,140
If I lose, I can pose as a jockey

3230
02:14:50,140 --> 02:14:52,620
and steal one of these horses and sell them

3231
02:14:52,620 --> 02:14:55,020
on the black market.

3232
02:14:55,020 --> 02:14:57,100
I bet I could beat a horse.

3233
02:14:57,100 --> 02:15:00,740
I bet I could outrace a horse.

3234
02:15:00,740 --> 02:15:04,180
Run me in the race.

3235
02:15:04,180 --> 02:15:07,180
I'm at the end of my stuff, pretty much.

3236
02:15:07,180 --> 02:15:08,820
There's the best game award.

3237
02:15:08,820 --> 02:15:10,540
Mortal Kombat wins.

3238
02:15:10,540 --> 02:15:15,060
And Leslie Nielsen says, whoopee.

3239
02:15:15,060 --> 02:15:17,140
I really like that juxtaposition.

3240
02:15:17,140 --> 02:15:19,580
Before I play the last clip, is there

3241
02:15:19,580 --> 02:15:22,620
anything else in this shockingly long episode?

3242
02:15:22,620 --> 02:15:24,020
My phone's died.

3243
02:15:24,020 --> 02:15:25,980
I don't know what my notes say.

3244
02:15:25,980 --> 02:15:26,660
I forgot.

3245
02:15:26,660 --> 02:15:27,500
I think I'm out.

3246
02:15:27,500 --> 02:15:28,460
I think that's for the best.

3247
02:15:28,460 --> 02:15:30,380
That's the universe editing it for you.

3248
02:15:30,380 --> 02:15:31,740
The Kid won.

3249
02:15:31,740 --> 02:15:33,020
The Kid won Sim City.

3250
02:15:33,020 --> 02:15:33,740
Oh, you're right.

3251
02:15:33,740 --> 02:15:36,140
The Kid gets to be the mayor of Santa Barbara.

3252
02:15:36,140 --> 02:15:39,340
Santa Barbara for 24 hours thrown into anarchy.

3253
02:15:39,340 --> 02:15:41,540
It became a purge situation.

3254
02:15:41,540 --> 02:15:42,020
Yes.

3255
02:15:42,020 --> 02:15:42,500
Yeah, yeah.

3256
02:15:42,500 --> 02:15:44,340
As we know, Santa Barbara had to get.

3257
02:15:44,340 --> 02:15:47,180
Yeah, Santa Barbara was a lawless city for two years.

3258
02:15:47,180 --> 02:15:50,540
They had to chase out all the 10-year-old no-goodniks

3259
02:15:50,540 --> 02:15:52,580
let in by the smartest kid in America.

3260
02:15:52,580 --> 02:15:53,100
Yeah.

3261
02:15:53,100 --> 02:15:56,140
Smartest, aliquist kid in America, I say.

3262
02:15:56,140 --> 02:15:57,580
Yeah.

3263
02:15:57,580 --> 02:15:59,300
But they cleaned it up.

3264
02:15:59,300 --> 02:16:01,180
They firebombed parts of the town.

3265
02:16:01,180 --> 02:16:04,260
And ultimately, the awards ended.

3266
02:16:04,260 --> 02:16:07,860
And they ended with this.

3267
02:16:07,860 --> 02:16:09,780
Now, if you're a cyber maniac like me,

3268
02:16:09,780 --> 02:16:11,060
I bet you had a blast.

3269
02:16:11,060 --> 02:16:13,740
If you're a cyber maniac like me.

3270
02:16:13,740 --> 02:16:17,140
And if you've never heard of a CD-ROM before the show,

3271
02:16:17,140 --> 02:16:18,980
it's pretty exciting.

3272
02:16:18,980 --> 02:16:22,540
I know I can't wait to get home.

3273
02:16:22,540 --> 02:16:25,180
I can't wait to get home and grab ahold of my joystick

3274
02:16:25,180 --> 02:16:28,500
and boot up the hard drive.

3275
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:29,740
Nice.

3276
02:16:29,740 --> 02:16:31,660
Ends with a joke where Leslie Nielsen

3277
02:16:31,660 --> 02:16:33,180
stands next to Jonathan Taylor Thomas

3278
02:16:33,180 --> 02:16:36,820
and says, I'm going home to jerk off.

3279
02:16:36,820 --> 02:16:40,900
Yes, Jonathan, let's all grab our joysticks

3280
02:16:40,900 --> 02:16:42,860
and give them a good crack.

3281
02:16:42,860 --> 02:16:45,820
Goodnight, everybody.

3282
02:16:45,820 --> 02:16:46,540
That's all.

3283
02:16:46,540 --> 02:16:47,020
That's all.

3284
02:16:47,020 --> 02:16:47,540
Wow.

3285
02:16:47,540 --> 02:16:50,300
I mean, I would make an effort to have some last bit

3286
02:16:50,300 --> 02:16:51,380
in this episode.

3287
02:16:51,380 --> 02:16:52,460
This is fucking crazy.

3288
02:16:52,460 --> 02:16:55,740
I had no idea this would go for so long.

3289
02:16:55,740 --> 02:16:58,100
Robert Denby, you gave us quite a gift.

3290
02:16:58,100 --> 02:16:59,460
God bless you.

3291
02:16:59,460 --> 02:17:02,420
You gave us everything we wanted in one two-hour package.

3292
02:17:02,420 --> 02:17:06,020
Listeners, you must go watch this.

3293
02:17:06,020 --> 02:17:11,060
As it aired on TBS, the Superstation, it's incredible.

3294
02:17:11,060 --> 02:17:14,860
Honestly, think about how many Academy Awards

3295
02:17:14,860 --> 02:17:20,620
you have watched all of the night of and been bored to tears.

3296
02:17:20,620 --> 02:17:23,180
This is better than, I'll just say,

3297
02:17:23,180 --> 02:17:24,980
it's better than any Oscars, right?

3298
02:17:24,980 --> 02:17:25,500
Isn't it?

3299
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:26,660
I guess it is.

3300
02:17:26,660 --> 02:17:28,260
Yeah, it is.

3301
02:17:28,260 --> 02:17:31,620
Maybe the best of the best, Billy Crystal era,

3302
02:17:31,620 --> 02:17:34,740
where everybody was on fire and they were tall,

3303
02:17:34,740 --> 02:17:35,540
the Lanch.

3304
02:17:35,540 --> 02:17:36,860
But think about this.

3305
02:17:36,860 --> 02:17:37,700
We love this so much.

3306
02:17:37,700 --> 02:17:39,100
And they didn't even need the Lanch.

3307
02:17:39,100 --> 02:17:40,020
They didn't even get Bruce.

3308
02:17:40,020 --> 02:17:41,540
I was hoping his name was in there,

3309
02:17:41,540 --> 02:17:42,740
but his name is not in the credits.

3310
02:17:42,740 --> 02:17:44,060
And they didn't even need him, yeah.

3311
02:17:44,060 --> 02:17:44,940
Yeah, yeah.

3312
02:17:44,940 --> 02:17:48,700
That's how much fucking cyber firepower they had.

3313
02:17:48,700 --> 02:17:50,460
Whoever's alive in the credits on this

3314
02:17:50,460 --> 02:17:52,220
should do the next Oscars.

3315
02:17:52,220 --> 02:17:53,020
Yes.

3316
02:17:53,020 --> 02:17:54,580
Give it to, well, there was one name.

3317
02:17:54,580 --> 02:17:56,020
I don't know if he's alive or dead.

3318
02:17:56,020 --> 02:17:59,420
But when I looked him up, the first name that comes up,

3319
02:17:59,420 --> 02:18:02,220
one of his other credits is like a Leslie Nielsen golf video.

3320
02:18:02,220 --> 02:18:02,860
Oh, I saw that.

3321
02:18:02,860 --> 02:18:05,220
He's trying to get in on the dwarf trend.

3322
02:18:05,220 --> 02:18:08,860
And he seemed to have been born in the 1930s.

3323
02:18:08,860 --> 02:18:10,220
So I don't know if that's who.

3324
02:18:10,220 --> 02:18:12,020
If he's still alive, I don't know if that's who you give

3325
02:18:12,020 --> 02:18:12,820
the Oscars to.

3326
02:18:12,820 --> 02:18:14,420
All right, well.

3327
02:18:14,420 --> 02:18:17,980
But Culp died 13 years ago.

3328
02:18:17,980 --> 02:18:21,020
Who else had a golf video?

3329
02:18:21,020 --> 02:18:23,180
You can't ask this question now.

3330
02:18:23,180 --> 02:18:27,380
Tim Conway had a series of directed VHS golf videos,

3331
02:18:27,380 --> 02:18:28,380
I believe.

3332
02:18:28,380 --> 02:18:29,460
Dorff, I just said it.

3333
02:18:29,460 --> 02:18:30,740
Oh, is that the same one I think of?

3334
02:18:30,740 --> 02:18:31,780
Yes, Tim Conway and Dorff.

3335
02:18:31,780 --> 02:18:32,300
Sorry.

3336
02:18:32,300 --> 02:18:33,180
How embarrassing.

3337
02:18:33,180 --> 02:18:34,100
I will cut that out.

3338
02:18:34,100 --> 02:18:35,140
You're a fucking moron.

3339
02:18:35,140 --> 02:18:36,700
Fucking idiot, I am.

3340
02:18:36,700 --> 02:18:37,660
Yeah, he did.

3341
02:18:37,660 --> 02:18:39,740
And it was called Dorff, dude.

3342
02:18:39,740 --> 02:18:42,500
I guess, oh, I thought you meant Steven Dorff had a series

3343
02:18:42,500 --> 02:18:44,260
of golf videos on VHS.

3344
02:18:44,260 --> 02:18:48,100
Another big area that opened up, funny instructional videos.

3345
02:18:48,100 --> 02:18:50,820
The CD-ROM era should have lasted longer.

3346
02:18:50,820 --> 02:18:52,340
Why didn't it go longer?

3347
02:18:52,340 --> 02:18:53,700
This thing is incredible.

3348
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:57,740
We must preserve Cybermania 94 as a time capsule of what

3349
02:18:57,740 --> 02:18:58,620
mattered.

3350
02:18:58,620 --> 02:19:01,340
Not if we needed to represent just the 90s,

3351
02:19:01,380 --> 02:19:03,540
but also how about the entire century?

3352
02:19:03,540 --> 02:19:05,500
The entire 20th century.

3353
02:19:05,500 --> 02:19:08,780
I say, flush it all down the toilet the way fucking

3354
02:19:08,780 --> 02:19:10,020
Zaslav wants.

3355
02:19:10,020 --> 02:19:13,220
And the only thing that should remain is Cybermania 94.

3356
02:19:13,220 --> 02:19:14,140
There I said it.

3357
02:19:14,140 --> 02:19:14,860
I think you're right.

3358
02:19:14,860 --> 02:19:16,580
And when the aliens, well, I shouldn't

3359
02:19:16,580 --> 02:19:17,460
say when the aliens come.

3360
02:19:17,460 --> 02:19:19,700
They're already here, as we've been seeing in the headlines.

3361
02:19:19,700 --> 02:19:21,220
Are the aliens helping the orcas?

3362
02:19:21,220 --> 02:19:22,460
Is that what's happening?

3363
02:19:22,460 --> 02:19:23,340
Oh, yeah, maybe.

3364
02:19:23,340 --> 02:19:25,060
Or the orcas are the aliens.

3365
02:19:25,060 --> 02:19:25,740
Oh, yeah.

3366
02:19:25,740 --> 02:19:27,020
They have been the whole time.

3367
02:19:27,020 --> 02:19:27,540
That's right.

3368
02:19:27,540 --> 02:19:29,180
Wow, just land and wig.

3369
02:19:29,220 --> 02:19:32,140
I know one thing that'll tell us that aliens have actually

3370
02:19:32,140 --> 02:19:35,060
infiltrated society already.

3371
02:19:35,060 --> 02:19:38,900
It's called Disney Marvel's secret invasion.

3372
02:19:38,900 --> 02:19:40,220
I'm hitting stop on the recorder.

3373
02:19:40,220 --> 02:19:41,540
Oh, OK.

3374
02:19:41,540 --> 02:19:43,180
Club 3, I don't need to do any of that.

3375
02:19:43,180 --> 02:19:44,140
You know what you're doing.

3376
02:19:44,140 --> 02:19:44,620
Long episode.

3377
02:19:44,620 --> 02:19:45,140
Bye.

3378
02:19:45,140 --> 02:19:46,700
Yes.
