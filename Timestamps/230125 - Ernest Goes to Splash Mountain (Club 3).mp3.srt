1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Club Three.

2
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,560
All right, it's Club Three, let's cut the shit.

3
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,080
We're talking Ernest goes to Splash Mountain

4
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,800
and I'm happy about that, that's a good thing.

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,520
But I can't help but say at the beginning,

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,360
this was not an ordinary month with just ordinary topics.

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,160
And we had one, there was one that was sitting in the five

8
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,960
that I was so confident about.

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,640
Even, and I even told you guys like,

10
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
well, let's pick a few others,

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,320
but we know what it's gonna be.

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,280
And what we thought that was gonna be is Bar Rescue

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,040
and a deep dive into the world of Bar Rescue

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,360
and Jon Taffer.

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,600
And look what happened.

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,400
Look, how did we not?

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,120
Like they're wasting the topics.

18
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,280
They're throwing the good topics away.

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,840
They're throwing them right in the trash.

20
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,160
Those are perfectly good topics.

21
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,920
The voting machines are rigged.

22
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,520
We have to investigate.

23
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,880
And they're soaked in raw chicken.

24
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,560
You're conducting your votes

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,800
with chicken soaked voting buttons.

26
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,840
You're wasting paper from the ballots.

27
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,080
The ballots are too big.

28
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,880
New Orleans Square is on fire again.

29
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,760
Every five years it's on fire.

30
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,840
There are digital ways to do this.

31
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,520
You need to get with the times

32
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,880
and you need to fix your fucking marriage.

33
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,120
I'll be back tomorrow.

34
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,240
You better have called your wife by then.

35
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,960
Oh, you could have had that.

36
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,960
You could have had it all.

37
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,000
As Adele says, you could have had it all.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,200
You could have had an episode

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,840
that we would have had to record

40
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,720
in fits and starts in 10 sessions

41
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,360
because we blew our voices out every time.

42
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,360
That's why McGruff 3 has been taking so long

43
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,520
because we are trying to get our voices back

44
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,360
to full strength.

45
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,640
We've done so many sessions on it.

46
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,840
It's good vibrations.

47
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,320
It's been going for six months.

48
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,120
I don't know if this will ever end,

49
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,960
but we got another one of the books tomorrow.

50
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
I'm dreading it.

51
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,080
Tearing my vocal cords apart.

52
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,920
I have to say though,

53
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,880
I was very pleased by all the votes for port of entry.

54
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,960
And then people go, this is for Jason.

55
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,000
This is a vote for Jason.

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,360
The heart of PTR.

57
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,760
Look, I'm not saying it.

58
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,800
People say it.

59
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,640
I don't know.

60
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,000
Was that quote said?

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,880
Are you making that one up now?

62
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,680
Jason, Jason, let's be honest here.

63
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,920
I don't say the, you know, people say it.

64
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,760
Maybe no one.

65
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,240
Maybe no one did say it.

66
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,160
I don't know.

67
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,800
I think you're hearing it more and more.

68
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,880
I think I called myself the heart and soul of podcast,

69
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,720
the ride on my sent in video on the episode of

70
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,200
double threats.

71
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,040
You called that,

72
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,200
you could, that contained the phrase of the heart and soul.

73
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,160
I called myself the heart and soul of podcast, the ride.

74
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,440
So Jason's just calling himself the heart.

75
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,520
All right, I'll take the brains.

76
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,040
That's fine.

77
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,200
Jason's the brains of podcast.

78
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,160
Oh no.

79
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,560
Sure sleeps a lot for the brainiac, but that's all right.

80
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,520
Well, I'm the big old dick.

81
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,000
That's what I'm calling.

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,840
All right.

83
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,840
The massive hog of podcast snort snort from Mr. Hog.

84
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,360
She was Mr. Hog here in the new year.

85
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,000
You take your brains.

86
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,720
Well, with that said, I mean, Jason,

87
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,720
is it, do you want to any further endorse port of entry,

88
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,040
which is the entrance area of islands of adventure?

89
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,880
Main street.

90
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,960
Sure.

91
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,880
Yeah.

92
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,720
I mean, look, if it's going to second chance voting,

93
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,920
if it automatically gets in,

94
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,440
I would push it up to the main feed if I had my druthers, but.

95
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,680
Is that, was that a move we can do if,

96
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,040
Didn't we promote something?

97
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,560
We promoted something that didn't win.

98
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,200
If it wins, would you say, well, I will,

99
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,800
I am taking it upon myself to move this up?

100
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,640
No, no, I just meant in general,

101
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,360
if it wins where the club three voters have spoken,

102
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,760
so we must abide by their choice.

103
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,080
Then it must be in the club.

104
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,200
But if it does not win,

105
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,120
you will enact another episode elsewhere.

106
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,800
Let me ask a question and maybe,

107
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,720
oh no, the taffer voice has ruined me already.

108
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,280
We've done my gruff sessions all weekend

109
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,240
and our throats are bleeding.

110
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,600
It was so disturbing when you just coughed up blood.

111
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,720
That was really gross.

112
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,560
I really apologize.

113
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,640
It was like 40 minutes in.

114
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,480
Is it, maybe I'm opening up a big can of worms here.

115
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,600
Can we have a thing where the club three members

116
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,000
maybe vote on referendums as well?

117
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,840
Episode topics is like,

118
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,760
so yeah, is it a possible thing to add to our

119
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,440
PTR constitution that we can move up a winner

120
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,160
of a club three poll to a main feed?

121
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,720
Or is it a referendum just giving Jason

122
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,000
some sort of sweeping power?

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,880
He has more power than the two of us.

124
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,720
Oh my God.

125
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,120
I'm not saying I'm not proposing that,

126
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,600
but I'm just saying in a hypothetical way,

127
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,280
should we have the club three members vote on like

128
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,000
what the next episode is and then on something to add

129
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,400
to the podcast to write constitution?

130
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,240
I'm not sure.

131
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,560
I mean, I'm comfortable with the way things are

132
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,560
where we are this supreme group of infallible,

133
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,920
forever serving members who kind of have more power

134
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,280
than the votes and the democracy in a way.

135
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,560
I'm pretty comfortable with that in all its forms.

136
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,720
Like that's power to me.

137
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,880
So this is, I don't know.

138
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,680
I think you're talking bedlam here.

139
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,160
You start opening up amendments

140
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,880
and giving people true rights.

141
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,720
Oh, right.

142
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,560
Oh, okay.

143
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,280
Interesting what you're saying here.

144
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,960
You know, I think let's just keep it in mind.

145
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,680
I'm not saying we got to do it now, but yeah,

146
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,520
if there's something that we, you know,

147
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,240
are having a disagreement about,

148
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,560
maybe we just throw it to the special club three listeners.

149
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,680
I'm not, yeah, I don't think we have to do it every episode

150
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,720
or every month or whatever, but yes,

151
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,080
there's something that gets so heated

152
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,680
that it can only be solved by committee, by the people.

153
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,040
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.

154
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,960
So do we need to do this with like,

155
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,880
is, what's the name of the goddamn Green Day?

156
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,360
Billy Joel Armstrong?

157
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,320
No, what's the name of the, the perfect album?

158
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,160
Oakland Coffee?

159
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,680
No, the album, the perfect, you said it.

160
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,160
That's a perfect, you said it breathlessly

161
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,360
that it's a perfect album.

162
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,200
Do I say American Idiot is perfect?

163
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,440
American Idiot is the name of it.

164
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,440
I'm so happy I forgot, you can tell

165
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,680
I had a great Christmas break

166
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,880
that I forgot the name of American Idiot.

167
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,120
That's the Green Day coffee line that they introduced.

168
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,480
The Green Day is summoned

169
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,280
and your second guess is Oakland Coffee.

170
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,960
What are the, let's do kind of like the password of,

171
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,720
or what's the, like name 10 things about Green Day.

172
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,880
To you, one of them is Oakland Coffee.

173
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,240
While it's been recently,

174
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,640
a couple of people have sent me ads for it

175
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,840
just to keep it on my radar.

176
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,600
Yes, Oakland Coffee is, I haven't tried it, but yeah.

177
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,480
Yeah, there's one.

178
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,640
That's the thing you could vote on.

179
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,600
Is Oakland Coffee perfect?

180
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Is American Idiot perfect?

181
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,680
Or is one as perfect as the other?

182
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,200
Yeah, it could be something like that,

183
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,040
or it could be, do we vote on giving Jason like

184
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,240
supreme power over episode choice for two years?

185
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,440
For two years?

186
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,360
I guess first of all, we're not doing that.

187
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,200
That's hypothetical.

188
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,760
First we're falsifying quotes about Jason.

189
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,440
Now we're giving him, now he gets the reigns

190
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,960
for two straight years.

191
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,200
We're not voting on that.

192
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,720
We're not bringing that to the people.

193
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,960
I'm just saying hypothetically that could be something

194
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,600
that everyone votes on.

195
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,720
That's all I'm saying.

196
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,560
Jason, you think that?

197
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,760
Matt, what do you think about all this shit?

198
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,640
You know, I think we just had to see which direction

199
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,640
the will of the people leans if it comes to a point

200
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,640
where somehow I have gargantuan voting and final say power.

201
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,880
And you two are like a Kevin McCarthy,

202
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,480
and I'm like the kicked in the head by a horse caucus

203
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,440
in the US House.

204
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,840
And somehow I have all the power.

205
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,880
You know, we'll just have to wait and see.

206
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,640
So I just want to, yeah, I want to put it in our brains,

207
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,600
and if it pops up where a good opportunity,

208
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,800
I think we could throw it to the Club 3 members.

209
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,480
I'd like to tack on an amendment to the Jason power

210
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,120
referendum that if that comes to a vote,

211
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,000
that also, with great power comes great responsibility,

212
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,800
and you now have the responsibility

213
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,520
of editing the show as well.

214
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,920
That's in your court now.

215
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,120
Writing the levels, you take over on the headphones

216
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,960
for Mike.

217
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,280
We might see a shockingly quick drop in quality

218
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,280
in the show if that happens.

219
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,160
Because Mike, I've seen Mike practically asleep

220
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,640
with his eyes closed doing text stuff,

221
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,200
or like this stuff he's like, I'll just crack this out.

222
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,040
Where is that?

223
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,840
I don't know, you're always, like you never,

224
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,200
you haven't gotten, I always say you haven't gotten

225
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,480
a good night's sleep since I met you in 2009.

226
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,320
That's true, well, yeah.

227
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,160
So.

228
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,640
You get two good nights of sleep every single night.

229
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,120
Yeah, that's true.

230
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,960
I know.

231
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,560
16 hours again.

232
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,440
The power of, you know, laws of energy transference,

233
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,520
it can't be destroyed.

234
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,960
The good night's sleep can't be destroyed.

235
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,520
It has to go somewhere, and I try to give it back to him,

236
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,760
but it's just not possible.

237
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
You take Mike's.

238
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,920
You take Mike's from him.

239
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,000
If you're not gonna do it, I will.

240
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,920
Okay, so what I think we can sum up here is that

241
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,400
now and the future we can, if we really feel strongly

242
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,960
somebody can bring something that they want the audience

243
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,760
to vote on, but we each can tack an amendment on it.

244
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,560
We can add pork to the idea.

245
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,400
Yes, great.

246
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,840
We can add pork to it, and so you could bog it down.

247
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,000
So it could be Jason wants to propose that he's in charge

248
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,840
of the show for two years, but then you could bog it down

249
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,880
with something that the audience would not want.

250
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,400
That I give, uh-huh, uh-huh.

251
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm trying to think.

252
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,040
We just put, well, I'm trying to think.

253
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,720
Every episode has chewing on the microphone from now on.

254
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,160
Every episode has chewing on the microphone.

255
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,240
Or I would say like-

256
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,200
Navi Babies.

257
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,800
There's a Navi Baby check-in corner every single episode.

258
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,400
Every five minutes, the song Scatman and Hatman plays,

259
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,720
and then oftentimes he just plays over us talking,

260
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,120
and you can kind of make out what we're saying.

261
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,480
So I could completely sink that proposal.

262
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,560
So I think that's fair.

263
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,880
That's in, you could do that whenever you want

264
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,440
as the editor of many of the episodes.

265
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,280
Well, here's what's funny.

266
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,760
I have put little things in episodes recently

267
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,960
that no one's caught.

268
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,200
What?

269
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,560
I don't wanna say what they are.

270
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Huh?

271
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,120
I put little things that I thought somebody would notice

272
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,800
in episodes, and it's not happened.

273
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,920
No one's noticed this.

274
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,120
Can not imagine, okay.

275
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,920
I mean, like, the listeners haven't, and we haven't.

276
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,040
I don't know that we're always re-listening.

277
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,800
What kind of, what degree of thing?

278
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,360
What can you say about the things without giving it away?

279
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,480
They're just little tiny audio things,

280
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,600
and they're not during the actual talking of the episodes.

281
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,840
But they're in-

282
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,120
Little Paul is dead in nuggets.

283
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,160
Yeah, similar to that, yes.

284
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,760
I don't know, I'm not sure where any of these

285
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,520
have ever been, if they really exist.

286
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,520
Yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip.

287
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,440
Scatman, I've never heard of any of these little drops.

288
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,320
It's just reverse scatman hatman.

289
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm just looping around.

290
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,760
How, well, this is a little Easter egg hunt

291
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,920
you've issued to the listener.

292
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,240
Have you noticed anything weird?

293
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,840
I would say in the last, there's a,

294
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,760
the one I'm thinking of mostly is in the last month

295
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,760
and a half, I put it in there.

296
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,600
Wow, well somebody's gonna-

297
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,600
And I noticed anyone bring it up, so I wonder.

298
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,080
Wow, wow.

299
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,640
Okay, well, there's an assignment and some new protocols.

300
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,960
We'll throw some votes your way.

301
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,120
That's right, there's a lot of business to attend to here.

302
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,680
But to get to the primary one, the winner this much,

303
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,040
I am excited, look, I'm upset about Bar Rescue and John,

304
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,680
but I'm really excited that Ernest Goes to Splash Mountain

305
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,480
came around as suggested by Jonathan Cook.

306
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,560
This, of course, is a special from 1989

307
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,640
about the first man to brave

308
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,920
the then brand new attraction Splash Mountain

309
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,360
and that man happens to be the lovable,

310
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,000
clumsy, redneck Ernest P. Worrall.

311
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,840
Of course.

312
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:31,840
Of many types of media from when we were growing up.

313
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,760
There's a timeliness to this in that I think

314
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,640
by the time it's out, either it is about to happen

315
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,280
or will have happened that Disney World Splash Mountain,

316
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,200
the original Splash Mountain iteration there

317
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,400
will have closed.

318
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,240
Disneyland, I don't know, they haven't said the date

319
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,280
as we're recording this, but I don't think

320
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,280
it's long for this world as the Tiana makeover begins.

321
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,560
Is there a date?

322
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,520
I don't think for Disneyland yet,

323
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,800
unless they have confused brand new information.

324
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,640
I'm not sure.

325
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah.

326
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,440
Give it a look and if you want to declare anything

327
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,840
that you get if you're right, feel free as well.

328
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,200
Well, we should have the audience vote

329
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,680
if he gets it, if he's right.

330
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,080
But the point is either way, we're losing these real soon,

331
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,720
original Splash Mountain for good reasons,

332
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,000
but some things will start disappearing

333
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,120
about that initial iteration, Splash Mountains

334
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,160
on people's minds currently trending a lot

335
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,080
on our type of Twitter, which is always concerning

336
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,240
given certain ways that it's been trending.

337
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,080
Uh-huh, sure.

338
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,320
I think it was you, Scott, made a joke

339
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,880
about the new Tiana restaurant.

340
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,400
Oh yes, because that was also just announced

341
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,280
that they're turning the French market

342
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,160
in New Orleans Square into Tiana's,

343
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,000
which we've speculated on on the show.

344
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,440
Does that go into Hungry Bear?

345
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,680
Does Critter Country start becoming Princess

346
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,040
in the Frog Country?

347
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,080
But no, instead it is Bridget,

348
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,400
because New Orleans makes sense thematically too.

349
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,760
So, new restaurant.

350
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,760
It's a buffeteria style that has seemingly

351
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,760
not been updated in a long time.

352
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,720
They switched the menu every now and then.

353
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,360
And you were like, let's not be creepy

354
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,560
and weird about this one.

355
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,600
And wouldn't you know it, we got some replies

356
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,240
that sure enough were creepy and weird.

357
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,080
I couldn't believe you.

358
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,600
Like actually, you make a joke that actually involves

359
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,840
an issue, quote unquote, and then you get stuck

360
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,200
getting these issue creeps.

361
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,960
Deadly serious, do not follow us.

362
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,000
That's all of course, they never do.

363
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,840
Always, always.

364
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,440
They get on Twitter a huntin'.

365
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,200
They got huntin' to do.

366
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,680
I'm itchin' for a fight today.

367
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,560
A fight that we are not going to get into.

368
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,200
We have better things to do.

369
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,520
No.

370
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,360
Very strange.

371
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,400
You are both correct.

372
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,080
KTLA has an article from like 10.

373
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,760
I'm right?

374
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,600
What am I right about?

375
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,320
About Splash Mountain not closing in Disneyland.

376
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,040
They haven't officially announced the article

377
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,680
from earlier today on KTLA.

378
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,160
When will Disneyland Splash Mountain close

379
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,440
for good theme park bloggers way in?

380
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,240
What?

381
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,480
It's still speculation.

382
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,520
It's still speculation.

383
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,600
Why, what?

384
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,040
What a non-store.

385
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,360
First of all, why weren't we asked?

386
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,040
And second of all, why was anyone asked?

387
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,880
I don't know.

388
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,840
Yeah, just to start.

389
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,120
January 30th.

390
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,240
March 18th.

391
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,720
I don't know, like what?

392
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,560
It's a great article.

393
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,760
It's a psychic.

394
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,040
Yeah, they're more, I don't know.

395
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,160
Maybe there's a theme park fan psychic out there

396
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,120
that covers all the ground.

397
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,960
Maybe.

398
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,440
We hope.

399
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,000
There's gotta be a street in Orlando

400
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,160
full of theme park psychics.

401
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,840
I'm calling a shot.

402
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,280
Episode about theme park psychics in the year 2023.

403
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,240
Great, great.

404
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,200
Well, we'll find it.

405
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,040
We'll have them on the show.

406
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,480
But yeah, you know, Splash Mountain winding down.

407
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,960
No more original ride.

408
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,400
No more petitions saying not to take away.

409
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,040
No more pointless petitions saying not to take away

410
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,360
the original ride.

411
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,640
But there's a lot of, you know,

412
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,760
fond memories I feel like associated

413
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,760
with the opening of the ride.

414
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,480
Especially the like, the promotional blitz of 1989.

415
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,320
So many commercials,

416
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,480
presence in every special Disney did around that time.

417
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,560
Whether or not it was all Splash Mountain or not.

418
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,400
Of course, the famous zip,

419
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,240
the crazy rap that got some play on Twitter a few years ago

420
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,040
for being called horny, I guess.

421
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,200
That's one take on it.

422
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,160
I, it's hard to see horniness through like such,

423
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,120
such bright clothes, through the like brightest

424
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,080
11 year old clothes you've ever seen.

425
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,280
Yeah, I don't get that from the clip.

426
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,320
They kind of like sway their hips.

427
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,120
The boys and the girls at each other a little bit.

428
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,960
I guess.

429
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,040
I was a little surprised that was the angle.

430
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,400
I guess that feels like a weird like ultra Christian

431
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,560
like point of view, I guess.

432
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,680
But I don't think that's where it was coming from.

433
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,320
Like this dancing is obscene.

434
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,680
Yeah, that special was banned from being viewed

435
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,720
in middle schools and high schools when it came out.

436
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,480
People, are they upset by Elvis still?

437
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,320
Like what?

438
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,840
Yeah.

439
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,040
The photography on television.

440
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,560
But the craziest one, probably this.

441
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,760
Probably this half hour special,

442
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,280
which I think was on the Disney Channel

443
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,880
and it was syndicated as well.

444
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,680
A full half hour, a little mini Ernest movie.

445
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,040
And Ernest, a lot of the Ernest titles

446
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,360
are the format of Ernest Goes To.

447
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,560
I think Ernest Goes to Jail was one.

448
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,600
Is Ernest Goes to Camp one of them?

449
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,920
Ernest Scared Stupid breaks from that format.

450
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,160
Ernest Saves Christmas.

451
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,080
They aren't all goes to,

452
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,000
I think there's an Ernest Goes to Africa.

453
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,840
Is there?

454
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,160
A lot of times he's, yeah, that was a latter day.

455
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,200
Oh.

456
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,040
Four of the movies were kind of higher end

457
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,920
and made for touchstone pictures.

458
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,440
So that's part of why this happens

459
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,600
that it's in the Disney, Ernest is in the Disney umbrella.

460
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,160
But then I think they dropped the deal

461
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,280
and the movies became a little more scattershot,

462
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,800
straight to video, we'll get these out and done,

463
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,160
but they won't have the sterling production value

464
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,640
of Ernest Scared Stupid.

465
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,680
Which I have some information about, I learned.

466
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,520
Oh really?

467
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,000
Oh great, great.

468
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,560
Well, that maybe takes us into this.

469
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,720
Oh, go ahead.

470
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,600
Maybe this getting ahead of the thing, of everything.

471
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,120
I'm watching this special real quick

472
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,480
and I just wanna talk a little bit about Ernest.

473
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,480
I'm watching this and I realize,

474
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,040
maybe I've said this on the show and I forgot

475
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,520
it's a revelation to me.

476
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,360
I am afraid of Ernest.

477
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,400
This does sound familiar.

478
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,200
And maybe I've said this before and I'm like,

479
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,040
really remembering.

480
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,320
It might have been years ago.

481
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,600
Right, it might have been years ago

482
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,720
when we were talking about,

483
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,240
the first time you ever referenced this

484
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,640
cause we'll probably talk about that.

485
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,760
I will certainly repeat material based on

486
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,800
whenever this came up, forever ago.

487
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,480
But I'm watching this and I'm going,

488
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,400
I think I put like Ernest and Pinhead from Hellraiser

489
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,400
on the same level of freaked out by them.

490
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,240
As from a kid.

491
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,760
Cause I've seen the clips recently,

492
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,080
but this is the first time I've sat down

493
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,720
and watched a piece of Ernest media

494
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,880
that's longer than 45 seconds in years.

495
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,800
And I was like, oh, the fish eyed lens.

496
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,640
Sure.

497
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,200
The weirdness of all of this.

498
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,040
I'm remembering now how unnerving I found Ernest.

499
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,360
The way he, he's often shot in fish eye

500
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,600
and he's often like,

501
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,120
look at the logo of this show,

502
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,480
which might be in our artwork or you can Google it.

503
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,320
Ernest goes to Splash Mountain and his face cut out

504
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,600
looking so bulbous.

505
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,440
Always.

506
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,280
And just his neck bulging and mouth bulging.

507
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,120
That's part of it.

508
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,960
I mean, that is part of it and I get it,

509
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,000
but I was watching this

510
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,120
and I was trying to get over that feeling.

511
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,680
And I've gotten over that feeling by the way,

512
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,000
with Pinhead.

513
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,280
I've watched multiple Hellraisers at this point

514
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,680
and they're gross movies,

515
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,040
but like I don't quite have the same visceral reaction

516
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,120
to Pinhead anymore.

517
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,800
I couldn't get over my reaction with Ernest.

518
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,640
Wow.

519
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,600
Maybe I need to watch more Ernest movies.

520
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,000
I think we're not, the faces, he's very good at faces.

521
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,840
He's great.

522
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,680
I like him.

523
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,200
Not only is it fish eyes, really close on him.

524
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,200
And a lot of the, I watched a lot of the commercial.

525
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,400
There's a lot of compilations.

526
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,920
Yeah, his commercials.

527
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,800
Cause he was an ad character at first.

528
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,520
Yes, he was like the Geico caveman before.

529
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,560
As if they'd gotten multiple movies

530
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,960
instead of just a network television show.

531
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,960
Yeah, just a show for a few episodes.

532
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,800
And it started as like advertising regional car dealerships.

533
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,640
Yes.

534
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,480
Right.

535
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,120
I feel you, you know, when you say you're afraid of him,

536
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,360
I flash to Ernest goes to jail,

537
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,600
which I would probably, similar to this special,

538
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,480
I would probably watch now and think this is very like

539
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,880
chintzy and silly.

540
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,080
But I was so scared of the idea of jail when I was a kid.

541
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,240
And then like, I'm looking at the poster of it right now.

542
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,560
And he's like, you know, like giant weird smile.

543
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,920
It looks like he has 500 teeth.

544
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,920
I'm also reminded of Ernest's exact double counterpart

545
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,840
in that movie, if you remember or have seen it.

546
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,280
Like that's, I don't remember why he,

547
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,360
I think he ends up in jail.

548
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,840
It's a switcheroo because there's a real like rough villain

549
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,240
who, and he's sort of playing like,

550
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,520
he's like De Niro in Cape Fear, something that shows his range.

551
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,920
He's really good and scary as the other Ernest,

552
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,160
but that made me afraid of Ernest that there's like,

553
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,800
all you do, you make him not smile.

554
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,520
And now he's a terrifying psychopath.

555
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,840
I didn't, so yes, I realized that my Ernest fear,

556
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,880
I don't think comes from the jail thing,

557
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,440
even though I wasn't a big fan of jail growing up either.

558
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,160
I think it was more of the trailer and commercials

559
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,320
for Ernest scared stupid.

560
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,040
Because as I started going through this

561
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,480
and I started trying to figure out exactly

562
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,240
what this was coming from,

563
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,960
I do believe that the creatures that they showed,

564
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,080
and I watched clips of her and I did not watch the whole movie

565
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,640
because I'm not that brave yet.

566
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,040
Ernest scared stupid has monster troll characters.

567
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,040
Do you remember these?

568
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,080
I'm looking at them now.

569
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,920
I haven't seen a picture of them in forever.

570
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,640
And they are scary as shit.

571
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,920
They're still scary.

572
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,760
I'll affirm this.

573
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,580
They're gross.

574
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,420
They are cool.

575
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,560
Also, I appreciate them now.

576
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,080
Incredible, practical.

577
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,720
I gotta watch this movie now, but.

578
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,560
Yes, I know.

579
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,360
I was like, this is a couple hours ago.

580
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,680
I'm looking through this stuff and I'm like,

581
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,280
oh, Ernest, maybe Ernest scared stupid is good.

582
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,680
Did you feel like a safety blanket feeling

583
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,680
with the presence of Eartha Kitt?

584
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,920
Well, I always do.

585
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,760
Somewhere in there.

586
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,800
I always feel good when Eartha Kitt's around.

587
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,280
The quick thing I learned on YouTube or something is that

588
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,400
I think the same guys that did Killer Clowns

589
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,160
had something to do with those animatronic,

590
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,880
or not animatronic, suits and stuff.

591
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,840
Because they are, literally,

592
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,040
they showed side by sides of the Killer Clowns

593
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,320
and those trolls, and they're the same shape.

594
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,720
And they just like remade the trolls

595
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,960
over the Killer Clowns, essentially.

596
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,000
Look at those molds, really.

597
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,840
Wow.

598
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,680
Kyoto brothers?

599
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,520
Yes, that's them.

600
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,600
Yes, thank you.

601
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,000
So I was like, wow, okay.

602
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,240
So I was like, yeah, this is, I think, even more so,

603
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,560
because he is unnerving.

604
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,520
That's part of the gimmick.

605
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,960
And he's like in your face and annoying.

606
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,120
And that's his gimmick.

607
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,480
But also, I think it's the commercials

608
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,600
for Ernest Scared Stupid that Extra added to me going,

609
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,040
oh, this is so gross, I'm so scared of Ernest.

610
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,960
Ernest is a guy to you who's around scary things.

611
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,520
Yes, he is.

612
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,960
So that's the association now with Pinhead, I think,

613
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,040
is because of that, because of that movie specifically.

614
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,360
Look at this shot where there's a girl in bed

615
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,480
with a teddy bear, and then the troll is.

616
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,320
It's so gross.

617
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,160
I'm scared of this.

618
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,480
That is so gross.

619
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,840
Who must have snuck into bed.

620
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,680
Like, this must be the moment that she turns around

621
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,280
and sees there's a troll in the bed with her.

622
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,120
Yeah.

623
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,040
It's a scary frame.

624
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,880
If you didn't know, this was from an Ernest movie.

625
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,720
Right. Wow.

626
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,480
I watched a clip of Ernest fighting a troll

627
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,080
on the back of a flatbed truck.

628
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,680
And I was like, this is great also.

629
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,240
Now I can see it, but I can't.

630
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,320
I'm trying to get rid of the old residual kid feeling,

631
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,800
because I'm like, this suit is creepy,

632
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,920
and Ernest is fighting a troll.

633
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,160
And then I thought the thing I always say on the show

634
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,440
about Indiana Jones that I wish they had followed

635
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,800
is that the Indiana Jones movies

636
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,760
would all be a completely different genre

637
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,520
in the way that one and two are.

638
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,120
They did this with Ernest.

639
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,560
Ernest is a character who's in a different place

640
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,880
every time. Yes.

641
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,960
Wacky summer camp movie, Christmas movie,

642
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,600
prison escape movie, creepy Halloween movie.

643
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,880
It's awesome. Sports movie

644
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,280
with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar straight to video.

645
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,120
Fantastic.

646
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,480
The savants of an amazing basketball player

647
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,320
written an insane amount of books.

648
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,400
He's written four books alone starring Mycroft Holmes,

649
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,400
the super intelligent brother of Sherlock Holmes.

650
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,920
Ah, well.

651
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,240
Brain's a podcast the right way.

652
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,200
That's why he's the brains.

653
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,160
He's the only one who can crack a book in his 30s.

654
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,200
Cameo in Glass Onion, you know?

655
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,720
So yeah, so all that, that's my whole journey with Ernest.

656
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,080
I was trying to figure stuff out,

657
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,560
and then I realized Ernest is the way

658
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,760
I wanted Indiana Jones to go,

659
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,080
where it was fully different genre movies.

660
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,920
I do really like the, because this is Peewee,

661
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,800
and there haven't been that many Peewee movies,

662
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,600
and really only the first one is great.

663
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,440
Right, right.

664
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,040
But I do like the idea that the movie starts,

665
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,400
and you kind of just get acquainted with where he is now.

666
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,280
There's not a bunch of backstory telling you

667
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,280
why he's at the circus now. Doesn't matter.

668
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,200
It just begins.

669
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,200
I mean, assuredly, Peewee is why Ernest movies happened,

670
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,040
right?

671
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,520
There's a market for bizarre, cartoony,

672
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,560
but live action characters to anchor movies.

673
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,400
Yeah, does that timeline make sense?

674
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,240
Yeah, it would have been.

675
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,320
Yeah, Ernest comes a little bit after.

676
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,160
I think so. Big adventure.

677
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,240
Well, I think just too, who's very popular is local ads,

678
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,080
and gradually that got bigger and bigger

679
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,680
until he's advertising like Sprite and Mellow Yellow.

680
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,040
That's crazy. He's doing gigantic.

681
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,880
Yeah.

682
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,920
The same guy can be the spokesman for, you know,

683
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,760
like local dairy, but then also Sprite,

684
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,400
and then all of these companies are fine with him doing.

685
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,040
No, it doesn't have to be exclusive. Who cares?

686
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,880
Yeah.

687
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,480
It was funny too, the one Sprite commercial.

688
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,360
I kind of mentioned it at the top,

689
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,320
but it was when Sprite was doing the thing of like,

690
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,880
ditch that cola, drink the lemon lime,

691
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,720
clean, clear Sprite.

692
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,760
Like clean as selling a soda.

693
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,120
It's very funny. It's clean.

694
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,200
Because it's clear.

695
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,040
It's clean.

696
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,280
It's clear. It needs like fruit, quotation marks.

697
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,200
It's like filtered water.

698
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,120
You're not going to drink a bunch of muddy water

699
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,520
out of a fish tank, right?

700
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,120
No, you're going to drink the clear water.

701
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,120
They should do it again. They should do it.

702
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,440
Scott, do you know, I texted Mike this early,

703
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,080
do you know about Starry?

704
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,040
I do not.

705
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,840
Pepsi has replaced Sierra Mist.

706
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,880
Sierra Mist has been retired once again,

707
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,160
and now they're selling Starry, the new lemon lime soda.

708
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,400
Is it spelled like the word Starry,

709
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,240
or is there like a shortening or an I?

710
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,080
No.

711
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,920
Okay.

712
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,760
But the new Starry is-

713
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,040
S-T-R-Y or S-T-R-I.

714
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,800
I'm trying to think of the douchey way to spell it.

715
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,640
Yeah, that's what I'm wondering.

716
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,840
S-T-R, no, it's just the word Starry.

717
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,680
Yeah, I was trying to think of the worst way to do it.

718
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,840
And they, when they said how they came up with it,

719
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,920
you know, they were talking about the idea behind it

720
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,960
in the marketing, and they said,

721
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,720
Starry hits different.

722
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,440
It's not an answer.

723
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,640
You just said a young person phrase.

724
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,800
That is no answer for why you did this.

725
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,600
Well, they're going nuts for Starry.

726
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,480
Why do these soda companies believe

727
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,040
that the cosmos can be captured in the taste of a soda?

728
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,120
Everybody's so confident about this.

729
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,960
Hubris.

730
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,920
Coke, Starly, and Starry.

731
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,080
Let me do a little bit of Ernest and Jim Varney deep,

732
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,240
I don't think we've said the name Jim Varney yet.

733
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,520
No.

734
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,680
Jim, here's how all of this stuff happens.

735
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,400
I didn't know the story of Jim Varney and Ernest.

736
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,640
Jim Varney is an actor and a standup,

737
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,320
and he is achieving some level of success in Hollywood.

738
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,680
He's on variety shows.

739
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,400
He's being deployed as a sketch actor,

740
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,200
and he's a super trained Shakespearean,

741
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,440
which I think makes it all work.

742
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,480
You could, like, in lesser hands and dumber hands,

743
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,920
the like full tilt committed to stupidity of Ernest

744
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,880
might not work.

745
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,800
You could tell there's like a better actor than the,

746
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,280
I don't know, he's smarter than the character.

747
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,400
But a lot of the stuff he's in, he's working,

748
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,320
but it's all a little shitty,

749
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,120
or just like passes really quickly.

750
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
I didn't know that he was a cast member

751
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,120
on the notorious 70s variety flop, Pink Lady and Jeff.

752
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,120
Oh, I didn't either.

753
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,480
The only, the show, it may be neck and neck

754
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,000
with Brady Bunch Variety Hour,

755
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,800
craziest, worst 70s variety show.

756
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,920
Which is, have you ever done that?

757
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,200
You ever tried Pink Lady and Jeff?

758
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,080
Ooh, boy, oh boy.

759
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,680
It's a rough go.

760
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,280
It's a very insane thing that they did.

761
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,600
But I didn't know Jim Varney was in there,

762
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,000
but he kinda has a little arc,

763
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,120
and then it sorta stops working out.

764
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,800
Things dry up for him a little bit.

765
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,240
He returns to his native Kentucky,

766
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,880
and is just working regular jobs.

767
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,480
Like, well, I guess that was my acting stretch,

768
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,160
and it didn't work out.

769
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,040
But then, I don't know if this was before

770
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,360
he went to Hollywood or anything,

771
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,480
well, it just, in his past,

772
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,440
he had been in a commercial for a director named John Cherry,

773
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,720
who makes all these kinda low budget commercials,

774
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,240
local commercials, and he'd done a character

775
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,920
named Sergeant Glory, who is a humorless drill instructor

776
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,800
who harangued cows of whatever the client dairy was

777
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,600
into producing better milk.

778
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,440
So he's a mean drill sergeant who tries to whip cows

779
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,120
into better milkshake, and this was so great

780
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,280
that they thought of him when another commercial came up,

781
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,400
a commercial for a theme park.

782
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,400
Didn't ever do this.

783
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,160
The very beginning of Ernest was a theme park thing.

784
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:24,160
It was an ad for a Kentucky amusement park called Beach Bend,

785
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,020
and this park had been around for a while,

786
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,080
and it had fallen into disrepair,

787
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,800
and it was bought by a bunch of people,

788
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,520
including country singer Ronnie Millsap,

789
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,320
and they were all going to turn Beach Bend around,

790
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,320
and they needed to get a commercial going

791
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,800
to get people back into Beach Bend,

792
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,160
but the disrepair was so bad

793
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,720
that they couldn't show any part of the theme park.

794
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,080
They thought it would make it look too crappy to go to.

795
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,840
So how do you make a theme park commercial

796
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,360
without showing the theme park?

797
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:57,360
Yeah, and it's like a Ernest around or outside house,

798
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,520
isn't it, because, yeah, they can't really film in the park?

799
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,260
Well, all of them are,

800
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,500
I think they began the Ernest formula,

801
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:09,300
which is always in or outside John Cherry's house,

802
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,460
which is a crazy thing that,

803
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,140
we're in a big Kentucky backyard,

804
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,260
and that this is what national brands

805
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,420
and eventually Disney are committing to.

806
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,660
No, this is what we want.

807
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,220
We wanna see your backyard, John Cherry.

808
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,700
But it's funny, because it does look like

809
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:29,700
what location manager, what location people hunt for

810
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:33,380
and have to search for in Southern California,

811
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,460
and it just happens to be his house and yard.

812
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:40,380
Yeah, yeah, no, but perfectly authentic.

813
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,820
So this starts everything.

814
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,240
This is him talking to cameras,

815
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,180
and whereas he's talking to Vern, unseen friend,

816
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,580
but who maybe doesn't get a lot, wants him to go away, Vern.

817
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,540
This is all contained in this ad for Beach Bend,

818
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:57,860
and this worked so well that a dairy company said,

819
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,020
today we'd like to do this,

820
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,940
and an ice cream company said they asked to,

821
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,420
and then car commercials and whatever,

822
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,740
and then this begins the Ernest empire.

823
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,500
But it all begins with theme parks, didn't know that.

824
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,320
That's crazy.

825
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,140
Do you guys have specific,

826
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,260
did you grow up with an Ernest commercial

827
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,400
in your neck of the woods?

828
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,420
I don't have a strong memory of that.

829
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,980
So I feel like he was first on my radar

830
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,860
in higher profile things.

831
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:27,020
In the bigger, the national Ernest products.

832
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,020
I remember loving Ernest as a little kid,

833
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,460
and I'm sure it's just from seeing snippets of the movies,

834
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,500
and then TV specials like this,

835
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,580
because I feel like he would show up in parades,

836
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,420
or he would show up in stuff.

837
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,420
Yeah.

838
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:45,140
And I mean, it's kind of like why, it's easy to sum up.

839
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,860
It's easy to see why I would like this at like five or six.

840
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:51,020
Like in the same way that Garfield is easy to sum up.

841
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,980
Garfield, like, oh, he's a lazy cat.

842
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,360
It's funny, a cat loves lasagna.

843
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,200
He tortures John.

844
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,360
He wants to send.

845
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,800
Keep going, let's hear it all.

846
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,000
He wants to send.

847
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,800
Nermal to Abu Dhabi.

848
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,640
And if you love the cat, the cat'll love you back.

849
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,480
That's the thing.

850
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,000
That's right, and never leave him.

851
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,200
What, yeah, love me, feed me, never leave.

852
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Don't leave me.

853
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,040
Don't leave me.

854
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,560
But the same thing with,

855
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,320
it's kind of similar with Ernie.

856
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,680
You can break it down to like,

857
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,680
well, he makes a lot of funny faces.

858
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,720
He's very good physical comedian.

859
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,000
He tortures this man, Vern, who I,

860
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,080
this was probably my, an early introduction to like a unique,

861
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,160
like, okay, this is an unseen character,

862
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,720
but the camera is this character's point of view.

863
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,040
So you, the audience, are technically Vern.

864
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,040
That's true.

865
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,720
That's a big, like, and what else was like this?

866
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,360
You had to start like, you know, eventually,

867
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,200
there's like, I feel like SNL sketches started doing it

868
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,520
at some point, or like the continental,

869
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,160
the Christopher Walken sketch,

870
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,520
but like, what thing were we seeing as kids where like,

871
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,840
you have to figure out that system.

872
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,680
That's pretty unique.

873
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:03,680
The Michael, Michael Mesmith standup comedy sketch show

874
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,320
where Jerry Seinfeld would talk to the camera.

875
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,360
The one where, he's like a private eye or something.

876
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,560
Yeah, that one.

877
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,640
Leno, this Leno.

878
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,560
There's a Leno thing.

879
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,400
Yeah.

880
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,880
Sketches, I only recently became aware of these.

881
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,880
They're so bizarre.

882
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,440
Very bizarre, yeah.

883
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,880
Rare acting appearance, sketch acting appearance.

884
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,720
Yeah, look them up.

885
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,120
A lot of variety.

886
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,600
Imagine Jerry Seinfeld's ability to like,

887
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,960
be a film noir.

888
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,760
Like, we know his acting ability.

889
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,720
Now imagine him as an old detective.

890
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,640
Oh man, the chops, exercising on the chops.

891
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,320
Him in like, 86.

892
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,280
Yeah.

893
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,120
Yeah, absolutely.

894
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,600
I loved anything Ernest.

895
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,880
My local ad was Cerritos Auto Square.

896
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,720
Oh, interesting.

897
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,120
Which is still like, there's tons of ads for that specifically,

898
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,840
but I was, I always like, you know there's those things

899
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,720
we've talked about that confused us as kids,

900
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,040
and I guess I had that, like wait a minute,

901
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,240
why is he in movies, and there's a Saturday morning show

902
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,440
of him, and he's advertising Cerritos Auto Square?

903
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,760
Oh, the Saturday morning show too,

904
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,240
I'm sure I saw bits of that.

905
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

906
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,040
I didn't like it, I didn't like it.

907
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,600
You didn't like any of this.

908
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,440
Yeah.

909
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,760
Scared of, even without Monsters,

910
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,400
or was that just tainted all of it?

911
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,160
Yeah, I think that extra tainted all of it,

912
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,080
but I always say, I was just not, I was not on board.

913
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,480
I don't know, my mom walked in and was like,

914
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,840
he's groovy, like I don't know if she said something.

915
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,080
I don't know if there was something like that,

916
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,040
but yeah, I was not into Ernest.

917
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,880
Huh, huh.

918
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,360
And I don't know, I may have even, as a kid,

919
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,680
there's very few things I like say,

920
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,240
what I, oh, I don't like that or something.

921
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,320
You'd always be like, oh, I like that, or whatever,

922
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,680
but I feel like I might not have said that

923
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,120
if somebody asked me when I was little.

924
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:36,960
You said you hate Ernest?

925
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,200
No, I hate him.

926
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,480
Have you come around, or you still,

927
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,240
well you were saying, it's hard for you to unsee.

928
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,800
Well, I was trying to separate the childhood trauma

929
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,120
from my analytical brain,

930
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,680
and I did it a little bit.

931
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,840
I appreciate him as a performer.

932
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,760
I appreciate what he's doing,

933
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,120
and I think there's some funny stuff in there,

934
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,160
but I mean, it's gonna take, it's gonna be a long,

935
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,560
it's gonna be like a very similar to me,

936
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,560
loving haunts journey through Ernest's catalog.

937
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,040
Were you comforted by the fact

938
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,040
that the Splash Mountain special is like 22 minutes long?

939
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,880
Wow.

940
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,720
And he's only a half of it.

941
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,360
And he's not in that much of it, yeah.

942
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,680
Yeah, yeah, so you're not doing a ton of Ernest here.

943
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,720
Yeah, it's like, what's the therapy

944
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,480
where you get exposure therapy?

945
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,760
Yeah, that's what it was for Ernest.

946
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,160
So it's a good starting point for me to come around

947
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,440
to being a full Ernest fan.

948
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,080
So next year, or later this year,

949
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,600
maybe there'll be an episode called Mike Loves Ernest.

950
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,600
That sounds great.

951
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,280
I'd love to know how and why

952
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,600
and what great Ernest moments.

953
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,440
We'll see.

954
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,280
We got you there.

955
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,320
Here's a question though,

956
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,880
another bit of history I didn't know.

957
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,360
How does the Walt Disney Company

958
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,840
get involved with Ernest?

959
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,840
How are these movies put out

960
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,600
through the mechanism of Touchstone?

961
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,960
And why is he getting a whole Disneyland special

962
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,000
to himself?

963
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,600
This was fascinating.

964
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,760
Never heard this before.

965
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,400
It's mid-80s, I couldn't tell you what year,

966
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,640
but the event is the Indy 500.

967
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,680
And there is a gallery of,

968
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,920
I don't know how they're presented,

969
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,320
if they're on the back of a truck,

970
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,080
so they just come out and wave.

971
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,000
But there are characters appearing

972
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,560
before the race starts.

973
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,720
And one of the characters is Mickey Mouse.

974
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,560
Mickey Mouse shows up and waves

975
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,760
and he gets an okay response.

976
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,680
Then Ernest shows up.

977
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,960
Everybody goes ape shit.

978
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,160
People are yelling, hey, Vern,

979
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,720
everybody knows it.

980
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,760
It's pandemonium about Ernest.

981
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,320
And this is noted by one attendee

982
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,240
of the Indy 500 that year,

983
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,280
Michael Eisner.

984
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,120
Michael Eisner sees,

985
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,400
hmm, Mickey not so much.

986
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,240
This guy, who I've never heard of a lot,

987
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,320
he commands to an assistant,

988
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,720
find out everything you can on this guy.

989
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,640
This is like something from a movie.

990
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,480
That's wild.

991
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,560
And then, we're gonna do a partner statue

992
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,120
with Walt and Ernest going forward.

993
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,880
Be a statue in every theme park.

994
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,480
Ernest, Ernest is now in the big six.

995
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,840
Ernest is one of the big six.

996
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,280
Mickey, Donald, Goofy, Chippendale, Daisy, Minnie, Ernest.

997
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,080
Start building big Ernest foam heads.

998
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,560
Let's get going on those molds.

999
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,360
Ernest and friends parking structure at Disneyland.

1000
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,760
We're gonna put Ernest in the big orb,

1001
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,240
the big cage orb that the motorcycles ride around

1002
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,080
in the circus.

1003
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,280
We're gonna start a hockey team, Anaheim Ernest.

1004
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,840
The big hotel in the shape of Ernest.

1005
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,520
Ernest store in every mall.

1006
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,880
Sell Ernest merchandise.

1007
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,200
All right, yeah, hey, he gets a denim vest in his eyes.

1008
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,680
And his brain starts wandering.

1009
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,520
I understand.

1010
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,600
Isn't this crazy?

1011
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,360
Yeah, I think Katzenberg was there too,

1012
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,200
but it gives a shit.

1013
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,280
That's not, the story's cleaner.

1014
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,920
Katzenberg probably said like,

1015
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,400
who cares about this Ernest character?

1016
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,800
I don't think we should do this.

1017
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,680
And also, Michael, I think our movie

1018
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,960
should be tilted the other way.

1019
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,160
You leave that idea in your pocket

1020
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,960
and you leave it there forever, Jeffrey.

1021
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:08,320
So, the research is done.

1022
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,000
There is business to be done in Ernest world.

1023
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,720
And he is, this, I don't, this feels too insane.

1024
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,840
That he is given a four picture deal.

1025
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,920
What do you mean?

1026
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,600
I think this might be incorrect intel

1027
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,800
from wherever I was watching it.

1028
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,240
Because I'm 1930.

1029
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1030
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,520
Yeah, where movies are all made outside

1031
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,720
on two sets in three days.

1032
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,960
Yeah, I don't know if that's true.

1033
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,920
But here's what I did find out

1034
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,400
is that the first one, Ernest goes to camp,

1035
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,720
that was a script they already had.

1036
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,560
Oh wow.

1037
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,360
So this was their fast track to like, let's try out.

1038
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,880
They've done that, this keeps the budget low.

1039
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,000
We got this summer camp script lying around.

1040
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,280
Who went to camp in that?

1041
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,640
Is it a different character?

1042
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,040
Geez, I don't know.

1043
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,720
Who did they, Tron?

1044
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,680
Tron went to camp.

1045
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,640
Imagine if Bruce Boxleitner from the computer world

1046
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,560
was sucked the other way.

1047
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,400
And now he's in charge of a summer camp.

1048
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,240
It'd be awesome.

1049
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,280
You know what, I looked up and we,

1050
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,120
Tron came up recently on the show.

1051
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,320
And while I came up, I pulled up just the box office

1052
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,720
for both those movies.

1053
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,920
They were both successful.

1054
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,240
It was another thing where I was like,

1055
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,720
oh, I thought this was a bomb.

1056
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,720
And they both made quite a bit of money

1057
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,320
compared to their budgets.

1058
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,160
Yeah, it's listed, the original one is listed as,

1059
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,000
you know, the nadir of Disney live action

1060
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,800
and Eisner needs to save stuff.

1061
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,720
But yeah, if it actually did,

1062
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,680
maybe the black hole was a bigger,

1063
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,200
that one's like an actual bomb.

1064
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,360
I think like black hole and island at the top of the world

1065
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,000
are like, they were, they were pet high hopes for.

1066
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,320
Black hole, they might've spent a little money on.

1067
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,160
Black cauldron too, I guess it was all.

1068
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,920
And then, it's so funny, now how long,

1069
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,240
that's like 82, right?

1070
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,120
Things are coming apart and then five years later,

1071
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,200
we're back, because of stuff like earnest.

1072
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,600
Who knew this would be the plan?

1073
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,400
Touchstone was an early like Eisner success.

1074
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,720
Like they talk about in the Disney war book,

1075
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,440
because it was like low to mid budget movies

1076
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,880
with kind of known people,

1077
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,520
but maybe like known people who had had some duds

1078
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,160
or had some personal struggles.

1079
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,600
Oh, so they wanted somewhere

1080
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,360
where they could still star in movies.

1081
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,640
Yeah, so like, and so the budgets are low

1082
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,880
and then they come out and they do really well.

1083
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,480
So I think they were talking about,

1084
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,520
along the lines of like trying to hit singles and doubles,

1085
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,920
like to get back up, to build back up.

1086
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,240
Sure, sure, sure, yeah, yeah.

1087
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,120
Instead of like, let's sink all our money

1088
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,960
into one big animated movie,

1089
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,280
and if it doesn't work out, we're screwed.

1090
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,360
Exactly, yeah.

1091
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,240
Well, earnest was just what the doctor ordered.

1092
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,600
They cranked out a script that existed,

1093
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,600
told them to make it earnest,

1094
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,240
and then suddenly he's in the fold

1095
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,600
and he's pretty like, he's pretty around.

1096
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,520
Yeah, he's also in that, the 35th anniversary special.

1097
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,280
There's a whole like earnest 10 minute chunk

1098
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,320
that I like a lot where he plays his own grandfather

1099
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,600
and there's a bunch of hijinks there.

1100
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,560
They go on the Autopia and they're pulled over

1101
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:18,000
by a highway patrol guy, which I loved when I was a kid.

1102
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,640
But I was also afraid that would happen on the Autopia.

1103
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,920
I didn't understand that was for a sketch only,

1104
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,760
but I like that.

1105
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,680
This is where I like, you know,

1106
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,320
I like earnest playing the evil earnest.

1107
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,160
I like earnest playing earnest grandpa.

1108
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,680
I love the old lady earnest.

1109
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,520
Oh yeah.

1110
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,000
That is one of the funniest things.

1111
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,720
I rewatched that, his, see the old lady scene

1112
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,760
from earnest goes to jail where he like,

1113
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,680
I don't know how he gets, it's Looney Tunes.

1114
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,360
I don't know how he gets the old lady disguise from jail.

1115
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,800
He does like 12 characters in earnest scared stupid

1116
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,800
and like, he's like talking to a little kid

1117
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,960
and like, I forget even how he sets it up,

1118
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,520
but it's just a Looney Tunes gag of like, keeps cutting

1119
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,440
and he's a different version of earnest.

1120
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,280
Oh great.

1121
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,120
Yeah.

1122
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:03,960
And he's got a lady as well.

1123
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,440
He's a live action Bugs Bunny a little bit.

1124
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,600
That's kind of the whole thing.

1125
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,000
I also felt like he's like, does Jim Carrey,

1126
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,760
did Jim Carrey see this guy?

1127
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,600
I wonder.

1128
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:16,280
I wonder too, cause I go, there's some stuff that Jim does.

1129
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,120
It's similar.

1130
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,640
It's a level of broad, it's a level of facial contortion.

1131
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,800
It's like stuff that like adults are like, oh, harumph.

1132
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,040
This is trite, terrible.

1133
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,200
And then, but teenagers love it or 12 year olds love it.

1134
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,040
I wonder.

1135
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:33,880
Yeah.

1136
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,840
I don't know, maybe he's, I mean, I don't think he's like

1137
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,280
stolen and I'm just wondering if he was influenced by it.

1138
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,520
I think he carried the torch of the character comedy.

1139
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,360
Yeah.

1140
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,600
Which I'm so sad is not around anymore.

1141
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,440
Right.

1142
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,120
Like, you know, yeah, is there, is Ventura,

1143
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,800
if not for earnest, is there Austin Powers?

1144
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,120
If not for, is there Borat?

1145
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,200
If not for earnest.

1146
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,360
And then we start passing that,

1147
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,880
then it starts, the torch is taken by weaker hands,

1148
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,480
sloppier hands, by Deuce Bigelow and, you know,

1149
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,760
people who don't have the magic.

1150
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,240
I mean, I stand by pistachio disguisey,

1151
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,880
but the world was not.

1152
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,720
We do.

1153
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,080
To end a pistachio disguisey.

1154
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:15,080
And I miss the, I actually genuinely think this,

1155
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,840
that if, you know, yeah, comedies don't work

1156
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,360
and they don't work over, I really think if we'd like,

1157
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,800
let's move past this era of kind of a harsh,

1158
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,360
I will not say anyone's name, Sullivan thing,

1159
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:29,680
any keyword names of the type of comedy.

1160
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,400
But I really think if you start doing like,

1161
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,600
I don't know, Dougie, and it's just a big crazy guy

1162
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,640
on a bus, I think everybody's like, who's Dougie?

1163
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,120
I think it's time for this kind of thing to come back.

1164
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,200
I agree, yeah.

1165
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,040
I think-

1166
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,240
Dougie the outrageous bus driver.

1167
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,080
Wow.

1168
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:46,900
Yeah.

1169
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,240
So we'll see.

1170
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,080
I mean, I don't know.

1171
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:49,920
Stinks up that bus.

1172
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,760
I don't know who's-

1173
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,580
Tremendous fun.

1174
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,420
Oh, he stinks too?

1175
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,260
Yeah.

1176
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:55,140
I mean, I don't know more about this guy.

1177
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,900
If that's true, what else is true?

1178
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,020
If it's then what?

1179
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,580
Yeah.

1180
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:02,380
Probably burps, I'd say burps.

1181
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,220
He's got to.

1182
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,180
Oh, easy, yeah.

1183
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,180
Hogs up the glass.

1184
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:08,460
Now the bus driver can't see.

1185
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,460
He's got a steering wheel in the back by the toilet too.

1186
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,900
So he can drive the bus while he's taking a shit.

1187
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,140
Taking a break, yeah.

1188
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:15,980
Yeah.

1189
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:20,420
That's one of the best sequences in the movie.

1190
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,380
And he's having, look, he's having diarrhea

1191
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,340
while he's driving.

1192
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,180
Oh yeah.

1193
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,000
Sorry.

1194
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:25,840
Well, that's why he's in there so long.

1195
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,680
Yeah, of course.

1196
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,620
Makes sense.

1197
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,140
There's a plot reason.

1198
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,900
But then a hapless passenger thinks,

1199
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,180
oh no, no one's driving the bus.

1200
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,380
So they start to control it.

1201
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,420
And then Dougie's also controlling it.

1202
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,240
Yeah.

1203
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,080
So the bus is all over the place.

1204
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:38,920
Right.

1205
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,740
So the main steering wheel is fighting with the toilet.

1206
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,580
Right.

1207
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,420
That's what you're saying.

1208
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,260
And then all of it.

1209
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:45,260
And then the poop starts slushing around.

1210
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,100
Yeah.

1211
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:46,920
Yeah.

1212
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,760
Sounds like a blast.

1213
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,600
You're telling me this isn't going to work,

1214
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,380
that this can't play overseas?

1215
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,220
Oh my God.

1216
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,060
Of course it could.

1217
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,460
There's no words in it as possible.

1218
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,300
It's Mr. Bean.

1219
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,140
Dougie only speaks when he must.

1220
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:56,980
Yeah.

1221
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:57,800
All right.

1222
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,640
Great.

1223
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,940
Let's get going on this.

1224
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:04,300
For now, Ernest was the man of the hour in 89.

1225
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,560
And thus we end up with this special.

1226
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,980
This is a special with a very unique format.

1227
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:16,740
A lot of the special is a news report.

1228
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:21,100
And then a lot of the rest of it is the POV

1229
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,940
of the memories of a man.

1230
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,780
Okay.

1231
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,340
Is there really like, what are we seeing?

1232
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,180
We're seeing the tape from the news station

1233
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,580
from Splash Mountain News Central.

1234
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,260
That's covering this.

1235
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:36,020
But then how are we able to flash to the,

1236
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:39,120
I don't ever question, I don't question Vern usually,

1237
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,180
but when the rest of it is a news report,

1238
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,640
how are we seeing what Vern saw?

1239
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,220
Yeah, no, it's very confusing.

1240
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,040
Mm-hmm.

1241
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,060
This is not no, I like that there's no logic.

1242
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,140
I don't mean to be a logic police here.

1243
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,340
Yeah.

1244
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,260
But it's so fun.

1245
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:59,660
So it's a live, in theory, news report.

1246
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:03,760
And sort of presented like Ernest is somewhere between,

1247
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:08,600
they mention Alan Shepard, or it's kind of an evil,

1248
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,960
Knievel, a kind of special I really like.

1249
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,820
I miss these two, the like.

1250
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:13,980
Super Dave.

1251
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:14,820
Yeah, yeah.

1252
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:17,100
Even, I guess that was a parody of those specials.

1253
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,260
It's a parody of them, but yes.

1254
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:22,920
But the thing of, stay tuned because a guy is gonna do

1255
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,740
a tremendous thing and it could go awry,

1256
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,300
but we're all gonna be glued to the screen to see.

1257
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:31,220
And Fox would do those later in the 90s and 2000s.

1258
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:32,380
Yeah, I love the 90s.

1259
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:35,400
Your Robbie Knievels was still going.

1260
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,380
RIP, did he pass away?

1261
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,700
Did Robbie Knievel pass away today?

1262
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,540
No.

1263
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:42,820
I think possibly.

1264
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:43,660
What?

1265
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,340
I think, I feel like I saw his name.

1266
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:47,100
I saw Splash Mountain trending.

1267
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,940
And I saw Robbie Knievel.

1268
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,300
Am I making this up?

1269
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,140
How would you be making it up?

1270
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:54,340
He died today as we're recording this.

1271
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,180
Mike.

1272
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,500
The PTR curse has been summoned in real time.

1273
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,460
Holy fuck.

1274
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,300
Wow.

1275
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,340
You got an Apple News notification.

1276
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:02,180
I did not see it.

1277
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:05,220
In the middle of your many other notifications.

1278
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,820
I did not see this.

1279
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,380
This came up organically.

1280
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,980
No, but Jason's saying that it was like subliminally.

1281
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:14,460
I saw it and I didn't consciously know I saw it.

1282
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,720
And that's why I brought him up.

1283
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:16,560
But I don't think so,

1284
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,280
because we were just talking about stunt specials.

1285
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,840
And it was, yeah, Scott was saying organically.

1286
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:24,960
I think that was a complete organic series of thoughts.

1287
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,400
But you also, you're right, Jason's right

1288
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,400
that you got also then an alert for half off starry.

1289
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,320
The big New Yorker.

1290
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,140
The big New Yorker.

1291
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:33,980
The leader of Starry.

1292
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:34,960
Right.

1293
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:35,800
Wow.

1294
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,800
That's crazy.

1295
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,640
Yeah.

1296
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,480
Wow.

1297
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,240
And I always know when celebrities die.

1298
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,000
I feel like I'm one of the first ones to know.

1299
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,120
I avoided saying it.

1300
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,440
It seemed, I didn't want to bring it down

1301
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,720
in the Discovery Zone episode,

1302
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,800
but we recorded that the day that Buster died.

1303
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,600
Buster passed away of Dave and Buster.

1304
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,520
Did you know that one?

1305
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:57,040
I didn't realize that there were actual Dave and Busters.

1306
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:57,880
Yeah.

1307
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,300
No, Buster was, it was a nickname.

1308
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,180
It was not a given name.

1309
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,880
But yeah, there were two guys.

1310
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:05,720
Wow.

1311
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:06,540
And yeah.

1312
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:07,380
I did miss that.

1313
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:08,200
That's crazy.

1314
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,040
I'm slipping.

1315
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,880
I guess the baby is really taking my focus.

1316
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,720
Huh?

1317
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,560
What's important?

1318
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:13,400
Buster.

1319
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,840
Buster and Robbie Knievel.

1320
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,120
You didn't pay your proper respects,

1321
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,400
but we get to, but the cool thing is the listeners

1322
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,320
get to hear you react to this.

1323
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,560
I mean, wow.

1324
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,800
This is just, I'm hearing this for the first time just now.

1325
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,640
That's right.

1326
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,200
Yeah, I feel like.

1327
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,040
What's the quote?

1328
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:27,880
You're telling me.

1329
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:28,720
You're right.

1330
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,560
You're telling me, wow, you're just telling me.

1331
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,760
For the first time.

1332
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,920
She was a remarkable woman.

1333
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,040
Markable stunt man.

1334
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:35,880
Markable stunt man.

1335
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:36,720
The rockable stunt man.

1336
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,320
One of the greatest and one of the best.

1337
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:42,520
Meanwhile, I have been digging into a little the.

1338
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,720
You always take a dare.

1339
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,560
You always.

1340
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,640
Buster, one of the greats.

1341
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,680
He was, I can only think of two.

1342
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,640
It'd be Dave and Buster and they were neck and neck.

1343
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,480
The greats.

1344
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,040
They say he was a daring devil.

1345
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,920
One of the things they would say about him.

1346
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,760
Anyway.

1347
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,600
I.

1348
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,440
I.

1349
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,280
Finish my thought.

1350
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,840
I, meanwhile, I have been digging into the next generation

1351
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:06,200
of like TV special that got popular in the 90s.

1352
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:11,200
The like pro wrestling's greatest secrets exposed.

1353
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,320
Masked magician, greatest secrets exposed.

1354
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,040
And I was just reading about one.

1355
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,360
I haven't watched it yet.

1356
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,320
I'm sure it's up on YouTube or Daily motion or something.

1357
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,880
Do you remember Fox's alien autopsy?

1358
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,320
Of course.

1359
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,400
Yeah, I don't, I don't, I didn't see it.

1360
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,320
I remember it existed.

1361
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,160
I didn't either.

1362
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,560
And they probably would have freaked this shit out of me.

1363
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,400
Oh, I watched it.

1364
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,640
Like, I want to watch this so bad.

1365
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,680
I watched it and they have like,

1366
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,240
we have footage of the actual autopsy.

1367
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,520
And that's what they were building to the whole episode.

1368
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,240
And this isn't dissimilar to what I was telling Scott about

1369
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,240
is the Jonathan Frakes hosted Beyond Belief Factor Fiction.

1370
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,080
Oh yeah.

1371
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,440
It's on that genre of like, it's an event

1372
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,720
and then the truth will be revealed at the end.

1373
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,960
And it's all in the same like time period for Fox.

1374
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,600
I love the tone of the like, the faux scary.

1375
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,040
They say it like did give me a little, a little pit.

1376
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,160
I wasn't scared of the show.

1377
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,000
Right.

1378
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,600
But I'm like, I better, this is important.

1379
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,520
This is the, some sitcoms, Dharma and Greg,

1380
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,760
they aren't tackling anything important over there.

1381
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,320
They are revealing magician secrets, pro wrestling secrets.

1382
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,000
We're going to learn their powers.

1383
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,520
We're going to learn what's an Al Capone safe

1384
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,440
where Jimmy Hoffa is buried.

1385
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,280
Oh yeah.

1386
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,120
It was all solved.

1387
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1388
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,000
Yeah.

1389
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,080
If you're looking for answers to any of those things.

1390
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,600
Fox prime time, 20 years ago.

1391
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,600
Glory to hell.

1392
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,600
Where it all happened.

1393
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,240
But we're, so we're in this, this neck of the woods.

1394
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,640
It's, it's an important special,

1395
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,640
a live special anchor person, Ralph Story,

1396
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,960
who was, I guess the host of the PBS thing.

1397
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,600
There's things that aren't here anymore.

1398
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,000
I know that, but that's a nice voice.

1399
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:46,840
I remember.

1400
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,320
Is that a franchise we could get Jason hosting?

1401
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,440
Possibly.

1402
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,840
That's something to build you up to.

1403
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,680
Like if you should, you should peak, you know,

1404
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,120
when you're 70.

1405
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:55,960
Sure.

1406
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:56,780
Yes.

1407
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,600
Well, if you ever got a Frank and a Coke

1408
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,080
at the tail of the pup,

1409
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:05,440
you'll be happy to learn that it's back and restored.

1410
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,480
Wait, is there a good things that aren't here anymore

1411
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,400
from islands of adventure?

1412
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,240
Oh, sure.

1413
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,200
Skipper boat tours.

1414
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,720
That lasted barely two years.

1415
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,560
Well, you know how to say it, say it as a 70.

1416
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,560
Say it as an old man.

1417
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:22,240
Well, there used to be a little transportation system

1418
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,320
that would take you from the port of entry

1419
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,880
to Jurassic park.

1420
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,240
And you would cross that beautiful waterway.

1421
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,760
Island skipper tours is no longer with us.

1422
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:33,600
Wow.

1423
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,420
Wow.

1424
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,600
Will you commit to doing that here and there

1425
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,680
for anything that's not in port of entry anymore,

1426
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,680
if we do this episode?

1427
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:39,880
Sure.

1428
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:40,720
Yeah, yeah.

1429
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,540
Great, great.

1430
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:44,700
Your PBS audition tape, we'll make it on the clock.

1431
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,400
But so Ralph story narrates this.

1432
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,120
Ernest is taken on splash mountain.

1433
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,440
He's gonna be the first ever to do it.

1434
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:56,720
And he's preparing over at Vern's daredevil training camp.

1435
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,360
Just pretty much just a tire spins around on

1436
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,240
and a kiddie pool.

1437
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,280
And it's mixed.

1438
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,440
This is all mixed with check-ins from the full team

1439
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,720
at splash mountain news central.

1440
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,160
Splash mountain news central.

1441
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,360
It's got a fun logo.

1442
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,520
I love the logo.

1443
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,360
It's up on the wall.

1444
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,400
It's on their little mic.

1445
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,240
I don't know what you call it.

1446
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,960
Little things you slide over the microphone.

1447
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,800
Flag.

1448
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,640
Flags?

1449
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,640
Sure, okay.

1450
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,260
I like that logo so much.

1451
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:26,440
It's a logo only in this.

1452
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:29,160
It's not the logo of the ride.

1453
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,680
It kind of speaks to something I love

1454
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,840
about the special in general

1455
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:37,920
is that it's tying such disparate things together.

1456
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,240
It's news report but kind of like daredevil

1457
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,280
doing a stunt intensity news report

1458
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:45,600
and very like modern 89 graphics.

1459
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,040
But then also Ernest.

1460
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,520
But then also the new like folksy down home ride

1461
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,960
that is based on a movie that everybody's trying

1462
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,340
to not talk about.

1463
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,640
It's like all these things.

1464
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,200
How do they all combine?

1465
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,040
I also think it's like a little bit of its time.

1466
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,400
Cause like the new, I feel like there'll be more

1467
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,580
news specials like the panda, the zoo is about

1468
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:05,860
to give birth.

1469
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:10,860
It's a panda watch and it's like a branded kind of a thing.

1470
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,540
I heard you mentioned Al Capone's,

1471
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,860
like the herald thing.

1472
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:14,820
Yeah, yeah.

1473
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:18,980
And David Copperfield I think is happening by now.

1474
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:21,740
It feels cool even though this is fake

1475
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:25,180
and the time jumps up significantly a bunch of times.

1476
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:29,500
Yeah, they really commit to the news report.

1477
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:33,700
Maybe too hard, it is very dry, this special.

1478
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:38,220
I guess that's to balance against Ernest being

1479
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:39,740
an insane character.

1480
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:40,580
Sure, yeah.

1481
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,620
Being a rubber faced man.

1482
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:46,060
Well, it allows you to get your genuine interviews

1483
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:49,420
and facts about the ride going.

1484
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:53,020
I mean, it's always with like kind of sketchy characters

1485
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,980
as the news anchors.

1486
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:56,460
But you know, you get real,

1487
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,980
this technically an interview with Imagineer Bruce Gordon,

1488
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:02,060
the joke being that the anchor person

1489
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:04,100
just says all the info for him

1490
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,860
and never actually lets him say anything.

1491
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,500
But you get the info.

1492
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,340
Sure, yeah.

1493
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,180
Seeing an Imagineer is exciting.

1494
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:13,340
Yeah, he gets to do a bit.

1495
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,140
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1496
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:18,580
There's a guy who I didn't even know,

1497
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:21,980
his name is Danny Breen who played Skip, sorry,

1498
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:25,700
Skip Blinkman, is it Binkman or Blinkman?

1499
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,860
It's Binkman.

1500
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,260
Skip Binkman.

1501
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,100
Great anchor character.

1502
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,780
And he's funny.

1503
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,300
He's my favorite guy in the whole thing.

1504
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,140
And I didn't realize this,

1505
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:35,500
he was a producer on Who's the Lion is in Any Way.

1506
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,100
He was on not necessarily the news,

1507
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,620
which was that old sketch show.

1508
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,940
Oh yeah, the Conan and Greg Daniels got their start on.

1509
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:42,340
Yeah, a lot of people got their start.

1510
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,980
And yeah, he's like producer on Wayne Brady.

1511
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:46,620
He is dead as well, but not today.

1512
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:47,740
A few years ago.

1513
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:50,460
The Imagineers passed away, Bruce Gordon,

1514
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:52,540
John Sherry, the director,

1515
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:54,020
I think of the earnest segments in this

1516
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,420
and all the earnest stuff.

1517
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:56,340
He's passed away.

1518
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:57,740
Jim Varney, of course, passed away.

1519
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:59,900
That was a sad one for, yeah, yeah.

1520
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:02,860
Because I liked Ernest Lowe as a kid and Slinky Dog.

1521
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:06,620
It's so, there's still a little emotion for me

1522
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:10,180
in Toy Story 3 and 4 that it's not him,

1523
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:12,460
but it's this actor, Blake Clark, who is his friend.

1524
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:15,300
And when he talks about it, he gets choked up.

1525
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,980
And I think there's some real heart to Slinky Dog.

1526
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:19,380
Yes, Slinky Dog's great.

1527
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,500
Slinky Dog's the only thing that makes me

1528
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,260
extra love Jim Varney.

1529
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,100
Yeah.

1530
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,500
An early childhood.

1531
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:30,900
Like that character in Toy Story, that's Ernest.

1532
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,340
That's the guy who was Ernest.

1533
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:33,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1534
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:34,860
I did like anything like that.

1535
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:37,700
Where like, oh yeah, wait, and they're deploying the,

1536
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,300
I don't know when else they,

1537
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,020
like, oh, it's Niles from Frasier,

1538
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:43,460
and he's the bug in Bug's life.

1539
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:47,580
Always like a nice reward for the kids who knew.

1540
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,700
Oh yeah, and we were kids who knew.

1541
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:50,540
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1542
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,940
We made sure everybody knew that we knew.

1543
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:57,940
But okay, you know, we're talking about how this

1544
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:04,980
hit us as kids, and maybe now I get into what was

1545
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:08,300
talked about a long time ago, my version of Mike's

1546
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,420
general fear of Ernest.

1547
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:12,700
If you're a new early listener or haven't heard this episode

1548
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:15,940
or if you forget, when this came up before,

1549
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:18,540
it is because I watched the special when it aired.

1550
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:20,740
I would have been four years old,

1551
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:25,740
and it scared me on such a just deep, visceral scarring

1552
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:31,460
level, I was so frightened by this.

1553
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:36,460
And my whole buildup with it was I was probably a little

1554
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:40,060
out of college, and I still thought,

1555
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,820
I remember that Ernest special where like,

1556
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:44,220
it actually gets kind of, I remember it scared me as a kid,

1557
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,380
and I think it was kind of genuinely some,

1558
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:49,020
actually some kind of cool horror filmmaking.

1559
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:52,580
And then there was not YouTube happening as much,

1560
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:54,220
or this thing had not been found.

1561
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,660
It is on YouTube now, very easy to watch if you wanna

1562
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,380
follow along with this episode.

1563
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,620
But I had to track it down, I had to buy the DVD

1564
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:05,780
from some eBay store, and I was like shaking,

1565
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:09,140
taking the DVD out of the self-produced cover

1566
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:13,340
that I paid $30 for it for no reason probably.

1567
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:16,740
Ironic because this is the way that a person could acquire

1568
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:20,620
Song of the South now, like a ripped DVD

1569
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:22,860
with like a printout box artwork.

1570
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:26,900
Like that has always been, I remember looking up in college,

1571
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:31,340
I was like, oh, how do, is this movie, it just lost its time?

1572
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,860
And it's like, oh no, there's a million websites selling

1573
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:36,540
bootlegs of this, and then when YouTube came along,

1574
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:39,060
it's all there in chunks.

1575
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:42,180
And it makes you watch the segments and go like,

1576
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:45,260
oh, they really tone down those voices for the ride.

1577
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:48,020
Oh really, oh I see, yeah, yeah.

1578
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:52,060
So you gotta, it's a drug deal to find a lot of these things.

1579
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:52,900
Sure, yeah.

1580
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:57,460
So I tracked this thing down and I put it in,

1581
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:01,860
and boy am I humiliated by what it actually is.

1582
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:02,700
So funny.

1583
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,180
You guys just rewatched it, I forget if you had seen it

1584
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:07,060
when we watched it the first time.

1585
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:09,100
But I'm jumping to the end here when we can talk

1586
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:12,380
about other things, but what it culminates in is,

1587
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:15,460
you know, he, Ernest, he does all his training,

1588
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:18,780
then he gets to Disneyland, he's paraded down Main Street,

1589
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:23,580
he's here, he's ready to do it, he is crazily cocky,

1590
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:26,660
so sure of how well his ride is going to go

1591
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:29,700
and that it's nothing, and then what happens

1592
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,660
is a horror show.

1593
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:34,780
I can't not describe it as that, but what is your

1594
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:38,620
viewpoint watching it now, based on what I saw

1595
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:39,700
when I was four?

1596
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:44,860
Well, yeah, he does his training, he screws a lot

1597
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:49,740
of the training up, he then goes down Main Street,

1598
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:52,460
I'm recapping a little too much, he goes down Main Street,

1599
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:55,940
he has like a parade beforehand, before he even does it.

1600
00:59:55,940 --> 01:00:00,300
Signs, or he's got like a whole crew's cheering Ernest on.

1601
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:03,740
Yeah, and then he does Splash Mountain,

1602
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:06,500
he's afraid, obviously, he's a coward,

1603
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:09,100
that's part of what's fun about Ernest.

1604
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:12,940
Sort of not until he's faced with the moment.

1605
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:16,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, because even on the way up,

1606
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:20,180
he says the line, that's my favorite line of the special,

1607
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:24,860
wish I had brought a book, it's reclining, it's nothing,

1608
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:28,580
he's tapping like he's yawning on his mouth,

1609
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:30,220
really like all that.

1610
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:35,220
Yeah, and then there's a couple, he goes on that first drop,

1611
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:38,100
and there's some geography here.

1612
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:39,980
Oh, you're right, I'm skipping to the final drop,

1613
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:41,460
we got three drops to get through.

1614
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:43,300
Yeah, they kind of mess, am I wrong,

1615
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:45,500
they mess a little bit with the geography of the track

1616
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,380
for the purpose of the special.

1617
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:48,900
Yeah, yeah, not consistent.

1618
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,100
Because that Danny guy I was talking about is like,

1619
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:53,900
there's a bit where him, with him like standing,

1620
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,700
waiting to talk to him, and he misses Ernest,

1621
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,940
even though he's like floats right by him,

1622
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:59,900
but Ernest's guy, he's gone down one dropper,

1623
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:01,380
and he's got an oxygen mask on.

1624
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:05,020
Yeah, that's a pretty good bit of him just totally missing.

1625
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:07,460
He looks ill, like it's really kind of,

1626
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:12,580
he's got oxygen not properly placed on his face either.

1627
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:15,860
He's like, he's wet, and by the end of it,

1628
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:19,220
there's just kind of, there's a big water stain on his shirt,

1629
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:21,980
and he spends a lot of it like sucked all the way

1630
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:25,780
into the log, and to connect a lot of dots here,

1631
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:28,260
this is now ancient history on the podcast,

1632
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:31,180
but I was very afraid of Splash Mountain,

1633
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:33,660
and you have to imagine a lot of it

1634
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:35,020
had to have come from this special.

1635
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:36,980
I mean, I was afraid of the drop itself,

1636
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:38,380
but it just freaked me out.

1637
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:40,780
Whatever, my baby brain, as I said,

1638
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:45,540
that just like intensified it 100 times what it actually is.

1639
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:48,340
What I also think happened to you is that

1640
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:51,380
they show parts of the ride earlier

1641
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:52,820
when they're kind of describing what it is,

1642
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:57,340
but the sequence with Ernest, it's mostly drop specific.

1643
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:01,140
Yes, you don't pass by, and you're not seeing Brer Bear,

1644
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:02,460
the little fun sequences at all.

1645
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:03,300
A little of it.

1646
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,060
It really makes it seem like this is just like

1647
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:09,540
a 15 minute journey through a mostly dark tunnel.

1648
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:11,100
So even though they told you before,

1649
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:14,620
oh, there's like music, and there's robots or whatever,

1650
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:17,460
when you see the actual ride portion of it,

1651
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:19,780
it feels kind of joyless,

1652
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:22,740
and the whole joke is like he's gonna die.

1653
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:24,980
He's gonna get hurt or die on it.

1654
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:25,820
That's true.

1655
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:27,060
That's said several times.

1656
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:29,100
There's some line about he might be part of

1657
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,940
Splash Mountain history, and if not,

1658
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:32,940
if he doesn't make it,

1659
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:35,420
then he might end up being part of the mountain.

1660
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:39,260
That line has said, there's other references to his death,

1661
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:41,660
the possibility of death just going on this ride.

1662
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:42,500
It's a lot.

1663
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,260
And we've said this a lot about other stuff

1664
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,900
where you're like, there's no way in modern Disney,

1665
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:52,900
are they joking about somebody dying on a ride so much?

1666
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:55,020
There's a moment, I think the moment where he does

1667
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,660
like the fake water skiing, he's like,

1668
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:58,380
I've got a team of dogs that can pull,

1669
01:02:58,380 --> 01:02:59,740
and then he gets pulled off camera,

1670
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:02,300
you can hear him scream, oh God, off camera.

1671
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:04,060
They would cut that nowadays.

1672
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:05,180
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1673
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:06,020
Yeah, absolutely.

1674
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:09,420
So I can understand why if you were a kid,

1675
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:11,460
and especially a kid who's really into Disney,

1676
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:14,020
and you were engaged with like, this is the new ride,

1677
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:15,780
I'm gonna do it, here we go,

1678
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:17,380
and then they show earnest on it,

1679
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:22,140
and they don't show any of the like vibrant parts of the ride.

1680
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:22,980
Yes.

1681
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:25,460
Why you would think even though it's a little bit silly

1682
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:26,700
if you watch it as an adult,

1683
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:29,980
it still seems like this is also gonna be like joyless.

1684
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:31,060
Yeah, yeah.

1685
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:34,260
It's suffering, but then right before that,

1686
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:37,420
you just ignore when like earnest says like,

1687
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:41,620
somebody call me a log, and the whole crowd screams,

1688
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:45,460
you're a log, like goofy gags like that.

1689
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:46,700
There's joy in the build up.

1690
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:48,540
Yeah, of course, I'm just saying you forget it all,

1691
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:50,180
because you're now, you're seeing what you think

1692
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:52,220
is the correct representation

1693
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:53,860
of the experience you're gonna have.

1694
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:57,700
I'm purely judging, like this is, but earnest is real.

1695
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:00,540
I don't know about Jim Varney, I know earnest P. Worrall,

1696
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:02,220
I know that he is doing this,

1697
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:07,060
and I don't know that editing can intensify

1698
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:08,220
sequences and moments.

1699
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:11,300
I'm watching a live news report where-

1700
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:12,980
Splash Mountain update.

1701
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:14,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1702
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:18,180
Where a man screams brutally,

1703
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:22,220
and his hair turns shock white,

1704
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:26,020
and he's gripping the sides of the handles of a log,

1705
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:28,700
and screaming in terror, and his death is,

1706
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,900
like, this is all, this is probably me,

1707
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:34,300
this is me knowing that editing exists.

1708
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:37,060
You can't be alone in this,

1709
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:38,980
which is something you try to tell yourself sometimes

1710
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:41,300
when you're having any, not even theme park related,

1711
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:43,860
sometimes you're having some doubts, fears, blah, blah,

1712
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:45,460
you always have to remember,

1713
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:47,700
you're not the only one thinking this.

1714
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,700
And I'm sure that's the case with other kids

1715
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,420
who saw this special.

1716
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:53,660
I don't know if they hyper-dwelled on it

1717
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:57,060
for another 30 years, but for sure at the time,

1718
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,820
I'm sure a bunch of kids were like,

1719
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:01,300
oh man, do I wanna go on this?

1720
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,100
Might've ran out of the room or something,

1721
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,380
but didn't keep thinking about it like I did.

1722
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:07,500
I don't mean, I don't wanna say, you know,

1723
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,060
that kid mindset is correct,

1724
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:11,460
but again, all the other Disney products

1725
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:13,500
you had consumed at that point were like,

1726
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:18,100
hey, just as one or both your parents are going to die,

1727
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,980
you will have to deal with that.

1728
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:23,380
That's funny, that stuff didn't register with me like that,

1729
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:25,580
but yes, of course, so many different Disney movies

1730
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:27,820
are like, and then one of the parents dies.

1731
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:31,220
The worst for me, I must've brought this up before,

1732
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:34,140
was the Robin Williams Jumanji,

1733
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:36,540
where they go a weekend out of town,

1734
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:39,260
and on the way back, the parents eat it.

1735
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:41,140
They die?

1736
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:43,420
They die, the Robin Williams parents.

1737
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:45,700
Oh, his flat, the 60s people.

1738
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:47,740
But they get caught in the-

1739
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:50,340
Someone dies, a set of parents dies.

1740
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:51,900
I have not seen this in years.

1741
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,900
They don't get stuck in the board game, they just die?

1742
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:55,220
They just die.

1743
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:56,740
Oh, okay.

1744
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:58,060
Yeah, it's too dark.

1745
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:00,340
My other big one, like something that I,

1746
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:03,220
where I walked in and my parents are watching this,

1747
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:07,660
and there was a, talk about like 90s scary fox,

1748
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:11,660
there was, I believe it was a current affair, zwang,

1749
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:15,580
that's still haunted by the noise, the hell of the noise,

1750
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:19,380
but there was just a news report about like a father

1751
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:21,540
who went crazy and killed his kids.

1752
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:22,380
Sorry.

1753
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:25,940
No, no, that was a more respectful hypothetical.

1754
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,540
And I just, I don't think anyone was paying attention to me.

1755
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:31,380
I just started, I've experienced this cry with my son now,

1756
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:33,380
where you don't, it's silence,

1757
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:34,620
you don't know what cry is happening,

1758
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:36,860
and then you look over and it's a cry that's been forming

1759
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,620
for 10 seconds and building,

1760
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:41,580
and it's about to go off the ledge,

1761
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,140
like Splash Mountain into like,

1762
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:43,980
Yeah.

1763
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:45,780
And drench everybody.

1764
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:50,260
But like, I'm like welling up because I've seen this,

1765
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:53,100
and now I don't just think that's something bad

1766
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:57,700
that happened, I said to my dad, you're gonna kill me,

1767
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:59,420
and ran out of the room.

1768
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:01,780
This is very grim, this is what you do,

1769
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:03,820
Mikey, we're talking about stories your mom tells all the time.

1770
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:05,540
This is one that was just repeated to me,

1771
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:09,500
that I just hear of the notion of a father killing a son,

1772
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:12,580
and I am sure that it is going to happen to me.

1773
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:13,420
Whoa.

1774
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:15,420
And I had to be talked down, that might've been like,

1775
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:18,460
that was a multi-hour session.

1776
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:21,820
It was Kirsten Dunst's parents.

1777
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:22,660
Okay.

1778
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:25,300
So her and her aunt move into the house

1779
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:28,060
where Robin Williams disappeared from.

1780
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:28,900
Oh, wow.

1781
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:31,220
And then in the attic is where they find the board game

1782
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:34,100
and get sucked in, or he gets popped out.

1783
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:37,220
So this is part of the backstory of some movies,

1784
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:39,420
even some like fun family movie, and you can't,

1785
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:40,500
you're meditating on that.

1786
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:43,340
Also, it's 1995, I am 10 years old,

1787
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:46,700
I know the difference between fiction and reality,

1788
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:49,140
but sometimes you just can't help yourself.

1789
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:49,980
Yeah, yeah.

1790
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:51,700
While you start playing out the movie in your brain

1791
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:54,300
where your parents die and yeah, yeah, yeah.

1792
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:59,500
Yeah, hey, stuff, wait, oh wait, hits harder, right?

1793
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,500
It is, yeah, it's like starry.

1794
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:04,020
Well, that's why we need the comfort of starry,

1795
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:05,300
or starry zero sugar.

1796
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:08,180
When life's hitting you harder, hit back with starry.

1797
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:10,380
As long as it's not a dirty soda,

1798
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:12,180
like those other dirty sodas, it's clean.

1799
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:13,020
Like those brown coals.

1800
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:14,900
I want it to be clean, yeah.

1801
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:18,220
Yes, that makes scary things worse.

1802
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:21,020
Fanta dirty, gross.

1803
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:26,460
So yeah, look, this just, I can't say enough how,

1804
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:29,220
like this, it just lived with me for years,

1805
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:32,780
is like, well, what is the scariest sequence ever in film?

1806
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:35,940
It would have to be the, how long,

1807
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:38,660
I would say probably three minute long sequence

1808
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:41,580
where Ernest is going down the splash mountain,

1809
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:43,300
it taught me that, okay, the splash mountain drop

1810
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:46,100
is miles long, you fall and you fall,

1811
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:50,020
and you, it's like gravity, like you fall out of a spaceship

1812
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:53,500
and you just go infinitely, that's what this was in my head.

1813
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,100
The scariest thing ever filmed,

1814
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:57,340
I timed it out today watching it,

1815
01:08:57,340 --> 01:09:01,220
this is a 20 second sequence, that is how long this is.

1816
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,660
20 seconds of fear.

1817
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:08,540
It sure is, and of course the discovery upon rewatching it,

1818
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:13,020
it is so goofy, there is a silly xylophone version

1819
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:16,180
of zippity doo da playing.

1820
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:19,900
What I imagined as like Cronenberg type

1821
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:24,900
or like a racer head kind of scariness is just,

1822
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:27,100
he's scared so it flashes on and off

1823
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:31,180
and he has shock white hair that goes up really high.

1824
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:35,100
It is so stupid, I just wish I could show you

1825
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:38,100
what it was to me, if there was some way.

1826
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:41,580
You were describing the end of 2001, A Space Odyssey.

1827
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:42,420
Yes.

1828
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:45,940
You were describing colors and someone is old

1829
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:47,900
in a space bedroom.

1830
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:52,100
But like mixed with like Hellraiser with like skin is open

1831
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:56,340
and it's just a muscle exposed and blood,

1832
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:58,580
like that's how the level of.

1833
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:02,660
Isn't there a part where Ernest's eye bursts open

1834
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:05,020
and just maggots pour out,

1835
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:07,860
but that certainly must happen in this.

1836
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:10,500
There's something that I think I could do,

1837
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,820
time permitting, I think I can do,

1838
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:14,500
at least like a poor man's version of this,

1839
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:19,260
which is, I was like, what sequences have hit me

1840
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:21,220
in anything as hard as this?

1841
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:23,780
And I can only think of one other one in my life

1842
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:26,420
and that is the end of Requiem for a Dream.

1843
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:29,820
I acquainted these sequences in my,

1844
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:31,260
you've both seen this, you know.

1845
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,140
Yeah, listeners, yeah.

1846
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:37,020
This is the ultimate, like there are upsetting moments

1847
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:39,380
in films that I've revisited.

1848
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:41,540
This is what I don't ever wanna see it again.

1849
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:43,540
That is the one where I'd be thrilled

1850
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:45,460
to never see that sequence.

1851
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:47,980
I have such a clear memory of me

1852
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:49,580
and there was like a handful of friends

1853
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:51,620
that were like when we were 15, 16,

1854
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:55,980
everyone getting into cool movies,

1855
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:58,540
trying to find cool movies and someone rented that movie

1856
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:00,980
and we did a rare like, hey, come over.

1857
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:03,620
Like we don't have school tomorrow,

1858
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:05,900
like it's an in-service day or whatever.

1859
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:07,300
Let's do a weeknight hangout

1860
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,700
and we'll watch Requiem for a Dream.

1861
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:11,180
And like just at the end of it,

1862
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:15,140
all these 56 year olds in these half finished basement,

1863
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:18,060
like watching on a 30 inch TV,

1864
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:20,460
a VHS copy of Requiem for a Dream

1865
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:22,620
and everyone just bummed out.

1866
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:26,140
Like, okay, well I'm gonna call my mom to come get me now.

1867
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:29,260
She's Louise.

1868
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:30,700
How was your night, honey?

1869
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:31,860
Not good.

1870
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:35,580
The opposite of like however long later,

1871
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:38,660
watching Amelie and like the handful of us going like,

1872
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:40,340
wow, that was fun.

1873
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:41,180
Oh sure, yes.

1874
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:44,060
What nice feelings we leave with.

1875
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:45,180
Yes, most movie,

1876
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:47,300
when you're looking at cool movies in that era,

1877
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:50,540
it's mostly fun and twee and delightful.

1878
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:53,980
It's the Tenenbaums and their coats

1879
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:55,420
and their interesting hats.

1880
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:58,500
Or it's like, oh, we're gonna go see a double feature

1881
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:02,500
of the new awards movies, Big Fish and 21 Grams.

1882
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:04,180
Wow.

1883
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:06,780
And thank God we saw the sad one first.

1884
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:08,700
What a double feature, wow.

1885
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:12,580
But yeah, basically I think that maybe the key

1886
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:14,820
to showing the audience what I saw,

1887
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:18,220
at the very least is putting the Requiem for a Dream music

1888
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:19,220
in there. Oh wow.

1889
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:21,180
The oft used and other things,

1890
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:22,580
Lord of the Rings I believe.

1891
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:26,260
And I can attest to every student film that was made

1892
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:29,460
between 2001 and 2007.

1893
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:31,100
The string quartet, yeah.

1894
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:33,780
Da, dun, da, dun, dun.

1895
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:36,500
I paired it up even just them next to each other

1896
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:37,620
and like, yeah, this is it.

1897
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:39,860
This conveys what I do.

1898
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:44,060
Here, let me just, I'll play the clip of the drop

1899
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:46,500
really quick if my computer cooperates with me.

1900
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,180
I do, of course now it's funny,

1901
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:53,140
but Ernest's yell at the very beginning is,

1902
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:56,180
I mean, I love a big bellowy yell

1903
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:57,860
and it's pretty spectacular.

1904
01:12:57,860 --> 01:12:59,260
Yeah. Just this giant.

1905
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:00,100
Ooh.

1906
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:06,180
And I can still can see the materials of what freaked me out.

1907
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:10,220
So, and also right before it's something that kind of,

1908
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:14,020
you know, got me going in that direction before

1909
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:16,340
is that there is a warning given

1910
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:18,700
that one of the anchor persons says,

1911
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:19,540
Oh, right, right.

1912
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:22,340
Seemish adults may want to look away at this moment.

1913
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:24,380
And then it cuts to the most sitcom-y extras

1914
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:25,900
all covering their eyes. Right.

1915
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:28,940
And like the costumed characters doing it too.

1916
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:31,180
But I just took that on like, uh-oh.

1917
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:33,780
And I probably thought like, mom, dad,

1918
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:35,820
should I leave the room right now?

1919
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:36,940
And I did not.

1920
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:41,580
And what I saw, I don't think I have to play the clip.

1921
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:45,500
If it comes up in the meantime, but,

1922
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:48,660
I appreciate that you guys have not been like,

1923
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:50,580
you know, this is a safe space.

1924
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:55,340
I've not been mocked for how frightening of a piece

1925
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:57,380
this was to me.

1926
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:59,340
I mean, certainly it's insane.

1927
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:00,820
If you were saying now it's still scary,

1928
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:02,340
I think we might get some mockery.

1929
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:04,740
It's not that, it's the same as you with the,

1930
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:07,660
your creepy feelings about Ernest.

1931
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:10,980
Where you still, you have, though, you can access those,

1932
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:13,260
but it's not that you're literally scared.

1933
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:14,460
I swear.

1934
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:15,500
There's also the aspect of,

1935
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,660
I don't know why I was so scared by the,

1936
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:22,660
just the mirror device that they spin the frame around.

1937
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:26,180
That like, just that made me think,

1938
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:29,940
well, that means that the drop somehow also goes upside down

1939
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:31,180
several times.

1940
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:34,820
And I imagine like strobe lights and just what,

1941
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:38,580
if you're taking wacky video editing on faith,

1942
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:41,620
as this is exactly what happens in the ride,

1943
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:43,220
you could see where I'm coming from.

1944
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:45,140
And it's really insane looking back,

1945
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:46,740
that the arc of this was,

1946
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:48,380
I was so scared of it for years,

1947
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:51,820
that I only went on it one time for decades.

1948
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:54,740
And then who built me up to do it,

1949
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:58,060
but the man who made the ride, Tony Baxter,

1950
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,700
it's still so bizarre that that happened.

1951
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:01,940
And that I'm going up,

1952
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:04,180
I'm seeing the point of view that's in the special.

1953
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:06,820
I'm still a little afraid on that lift hill,

1954
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:08,900
where it's the light, like,

1955
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:11,300
it's not so fun up there.

1956
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,060
It's not very like silly magical.

1957
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:15,860
Maybe it will be with the Tiana makeover,

1958
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:17,500
but it's a little industrial, right?

1959
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,100
The thing's clanging along,

1960
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:21,780
and then the light's getting bigger and bigger.

1961
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:25,300
And you're on this kind of conveyor belt.

1962
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:27,460
It's like the end of Toy Story 3, right?

1963
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:28,300
Isn't it?

1964
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:29,140
Yeah, a little bit.

1965
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:31,100
It's like, where is this going?

1966
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:32,100
What's that light?

1967
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:32,940
Uh-oh.

1968
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:35,740
It's the bad thing in the light.

1969
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:38,780
Anyway, but then I'm eventually on it.

1970
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:42,460
And like, what, literally what Tony said in the live show,

1971
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:43,820
I'm repeating as a mantra,

1972
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:45,500
that like it's gonna be pure joy.

1973
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,460
Pure joy when this is over.

1974
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:51,180
Pure terror, but pure joy, whatever the specifics were.

1975
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:54,420
That's like your transcendental meditation,

1976
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:57,100
like a special mantra that only you know.

1977
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:58,100
That you can't tell anyone.

1978
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:58,940
A mantra.

1979
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:00,700
I might, that you know,

1980
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:02,980
probably I don't remember the phrase exactly.

1981
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:04,260
I don't know if you guys do.

1982
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:06,980
I don't remember how specific it is to Splash Mountain,

1983
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:08,700
or if it includes the phrase log,

1984
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:11,060
or river boat, or dancing chickens.

1985
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:13,900
But I bet the core of that,

1986
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:17,380
what he told us is probably applicable for a lot of things.

1987
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:18,300
Well, that's true.

1988
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:19,620
That's a very good point.

1989
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:21,660
Lesson you can apply to many different things.

1990
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:23,900
I think so, unless again, it is too.

1991
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:25,620
But don't be scared,

1992
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:28,820
because then there's like a nice old hound dog

1993
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:30,180
in a rocking chair.

1994
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:32,580
Would you say though, like you could,

1995
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:34,940
because it's so specific to Tony,

1996
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:37,140
and this live show we did,

1997
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:39,180
is that something that you can't use now,

1998
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:41,420
for like say a Velocicoaster?

1999
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:42,500
Oh, possibly.

2000
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2001
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:45,140
Like if you really got in the zone,

2002
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:46,300
and when I got in the zone,

2003
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:48,740
drank two wines, got in line for the Velocicoaster,

2004
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:50,660
thought of the Tony mantra over and over.

2005
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:52,900
Well, you know the two wines is part of it.

2006
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:54,540
I might only need one at this point.

2007
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:55,380
Sure.

2008
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:57,180
But also it's just because my tolerance is going down.

2009
01:16:57,180 --> 01:16:58,020
It's going down.

2010
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:58,860
I've learned that.

2011
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:01,020
That humidity can make you weird with booze.

2012
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:04,540
We also, we could buy you a clicker, a blue clicker.

2013
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:05,940
Oh, so I feel like I have control over.

2014
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:07,580
So you have control, yeah.

2015
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:11,700
I am definitely afraid of Velocicoaster.

2016
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:12,540
Yeah.

2017
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:14,180
I was down, and I think listeners could agree,

2018
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:16,580
this is a more intense experience than Splash Mountain.

2019
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:17,420
Yes, I'm sure it is.

2020
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:18,240
I certainly built up Splash Mountain too much.

2021
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,280
I blame Jim Varney.

2022
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:21,120
It's his fault.

2023
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,920
It's unclear to me at this juncture,

2024
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:25,720
will I brave Velocicoaster or not?

2025
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:26,680
Would you rather do Hulk,

2026
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:29,240
if you had to, Hulk or Velocicoaster?

2027
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,600
Ooh, that's interesting.

2028
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,040
I think, here's my guess,

2029
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:34,640
I think what you're telling me with your look, Jason,

2030
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,160
is that Hulk is, maybe I'm wrong,

2031
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:40,040
isn't Hulk kind of a, it's getting up there in age,

2032
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:40,880
and it's a bit of a mind game.

2033
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,080
I believe it would be a rougher experience for you.

2034
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,100
I bet Velocicoaster, you'll be scared,

2035
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,880
but it's probably smooth as shit.

2036
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:49,560
Yeah.

2037
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:50,380
I bet it's like.

2038
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:51,220
That would help me,

2039
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:54,160
because it helps me on that I like in Crudicoaster so much,

2040
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:57,200
and the recentness of the build.

2041
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,040
I was also, I went down,

2042
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,640
I have been there since Velocicoaster opened,

2043
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,000
I was down for this bachelor party,

2044
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,600
and the people who went on both rides

2045
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,240
were really happy after Velocicoaster,

2046
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:09,720
and kind of all holding their heads after Hulk.

2047
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:14,320
You need to do Hulk a couple times so your body learns,

2048
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:15,840
and then you can enjoy it.

2049
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:16,680
Oh no.

2050
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:18,400
You know what I'm saying?

2051
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,520
Yeah, I mean, after the first concussion,

2052
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:24,200
it just sort of is gravy all the way.

2053
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,680
Because the first time I went on it after a long time,

2054
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:28,640
which might've been the first time I ever did it,

2055
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,800
I felt bad, I felt like shit.

2056
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:31,640
Okay.

2057
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,320
And then the next time or two,

2058
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,800
and then Jason and I got to do front row on it,

2059
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,200
which is wild.

2060
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,680
But I think it was great.

2061
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:40,520
I mean, that was fun.

2062
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:41,360
I had a lot of fun on it.

2063
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:43,480
I had been in the front on that a long time.

2064
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,400
It was very intense, but yeah,

2065
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,560
but that time I really, I did like it,

2066
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:49,280
but it was not like that first time

2067
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,960
where my body was a little upset with me.

2068
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2069
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,000
You know, where I land,

2070
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,520
and I'm sure we've said some of this before,

2071
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:57,720
I've said some of this before,

2072
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,360
because going back to Orlando with you guys,

2073
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,160
I tried a bunch of stuff I hadn't done.

2074
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,800
I found Rock and Roller Coaster like right at the line,

2075
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,480
maybe even a little above the line.

2076
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:10,320
Oh really?

2077
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,640
I did it again with the Bachelor Party,

2078
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:16,360
but I like, that start is like,

2079
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:18,680
that's a hair, I don't know how much higher than that I can go.

2080
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:19,520
That's interesting, I've said this many times,

2081
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,840
I'm sure the start, I love the start,

2082
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,000
and again, it gets everything out of the way.

2083
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,320
It gets rid of my fear immediately.

2084
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:27,320
Yeah, yeah.

2085
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:28,160
So it's interesting.

2086
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:29,480
Yeah, but it's counting down.

2087
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:30,320
Like you see.

2088
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,160
Oh, there's a little bit of a nervous.

2089
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:32,000
I hate countdowns.

2090
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,480
Like this special, the countdown aspect

2091
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,240
of the clock in the corner scares me.

2092
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:37,080
I don't like countdowns.

2093
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:37,920
Rock and Roller Coaster said,

2094
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,640
the setting is a dirty alleyway.

2095
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:43,480
You are being launched into the darkness.

2096
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:46,920
There's both screaming and the actual launch sound.

2097
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:47,760
I'm feeling so.

2098
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,720
And I think like effects of like squealing tires.

2099
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,040
Yes, for sure, yeah.

2100
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,880
But then the guys like check out Steven Tyler's new hat,

2101
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,520
and then that's funny.

2102
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,720
We don't have to talk about Steven Tyler

2103
01:19:58,720 --> 01:19:59,880
that much right now.

2104
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,480
Not that the information hasn't been out there

2105
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:02,320
for 30 years.

2106
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:06,320
You can compare the other Aerosmith guys coffee.

2107
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,080
Joey Kramer. Green Day coffee.

2108
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:09,360
Oh, absolutely I could.

2109
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:10,560
Oh, celebrity coffee.

2110
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,200
Joey Kramer doesn't get sued for something bad.

2111
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:14,360
As far as we know.

2112
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:15,200
Oh, right.

2113
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:16,760
Oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah, right.

2114
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:20,480
Steven Tyler's ongoing presence on the show might.

2115
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,720
I just think that you have to separate the songs.

2116
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:25,880
The perfect songs.

2117
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:27,320
From the less than perfect.

2118
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,160
I can't believe we're saying this.

2119
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,680
The less than perfect artist.

2120
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:31,160
Yeah, well.

2121
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:34,040
Might be jumping over to Crosby, Stills and Nash.

2122
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:37,240
Just like Marvel swapping the French Rock

2123
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:39,720
and Roller Coaster to Avengers.

2124
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:41,280
Oh, can you imagine?

2125
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:44,960
It's our house playing on the Rock and Roller Coaster now.

2126
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:48,880
Soaring harmonies that hit as you soar up the.

2127
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:49,720
Yeah, they should go.

2128
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,880
They should definitely go with an older band

2129
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,120
to replace Aerosmith.

2130
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:53,960
Yeah.

2131
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:54,960
And fluff that.

2132
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,240
Yeah, Credence.

2133
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,560
Hey kids, it's Credence.

2134
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:59,280
Credence would be awesome.

2135
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:00,120
Yeah, that'd be pretty cool.

2136
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:01,600
Fortunate something while you're doing it.

2137
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,200
I got excited and hit the mic.

2138
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,040
Uh.

2139
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:05,920
Bang, that's how excited I am.

2140
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,720
So yeah, well, the point is we'll see.

2141
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:09,560
I don't know.

2142
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,320
I'm a little scared of that one, but you know.

2143
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,160
I still.

2144
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:14,000
I don't want to.

2145
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,480
Good things have come from increasing my tolerance

2146
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:16,320
due to the podcast.

2147
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,160
I'm afraid of Tatsu.

2148
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,080
I'm afraid of X2.

2149
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,960
I haven't done either of them.

2150
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:20,800
I'm afraid of every.

2151
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,160
I, Magic Mountain, I don't think I'm doing any of that.

2152
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:26,280
Because the poor construction.

2153
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:27,120
Well, that's true.

2154
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:27,960
Issue for me.

2155
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:30,240
I still think Riddler's Revenge you'd be OK on.

2156
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:31,080
Maybe.

2157
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:33,680
Because you stand and it's, I think it'd be all right.

2158
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:34,520
Yeah.

2159
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:35,360
That one feels fine.

2160
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,200
No, I don't like that standing.

2161
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,040
That doesn't sound good to me.

2162
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:37,880
Yeah, I don't like that standing.

2163
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,320
Well, it's not great because there's some shooting up

2164
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:40,160
your butthole.

2165
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:41,320
That's not as fun.

2166
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:43,920
The seat is like digging in your ass.

2167
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,440
It says you.

2168
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:49,240
Well, it's all about what you, if you're comfortable with it.

2169
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:53,120
That's just, but it's not, it's not ideal for being on a roller

2170
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:53,840
coaster.

2171
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:54,360
Yeah.

2172
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:57,920
That's what I feel about something in there.

2173
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:58,840
Separate these.

2174
01:21:58,840 --> 01:21:59,560
Prep work.

2175
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:01,600
I don't know if you're doing the full prep work

2176
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,080
for that standing coaster.

2177
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:04,880
Some items.

2178
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:07,280
Some work.

2179
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:08,200
Some lotion.

2180
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:09,240
It's like getting it.

2181
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:12,240
You got it like as if you're going to have a colonoscopy.

2182
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:14,800
You have to do the same work before Riddler's Revenge.

2183
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,680
We'll all happily do any of these rides.

2184
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:17,520
We'll blacked out.

2185
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,360
Yeah, Scott.

2186
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:21,000
That's what the wine's trying to get me partially to.

2187
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,480
And I'm going to assure you, it's not worth it, my man.

2188
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:27,600
But go for it.

2189
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,880
But I will return to Twisted Colossus.

2190
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,040
I do make that vow.

2191
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:31,400
Yeah.

2192
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:33,320
I don't know if I'm calling my shot this year,

2193
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,600
but I will return to Twisted Colossus.

2194
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:36,680
I'll do that with you.

2195
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:39,240
Even though the most recent, I rode that coaster

2196
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:42,720
in Ocean City in South Jersey that had all the troubles where

2197
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:44,480
they had to keep redoing it.

2198
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,920
And it's a pretty recent installation.

2199
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,480
And it just ruined my life for like an hour.

2200
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:51,800
It just fucked me.

2201
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,040
I'll say the thing about that, and I don't know,

2202
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:57,440
maybe I didn't articulate, other than the dick crushing

2203
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:00,640
restraints that were on the ride,

2204
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:02,640
Twisted Colossus was the first one

2205
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:05,680
where the damage was psychological and not

2206
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:08,160
I got beat up because it was a pretty fast, pretty smooth

2207
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:08,960
coaster.

2208
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,160
It truly was just like, my body is freaked.

2209
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:12,640
Yeah.

2210
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:14,840
Versus anything that I'm a little nervous on.

2211
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:16,720
Obviously, Disney's less intense in general.

2212
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:21,640
But any of that stuff, I'm never like, panicky after the ride.

2213
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:22,280
Sure, sure, sure.

2214
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:23,760
I'm usually like, oh great, that was fun.

2215
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,960
Versus Twisted Colossus where I was like, oh, I got to calm down.

2216
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,000
I got to calm down.

2217
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
It was not all smite.

2218
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,480
It was not the Baxter pure pleasure at the end.

2219
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:32,800
It was not like that.

2220
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:36,840
But again, I did it once and my body maybe gets used to it.

2221
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:41,400
Well, keeping my listeners, you might not

2222
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,920
want to go up against port of entry,

2223
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:45,560
but we are calling for suggestions for next month.

2224
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:48,760
And suggest whatever you want, including things like this.

2225
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:52,160
But unless certain amendments pass,

2226
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,960
there's kind of a cap on your ability

2227
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:58,440
to get us physically into places that we don't want to go.

2228
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,600
Well, yeah.

2229
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:00,560
But you can try.

2230
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:01,960
You can try, yeah.

2231
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:02,800
Good luck.

2232
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,000
But we're facing fears now.

2233
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:04,560
You know what?

2234
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:05,960
I'll just, I have a queue up now.

2235
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:07,200
I will play the sequence.

2236
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:11,600
If there's any details of this that you want to call out,

2237
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:14,000
or anything I haven't mentioned, I'll say.

2238
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,600
But here is the 20 seconds that scarred

2239
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:17,760
Scott Garner for decades.

2240
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:33,160
It's upside down spinning fast motion

2241
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:35,080
through the rest of the ride.

2242
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,920
I just screaming in agony.

2243
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:39,120
That's part of it, right?

2244
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:39,840
Yeah.

2245
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,160
Doc Brown hair.

2246
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:44,240
That's not a joyful scream.

2247
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:45,240
I love the scream.

2248
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:47,680
It's an excellent executed scream.

2249
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:50,800
It's really weird that I know that they wouldn't have said,

2250
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,640
oh, and then Ernest should have enjoyed it.

2251
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:55,560
That's an interesting choice.

2252
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:56,480
Because even back then.

2253
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,000
He gets off.

2254
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
And you could have him be scared.

2255
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,600
But then, yeah, they keep him at that.

2256
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,920
But he says it was great.

2257
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,200
But then what is the line he compares it to?

2258
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,600
It's like a heart attack or something?

2259
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:13,640
He says, things like Splash Mountain keep you young.

2260
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:15,680
That and blood transfusions.

2261
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:16,600
Oh, that's what it is.

2262
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:19,840
And transplants, cosmetic surgery.

2263
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:25,040
And then in this whole sequence, he's just in the log,

2264
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:29,400
glued to the bottom, gets out soaked, filthy.

2265
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:32,800
He takes the safety bars with him.

2266
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,160
That's a detail.

2267
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:34,840
That part of it.

2268
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:38,280
And also, you know what really gets me in this sequence?

2269
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:39,640
Maybe it still gets me.

2270
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:43,280
The close ups of the hands.

2271
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:46,480
Getting splashed on, grasping.

2272
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,040
The wet metal.

2273
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:49,480
I still don't like that.

2274
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:53,240
If I've got something like foam and hard to hold on to

2275
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:54,960
on a ride, that's great.

2276
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:57,120
But I'm worried that my hands are going

2277
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:00,160
to slip off of that wet metal.

2278
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:02,760
We never talked enough about wet metal on this show.

2279
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:03,840
I think that has a car.

2280
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,040
This is a fear of mine.

2281
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,000
Wet metal.

2282
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,200
Wet metal.

2283
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:10,640
And when you do do Guardians, you like to hold the side,

2284
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:11,160
right?

2285
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:12,680
Yeah, I grip.

2286
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:14,200
And I don't like that that's metal.

2287
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:15,560
I love something padded.

2288
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,080
But I do what I can.

2289
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:18,880
But I am like, grip.

2290
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:22,200
If I ever post or anybody sees a picture of me

2291
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:26,840
when they take your picture on that ride, I am just the arms.

2292
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:28,920
I'm at risk of pulling the restraints off,

2293
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:30,360
even though I like that right now.

2294
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:32,960
And on Incredicoaster, are you gripping the metal?

2295
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:33,440
Oh, yeah.

2296
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:34,440
Big old hug.

2297
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,440
I had a phrase once, but I forget

2298
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,560
that I'm hugging my harness, mommy.

2299
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:39,160
Oh, right.

2300
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,000
Isn't that?

2301
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,240
It might have changed.

2302
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:42,520
I said something years ago.

2303
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:45,240
It might have been in a little different context.

2304
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:48,400
You don't have the choice between cloth mommy or wire mommy.

2305
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,120
You only have harness mommy.

2306
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:53,800
You have to use what you have, unlike the monkeys

2307
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,920
in that experiment.

2308
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,200
I don't quite know this reference.

2309
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:01,760
Oh, there was some experiment decades and decades ago

2310
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:07,840
where they had one young child monkey hugging a cloth doll

2311
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:12,680
monkey, and then another one trying to hug wire mommy.

2312
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:15,240
And it was like a metal.

2313
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:16,280
This resonates with me.

2314
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:17,600
That is so upsetting to me.

2315
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,240
It really resonates with me.

2316
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:21,880
And I got a little boy who wants his cloth thing.

2317
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:23,840
And I, oh, no.

2318
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:26,800
What's the phrase in the Grant Morrison bat?

2319
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,400
Is it mommy made of nails?

2320
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:30,120
I think so.

2321
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:30,640
It is.

2322
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:32,600
There is some shockingly nightmarish stuff.

2323
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:35,600
Professor Pig has mommy made of nails.

2324
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,960
I think he's seeing he's, Professor Pig is torturing Robin.

2325
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,320
Professor Pig has like a creepy pig's face on,

2326
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:45,880
and he makes, he like melts faces on other people's faces.

2327
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:46,400
Yeah.

2328
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:47,040
Oh my god.

2329
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,160
The dollatrons, I think is the name of the villains.

2330
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:50,400
That is not a mommy for me.

2331
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,000
No.

2332
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,200
So anyway, yeah.

2333
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,040
So you hug your mommy restraint.

2334
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:56,960
And this is why I don't think I can do Velocicoaster,

2335
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:59,800
because you had nothing but grips on that thing.

2336
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:01,840
Is it, oh, yeah, is Velocicoaster just on your lap

2337
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:02,720
or it doesn't have the?

2338
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:03,280
Just lap.

2339
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,160
Because that's the Twisted Colossus thing too.

2340
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:05,680
Oh, boy.

2341
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:06,920
And that I was not ready for.

2342
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:09,160
It just covers your legs, which does

2343
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:11,760
make you feel like you're about to fly out of the car.

2344
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:12,800
I don't think I can do it.

2345
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,520
I think this is too far beyond.

2346
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,840
I don't think I don't think this is crazy.

2347
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,920
I think the audience, I think catching,

2348
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,760
getting me, the host of the theme park,

2349
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:23,720
Park, is to actually go on every ride at Disneyland

2350
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:25,120
is a good thing.

2351
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,280
I'm glad that I've done it.

2352
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:28,360
But this, we're getting into some territory here.

2353
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:28,920
I don't know.

2354
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:29,640
I might be at my.

2355
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:30,200
Interesting.

2356
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:31,840
Might be at my limit.

2357
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:37,320
Have you ever done, I have yet to do the cars on the Ferris wheel,

2358
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:39,240
the moving ones?

2359
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:40,440
No, I'm fine with that.

2360
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,600
That does not bother me.

2361
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:42,920
I think that's the specific.

2362
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:43,440
Yeah.

2363
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:45,000
And I don't think that's crazy for you.

2364
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:45,960
But I do that no problem.

2365
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:48,240
That's, I think Jason and I did it together.

2366
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:50,480
Look at Mr. Confident, Mr. Cocky over here.

2367
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:51,840
I'm not putting you down.

2368
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,240
I respect your fear.

2369
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:56,080
I respect all fears here.

2370
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:56,880
Well, we'll see.

2371
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:00,360
Whenever we go to Orlando again, we'll see what happens.

2372
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,880
We will just have to see what happens.

2373
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,120
I guess we can wind this down.

2374
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:07,240
Are there any other details about this special

2375
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,960
that we enjoyed, anything we'd recommend finding?

2376
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:12,960
I mean, it's very short.

2377
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,040
So I would say if you're interested, it's not 20 minutes.

2378
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:16,880
It takes 20 minutes.

2379
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,600
That is a lot of fun.

2380
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,240
It's a very fun special watch.

2381
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:21,800
Multiple copies on YouTube.

2382
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:23,200
Very short.

2383
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:26,880
They do a thing that Disney pretty rapidly started.

2384
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:30,640
Stopped doing in the 90s was like the inspiration of the ride.

2385
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:34,040
The Song of the South hit movie from 1946.

2386
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:35,200
That is yes.

2387
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:38,800
I also that struck me too because jarring because we've talked about a little bit

2388
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:42,560
about this movie controversial when it came out.

2389
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:46,800
It was from the get go was people protesting saying, why the hell are you doing this?

2390
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:49,120
Yeah, it was never a safe time with never.

2391
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:52,640
So then then it becomes, oh, maybe we take the characters out of it.

2392
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,240
All right. Well, people are going to be mad about it.

2393
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,320
And then they put it back in the theater and they feel like

2394
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:58,040
the heat's died down or whatever.

2395
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:00,920
But still, the even the vibe, you would think they would be trying

2396
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:04,600
to get away with something and being like our beloved characters here

2397
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:10,080
that we just somehow were born out of thin air, Brayer, rabbit and bear bear.

2398
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,440
You know what I mean? Like it's a weird choice.

2399
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:16,720
Even then, when when they clearly the company was like, should we be what?

2400
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:20,880
And then they're like, oh, the Disney classic that we will never release on video

2401
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:25,320
and we're not having any plans like they're really just it should have never

2402
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:27,040
gotten to this point.

2403
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:30,840
There should have been a different topic if they wanted to do a log flume.

2404
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,480
Well, yeah, of course.

2405
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:36,800
But it is just funny because it felt it feels like so much of it was designed.

2406
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:40,120
Building Splash Mountain was designed like, well, we'll take out the parts

2407
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:43,840
that we think are the problem and we'll just take it and strip it for parts

2408
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,960
and put it in.

2409
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:48,520
But meanwhile, in the special, there's like, hey, you know where these characters

2410
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:52,880
are from? Yeah, the movie that we that was a problem 50 years ago.

2411
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:55,480
But you still could have things go in and out like this.

2412
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:59,040
They were still mentioning Song of the South for sure in the nineties.

2413
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:02,200
Of course, it's just it's it comes in waves.

2414
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:06,160
But it is interesting that it was like it was obviously there was many

2415
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:08,520
discussion, many discussions about it again.

2416
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:11,800
Yeah. Where it wasn't like because initially you might have been like,

2417
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:12,720
well, there was no problem.

2418
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:15,840
No one thought the movie was a problem when it came out and it's like not true.

2419
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,040
And then it was like, well, no one thought it was a problem in the 80s.

2420
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:18,960
And it was like, not true.

2421
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:21,360
They all were talking about it being maybe a problem as well.

2422
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,080
The even funnier thing.

2423
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:25,760
This came out on the Disney dish.

2424
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:29,320
Jim and Len talked about like Disney's give and take relationship

2425
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:31,360
with McDonald's over the years.

2426
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:37,920
And you can find a blog like has the scans and talks about like the pitch deck

2427
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:41,720
of like Splash Mountain presented by McDonald's.

2428
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:44,520
And it didn't that did not happen.

2429
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:49,600
Oh, OK, because it was like local SoCal franchisees wanted to sponsor it.

2430
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:52,320
And then the national branch was like, no, we can't.

2431
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,680
We got other things going on.

2432
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:56,880
And then it all kind of went to hell.

2433
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:01,000
They might have had McDonald's may have had to associate with Song of the South.

2434
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:03,040
Maybe they figured that part out.

2435
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:04,640
I don't know. Yeah, I don't know.

2436
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:06,840
I won't give them credit for it, though.

2437
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:08,080
No, no, no, probably shouldn't.

2438
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:10,120
I should assume the worst. But or.

2439
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:12,920
But, you know, here we are.

2440
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:17,720
We're now in the beginning months of the untangling of Song of the South

2441
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:22,840
from this attraction, which, you know, there's nothing wrong with the ride track.

2442
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:25,680
There's nothing wrong with this fun hill.

2443
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,160
There is. Yes, the rise.

2444
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:30,360
Initially, we were like, we're not like we don't like these characters.

2445
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:32,440
Yes, you can get rid of these cute characters.

2446
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:33,440
Who cares? It did.

2447
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:35,000
The bones are going to be there.

2448
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,640
And anybody who's weirdly upset about the there's even people who are nervous

2449
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:43,480
about the redo, not even in a way of because I need the characters from this movie.

2450
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,840
There's people who are just skeptical.

2451
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:49,200
You know, I just have to assume and believe that

2452
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:54,280
current Disney technology being put into a pretty old ride.

2453
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:58,440
This is just something they should probably be doing every 30 years with everything.

2454
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:03,840
Well, even like that riverboat scene at the end, the big scene with all the animatronics.

2455
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:06,880
First off, they never keep it up and running the maintenance on it.

2456
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,360
They say, oh, yeah, it's people's fault.

2457
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:10,920
It's management and the budget's fault.

2458
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:12,160
Yeah, they don't fund it. Yeah.

2459
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:16,680
That I feel like that that's going to cost too much money to just gut it entirely.

2460
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:19,800
I feel like a lot of I think gutting, I think gutting is cheap.

2461
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:21,960
I think true.

2462
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:23,040
I think gutting is cheap.

2463
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,320
Putting up a new version of it is expensive.

2464
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:26,560
The new version is expensive.

2465
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:30,160
So I'm worried, like I because all those America sings again, you know,

2466
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:32,800
if you want to really peace out those America, those are from America sings.

2467
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:34,040
That's right.

2468
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:35,520
On the south walks away.

2469
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:38,800
There's a show that's hateful just because it's bad.

2470
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,360
Yes. And probably a few of the songs.

2471
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,120
Some of the songs are bad too.

2472
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:45,240
Ninety five percent of the song.

2473
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:46,800
Yeah, it's OK.

2474
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,080
But the animals are just singing.

2475
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:50,040
That's what they were programmed to do.

2476
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:51,520
So keep.

2477
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:55,000
So keep the high kicking goose.

2478
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:56,760
Yeah. Yeah.

2479
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:59,160
Yeah. No, that holds up any time.

2480
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:00,560
Any other history.

2481
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,280
I think what I just said there.

2482
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:06,880
Do you know that there is also a there is in this special, the earnest part of it

2483
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:12,040
has a reference to let me just say the line and then I'll explain what the line is.

2484
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:12,800
He just says it.

2485
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,480
And it's just this crazy specific that you never would have thought of thought about

2486
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:17,320
when you were four. I didn't.

2487
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:21,160
You know, Vern, this rope is as tight as Italian hemp has been since the senseless

2488
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:22,400
and brutal hanging of Coley.

2489
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:24,160
Or yes. Yeah.

2490
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:25,440
Yeah. What is that again?

2491
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:30,200
Cole? I didn't know Cole Younger is it was a Confederate bandit

2492
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:34,840
during the Civil War like he and his brother, the Younger brothers

2493
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:38,760
were all a bunch of no good and excited and stare at this for too long.

2494
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:43,880
Yeah, there is a Confederacy reference in the other part of Ernest goes to Splash

2495
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:45,600
Mountain. How weird is that?

2496
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:48,480
Very weird. And that's maybe that's an ad lib.

2497
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:50,000
Maybe.

2498
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,480
Well, he's a he's a Kentucky guy.

2499
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:53,920
It's in character. Sure.

2500
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:57,120
I don't know. I guess he knows his Confederate history.

2501
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:00,240
I couldn't find any proof that Cole Younger's horse was hung.

2502
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:03,360
Hmm. Strange. Is that a penis?

2503
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,960
I don't know if he was.

2504
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:07,200
Might not have been.

2505
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:10,520
Might not have been hung at the neck, but I think we can assume that the horse was hung.

2506
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:14,200
Yeah, he is a big horse.

2507
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:19,160
The big the big hog of the big hog of Cole Younger's gang,

2508
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:21,240
as I am the big hog. Of course. Yeah.

2509
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:24,200
The red. Well, what else we got?

2510
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:26,680
I think we're just hey, we're looking forward to this redo.

2511
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:29,240
Worry just a little worried, not because of the IP.

2512
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:30,600
I think the IP switch over is great.

2513
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:34,440
I think there's going to be a budget budget and what they'll let them do.

2514
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:38,560
No matter what, it is the budget of the Disney company because it was like today.

2515
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:42,240
Some of the earlier art looked a little bit flashier to me

2516
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:45,560
than what the newer version of the redo looks like.

2517
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:49,480
But it looked a little bit less spectacular already from the outside.

2518
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:51,400
And then I think we've said this before.

2519
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:56,000
One of the imagineers was like, we're using like misting technology.

2520
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,280
And I'm like, oh, I don't like the sound of this thing.

2521
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:00,280
Worried about the misting.

2522
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:03,080
Covers up where robots used to be.

2523
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:05,600
I mean, the the actual rise in last year, like

2524
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:08,320
Guardians of the Galaxy mission breakout. Great.

2525
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,320
Runaway where railway? Great.

2526
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:16,080
Then you factor that in with like recent news, like, oh, activist investor

2527
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:20,240
demands that they will pull their support unless Disney starts making profit

2528
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:23,800
on streaming. And it's like that doesn't that's not going to happen.

2529
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:25,680
No, this is all six months.

2530
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:30,120
This was all under JPEG, which is also a little scary, too,

2531
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:33,280
because all of this, like whatever they if they're closing the ride

2532
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:38,360
now to start work immediately, I have to imagine most of this was approved

2533
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:41,200
under him, which also is a part of my fear.

2534
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:45,760
But maybe we'll get some maybe Iger will say some maybe they have to make him

2535
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:47,920
happy and spend more money.

2536
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:49,400
Yeah, I don't know.

2537
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:54,920
Splash Mountain is a long ride, too, which is also it's it's great.

2538
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:58,680
We all love long rides and it's a long ride, which means there's a lot of sections

2539
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:02,040
with robots, a lot of things to fill space to look at.

2540
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:07,040
And that is, again, where I'm worried that we're going to get a lot of projections on mist.

2541
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:12,040
Yeah, I think there's going to be a lot of mist and maybe it'll be cool.

2542
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:16,400
Maybe the projection technology is so good, it will not look like Davy Jones.

2543
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:20,520
But they do tell like it won't look like that pirate thing.

2544
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:20,960
It's gotten better.

2545
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:21,840
It's gotten better.

2546
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:26,080
He's called the princess and the frog colon tails from the mist.

2547
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:28,520
You know, you forget that.

2548
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:31,280
That's right. You do forget that.

2549
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:35,800
So, yeah. So maybe they just put a fog machine in there and fog up the place.

2550
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:39,440
And you play the Randy Newman songs and you go, it's pretty good.

2551
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:43,800
I'd be fine. I just, you know, I say, give the people what they obviously want,

2552
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:45,600
which is Ernest robot.

2553
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,600
I know it's not the same IP.

2554
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:50,840
I know Ernest is not from whenever Princess and the Frog is set.

2555
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:53,920
Right. You know, it's a nod to the history.

2556
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:59,040
A log crashed into the side and Ernest is all bent up his legs,

2557
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,880
all these tied up like a pretzel and

2558
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:04,800
asking for Vern's help.

2559
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:08,000
Anybody seen Vern would be.

2560
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,440
Yeah, I think is there an was there ever an Ernest?

2561
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,280
There's no no Ernest robot on a ride.

2562
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:16,360
That would have been tweeted at us within the first six months of this podcast.

2563
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:20,600
But yeah, is there was there an Ernest like stand

2564
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:23,840
a cardboard cutout anywhere at a certain point, maybe possibly?

2565
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:24,600
I think it's a question.

2566
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:28,520
They might have made a physicalized Ernest in some form, some restaurant

2567
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:29,720
promotion or something.

2568
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:32,040
Well, there was a thing like 10 years ago.

2569
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:34,440
Do you guys remember this where like

2570
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:40,400
Ernest started showing up on websites or like a cutout to car dealerships?

2571
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:44,200
And it seemed like the licensing was available again.

2572
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:45,480
So people were trying to.

2573
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:46,600
Oh, yes, of course.

2574
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:48,480
I was sending I think I was sending this to you.

2575
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:49,800
Yeah, I can't.

2576
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:52,600
But I couldn't. It was hard to search like.

2577
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,320
Oh, it was very confusing.

2578
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:57,000
Somebody owns like the IP of Ernest.

2579
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:00,440
Yeah. And they were trying to repurpose maybe old footage

2580
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:02,680
or just like him in a print campaign.

2581
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:07,200
And they were like, do you want Ernest to advertise your product still?

2582
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:08,320
Really? Yeah.

2583
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:11,880
And I have to I should go and try to find this because I forget where I found that.

2584
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:15,880
Because the main thing of like 2010's Ernest, if you search it, is like

2585
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:20,080
we're working on the movie Son of Ernest and we're very excited.

2586
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:24,400
I mean, there's a lot of interesting investigation here

2587
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:29,480
with with stuff that like the person and the either the person who played it

2588
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:32,200
or the person who was in charge of it like is dead.

2589
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:34,280
I'm I'm fascinated by all this.

2590
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:37,800
I'm fascinated by how Sherry Lewis's lamp shop characters.

2591
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:42,560
The only thing that they're being used for right now is their chew toys for dogs.

2592
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:44,280
Oh, Garfield got one for Christmas.

2593
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:45,840
He loves it. Yeah.

2594
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:49,640
Lamb chop is something that the dogs hump and chew.

2595
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:52,360
And you can buy lamb chop in a grocery store or a pet store.

2596
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:56,320
And that's what Sherry Lewis's empire has become.

2597
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:58,840
Do you want your dog to hurt lamb chop?

2598
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:03,920
Right. And then, yeah, like whoever owns Ernest is like,

2599
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:05,760
we got Ernest lying around here.

2600
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,400
Well, yeah, but he's dead.

2601
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:08,200
It doesn't matter.

2602
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:10,640
Let's figure out if we can make some more money off of him.

2603
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:12,840
Can he advertise the podcast? Yes.

2604
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,640
Can we use him as? Oh, boy.

2605
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:15,640
Well, this is how we can.

2606
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:17,040
We have a little business here.

2607
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,960
People paid money to hear this episode.

2608
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:22,320
Yeah, we got to get people in the in these gates in this club.

2609
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,440
Right. This is the way Ernest is our spokesman.

2610
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:26,320
Ernest is back and he's.

2611
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:30,480
Do you think you could get the you could get the rights for the amazing Criswell?

2612
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:33,680
You could be making bad predictions on TV.

2613
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:36,600
We could look into let's look into it.

2614
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:38,960
I told you I was looking into the Bozo rights

2615
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:41,800
until David Arquette snatched them away from me.

2616
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:44,800
Arquette got him because remember,

2617
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:48,640
Bozo and the clown babies was also part of the package.

2618
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:53,160
Yes. Of this woman who was the widow of the guy who pretended that he was the first Bozo.

2619
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:54,520
On a very shady website.

2620
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:58,200
Yes. And an old website with like a fax number in a place in Burbank.

2621
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:02,960
You would fax a lady like an old lady widow in Burbank

2622
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:05,520
if you wanted to license Bozo.

2623
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:08,480
And then like months later, David Arquette bought Bozo,

2624
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:12,720
showed up on New Year's Eve two years ago on CNN, I think dressed as Bozo.

2625
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:15,920
And then hasn't seen anything.

2626
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:17,920
That's what you did it for for a lurk.

2627
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:19,560
He well, he wants to this character.

2628
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:22,760
I think he maybe thought there might be more demand for Bozo.

2629
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:26,560
But it hasn't materialized yet.

2630
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:30,640
So, yeah, I think I think we should try to license all of these characters.

2631
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:34,000
If you can think of if you get out there, think of a character or a person

2632
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:39,360
that played a character like, can we license like Don Nats's nervous man character?

2633
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:45,600
The character that he would do on like variety shows before the Andy Griffith show.

2634
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:48,480
We are so thirsty for

2635
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:53,280
by using our money to buy an unwanted old IP.

2636
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,160
We must waste our money on this.

2637
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:57,720
A 90 year old widow.

2638
01:41:57,720 --> 01:42:00,760
Maybe we should just sign something over to us for that.

2639
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,640
If we're just really nice. Yeah.

2640
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:04,560
And we would be dog.

2641
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:07,840
Geez, ma'am. I was such a scaredy cat when I was a kid.

2642
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:11,040
Why? I didn't want to go on the scary ride because of the special.

2643
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:14,960
And one time I saw the news and it made me think my daddy was going to kill me.

2644
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:17,480
I guess I'm just a sweetheart.

2645
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:21,880
I said, you know what I never say on the podcast on my podcast is Dick or Hogg.

2646
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:24,080
I'm just a good boy.

2647
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:26,960
Oh, so would you mind signing them rights over?

2648
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:32,200
That's why I would like the full rights in perpetuity for Jack Parr

2649
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:33,800
for your late husband.

2650
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,640
Man, I have never seen more than seven minutes of footage of

2651
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:43,640
there when I just got to have Mr.

2652
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:45,880
Carr. I need him in perpet.

2653
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:49,080
Pupatourity. What's the word even?

2654
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:51,400
I don't know. I'm just an old little boy.

2655
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:57,880
I was texting my friend, a few friends about the new Batman 66 figures

2656
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:02,360
and the word, you know, you have to get likeness rights from estates.

2657
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:05,160
People that are still alive that, you know, control.

2658
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:08,520
So I said, you know, are they going to get the Madge Blake rights?

2659
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:10,760
Aunt Harriet, of course, from Batman 66.

2660
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:13,160
And my friend was like, you know, I think the perfect job for you

2661
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:17,440
would be going to get people's likenesses from their estates for the Batman figures.

2662
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:22,080
You should take a correspondence course on how to be a private investigator,

2663
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:24,920
a process server. It's got to be the same skill set.

2664
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:28,800
Yeah, maybe going to like Mad Blake's great granddaughter.

2665
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:32,560
It's it's endless checking.

2666
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:33,840
Yeah, it's research.

2667
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:38,240
It draws on your knowledge of things that no one in your peer group has.

2668
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:44,880
Yeah. And then you get to go talk to and have to befriend a bunch of bizarre people.

2669
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:47,800
For sure. Bizarre.

2670
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:50,480
There's no way they're not all very strange.

2671
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:53,000
Wow. Wow. Well, you found your calling.

2672
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,520
This is a very productive episode.

2673
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,400
Boy, a lot of systems.

2674
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:58,440
We have the amendment system.

2675
01:43:58,440 --> 01:44:03,000
I'm going to break a bottle and wave it at Elliott Bankhead to try and get to Lula's

2676
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:05,760
rights to Lula.

2677
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:08,120
Elliott is ninety five.

2678
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,160
I'm not a good house.

2679
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:12,960
All right.

2680
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:14,640
Don't make me tip you over.

2681
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:17,880
The great grandson of the Lula Bankhead

2682
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:21,280
took her name for some reason.

2683
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:23,880
Why do you Baptist?

2684
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:28,520
As a joke, she was on one episode.

2685
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:31,560
You need this figure that bad. Yes.

2686
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:35,760
Boy, oh boy.

2687
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:40,320
Well, unlike any Bankhead episode,

2688
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:45,520
heirs who talk back, you survived podcast.

2689
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:47,840
The ride sure did.

2690
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:52,840
Relatives, certain relatives might not be so lucky, but listeners, you made it.

2691

2693
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:58,040

Let us know what you want us to do in February.

2696
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,320
We'll be back in a month.

2697
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:09,840
Don't fuck it up.

2698
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:12,400
You need to turn this podcast around.

2699
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:14,520
It's your suggestions.

2700
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:16,560
You're on the line.

2701
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:19,400
Who suggested a Lula Bankhead episode

2702
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:22,640
that's unrelated to the barks?

2703
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:24,680
We're trying to get young people in here.

2704
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:26,400
I'm not going to do that.

2705
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:28,720
Jim Varney's old enough as it is.

2706
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:31,000
She almost died of a venereal disease.

2707
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:35,520
That's vulgar topics for a theme park to podcast.

2708
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:39,800
Don't make these nice boys say stuff about STDs.

2709
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:41,880
Shut this episode down.

2710
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:42,640
Shut it down.
