1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Forever.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,560
Dog.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:13,220
Warning, the following podcast contains godless fake meat, a countrywide French giveaway, a

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:18,180
ahem, gantt tree lift, and a round and round that has moved around.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,860
We're talking Astro Orbiter on today's podcast, The Ride.

6
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:48,100
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a podcast about theme parks which once again grapples with

7
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,860
getting 90 minutes out of a ride that goes round and round for 90 seconds.

8
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,840
I'm Scott Gardner, I'm up to the challenge, Mike Carlson.

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,020
I'm here, my name's Mike Carlson, and I'm not worried a bit.

10
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,560
I'm not worried for a second that we won't be able to talk about it.

11
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,040
I mean think about it, it goes round, that's 45 right there, and it goes round again, that's

12
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,620
another 45, that gets you to 90.

13
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,260
We gotta talk about both halves of the experience.

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,260
I hate to be so cocky at the top of an episode, but I am.

15
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,080
I'm feeling very confident, very sure of myself, and I hope-

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,040
Well this is good.

17
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:19,420
I hope Jason is too.

18
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,700
This will resonate, just to share it.

19
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,920
I'm feeling confident too because there's always the long wait for this 90 seconds too.

20
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,660
Yeah, he's feeling cock sure as well.

21
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,480
That is part of it.

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,200
We have to be cock sure.

23
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,160
There's also so many of them.

24
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:38,320
There's so many of them, with so many names, that's a lot of why I thought, oh this is

25
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,820
something here, because we're talking about a bunch of rides.

26
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,780
Do all of the rides go round and round and that's it?

27
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,220
Yes, but by the time you collect them all, yeah so today we're talking about the Rocket

28
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,000
Round and Rounds.

29
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:58,460
Any of the Disney Park rides over the years that have had a Rocket Round and Round, that

30
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:03,140
have been a Rocket that goes round and round, which have been in the park since the 56,

31
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:11,440
a long time franchise, as part of our little campaign to keep Tomorrowland alive in the

32
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,700
show as promised and negated on long ago.

33
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,880
But first, let me jump ahead to a period where there will be, I imagine no Tomorrowland,

34
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,940
although well there's haunted Tomorrowland stuff here and there.

35
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,800
Yes, of course there is.

36
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,700
But I'm talking about October.

37
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,240
October is on the way and that is when podcast The Ride becomes Haunt Cast the Fright, a

38
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:40,400
season of tricks and treats and haunts and puns and scary names that are negotiated and

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,860
litigated for a good five minutes at the beginning of every episode.

40
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,980
But that means that a special treat for this year, as part of the Halloween season, we

41
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,640
will be doing for the first time ever Haunt Cast the Fright live at Dynasty Typewriter

42
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,940
in Los Angeles.

43
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,480
That's Friday, October 20th, two shows, one at 7.

44
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,820
30, one at 10.

45
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,560
These are going to be super fun.

46
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,580
We're really excited for them.

47
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,320
Let's say costumes encouraged, right?

48
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:09,580
Yeah, sure.

49
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,640
I think so.

50
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:10,700
Sure.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,640
Why not?

52
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,860
Unless people feel humiliated to wear a deep theme park reference costume.

53
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,760
I should know.

54
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,060
As they go from the parking lot to the street.

55
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,640
But hey, that's a safe place to do it, I think.

56
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,040
Yeah, they should feel confident.

57
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,060
They should feel cocky when they're doing that.

58
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,520
Get that Carlson cockiness, the famous Carlson cockiness.

59
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,740
I'll be costuming it up.

60
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,500
We haven't discussed this really.

61
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,140
We did a little.

62
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:34,980
We got to costume it up.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,520
Yeah, we did a little.

64
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,540
You threw out some ideas.

65
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,080
Sure.

66
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:37,500
Yeah.

67
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,260
Well, you got to see what we'll be wearing.

68
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,220
We want to see what you'll be wearing.

69
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,740
They're going to be really fun shows.

70
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,080
We're also going to be live streaming both of those.

71
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,440
Thanks to Dynasty Typewriter and those will be archived for a little bit after too.

72
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,720
Click a link in the show notes and you will find all that.

73
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,220
And that's all of our business, right?

74
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:54,600
Wrong.

75
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,300
No, we're coming to Orlando.

76
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,200
And I think that's largely sold out.

77
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,360
Thank you, audience.

78
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,780
The seats are sold out.

79
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,120
But there are standing room spots available.

80
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,540
There are spots for your left and right feet if you still want to make.

81
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,440
At least as of this recording, there are.

82
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,520
We're doing two live shows on November 10th.

83
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,280
That's a Friday.

84
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,880
At Tin Roof on iDrive.

85
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,660
Cannot wait for that.

86
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,380
Oh, being live on iDrive.

87
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,740
What a feeling that's going to be.

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,520
All the greats have played it.

89
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,420
Uh-huh.

90
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,280
Yes, Van Halen cover bands.

91
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,080
Metallica cover band.

92
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,140
Linkin Park cover band.

93
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,780
Oh, yeah.

94
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,520
And now us.

95
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,180
And we're going to cover different rides and facets of the theme park.

96
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,660
That's right.

97
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,020
Keeping with the tradition.

98
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:49,180
Do you think the Tin Roof venue has Tin Roof sundaes?

99
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,760
You're going to have to elaborate.

100
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,500
Tin Roof.

101
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,700
You see a Blizzard or a Sunday Tin Roof.

102
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,420
It's chopped nuts and chopped cherries.

103
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,420
That's the name of a specific ice cream dish?

104
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,940
Yeah, chocolate sauce or fudge.

105
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,320
Yeah, Tin Roof.

106
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,380
You're the experts.

107
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,700
You got to tell us.

108
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,260
Is it called a Tin Roof sundae?

109
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:06,900
Yeah.

110
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:12,140
Listeners type in comments, how did Michael Jason not know the thing that Jason said?

111
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,380
He's the treat boy.

112
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,880
There's a reason why he's the treat boy.

113
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,460
Tin Roof sundae.

114
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,280
I've known Jason over a decade and I don't think I've heard him say Tin Roof sundae before.

115
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,200
So that's interesting.

116
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,100
Loaded with layers of vanilla and chocolate ice cream, gooey marshmallow sauce and chocolate

117
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,160
sauce and plenty of Spanish peanuts for a delicious salty crunch.

118
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,640
How about that?

119
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,660
I think it's one with a little wake up ring.

120
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:33,860
They have to have it then.

121
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,560
This is a chain.

122
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,420
Tin Roof is some chain.

123
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,900
They have like 12, 14 locations in America.

124
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,280
Wow.

125
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:38,860
Is that right?

126
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,340
Yeah.

127
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:39,820
Oh, great.

128
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,580
I would think that they have something like that.

129
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,680
Top round roast beef, I believe they have them.

130
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,680
They have Concrete's, you know, like.

131
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,940
I know what Concrete is, yes.

132
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,800
Tin Roof is one of the ones there.

133
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,360
I think the peanuts are a big element.

134
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,240
Marshmallow.

135
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,520
Would you eat a Tin Roof sundae on stage at the Tin Roof if it was available?

136
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,520
I don't know.

137
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,460
Does Jason want to perform under the influence?

138
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,440
That's the question.

139
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,020
That's the question.

140
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,800
Yeah, but the question is, do we want the place like, oh, not kind of packed or do we

141
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,940
want the place packed when people hear that you're going to be eating for two shows?

142
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,140
So it's going to have to be two different Tin Roof sundaes live on stage.

143
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,500
Now we don't even have standing room.

144
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,880
We have a lying room.

145
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,400
We have lying.

146
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,340
You can lie on the floor and bartenders will step over you.

147
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,200
But that's the pandemonium there is to see Jason eat a Tin Roof at Tin Roof.

148
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,700
They sell tickets across the street and hand out binoculars so you can kind of see through

149
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,160
the window.

150
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,120
Yeah, that's the nasty voyeur ticket.

151
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,120
The peeping Tom ticket.

152
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,180
We will sell peeping Tom tickets if we break fire code with the amount of tickets sold

153
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,660
in the building.

154
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,940
And we would like if you get a peeping Tom ticket to wear a trench coat and a hat.

155
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,820
Yes, please.

156
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,720
There will be some loners, but we can't guarantee loners for everyone, okay?

157
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,800
Yeah, we can't.

158
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,440
So because the demand will be too high.

159
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,800
He hasn't agreed to eat it though.

160
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,340
Exactly.

161
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,480
Trench coats, amazing, you would think.

162
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:11,700
We all came along, you know, we were born after the period of restaurants having loner jackets

163
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:17,420
of like, oh, sir, you need to put a jacket on to eat this under season prime rib.

164
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,760
There's got to be a place that still does that.

165
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,400
Yeah, I'm sure there is.

166
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,740
But it's not Tin Roof Orlando.

167
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,340
No, I don't think they have jackets.

168
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,320
They got a lot of food I'm looking at.

169
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,320
Desserts I don't know.

170
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,860
I don't know if it's a different menu or they're not.

171
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,640
Yeah, I don't see it either.

172
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,660
But they are missing out on a whole area.

173
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,000
But drinks and food looks good.

174
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,660
I think we're going to have a fun time there.

175
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,740
So make it if you can, if you can squeeze in.

176
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,640
But God bless you Orlando audience or anybody traveling in for grabbing those seats and

177
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,080
joining us.

178
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,380
We are so excited about all of this block of live show fun.

179
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,680
But all that being said, let's get back to Tomorrowland.

180
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,560
As I said, we're trying to make good on the Tomorrowland promise.

181
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,560
We discussed some of this on the second gate several days ago.

182
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,600
We talked about another since the beginning Tomorrowland franchise that has changed names

183
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,360
slightly through the years.

184
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:16,240
Rocket to the moon, flight to the moon, mission to Mars, now Red Rockets, pizza port, then

185
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,060
alien pizza planet, at least in.

186
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,800
So they've kept the tradition of slight name pivots.

187
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:28,340
And we go back to slight name pivots with this with Astro Orbit or rocket jets, whatever

188
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,660
you want to call it.

189
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,680
But I said at the beginning, I threw it under the bus a little and I said this is a ride

190
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,600
that that goes round and round.

191
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,200
And yes, that is what the ride does.

192
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,920
But I think there's more here.

193
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,180
And I don't think we would, you know, we are under no obligation to do it if there wasn't

194
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,800
more here.

195
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:54,020
The more here to Astro Orbit or rocket jets, all of it, I think is that it also just due

196
00:08:54,020 --> 00:09:00,480
to its size and due to it being a rare outdoor Tomorrowland experience, I think it becomes

197
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:07,300
kind of a symbol of the land in a way, sometimes situated in such a place in Tomorrowland that

198
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,240
it's like the weenie, that imagineering term.

199
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,100
It's like the it's the the beacon calling you into the land, telling you from afar,

200
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,660
telling you everything you need to know about the land.

201
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:24,860
And in that position, this is my big thesis at the top here.

202
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:31,460
I think that all of these rides represent their respective Tomorrowlands in big ways.

203
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:37,000
I think they represent the strengths of their particular Tomorrowlands and in a lot of cases,

204
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,080
their weaknesses.

205
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:44,960
I feel like you can tell the overall health of a Tomorrowland by checking on its Astro

206
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,340
Orbiter.

207
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,400
It's like the I don't know what part of the body you would say, but it's like, well, let's

208
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:49,940
check that.

209
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,880
And then that might be that might indicate a greater problem.

210
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,120
You put the big stethoscope up to the Astro Orbiter and see.

211
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,420
Right.

212
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:56,920
Yes.

213
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,900
Check on each of its orbs.

214
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,240
Right.

215
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,120
See what you hear.

216
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,300
Astro Orbiter check on its on its current level of paint coat.

217
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,700
Yeah, that's yeah, I think there's a lot of truth to that.

218
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:16,200
It's certainly something that, yes, especially for kids, suggests what almost all the rides

219
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,840
should be about in some ways.

220
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,980
It gives you like it goes all these rides I'm going to be doing.

221
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,620
I'm going to be in a little ship and I'm going to be going somewhere.

222
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,800
Yeah, that's true.

223
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,800
That is most Tomorrowland experiences over the years, isn't it?

224
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,200
Some from Star Tours to Space Mountain.

225
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,440
It's yeah, other than technically Autopia being in there.

226
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,780
But yeah, everything else is you're in a little spaceship.

227
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,240
That's never made sense.

228
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,480
It's like go to a rocket.

229
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:44,780
Here's three rides, sometimes four, lots of rides where you go to space.

230
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,160
Yeah.

231
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,460
And then here's a ride where you get in a car.

232
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:47,960
Yeah.

233
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:48,560
Future car?

234
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,660
No, a current car.

235
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,840
Probably actually probably a 1990s car.

236
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,140
Yeah, it makes sense, I guess, from the original Tomorrowland, I suppose, because it was just

237
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,480
a bunch of ads for different companies that Walt was friendly with.

238
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,440
So it's like and then there's like ads for paint and stuff.

239
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,160
But it certainly doesn't make sense now.

240
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,240
And the highway system was really being built up.

241
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,060
Yeah, it's true.

242
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,120
Yeah, that's like the future is highways, futures you will be driving on.

243
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,060
The future is little kids will be driving on highways.

244
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,860
But yeah, everything else, like you see that as a kid and like that's the that's putting

245
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,240
an image in your head of sort of what Space Mountain is like.

246
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,260
So I almost feel like you're like it strengthens Space Mountain in a way.

247
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,560
It's a little like demo.

248
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:35,300
It's like getting your feet wet in terms of elevated Disney rocket travel.

249
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,440
It feels like the basic training for Space Mountain in a lot of ways.

250
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,120
That's true.

251
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,220
At least you can see you're outside and you're not going into space, but you're in this little

252
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,860
vehicle and it looks like space.

253
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,740
So then when you're in space, your brain, because I know my brain sort of took me in

254
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,820
there the first time I ever went on.

255
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:56,020
Like I knew I wasn't in space, but man, your imagination runs wild with what's in the actual

256
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,640
like building of Space Mountain.

257
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,100
Sure.

258
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,580
Yeah.

259
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,040
Yeah.

260
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:05,080
In addition to going round and round, let's not forget, it also goes up and down.

261
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,620
Yes, this is true.

262
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,240
As any good spinner ride should have, it does give you the ability to control it and control

263
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:21,480
how high you get in it, which adds significantly to the thrills, especially in the ones where

264
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,360
you're elevated on a platform already.

265
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:30,420
You going all the way up perhaps gets you to like 80 feet in the air, I think is what

266
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,700
it is, but that's not true of all of them, necessarily.

267
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,020
They're all a little different.

268
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,420
They're all a little bit different.

269
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:46,760
It's a confusing thing to chart and we can step through them, but before we do any history,

270
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:56,060
let me just ask you guys any like emotional attachments or feelings you have about any

271
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,640
iterations of this franchise.

272
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:05,540
There's one or has been one at some point in I think every Magic Kingdom park, right?

273
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,080
Yeah.

274
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,560
They've all at least had some equivalent.

275
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,940
Well, there's Tokyo Disappeared.

276
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,380
Yeah, Tokyo is the only one that doesn't have it currently, I think.

277
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,160
But they did have one at some point.

278
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:20,860
But the applicable ones, like mostly for us in terms of childhood are Disneyland and Disney

279
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,400
World.

280
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,100
Strong feelings about this attraction from any point in your life?

281
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,780
I always liked the Disney World one when I was young.

282
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,120
I mean, I definitely wrote it when it was Star Jets, when it was the original one, and

283
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,500
certainly wrote it plenty as Astro Orbiter, which has a lot going for it.

284
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,000
I like the idea of Star Jets and Astro Orbiter in Florida.

285
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,260
You're high up.

286
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,480
I like that.

287
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,300
Technically, I guess you would take a gantry elevator, a gantry lift, some might say.

288
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,580
Oh, an early Disney gantry lift.

289
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,360
Wait, what?

290
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,060
A gantry?

291
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,260
I don't think you said it right.

292
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,480
Can you say it in a different way?

293
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,200
I just feel like something was wrong about how you said it.

294
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,520
I mean, I'm just saying.

295
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,880
You're saying I didn't put enough mustard on it.

296
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,040
I think Jason's completely missing.

297
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,360
We both are getting it.

298
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,200
What's the way to say gantry?

299
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,340
Gantry?

300
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,920
That we know…

301
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,200
Here's what I'm trying to get.

302
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,740
To be fair to Jason, there's been other times when he says something wrong and this is not

303
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,620
actually that bit.

304
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:22,980
No, no, no.

305
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,660
It's a different bit.

306
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,200
Oh, okay.

307
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,120
So this bit is…

308
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,160
I am flashing back to happy memories of childhood and smiling.

309
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,120
I'm sorry, it's unclear.

310
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,280
What's the fun way to say gantry in the world of theme parks?

311
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,620
Oh, a gantry lift?

312
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,900
That's almost there.

313
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,680
I think that's what you were…

314
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:44,440
Gantry!

315
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,620
There you go.

316
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,380
Oh, it's me.

317
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,160
No, I'm sorry.

318
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,480
It was close to the thing where we were like, what was that word?

319
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,500
That's not what we were…

320
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,880
I should have presented it in a different way.

321
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,240
Yes, I know.

322
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,280
There's one if not more of those per episode.

323
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,260
No, this is…

324
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,500
You just weren't speaking in proper Rocketeers.

325
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:00,700
You weren't Rocketeers.

326
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,480
A gantry lift.

327
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,660
A gantry lift.

328
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:03,920
Yeah.

329
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,240
Gantry lift.

330
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,420
Oh, it's nice to hear it.

331
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:05,740
Hey, Greg.

332
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,920
So I was like that and especially the big planets.

333
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,920
I think the big planets certainly plus it up a little.

334
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:20,820
And that area of Tomorrowland above the People Mover, you hear that great music loop, that

335
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,280
kind of spacey music loop I always loved.

336
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,440
Yeah, so that becomes like the onboard soundtrack.

337
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:32,340
There's not music made for this ride, but you're picking up the area music.

338
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,060
Yeah, yeah.

339
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,980
You get it on the People Mover and walking around and in this.

340
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:45,420
So it's kind of like, I don't know, it is a unifying thing in that land and it being

341
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,440
high up and kind of…

342
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,220
I think they painted it at some point.

343
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:55,520
I didn't remember the rockets being this kind of shiny blue, fluorescent blue almost.

344
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,640
And I think they look good.

345
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,100
Yeah, yeah.

346
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,680
I think the Florida one is pretty spectacular.

347
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,960
Looks good from afar.

348
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,380
I like being up in that California grill at the Contemporary.

349
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:15,840
It's kind of like the main thing you can see when it's lit up at night and got neon stripes

350
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,840
and that kind of thing.

351
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,540
It's a lot of a big part of the skyline there.

352
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,300
Mike, feelings?

353
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,480
Do you care about any of these?

354
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,900
Yeah, I think I said on Dumbo, the Dumbo episode that I feel like I'm going to fly out of them

355
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,560
and it stresses me out even more now that I'm older.

356
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:39,700
But as a kid, I did really like it, but it's so slow moving that I would feel like I'm

357
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,300
going to fall out, I'm going to fall out.

358
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,900
And then I would be very afraid to pull it all the way up, because especially when you

359
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,180
go all the way to the top, you're leaning a little bit.

360
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,920
And now you're in an angle.

361
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,740
So then I would just be like a little stressed the whole time.

362
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,840
So I would be very interested in going on it.

363
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,140
But then when I was little, I feel like I would be like, I don't want to raise it up

364
00:16:59,140 --> 00:16:59,780
too high.

365
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,320
So I'm like floating on the ground and all the other kids are just looking like the coolest

366
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:05,900
kids ever.

367
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,560
All of the other ones are all the way up.

368
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,040
All the other kids are all the way up.

369
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,600
Yeah, I'm getting in that.

370
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,780
When I was a kid, I would get in that thing and as soon as it would start to move, I would

371
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,540
just pull it all the way up.

372
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,880
Of course, Jason's making me look like a loser as a little kid.

373
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,780
I'll do it now to save face.

374
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,660
If I'm on one of these, if I'm on Dumbo, if I'm on Astro Birds, I will go all the way

375
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,500
to top because I know I have to prove to everyone that I'm cool.

376
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,340
To the children?

377
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,560
You have to prove to the children that you're cool?

378
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:37,260
From three years old to 85 years old, I have to prove now to everybody that I can do this

379
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,160
because I was so afraid to do it when I was little.

380
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:45,560
I think if you're a four-year-old getting on Dumbo for the first time on your first

381
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:51,640
trip to Disneyland and as you get aboard that thing, I think the main thing you're thinking

382
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,480
is, hey, that older guy in elephant number nine, is he cool or not?

383
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,620
Yeah, that's what I think they're thinking.

384
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,460
They will say, oh, is he cool or not?

385
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,940
They go, oh, he went all the way to the top and he's spending most of the ride on the

386
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,940
top, so yes, he is cool.

387
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,860
So therefore, no further information needed on whether this guy is cool.

388
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,080
Yes, he's, yes.

389
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,580
I was wondering what his weaknesses were, but I guess he's cool.

390
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,620
Is he blasting Olivia Rodrigo's guts from the elephant as well?

391
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,260
Yes, he is.

392
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:25,740
cool.

393
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,760
Having listened to some Olivia Rodrigo.

394
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,340
I've listened to half of it.

395
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,680
That was all the work you needed.

396
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

397
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,920
I've listened to half of it.

398
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,640
You've listened to half of it.

399
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,540
Wow, this guy's elephant is all the way up.

400
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,960
He looks like a guy who's probably listened to half of Olivia Rodrigo's.

401
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:46,700
My elephant is all the way up, which is, that'd be a good line in a song where I'm, some

402
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,420
sort of hip hop song.

403
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,960
That's a DJ call, yeah.

404
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,660
You can't stop me, my elephant's all the way up.

405
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,180
All the way up.

406
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:53,960
Yeah.

407
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:59,580
I do, I do, this is a run, I would be sad if it ever ended if you didn't, if you stopped

408
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:06,920
shouting names of albums almost in an accusatory fashion at us for maybe thinking that you're

409
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,600
not with it.

410
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,460
I feel like it happened not long ago with like, I've heard Harry Styles, I've heard

411
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,300
the Styles album.

412
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:11,680
Yeah, yeah.

413
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,120
It's good.

414
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,680
Hey, why are you, I'm not saying you didn't hear it.

415
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,300
I'm not thinking about it at all.

416
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,660
I like the Harry Styles album.

417
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,620
Harry's House, yeah.

418
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,280
Harry's House, yeah.

419
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,380
You've explained Harry's House.

420
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,720
I'm a huge Harry's House fan.

421
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,240
I know you're a big Harry's House guy.

422
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,840
In case you don't think I am anymore, I am.

423
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,260
I just wanted to put that out there.

424
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,800
You think I stopped liking Harry Styles, I didn't.

425
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,960
I don't know, why are you making these gestures like you're like, like you want to choke us?

426
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,480
Because I can tell Jason doesn't believe me.

427
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,060
Well, you got really intense.

428
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:43,420
You were like, we need to watch Don't Worry Darling without the gossip and hearsay.

429
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,580
Don't listen to the gossip, just listen to the music.

430
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,720
Enjoy the movie.

431
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,200
Yeah.

432
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,780
Enjoy Don't Worry Darling.

433
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,780
Jason, stop looking at me while we record.

434
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,140
You're making me nervous.

435
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:57,760
Do you like the sad Olivia Rodrigo songs or like that really pop, like up tempo fun song

436
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,520
about looking up with your ass?

437
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,300
There's a couple of slower ones in the first half.

438
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,540
I don't really want to spend too much time because I do have some thoughts on this.

439
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,940
Oh, now all I want to do is girly you about Olivia Rodrigo.

440
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,640
But I'm not prepared necessarily to do it.

441
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,700
I know it's not called-

442
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,340
I thought you liked it, I thought you were cool.

443
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:16,440
I do like it.

444
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,280
Are you cool or not?

445
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,140
I am cool.

446
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,120
I know it's not called Fuck It, It's Fine, but the song about hooking up with your ass

447
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,220
is really catchy.

448
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:24,980
Here's the thing.

449
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,860
Some of the songs I think are trying to go for like a young, like a new Joan Jett quality.

450
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,160
And sometimes I feel like with modern recording technologies, things sound too slick and it

451
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,460
doesn't give me quite the feeling or the feeling maybe they were going for.

452
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,580
And then you go back and listen to like early Joan Jett and there's a grittier, it sounds

453
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,240
grittier to me, partly because of the recording.

454
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,260
Well, that's my feeling about, you know, Steely Dan's 2000 album, Two Against Nature versus

455
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,460
like Asia or Gaucho.

456
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:52,940
Sure, yeah.

457
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,200
The songwriting is still there, but ultimately the recording is just a little too slick.

458
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,700
It's too slick sometimes.

459
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,980
And some bands it's good when it's too slick.

460
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,400
You listen to a Radiohead album and it's like the recording is precise and clean and it

461
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,800
just sounds like, it sounds amazing and that's right for that music.

462
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,760
But when you're going for the grit of Jett.

463
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,920
That's what I think.

464
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,500
But that's kind of a first listen.

465
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,100
So it's not an in-depth review.

466
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,420
I'll get my in-depth review later.

467
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,320
What do you think about the song Love is Embarrassing?

468
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,060
Oh wait, that's track nine.

469
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,600
I guess we don't know.

470
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:24,900
Shit.

471
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,920
We haven't gotten track nine yet.

472
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,860
Did I get the track nine?

473
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,840
I don't think I did.

474
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,680
You're a bad idea, right guy like me.

475
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,060
Yeah.

476
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,200
I go on the top of Dumbo.

477
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,260
I listen to the newest music.

478
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,080
I'm brutal out there.

479
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,360
I'm sitting on a Dumbo.

480
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,360
I went to the Aras Tour.

481
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,760
I am not aging.

482
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,300
My age is not changing.

483
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,700
It's staying the same.

484
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,040
In fact, it's going backwards.

485
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,240
If I'd seen every night of Aras, it would have reversed all of my gray hairs.

486
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,960
Too expensive.

487
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,000
It was ultimately only, only some of them went backwards.

488
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:05,620
Yes.

489
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,980
Because I only saw one night.

490
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,100
There is no way you were the only man talking about the Aras Tour breaking down in front

491
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,180
of you.

492
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,160
I saw the Aras Tour.

493
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,120
I was at Aras.

494
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,380
I know I was born in a different era, but I saw Aras today.

495
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,400
I'm just owning.

496
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:31,200
I went to Beck who was, I went, I fought Taylor Swift traffic to go to Beck and not Taylor

497
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,760
Swift where he made reference to like, all right, let's get all you Swifty dads up and

498
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,080
dancing.

499
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,100
Yeah.

500
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:38,900
Yeah.

501
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,240
Hey, I'm willing to, I'm willing to take dad jokes at my Beck shit.

502
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,240
You got a friendship bracelet that says, baby, I'm a lost cause.

503
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,720
That's how I feel about keeping up.

504
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,200
Yeah.

505
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,800
I know too much about two against nature.

506
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Once you cross the two against nature bridge, there's no going back.

507
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,280
You just can't, you just have to embrace it and know you're not going back to cool.

508
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,960
That older millennials running after us trying to tell us about the best tracks on modern

509
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,700
guilt.

510
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,020
Which is 10 years old.

511
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,440
Which is a variation album.

512
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,680
It's so old at this point.

513
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,300
It's really old.

514
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,680
So anyway, we're all cool.

515
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,620
Now let's prove it by talking about all the iterations of the Astro Jets attraction in

516
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,240
the history of the Disney parks.

517
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,820
So yeah, look, this it's, it's been there since 56.

518
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:36,060
This was, it was called Astro Jets then it's considered, I didn't realize it was considered

519
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,960
like the first major new ride to get added to Disney post-opening.

520
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,800
So this is, this is, this has proven, Hey, we're not, we didn't blow our wad months ago.

521
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,440
We got, we got more ideas.

522
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,640
You think we only had elephants that spin around.

523
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,140
We got rockets that spin around.

524
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,960
And this was like the most exciting thing there.

525
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,820
I think so at that time, probably.

526
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,540
Yes.

527
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:03,400
Um, because, you know, it's always been any iteration of this has, you know, yes, it's

528
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:10,760
a spinner ride like Dumbo, but it's always been kind of, kind of bigger, kind of scarier.

529
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,700
A little more austere possibly.

530
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,220
It's, you know, Dumbo is for little kids.

531
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:23,460
This is for 12 year olds, at least or only, or eight year olds as brave as 12 year olds.

532
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:23,940
Yeah.

533
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,440
Well, the best iterations of it are up higher.

534
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:33,120
They're either above the people mover or in Tokyo just above because it looked better.

535
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,540
Yeah.

536
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,420
Oh yeah.

537
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,660
They didn't need to.

538
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,460
They didn't need to.

539
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:42,620
In Tokyo, there was not a people mover, but they still built a platform for it because

540
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,160
it's cooler.

541
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,160
Also very funny.

542
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:49,020
The Tokyo version had a big, the big rocket in the center says USA on it.

543
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,660
They kept that design.

544
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,860
That is weird.

545
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,460
Yes.

546
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,460
I mean, that's the, again, I think we'll find the various ways that this attraction

547
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,460
represents the Tomorrowland or the park.

548
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,070
And that to me feels like what that says about Tokyo Disneyland when it opened was let's

549
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:08,570
just do all the stuff the American parks are doing down to a rocket says USA.

550
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:09,210
Yeah.

551
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,270
We are rarely reinventing the wheel.

552
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,550
We like what they have.

553
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,570
Let's do what they have.

554
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:17,850
And then they've come to forge their own identity, you know, in the years since.

555
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:18,390
Yeah.

556
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,170
But so we got Astrojets.

557
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,390
It's not up on a platform yet.

558
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,970
It's just down on ground level.

559
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:28,010
They haven't innovated to that extent yet.

560
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,250
Then we get the first name change.

561
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,610
Astro, it was Astrojets until 1964.

562
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,730
United Airlines joins as a park sponsor for the Tiki Room.

563
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:46,090
And they say no more Astrojets because American Airlines, our competitor, calls their planes

564
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,070
Astrojets.

565
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:47,630
Yes.

566
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,630
Inaccurately.

567
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:49,570
Yeah, right.

568
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:53,930
So they were pitching a fit about something on the other side of the park.

569
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:58,370
They're not even close to, they don't sponsor that ride, but they don't want anywhere.

570
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:03,410
They consider that free advertising for American Airlines famous Astrojets.

571
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,670
Isn't everything space age back then?

572
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:17,370
Like wasn't everyone just using jet and Astro and moon and you know.

573
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,130
Yeah, true.

574
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,090
Yeah, yeah.

575
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,750
That's just, that was them trying to be cool back then.

576
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,090
Yeah.

577
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:25,290
We're up on that space parlance.

578
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:32,870
But yeah, I think no reason to make that change, but it leads to our first slight name pivot,

579
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,610
which is Tomorrowland jets.

580
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:40,190
It is now Tomorrowland jets for several years until the entire thing is torn up.

581
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:43,030
The first big revamp of Tomorrowland.

582
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,050
And this is where it becomes Rocket jets.

583
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:49,310
And I remember it as Rocket jets for a long time.

584
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:53,310
It's not a very like fanciful Rocket situation.

585
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,430
That's a lot of these early ones.

586
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,210
It's very like, it's a little clinical.

587
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:01,210
It's a little, also kind of representing the Tomorrowland of the era.

588
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,610
We talked about this was actually the moon.

589
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,070
It's not science fiction.

590
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,590
It's science fact, right?

591
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,970
Because we haven't been to the moon yet.

592
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:09,570
That's another two years away.

593
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,450
Do you think in the, maybe I didn't read anything.

594
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:17,930
Like were they thinking in the narrative of the spinner ride that you were in space or

595
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:22,050
since it was just Rocket jets, it was just, we were using a rocket and we were flying

596
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,390
around Disneyland.

597
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,830
Do you know what I'm saying with the difference?

598
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:25,390
Oh, I see.

599
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,610
Were they thinking that this was like you were going into space or are we just simulating

600
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,090
what it would be like to be in a rocket and shoot around the sky?

601
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:36,850
Maybe it is, what if it is considered like a training exercise?

602
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,070
I think that's kind of the idea.

603
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:43,350
Like all of us will be going to space on the regular soon.

604
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:48,350
We will have, you know, your parents might not move there, but they might, your uncle might.

605
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,290
So you're gonna, we're gonna be taking trips.

606
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:55,470
That's like, that's like going down to San Diego to see your uncle.

607
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,170
It'll be going to the moon.

608
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:01,410
So you need to get in shape for that when that comes three years from now.

609
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:01,850
Yes.

610
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:02,790
And that's why it's just jet.

611
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:06,810
Cause like, I think, yeah, you would train with a jet to go into space, I suppose.

612
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:09,110
Cause Astro Orbiter, obviously the narrative is you're in space.

613
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,530
You think just fully.

614
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,270
I think.

615
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:12,950
Jason, do you agree with me?

616
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,470
Astro Orbiter, it's the name Astro Orbiter.

617
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:19,430
And they've got like kind of configurations of planet type things.

618
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,590
They're planet type items.

619
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:25,670
I think so.

620
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:32,130
By the way, got very excited when I realized I thought it was a Mandela effect situation

621
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:38,990
going on, but that one is Astro Orbiter with an O and one is Astro Orbiter with an E.

622
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:39,590
Yeah.

623
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:44,670
I was like, oh yeah, we're not going to have any trouble filling this episode.

624
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,550
So many slight differences.

625
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,730
What does it mean?

626
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,030
We've talked about this before.

627
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:57,450
That, so like I thought as a big theme park fan kid, I thought that everything in the

628
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,670
parks had significance.

629
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:04,730
Like this is a manicured place and it must be there for a reason and done a certain way

630
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:05,550
for a reason.

631
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,090
And this one brings me right back to that.

632
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:13,770
I'm like, what does it mean that one is Astro Orbiter with an E and one is Astro Orbitor

633
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:14,550
with an O?

634
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:15,810
Why?

635
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,270
Why did they decide that?

636
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,210
They were only open four years apart.

637
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,750
What is it about?

638
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,670
What does one convey that is different than the other?

639
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,670
I don't really know.

640
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:30,730
The spelling that's correct is orbiter with an E.

641
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:31,550
Yeah.

642
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,090
But correct, yes, correct.

643
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,950
But can you not dream, Michael?

644
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,250
Can you not, orbitor has a grandeur to it.

645
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:40,850
Doesn't it feel like-

646
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:41,690
I don't disagree.

647
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:44,550
This is the only the dreamers like H.

648
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:44,710
G.

649
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,130
Wells and Jules Verne could imagine an O instead

650
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,430
of a clinical E.

651
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:49,990
Of course.

652
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:56,070
It does feel spacier and another wrench is thrown in when you look at some of the international

653
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,370
parks and they call it the orbitron.

654
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:58,930
Yes.

655
00:29:58,930 --> 00:29:59,150
Right?

656
00:29:59,390 --> 00:29:59,750
Yeah.

657
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:03,390
And it's like, well, that adds a whole new wrinkle to this scenario.

658
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,570
I don't know what to think now.

659
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:08,270
I mean, what's the better designed one from Disney World Disneyland, do you think?

660
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,390
I'm looking just to double check what I think.

661
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:17,190
Well, I think the black and white ones from Star Trek era might be the most like tasteful

662
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,450
design they've ever gotten.

663
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:25,890
But I think Tomorrowland, New Tomorrowland, which is what they call the Florida redo in

664
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:26,510
94.

665
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,990
And do they also call that out here?

666
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,370
Was that also called New Tomorrowland?

667
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,910
I think just New Tomorrowland.

668
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:39,470
I always say Tomorrowland 94 for Florida, Tomorrowland 98 for Disneyland.

669
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,010
Sure.

670
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:42,030
I'm looking back and forth.

671
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,510
It's hard to say.

672
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,730
They are similar.

673
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:50,770
Both of these were out of the clinical 60s rocket era.

674
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:54,690
They were into fanciful science fiction design.

675
00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:00,670
I think I like the Disneyland one better, but I like the placement obviously in Disney

676
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,370
World much better.

677
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:02,030
I like the placement better.

678
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:02,610
Yes.

679
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,010
Do we like the gold?

680
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,110
Do we like that being made?

681
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,050
It used to be more gold.

682
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:11,290
Well, I was going to say it's like it's kind of still out of place as far as the gold,

683
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,190
the Jules Verne.

684
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,470
Did Jules Verne use a lot of O's instead of E's?

685
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,690
Is that part of it?

686
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,830
Well, let's ask the reader over here.

687
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,790
It seems like something Jason, the book reader, would know.

688
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:24,390
I don't know.

689
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,050
I think one or two.

690
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:32,850
Early science fiction, kind of like early horror is very clinical, very stiff.

691
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,150
Reading a Lovecraft book.

692
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:34,870
Yeah.

693
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,750
I was like, I'm going to read a Lovecraft book.

694
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:40,550
I'm like, my God, the details here that feel superfluous.

695
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,510
Yeah, some of them are better than others.

696
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:45,930
It definitely works well in short stories.

697
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:47,390
Lovecraft.

698
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,690
I don't think I've ever read a full novel.

699
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:50,710
Yeah.

700
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:56,510
Yeah, I think I like the Tomorrowland one better, but yeah, I don't know.

701
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,150
I guess it looks a little more fantastic.

702
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,190
Well, not much, but not much really.

703
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,290
Similar zone.

704
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:07,290
I mean, some of the whether you like it better, I feel like comes from the broader land.

705
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:11,770
Let me keep stepping through historically a little bit.

706
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:19,330
So Tomorrowland 67, with that redo, this is when the big choice is made.

707
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,290
This is when we move upstairs.

708
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:28,050
And in doing so, by putting it on top of that platform, it's PeopleMover on the second level,

709
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,650
RocketJet's all the way on the top.

710
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,830
You got to take a gantry.

711
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:34,450
Gets you up so high, more thrilling, better views up there.

712
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:40,370
And it goes from a C ticket to a D ticket, a rare attraction where it itself doesn't

713
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,850
do anything it couldn't do before.

714
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:46,190
But placement alone gets it one ticket level up.

715
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,430
That makes sense to me.

716
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:53,450
I think speaks to the virtue of putting it up on that platform.

717
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:54,270
Yes.

718
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,970
It's what like what unlocks its ultimate form, you would think.

719
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:57,690
Vibes.

720
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:58,090
Yeah.

721
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:00,330
The vibes massively increased.

722
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:06,670
You know, the ride doesn't do anything different, but I wasn't taking vibes into account.

723
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,470
There are major vibes up there.

724
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,210
So anyway, that version is still that's the USA.

725
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,070
That's kind of clinical modern rocket.

726
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:18,190
But it's from the Disneyland I started going to.

727
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:25,110
Like I'm still very fond of pre redo 80s well into the 90s style.

728
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:30,530
Tomorrowland where there'd just be a big big Coca Cola sign and that's not even the logo

729
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:31,910
they use anymore.

730
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,210
And that neon Mickey, of course.

731
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,290
But I don't know.

732
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:39,730
It's not the most fanciful thing, but I still liked it.

733
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,550
When they bring this to Disney World, they do the same thing.

734
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,030
They put it up on top of the platform.

735
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,510
It's now here's another.

736
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,490
It's Star Jets there.

737
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:48,110
Yes.

738
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:48,650
OK.

739
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:49,830
Rocket Jets here.

740
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,070
Star Jets there.

741
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:55,550
What is it in Tokyo when they open essentially this?

742
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,410
I think it's Rockets.

743
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,450
I think you go back to Rockets.

744
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,150
Yes.

745
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:00,430
Why?

746
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,850
We don't know why these pivots.

747
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,510
We aren't sure.

748
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:13,010
And then what really changes it all, what cracks the whole thing open is Disneyland,

749
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,090
Paris or Euro Disneyland at the time.

750
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:20,350
This is where we start breaking the Tomorrowland mold.

751
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:25,130
They're getting the sense that these Tomorrowlands are not aging very well

752
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,530
and that everything's a little stuck in the 60s in a bad way.

753
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:34,190
So this is the first time that we have that notion of it's the future that never was.

754
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:37,090
And it's inspired by the great writers.

755
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:41,990
And we try to do something that feels a little future, but retro, but timeless.

756
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:49,570
And I feel like that orbitron in Paris is like one of the biggest manifestations of that.

757
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:54,270
It seems like something they were very proud of to take this ride that maybe feels like

758
00:34:54,270 --> 00:35:00,370
a clinical round and round rocket ride and turn it into this like sculpture, this like

759
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:01,050
living sculpture.

760
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:11,990
Verne, a national hero, like a beloved figure.

761
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:15,530
And we're going to make like the land.

762
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,250
And the French said, thank you so much.

763
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,170
Merci beaucoup.

764
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,170
Yes, they did the polite spinning.

765
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,790
You know, we are so happy about this.

766
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,050
We will not throw eggs at your press conferences.

767
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:26,850
Thank you, Mr.

768
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:30,030
Baxter for your Jules Verne inspiration.

769
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:34,890
Like you say, we will blow our smoke to your left, not in your face.

770
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,010
No cultural Chernobyl is this.

771
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:46,350
So here we get, and this is where we also, we don't put it up on a platform anymore.

772
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,070
It is back down to the ground.

773
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,130
And is that okay?

774
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,210
Can we go backwards?

775
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,190
Is that allowed?

776
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:57,730
If you're getting more out of it, if you're, you know, because what we've added are all

777
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:03,310
of these like these orbs that you pass by that it is this living, moving sculpture.

778
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:03,670
Yeah.

779
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:11,170
And, you know, like that it feels very like it looks like, you know, fantastical concept

780
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,450
art from Verne era.

781
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:20,930
And like, there's, you know, like, like compass type components and, and that sort of thing.

782
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,170
It's definitely cool.

783
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,690
I don't know.

784
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:28,650
What do we think about this choice just at the pierce stage?

785
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:33,030
Well, it's going to, my opinion is going to probably fall on all the, all of the ones

786
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,750
that have this extra planet stuff.

787
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:40,190
But I think the thought process was, yeah, you're elevating the experience of a spinner

788
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:44,670
by now presenting abstractions of space and planets and stuff.

789
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:50,410
But really, when you're on an Astro orbiter or any sort of spinning ride, what you're

790
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,970
doing is just seeing how far you can see into the distance.

791
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:56,070
You're just seeing, hey, I can see tomorrow.

792
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,210
You can kind of see the top of the building over there.

793
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,830
You can see the tree house over there in Disneyland.

794
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:05,110
Like there's no way that's not going to be what if you have an open air ride like this,

795
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:07,490
you're just trying to see, oh, I can see outside of Disneyland.

796
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,730
Like that's all your dumb brain is doing.

797
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,870
So I don't mind the planets even being there because it's kind of an interesting thing

798
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:14,290
to go by.

799
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:17,950
But I feel it's more for the people looking at the ride than it is for the people in the

800
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:20,910
cars because I don't pay any attention to these planets.

801
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,150
That's a good point.

802
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,810
When you're in the car, you're just trying to see how far you can see into the distance.

803
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:28,670
Only as sculpture can you judge these things by what they look like in the middle.

804
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,890
But when you're on it, you're probably not looking at the middle.

805
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:33,050
No, you're just, you're trying to see what you can see.

806
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,050
You're trying to see if you can see your car or something.

807
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:37,390
If it's parked on the Mickey and Friends parking structure.

808
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:41,870
But this is one where the Florida one is a little elevated because the planets are kind

809
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,330
of encircling you a bit.

810
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:44,050
Yes.

811
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:47,850
You know, they're not entirely in the center where you could ignore them.

812
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:48,770
They're kind of.

813
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:49,890
They're getting in your vision.

814
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,130
They're getting in the vision.

815
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,190
Even if you're focusing.

816
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:52,850
Same thing in Florida.

817
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,850
Are you look staring at, oh, there's a planet.

818
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,530
No, you're trying to see, oh, I can see.

819
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,130
Well, sometimes they glow at night.

820
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:00,950
I'm not saying it's that cool and it's not part of it, but aren't you just trying to

821
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,670
see if you can see the Polynesian from there?

822
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,350
Yeah, that's true.

823
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:05,630
Oh, yeah, look at Bay Lake.

824
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,410
Oh, I can see over here.

825
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:11,110
Yeah, like that to me, that's always what's fun about being up high on one of these things

826
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,710
is like kind of trying to see what you can see.

827
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:16,730
So does that have to factor if we are like ultimately, you know, we haven't been on all

828
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:21,850
of these because a lot of them are international, but I wonder if we can determine which is the

829
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:24,670
best and does this factor need to be entered into it?

830
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,210
I think so.

831
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:30,310
To be not just the placemaking of the ride itself, but like what do you get to see?

832
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,210
Yeah, and it's so Disney World to me is like the winner.

833
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:33,670
Yeah.

834
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,210
We're just judging by that.

835
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:40,010
I love like Everest.

836
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:44,950
When I'm going up that little Everest climb, I am just looking to see what I can see in

837
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:47,630
the distance because it's the flat swamp of Orlando.

838
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,490
I'm like, oh, I can see the Tower of Terror from here.

839
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:51,670
I'm looking around.

840
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:54,550
I'm completely taken out of the narrative of Everest.

841
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,390
I don't give a fuck about Everest on that climb.

842
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,830
I do when I get back inside.

843
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:02,290
I love Everest again, but from that point on, I'm just like, oh, can I see I drive from here?

844
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,770
Oh, I can see this.

845
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,190
I can see Spaceship Earth.

846
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:05,790
Yeah.

847
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:08,470
Anytime I'm up high in a theme park thing, that's what I'm looking.

848
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:09,750
I'm looking for other stuff.

849
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:13,310
Doom?

850
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:19,150
It's like, hey, can you put me on this side where I can see the Tony Romans on iDrive?

851
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:20,130
100%.

852
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:20,550
Yes.

853
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:21,910
I want to see the rock.

854
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:24,770
If I'm on knots, I want to see the rock and bruise if I'm up high.

855
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,050
I want to see what I can see.

856
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,270
Can I see the Portillo's from one of the coasters?

857
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,230
That is always exciting.

858
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:32,730
Yeah, I do like seeing the tip of that rock and bruise guitar.

859
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:33,830
Yeah, exactly.

860
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,790
So that's what I think.

861
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:40,730
I think they kind of overthought it in a way of like, well, here, these planets will be

862
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:44,090
entertainment for the riders, but not entertainment for me.

863
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:49,970
I'm looking for things in Anaheim I can see or other parts of the park that is usually

864
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,190
I can't see from this location.

865
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,630
So you got to get up high.

866
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:54,650
So you got to get up high.

867
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,910
That's the way I feel about it.

868
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:00,090
I texted you guys about this a little bit.

869
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:05,750
I and a friend of the show, Buzz Buzz, I'm sorry, I say it in every episode.

870
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:06,150
Sure.

871
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,750
Had a really fun night.

872
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:14,990
Something we'd never thought about doing before, which is just bar hopping all of the sky bars,

873
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:18,210
all of the rooftop bars around Disneyland.

874
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,950
No money given to Disneyland just fully.

875
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:26,650
But exactly what you're talking about and are after, which is like, it was really fun

876
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:29,850
going upstairs at every hotel we could find.

877
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,010
Okay, what do you got here?

878
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,130
All right, you got a little bit of space.

879
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:35,650
Man, you're here that you can kind of that kind of cuts through and you could see.

880
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:39,190
Is that a lit up Mark Twain over there landed at a bar?

881
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:39,990
What was this?

882
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:40,730
This place is called.

883
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:44,130
I also like the slight rearranging of magical words.

884
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:46,890
We talk about Disney rearranging the same words over and over.

885
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:52,950
But all the hotels on Harbor all like the one we were at was Grand Legacy at the park.

886
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:56,190
How many it's like off brand Halloween costumes.

887
00:40:56,190 --> 00:41:00,090
How many words can we kind of jumble together to illustrate?

888
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,030
The exact same thing.

889
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:04,010
Yeah, Castle Magic Lodge.

890
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,150
Does that really one of the names?

891
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:05,850
No, no.

892
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,850
That's actually an elevated one actually.

893
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,090
I got excited about it.

894
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:13,330
Grand Legacy at the park was pretty cool.

895
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,690
I think we determined that one's good because you can see fireworks.

896
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,830
They pump in music.

897
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,870
They briefly stop playing their in-house music,

898
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:29,070
which is like a outdated version of dance remix of Red Hot Chili Peppers, by the way.

899
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:32,050
Which did I think of you when this came on?

900
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:32,430
I'm glad.

901
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,130
I did, Mike.

902
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,790
Yeah, Mike has disappeared.

903
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:39,610
It's just a puff looney tunes puff of smoke because he's running to this place.

904
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:42,650
Well, this is a thing I do not like I end up doing it to no one.

905
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,130
Even if there's people there who won't understand what's happening.

906
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,870
Something like that comes on and I do your move.

907
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:48,190
You point.

908
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:51,050
A little smirk and like, oh, hear that.

909
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,430
A very obvious song that you hear almost everywhere.

910
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:54,610
You know what's funny?

911
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:55,170
You say that.

912
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,470
I don't know if I've said this on the show before.

913
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:59,290
This sticks out to me and I don't know that I was copying this woman,

914
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,110
but when I was like 19 or 20 and working at the container store,

915
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:07,610
I was helping a woman find something in the store and a song came on and the woman stopped

916
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:10,590
and I swear she pointed up and she said, oh, this is KT Tunstall.

917
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:11,310
KT Tunstall.

918
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:15,930
For that song, it's in like soap ads.

919
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:21,230
Like, wow, a rare opportunity to hear that song.

920
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,530
I never thought it would happen to me.

921
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:30,410
I was working at the container store as so many of these letters start.

922
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:33,410
KT Tunstall.

923
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:37,450
So you heard that happen and you're like, this is something I should aim for.

924
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,990
I don't think I stole it from there, but when you just pointed,

925
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:44,090
I just had that memory of it all of a sudden, like somebody doing it to me.

926
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:49,490
Someday, I dream of someday that there will be an artist named Ed Sheeran and his song

927
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:53,510
Shape of You will come on everywhere that you are for two years time.

928
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:57,930
And when that happens, I will point up at the speaker to acknowledge it is happening.

929
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:00,970
Mike, you remember that because that was like a turning point.

930
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:01,930
That was a fulcrum.

931
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:04,230
Your life could have gone in a different direction.

932
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,970
You could have fallen in love with that woman, started a whole new…

933
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,810
The woman was like 40 years older than me.

934
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,370
This is like your sliding door.

935
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:10,970
What's that?

936
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,890
I think the woman was like 40 years older than me.

937
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,170
But this is your sliding doors moment.

938
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:20,310
I'm not saying it lasted forever, but she could have educated you in the ways of the world.

939
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:21,210
Of the ways of Tunstall?

940
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,830
Yeah, Tunstall.

941
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:23,870
And you would have been changed.

942
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:25,010
These are the B sides of…

943
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:28,190
I've never deep dived on KT Tunstall's music career.

944
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,510
That's the way to get cool.

945
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:30,730
Hero's Journey.

946
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,430
Character returns to beginning, but changed.

947
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:38,290
I disagree with some of the philosophy of what Jason's saying,

948
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:42,910
but I can't disagree that ultimately anything could be a sliding doors moment.

949
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:43,690
And he's right.

950
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:48,950
You could have married that 40 years at 19, based on her like of KT Tunstall.

951
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:49,510
You could have married…

952
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:53,110
Well, it could have just been one crazy summer sort of thing.

953
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,930
I'm not saying it could have been married.

954
00:43:55,050 --> 00:44:01,310
The thrill for her too of getting hit on by a 19-year-old in container store employee.

955
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:04,810
I'm wearing the apron, like 160 pounds.

956
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:07,870
Yeah, it's true.

957
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:09,070
I was…

958
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:09,610
Look, I…

959
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:11,330
Couldn't help but notice you like music.

960
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:12,890
And containers.

961
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,750
We both love containers.

962
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:17,490
We both love to rock.

963
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:21,930
But what sizes and what shelves can you put them on?

964
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:25,930
Well, I can help her with that and she can help me with other things.

965
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:28,370
She can help teach me other things.

966
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:33,090
You have a history of years of sexual awareness.

967
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:35,670
What do you know, Tunstall woman?

968
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:39,950
Puts the record player KT Tunstall search button in.

969
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:42,590
My world changes forever.

970
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:45,650
You walk in, she's got a full vinyl collection, hundreds of albums.

971
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:47,050
Then you realize it's all the same.

972
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:48,490
It's different copies of the same.

973
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:53,370
I don't even know what that's called.

974
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:54,650
Have you sing woohoo.

975
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:56,250
That is the KT Tunstall song, right?

976
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:57,110
I think so.

977
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,610
What was Corinne Bailey Ray?

978
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:00,170
That's my only…

979
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:01,010
Oh, oh.

980
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:02,810
Do you want me to put your records on?

981
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:03,330
Is that right?

982
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:05,410
Who was Feel the Rain on your skin?

983
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:08,650
Feel the rain on your skin.

984
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:10,870
No one else can feel it for you.

985
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:12,370
Never went past that in the song.

986
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:13,370
If I could avoid it.

987
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:13,530
Oh.

988
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:14,290
Never…

989
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:18,350
I like a good song that's omnipresent that I somehow never finish.

990
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:21,890
Well, I've watched more of a Lessons as commercials than you, I suppose.

991
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:23,230
Natasha Bedingfield?

992
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:23,790
Okay.

993
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:25,510
And is Natasha Bedingfield?

994
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:27,650
KT Tunstall woohoo.

995
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:28,210
Woohoo.

996
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,590
I get all the shampoo music confused.

997
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:31,130
Yeah, yeah.

998
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:34,190
The mid-2000s shampoo music.

999
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:34,670
Yeah.

1000
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:35,870
Oh, that's 2004.

1001
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:39,630
Who's…

1002
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:43,750
Everybody have big plans for the KT Tunstall woohoo 20th anniversary question?

1003
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:46,590
What's a better rock woohoo?

1004
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:47,570
That or Blur?

1005
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:49,930
Oh, I'm just trying all my old favorites.

1006
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:53,470
1-800-collect, Star 69, like all the other…

1007
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:55,690
You just like to dial those numbers sometimes?

1008
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:57,430
Just every now and then, yeah.

1009
00:45:57,610 --> 00:45:58,570
Just to get the feeling?

1010
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:03,390
Just for a flashback, because those woohoo songs were like in those too, you know?

1011
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:04,890
Good woohoo's back then.

1012
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:09,590
Anyway, just to wrap this up briefly, it was like a night where we didn't even…

1013
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:11,370
Disney got no money.

1014
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:14,410
We didn't go on a ride and yet we had such a blast.

1015
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:15,750
Just like what are our different…

1016
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:16,990
Yeah, yeah.

1017
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:18,230
And I would recommend to…

1018
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:22,370
If you're around there, or if you want to go do a bar hop of that area,

1019
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:23,790
I send you guys a picture of this.

1020
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:26,670
Go to the top of the Fairfield Resort.

1021
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:27,850
Is there a bar?

1022
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:28,290
No.

1023
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:29,830
Are you allowed to be in there?

1024
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:30,270
No.

1025
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:31,610
Will anyone stop you?

1026
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:31,950
No.

1027
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:33,450
But it's motel style.

1028
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:36,130
One thing that was disturbing about this entire trip was realizing

1029
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:40,810
how easy it was to just be a guy on the street on Harbor Boulevard,

1030
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:45,810
and then within 20 steps be just knocking on a family's door if you wanted to.

1031
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:46,430
Oh, yeah, sure.

1032
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:47,770
And just open the door.

1033
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:50,090
Hello, it's me from the street.

1034
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:50,750
Yeah.

1035
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:51,370
Sure.

1036
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:52,710
We didn't do any of that.

1037
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:53,670
Here's what I'm saying.

1038
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:55,470
Go to the top of the Fairfield.

1039
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:57,710
It's the one with a Panera in the parking lot.

1040
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:01,590
And when you're at the top, look down and you will get a special treat.

1041
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:03,590
I don't know if I should spoil the treat.

1042
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:05,730
Skip ahead if you don't want to hear what the treat is.

1043
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:07,450
You can also see this on Google Maps.

1044
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:12,930
If you look down from above, you can see the worst drawn Mickey Mouse

1045
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,350
you've ever seen in your life.

1046
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:15,830
Fainted on top of whatever.

1047
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:16,770
It looks like whatever.

1048
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:17,170
They're like Lobby Top or Helipad.

1049
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:20,090
Part of me thinks we should put this on a shirt.

1050
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:23,290
This weird grotesque Mickey.

1051
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:23,850
Grotesque Mickey, yeah.

1052
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:24,710
Yeah, yeah.

1053
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,670
That's as deep of a reference as you could.

1054
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:29,990
And I think it's off enough that they couldn't have a problem with it.

1055
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:30,430
Yeah.

1056
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,920
His ears are so floppy that he's almost becoming a mule.

1057
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:36,510
Yeah, it's Mickey Mule.

1058
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:39,590
Mickey went to Pleasure Island.

1059
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:40,930
Oh, this is, yeah, yeah.

1060
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:43,990
And he's smoking and drank and he's turning into like a donkey or a mule.

1061
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:45,950
Yeah, this is Mickey a couple cigars in.

1062
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:46,410
Yeah.

1063
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:47,890
What's happening to me?

1064
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:52,370
To the salt mines with me, I guess.

1065
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:54,710
Sorry, I had one sip of beer.

1066
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:57,170
I thought it'd be okay because it was all foam.

1067
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:03,730
Being convinced by Clint Eastwood to just, you know, drive across border a few times.

1068
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:05,310
Oh, I see.

1069
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:06,750
Oh, the mule.

1070
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:07,970
Have some threesome.

1071
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:10,610
Have some 80 rough threesome, you know?

1072
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:15,350
I also, our findings from this night, we got there too late to like actually hang there,

1073
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:21,430
but here's my big recommendation is the Westin, which is on the corner of Disneyland Drive and

1074
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:22,290
Nutella.

1075
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:29,030
It's like such a straight shot view of Incredicoaster and Mickey's Fun Wheel.

1076
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:33,790
So you time it, you get it up there when World of Color is in progress and then you're getting

1077
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:37,290
your Mickey's Fun Wheel trip light show.

1078
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:42,950
And it seemed superior in general, much better eyelines than Parkestry,

1079
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:51,050
which is the bar at the top of the JW Marriott, which connects, not good sight lines, but

1080
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:57,050
it does have an exclusive door to Garden Walk, the most confusing mall in the world.

1081
00:48:57,870 --> 00:48:59,710
So it just depends on what you're after.

1082
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:07,450
If you want Anaheim, if you want proximity to Garden Walk and their restaurant Huckleberries,

1083
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:11,790
which is a full ripoff of the vibe of Knott's Berry Farm.

1084
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:15,890
It's clearly Garden Walk trying to tap into different berries.

1085
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:20,870
Suddenly, I got to say, after this night, I'm maybe coming around on Harbor Hoedown.

1086
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:21,390
Yeah?

1087
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:27,550
It was, there's something truly perverse and fascinating about an all Harbor night.

1088
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:28,670
That's interesting.

1089
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:32,150
And the only Tony Romas in the state remaining around there.

1090
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:34,650
We got to act fast then.

1091
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:40,650
Well, this is reversed from City Walks on because it's the fewest episode.

1092
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:42,610
Like it's one and a half episodes.

1093
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:43,470
Is it?

1094
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:45,190
Well, all right.

1095
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:46,330
Sorry, Mike.

1096
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:47,470
Mike's back.

1097
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:49,930
The pump of smoke is gone and now he's furious.

1098
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:51,710
Vain is back to first.

1099
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:53,670
Was the old Fuddruckers on Harbor?

1100
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:54,550
No, it wasn't.

1101
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:56,450
They closed on in Anaheim as well.

1102
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:57,910
There's only a couple of Fuddruckers left.

1103
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:01,150
There's some videos now people doing like deep dives on what happened

1104
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:03,130
to chain restaurants on YouTube that I've been watching.

1105
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:03,990
I watched so many of these.

1106
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:07,730
But yeah, this sounds very interesting.

1107
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,190
A Garden Walk, I just, how much stuff is,

1108
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:12,750
is there a lot of empty space at Garden Walk or is?

1109
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:16,250
Um, it's all, it used to be, that used to be the case.

1110
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:18,070
And if you don't know, by the way, this is a park,

1111
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:20,210
this is a mall that's not next to Disneyland.

1112
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:25,090
It's like inconveniently several long city blocks away.

1113
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:28,490
And we've always theorized this is a mall that Disney is trying to run

1114
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:31,290
into the ground so that they can buy the property.

1115
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:35,210
And it's, you know, somewhat mission accomplished because all the spaces

1116
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:37,990
are filled by something, but by like weird things.

1117
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:43,770
Like there's just like, here's a half of the mall space or half of the store

1118
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:48,370
space is filled by arcade games and they aren't good arcade games.

1119
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:50,130
They're like 20 year old arcade games.

1120
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:53,090
And how do they justify this as something you might want to walk into?

1121
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,030
I don't know, call it K-pop games.

1122
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:58,930
No other reflection of K-pop culture at all.

1123
00:50:59,270 --> 00:50:59,630
I don't know.

1124
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:01,050
I saw that word trending.

1125
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:04,790
I think put it on there and I saw that word trending five years ago.

1126
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:10,670
It'll get a couple more quarters into our resting T3 machine.

1127
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,230
That's not even factored in.

1128
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:17,390
There's the whole big environmental impact plan that came out for the

1129
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:19,890
Disneyland Forward project in Anaheim.

1130
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:23,850
And they're still like, I wonder if they're even thinking about Garden Walk at this point.

1131
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:27,510
There was a long thread about Disneyland Forward going around.

1132
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:30,270
I think based on that environmental impact.

1133
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:31,050
Yeah, for sure.

1134
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:34,730
I mean, there's a lot of maps and stuff and like you can see what they're maybe planning.

1135
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:38,730
But I was wondering about Garden Walk is like, is truly the plan is to completely

1136
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:42,470
choke it out until it's, please take it off our hands, Disney.

1137
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:46,110
Because it doesn't seem like that's even part of the 30 year plan.

1138
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:46,470
Poor House of Blues.

1139
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:49,010
Just getting shuttled around in Anaheim.

1140
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:50,050
Poor House of Blues indeed.

1141
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:55,330
Although we also, we're talking, we viewed it as like a power move that they said like,

1142
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:57,090
we don't need you, Disney.

1143
00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:02,030
We can pack this, we'll get an old movie theater, make it a House of Blues.

1144
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:06,430
And it was jam packed, which made the parking college an absolute nightmare.

1145
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:06,830
Sure.

1146
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,450
I'm not pro them selling it to Disney.

1147
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:10,070
I'm just saying.

1148
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:16,370
And then there is, who knows how far along it is, but is it OC Vibe is the one that's

1149
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:18,330
supposed to come along by Angel Stadium?

1150
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:21,110
OC Vibe where the I is an exclamation point.

1151
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:21,590
Yes.

1152
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:26,690
And there is like a theme dinner, like somebody who used to work for Disney and Universal is

1153
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:31,550
like, I think in charge of whatever they say now, experiences or whatever.

1154
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:35,290
I see them on Twitter every now and then posting interesting stuff.

1155
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:35,930
I mean, this is good.

1156
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:39,950
This could be the next LA Live, a bad mall that we don't ever go near.

1157
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:45,590
I mean, if we, if we're already not going to LA Live, even though it's 20 minutes from

1158
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:51,350
where we live, surely we'll be soon not going to OC Vibe, which is an hour and 20 away from

1159
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:51,510
where we live.

1160
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:54,730
Is Shaq's restaurant down there is one of his restaurants?

1161
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:55,230
Oh, maybe.

1162
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:56,590
I wanted to try that.

1163
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:56,970
Yes.

1164
00:52:57,130 --> 00:53:00,210
The Shaq sit down restaurant is really good.

1165
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:01,950
It's like a barbecue restaurant.

1166
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:05,150
The Shaq fast food restaurant sucks ass.

1167
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:06,510
The one in Glendale.

1168
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:07,090
Yes.

1169
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:07,790
Oh, I see.

1170
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:08,670
That is bad news.

1171
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:11,930
But the barbecue one's good, may have closed.

1172
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:12,410
I'm not sure.

1173
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:13,510
Might have been a pandemic close.

1174
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:13,730
Kind of.

1175
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:15,030
There's a yard house down there.

1176
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:20,290
Not usually number one on the priority list when you're dating a vegetarian, the barbecue

1177
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:20,550
place.

1178
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:23,230
So the workplace have Impossible Meat nowadays.

1179
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:24,050
That's true.

1180
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:24,410
Yeah.

1181
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:24,750
That's true.

1182
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:25,150
So.

1183
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:27,930
But sometimes that is disgusting.

1184
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:28,950
Occasionally.

1185
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:30,710
Sometimes cooked really well.

1186
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:32,310
I think I'm done eating Impossible Meat.

1187
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:32,930
I think so.

1188
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:33,130
How are you?

1189
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:33,770
I understand.

1190
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:36,750
I don't like Beyond Meat because I always get a stomach ache.

1191
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:39,150
And then I was eating Impossible Meat and I can handle that.

1192
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:43,090
But then I started looking at the ingredients and I was like, I'll just eat some vegetables.

1193
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:44,010
Like what?

1194
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:44,530
Like.

1195
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:44,850
Yes.

1196
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:45,310
Yes.

1197
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:48,910
There's a barbecue place in Burbank that cooks it really well.

1198
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:49,370
Yeah.

1199
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:51,770
I'll just have some like chickpeas and vegetables.

1200
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:52,530
I don't know.

1201
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:55,610
There's just too many ingredients and it bleeds.

1202
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:58,430
And I was all, maybe I'm crazy.

1203
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:01,710
Maybe somebody will tell me I'm wrong, but I was just like, why is it bleed?

1204
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:02,570
It shouldn't bleed.

1205
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:03,510
I don't know.

1206
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:04,430
It might trick your brain.

1207
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:05,570
I've been drinking these.

1208
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:08,190
It does trick my brain, but I was just like, there was something about it where I was just

1209
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:09,490
like, I'll just eat some vegetables.

1210
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:10,470
Maybe.

1211
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:10,770
Yeah.

1212
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:11,510
Maybe I'm wrong.

1213
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:12,610
Somebody tell me I'm wrong.

1214
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:14,950
I've been drinking these non-alcoholic beers.

1215
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:16,610
Athletic Brewing makes.

1216
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:17,810
They're really good.

1217
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:21,170
It's the ones John Moxley was plugging to get free cases.

1218
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:21,530
So.

1219
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:21,970
Oh, okay.

1220
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:23,370
I, I don't know.

1221
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:24,390
Who's John Moxley?

1222
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:25,370
Professional wrestler.

1223
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:26,490
Professional wrestler.

1224
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:27,590
Yes, I should assume.

1225
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:28,150
Multi-time world champion.

1226
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:30,090
But if I don't follow wrestling, I don't know who it is.

1227
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:30,270
I don't know.

1228
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:31,510
I thought maybe you had seen him.

1229
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,770
He used to wrestle under the name Dean Ambrose.

1230
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,390
He's kind of a squirrely guy.

1231
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:39,970
When he was Dean Ambrose, he was squirrely.

1232
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:40,650
Now he's scary.

1233
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:44,270
We're going to clip this and we're going to tag him and he's going to hear what you just said.

1234
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:48,310
I don't think, well, that wasn't, he wasn't fully in charge of that character.

1235
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:50,210
John Moxley is terrifying.

1236
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:53,470
He's just beating people up and bleeding all the time.

1237
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,770
He got a bunch of skewers stuck in his head in Wembley Stadium.

1238
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:56,650
He loves it.

1239
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:57,350
He loves it.

1240
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:57,930
He loves for it.

1241
00:54:57,950 --> 00:54:58,450
He loves skewers.

1242
00:54:58,450 --> 00:54:59,150
He's an artist.

1243
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:00,190
Loves brain skewers.

1244
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:00,850
Guy's an artist.

1245
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:02,070
Shaquille's is closed.

1246
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:02,850
There's no Shaquille's.

1247
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:04,910
Don't go to LA Live.

1248
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:10,090
Should we, we've not discussed if we should go to the Shaquille Halloween event in Long Beach.

1249
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:11,850
I emailed them a press.

1250
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:14,710
I said there's a press day or something, but I've yet to receive a response.

1251
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:15,510
What is it called?

1252
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:16,530
Shaqtoberfest?

1253
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:17,650
Shaqtoberfest.

1254
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:18,670
At the Queen Mary.

1255
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:23,870
or at least next, early next year too.

1256
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:25,430
Shaq is everywhere with the, yeah.

1257
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:26,530
What Shaq stuff is coming?

1258
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:28,110
Well, I can't say, I can't say right now.

1259
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:29,130
You can't say?

1260
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:29,430
Yeah.

1261
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:30,490
There's Shaq rumors.

1262
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:31,290
We can't talk about?

1263
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:31,850
There's Shaq stuff.

1264
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:34,250
There's just a lot of, I just, for some reason, the last month,

1265
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:35,410
Shaq and all of the-

1266
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:38,470
Mike has signed a Shaq-based NDA.

1267
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:40,350
A Shaq DA.

1268
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:47,830
There's a street date when his review can come out for Shaq's new like financial services company.

1269
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:54,910
And I would, to put it back into theme park terms,

1270
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:58,370
we want, if we want, if we need sponsorship to get big rides happening,

1271
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:00,530
a general ride.

1272
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:06,010
Oh my, yeah.

1273
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,570
That could be the most product placement ride ever made.

1274
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:09,470
I'd be thrilled.

1275
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:11,410
It is time for a revival.

1276
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:14,850
I mean, Shaq and the general, not that they ever went away, but it's like,

1277
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:17,170
okay, it's time to do the full court press, guys.

1278
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:18,410
It's time to re-build them.

1279
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:19,590
We haven't had enough.

1280
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:20,770
We haven't had enough.

1281
00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:27,810
Okay, so where were we?

1282
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:32,090
France, Orbitron, Discoveryland, pretty successful.

1283
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:37,490
I think, I feel like for all of the faults of how Disneyland Paris went over when it opened,

1284
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:42,650
I think architecturally, vibe-wise, it made a lot of imagineers think this is it.

1285
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:45,350
We need versions of this in the park.

1286
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:47,150
So Tomorrowland 94 happens.

1287
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:54,330
It's not quite that, but it's this different, it's this more Buck Rogers 30s way of doing

1288
00:56:54,330 --> 00:57:02,190
that never was, which I always like for its color and its neon and all of the things that

1289
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:05,190
the Disney World Astro Orbiter has.

1290
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:08,230
And then we get to Tomorrowland 98.

1291
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:18,630
This is where they just literally say, let's put Discoveryland in, but in a facade way.

1292
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:21,070
We will paint everything that's their gold.

1293
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:27,230
And as part of that, the Astro Orbiter will, we're going to take that Orbitron,

1294
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:33,710
literally the exact same design, put that in Tomorrowland and not just in Tomorrowland,

1295
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:35,790
but in the front of Tomorrowland.

1296
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:40,610
Big rocks jutting out as part of this display as well.

1297
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:44,570
Something that felt a lot like something Paris did and would have done.

1298
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:50,310
But as mainly Astro Orbiter comes down, it's no longer up on its perch.

1299
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:53,910
It's at the front of the park, which I think we can all agree,

1300
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:58,250
a successful move that added to the kinetic energy of the hub.

1301
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:00,450
No one likes this.

1302
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:01,870
This is one of these.

1303
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:05,150
If you started this episode, you must have known this is where it's going.

1304
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:09,470
We will pick apart various other things about Tomorrowland and Tomorrowland areas,

1305
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:13,050
but this is a chance to just fully discuss this, tackle this.

1306
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:13,850
What is this?

1307
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:14,790
Why did this happen?

1308
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:22,170
Well, the thing that I came across a couple places is that they fully were prepared to put

1309
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:24,510
the Orbitron up top.

1310
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:25,290
Yeah, yeah, I read that.

1311
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:26,970
And it was too heavy.

1312
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:35,010
Too heavy, because it's big and bulbous and all of its accompanying set pieces didn't all fit,

1313
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:40,370
which feels strange because there's something like that at Disney World up on top of that tower.

1314
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:42,570
Yeah, I guess it's more reinforced.

1315
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:49,510
But then the other thing I saw, that kinetic sculpture, which is called the Observatron,

1316
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:52,570
the Orbitron is not the Observatron.

1317
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:54,330
The Orbitron is not the Observatron.

1318
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:58,170
No, that is mostly the guts of the StarJet.

1319
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:00,250
No, no, no, wait.

1320
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:01,410
Sorry, the RocketJets.

1321
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:02,330
RocketJets.

1322
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:03,210
Oh, see?

1323
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:06,110
RocketJets are not StarJets.

1324
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:08,370
Orbitron is not made of StarJets.

1325
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:09,430
It's made of RocketJets.

1326
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:14,870
Yeah, so this is, they took off the rockets, they sold the rockets at auction,

1327
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:18,350
and they put these fakie satellite dishes on.

1328
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:22,830
But still had a spinning mechanism with arms, just the guts.

1329
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:25,030
And it would come alive and play music.

1330
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:27,010
Now, I saw this.

1331
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:28,690
It did used to do this.

1332
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:29,350
They did it.

1333
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:30,050
I saw it.

1334
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:30,850
This was done.

1335
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:33,090
But it was unreliable.

1336
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:36,870
Somehow running it every few minutes was okay,

1337
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:41,370
but running it every 15 minutes made it freak the hell out.

1338
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:42,630
Strange.

1339
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:44,310
Not regular enough, I guess.

1340
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:48,750
We end up in this bizarre world of there's an Astro Orbiter

1341
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:50,730
up at the front of Tomorrowland,

1342
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:53,330
and then the guts of it still are up on that platform,

1343
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:55,250
but just doing a little show.

1344
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:58,750
Sometimes, sometimes, what is the show even?

1345
00:59:59,050 --> 00:59:59,950
Satellite spin array.

1346
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:03,830
It was meant to convey that we're going to communicate with the stars.

1347
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:06,710
It's like almost, sure, it's designed,

1348
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:12,470
but it's also kind of a makeshift ET contact weird kind of,

1349
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:14,070
and like a light will shoot up.

1350
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:17,810
And it's where we're talking to aliens, I guess.

1351
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:19,790
It was certainly unique the first time I saw it.

1352
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:21,130
It scared the hell out of me.

1353
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:22,850
Didn't know it was coming.

1354
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:24,570
Wasn't sure what was happening.

1355
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:26,590
You thought you were being invaded?

1356
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:28,430
I think I was just walking around the land,

1357
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:31,290
and suddenly stuff was moving and there was music.

1358
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:35,590
Just walking with a hand with you had retrieved hot dogs and sodas

1359
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:36,870
for your entire family.

1360
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:38,450
Jason, you mind getting those?

1361
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:41,850
And I was bouncing them back and forth.

1362
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:51,370
I think this was the only other place that had the room to put it here

1363
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:54,930
without using like, or without demolishing something.

1364
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:59,650
There's no other big, there's not a plot of land open in.

1365
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:04,290
And it's the, well, then you start going, well, why did they do it at all?

1366
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:08,190
And is that, is part of that that like, it becomes clear,

1367
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:10,310
Tomorrowland 98 is gonna be all clones.

1368
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:14,470
We're gonna move just exactly, honey, I shrunk the audience,

1369
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:17,470
the same movie from Epcot into that theater.

1370
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:20,490
InnoVentions, which is new, but cheapo.

1371
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:24,030
It's all just kind of, we'll put a fin on that building.

1372
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:26,650
Racing stripes, I feel, look pretty sharp.

1373
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:30,920
And then this, which is just, the fact that they

1374
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,520
could have put it up on top if they just redesigned it,

1375
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,820
but they didn't redesign it.

1376
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:39,240
It is exactly the specifications of Paris,

1377
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:41,220
where it was rapturously received.

1378
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,420
What a wonderful sculpture they have here.

1379
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,840
So why would that not, so they jam it into the front

1380
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:51,860
and that justification always felt so flimsy into the kinetic energy.

1381
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:52,900
What is that?

1382
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,900
You know what that's like for real when there's a, when it's cool,

1383
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:59,620
when there's a bunch of Disneyland vehicles going by.

1384
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:01,080
This isn't a good version of that.

1385
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:04,880
I would say that it makes more sense, even though I don't think,

1386
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:09,220
it makes more sense as a decision if you didn't have a people mover or a rocket rod,

1387
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:14,240
but the rocket rods opened and the idea was still to have the rocket rods going.

1388
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:19,200
You got other types of rockets and no rocket rods are not rocket jets.

1389
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,940
And it's not rocket to the moon, which is not flight to the moon.

1390
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,640
So you do have movement that's coming pretty close to that entrance

1391
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,160
and you can see in there and oh, there's things moving around.

1392
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:33,640
So if there was nothing else, maybe you could say that this made more sense.

1393
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:39,220
But it's not that they didn't know rocket rods was going to fail and destroy the track.

1394
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,740
That it would either be, they'd be deserted tracks.

1395
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:43,740
All those opposite of kinetic energy.

1396
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:49,600
Any elevated platform they built before 1990 apparently is just flimsy as hell and can't

1397
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,280
support much.

1398
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:52,780
Disney did not know how to build elevated platforms.

1399
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:53,560
Yeah.

1400
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,200
So yeah, I guess.

1401
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,800
They can send me on a rocket to the moon, but they can't build a platform.

1402
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,480
That holds rockets to the moon.

1403
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:01,080
Unbelievable.

1404
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:02,880
Yeah.

1405
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:07,520
So I guess that all combined, I guess like they really wanted to get this in here.

1406
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:10,180
I mean, I guess my preference would be just don't put it here.

1407
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,100
Just get rid of it.

1408
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:11,960
I guess if you can't.

1409
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:17,220
I feel like ever since we've all been holding on for when they will knock it out.

1410
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:18,860
This has to go.

1411
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,060
It is going to happen.

1412
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,980
It's just a matter of when do we get this tomorrow and budget.

1413
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:27,640
When Apple buys Disney, then maybe it will be removed.

1414
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:28,300
Yes.

1415
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:32,440
And you put it up on top and you turn all of the orbs into big apples.

1416
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:33,320
That's right.

1417
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:38,520
And it's a representation of how Tim Cook gets his ideas.

1418
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,360
This is what's happening.

1419
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:41,260
Yeah, that's true.

1420
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:41,680
It's Tim Cook's brain.

1421
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,060
Ideas swirling around a big apple.

1422
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,740
I think he's one of those maniacs who's like, I wake up at 5 a.

1423
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:47,860
m.

1424
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:48,460
every day.

1425
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:49,400
I wake up at 4.

1426
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,020
30 a.

1427
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:50,100
m.

1428
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,540
That's also, I think somebody-

1429
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:57,280
This seems to be your particular version to, I either wakes up at 4, Tim Cook wakes up at 5.

1430
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,940
I find it troubling.

1431
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,800
I don't think it's good for the circadian rhythm.

1432
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:04,140
You would find it troubling if they said they woke up at 9.

1433
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:06,940
Jason, don't ever have children.

1434
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:08,320
I recognize it's begrudging.

1435
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,060
You see these disgusting CEOs getting up before 9 a.

1436
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:13,320
m.

1437
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:15,560
Jason's not opposed to rise and grinding.

1438
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:17,860
Just the grinding starts at 11.

1439
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:18,340
45.

1440
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:18,960
Yeah, yeah.

1441
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:20,220
I think that-

1442
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:22,540
The sun is casting a shadow.

1443
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,960
I think though that some of these people are lying.

1444
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:27,700
I think a lot of CEOs are lying.

1445
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:32,040
I think that there's some person that tells them, like the CEO whisperer,

1446
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:36,220
that tells them the right lie to talk about how much they're working.

1447
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:40,820
It's a defense mechanism against people that think they make too much money.

1448
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,980
You see with actors too, they have these insane schedules up at 4 a.

1449
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:46,120
m.

1450
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:47,580
and the rock is up at 4 a.

1451
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:47,740
m.

1452
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:48,620
and he carbo-

1453
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:52,240
Well, at least he can back it up by pointing at his muscles.

1454
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:53,100
Well, that's true.

1455
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:56,820
That's true.

1456
01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:58,800
But Tim Cook or Eiger?

1457
01:04:59,220 --> 01:04:59,960
Stay Prayed Up.

1458
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,320
Are you following him on Instagram?

1459
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,500
I'll check in here.

1460
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:04,700
I'm a fan of the entire-

1461
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,220
I love when he says, stay prayed up.

1462
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:10,780
All the spokes on the wheel of the Wahlberg of F45 and-

1463
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:12,940
Mike, are you getting alerts from the Bible app?

1464
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,800
Not yet, but I will soon.

1465
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,080
What's the Bible app called?

1466
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,020
Oh, I don't know.

1467
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:18,700
I forget.

1468
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:20,560
But I love-

1469
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:21,500
I don't remember it.

1470
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:25,200
He posts nonstop on Instagram and it is fascinating.

1471
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,660
He forces his children to be young entrepreneurs too.

1472
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:29,720
So you can follow them.

1473
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:30,460
They're like a card.

1474
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:31,900
They have like a card business.

1475
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:36,200
He's trying to build a big movie studio in Vegas.

1476
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:37,320
Yes.

1477
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:42,840
Trying to build a Hollywood in the desert, which very much seems like the reverse of like

1478
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:47,000
Nickelodeon Studios, Universal Studios in Monsoon covered Florida.

1479
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,360
We have just the blinding sun and heat of the desert.

1480
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,280
So I guess sound stages.

1481
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:58,260
There's something stronger than the elements and that's wokeness.

1482
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:04,180
If you can get away from that by leaving Los Angeles, you can endure any weather conditions.

1483
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,280
Halo is the app.

1484
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,980
Halo be thy name.

1485
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:10,460
Okay.

1486
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:15,720
I referred earlier to this.

1487
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:19,200
I realize it might be a big objection I have to this placement of this.

1488
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:23,420
The former rocket jets, the ones in Florida,

1489
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:28,600
there's that main drag that a lot of Tomorrowlands have.

1490
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:34,300
Sometimes up way high towards the end of it are the rocket jets, Astro Orbit or whatever,

1491
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,840
and it is the weenie.

1492
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,740
It's the thing bringing you into the land.

1493
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:42,620
By putting it in the front, it's an inverse weenie.

1494
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,460
It's an inverted weenie.

1495
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:48,940
This is something no one wants.

1496
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:53,700
An abomination that is literally blocking you from coming into the land.

1497
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:56,240
It's almost like it's telling you stop here.

1498
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:56,840
This is as good as it gets.

1499
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:00,180
It's crazy and stressful and we got nothing going on back here.

1500
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:02,340
Only come back if you want space.

1501
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:03,260
We know you like Spaceman.

1502
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:04,700
We know you'll end up here.

1503
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:05,980
You'll have to.

1504
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:09,040
But anything else, you might want to back up.

1505
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:09,600
Yes.

1506
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:14,680
There was a lot of problems with Tomorrowland 98, number one being money.

1507
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:20,100
I wonder if this was just like, I guess, got to go somewhere.

1508
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:24,660
All of the decisions in Tomorrowland 98 feel like, ugh.

1509
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:26,960
We got to put a ride in here.

1510
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,680
We have this ride designed.

1511
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:30,660
All we got to do is build it again.

1512
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,860
It was just like, well, maybe this will be an interesting…

1513
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:36,340
This will just draw people toward Tomorrowland.

1514
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,860
And it sounded interesting.

1515
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,900
And the concept art looked interesting.

1516
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:43,580
I don't think I would have hated it just in concept.

1517
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:44,040
No.

1518
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:48,720
I don't hate it, but I wouldn't have been like, bad move, big mistake here.

1519
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:51,660
I would have been like, oh, yeah, that's interesting in the front of Tomorrowland.

1520
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:52,180
Okay.

1521
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:55,560
It's almost like there's the castle and then there's a big ride here.

1522
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,840
And it's kind of not what happens at Frontierland or Adventureland

1523
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:02,300
where it's like the mystery lies past the entrances.

1524
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:03,280
It makes it uneven.

1525
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:06,160
It doesn't match the others, essentially.

1526
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,000
But I feel like almost…

1527
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:11,700
Imagine the reverse, okay?

1528
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:16,900
Rockets just say up top, they put a kinetic sculpture at the entrance.

1529
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:22,480
Now, that's probably difficult because of the audio soundscape of Mainz.

1530
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,380
There's just so much going on.

1531
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:28,400
You probably can't blast like Twinkle-ing, you know,

1532
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:32,200
from the Earth to the Moon soundtrack from Paris or whatever.

1533
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,880
But imagine if the Starjets had just stayed up top

1534
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,320
and they just painted them golden bronze.

1535
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:41,340
I mean, Rocketjets, but sure.

1536
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:42,680
Rocketjets, fuck.

1537
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,240
It's gonna bother me.

1538
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,200
I don't want to fuck it up.

1539
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:49,100
We need a swear jar in the middle.

1540
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:53,900
Every time that we get one of the minute name differences wrong.

1541
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:55,860
I also focused on the orbitron.

1542
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:57,160
It's not the observatron.

1543
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,300
I'm forgetting about the Rocketjets.

1544
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:02,020
And if you could say Rocketjets in Rocket Raccoon's voice from now on also.

1545
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,380
It's the Rocketjets.

1546
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,520
Take the gantry lift.

1547
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,540
Take the gantry lift to the Rocketjets.

1548
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,100
Which ate the Astrojets.

1549
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:12,640
Wow, you can see Neon Mickey really good from up here.

1550
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:19,900
Well, I would say just what they should have is a sign that says Tomorrowland.

1551
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:23,740
And then the good stuff comes when you go into the land.

1552
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:28,020
I mean, they put up a couple of those in the last five or six years or so.

1553
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,020
Well, they got rid of those big rocks.

1554
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:30,840
Yeah.

1555
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:32,560
Now, I'm gonna bring this up.

1556
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:38,460
And I don't want to be sacrilegious as we discuss Wahlberg and Hallow.

1557
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:43,300
I don't want to say anything against who we believe in the most.

1558
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:48,200
But I feel like this has always been pegged as a Tony Baxter problem.

1559
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:48,760
I'm sorry.

1560
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:49,140
I'm sorry.

1561
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:49,740
I said it.

1562
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:52,000
I don't want to say anything rude to this man.

1563
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:56,060
At least in my head, am I crazy?

1564
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:59,760
I feel like I've thought this whole thing of it being up front.

1565
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,400
And the rocks being there.

1566
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:05,740
And because he really liked that orbitron in Paris, that this is somehow,

1567
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:08,700
in my head, it's always been his fault somehow.

1568
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,120
But is this false?

1569
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:12,020
Is this internet fan theory?

1570
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,520
And do you put this on the pile with probably Eisner Golfer?

1571
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:19,120
And I still think probably Space Mountain fans.

1572
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,700
Well, I've heard him talk about it.

1573
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:21,840
Is that why we know this?

1574
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:24,940
Yeah, because he was in charge of Disneyland Paris.

1575
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:25,980
So much of it was him.

1576
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,420
And he's the Jules Verne guy.

1577
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:33,160
Because that all came from Discovery Bay, his long ago proposed expansion for Disney.

1578
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,900
He has like a Jules Verne time machine in his house.

1579
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:37,460
I've seen the video of it.

1580
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:39,700
So he's a big Jules Verne guy.

1581
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,640
So I've heard him talk about Tomorrowland 98.

1582
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:45,940
And he said basically, he acknowledges,

1583
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:48,300
I don't know that he acknowledges the placement here is wrong.

1584
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:51,940
But he says that they didn't have a lot of money to do this.

1585
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:56,500
And in hindsight, he thought that they were doing the best they could with the money.

1586
01:10:57,140 --> 01:11:01,240
I think he said the point, the guests don't know the budget ultimately.

1587
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:04,040
So it's like they're not taking that into account.

1588
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:07,000
And I think he thinks of this as sort of a failure.

1589
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:10,800
And I don't know that it's completely, obviously not his fault that there wasn't enough money.

1590
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:13,580
But what about this thing?

1591
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:14,740
Do you think that-

1592
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:16,200
This specific placement you're saying is his fault.

1593
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:20,560
Yeah, and I saw comments saying that people were going a bit over.

1594
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,860
But this is message board stuff, so you can't trust this.

1595
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,340
But I saw people saying this is there because of ego.

1596
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:31,080
He wanted his precious orbitron in the park come hell or high water.

1597
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,360
And it's interesting question.

1598
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,080
Oh, you can't it's too heavy to put up on top of the platform.

1599
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:36,060
I don't care.

1600
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,040
Put it anywhere it takes.

1601
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:39,260
It must be there.

1602
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:42,680
I don't know if I believe this sounds like the kind of when people are like

1603
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:46,200
broadcasting theories about showrunners on shows and like, well, you

1604
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,780
and then you talk to somebody who was actually in the room and like,

1605
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:49,920
oh, that is all made up.

1606
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:50,920
That's all a bunch of shit.

1607
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,960
Yeah, it definitely sounds like narrative writing.

1608
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:58,100
I think the legitimate narrative is like budgets failing and falling apart

1609
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:03,380
and necessity being the mother of the bench and we have to do something.

1610
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:13,560
And I think that kind of overshadowed actual guest behavior of like,

1611
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:17,940
well, this line is going to be really long and people are still going to wait in it,

1612
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,400
but it might be unpleasant.

1613
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:24,460
And also this long strip behind it is going to become stroller parking.

1614
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:25,460
Yeah, yeah.

1615
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:26,880
Yeah, nobody thought about that.

1616
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:27,260
Yeah.

1617
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:27,740
Yeah.

1618
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,060
Well, I mean, if we can ever talk to him again, let's ask him.

1619
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,360
Was it your ego that put this shitty?

1620
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,740
Let's talk about your ego.

1621
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:38,560
Yeah, we'll talk about his ego for a while.

1622
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:43,780
I want to see if we can get if he because he said there was supposed to be a sponsor on

1623
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:45,520
rocket rides and drop down.

1624
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:45,740
Rocket rides?

1625
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:46,620
Rocket rides.

1626
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:47,040
Yeah.

1627
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:48,260
Did you call it rocket rides?

1628
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:49,340
I think I did.

1629
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:51,460
Well, that's the topic today.

1630
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:51,800
Yeah.

1631
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:52,440
I didn't focus.

1632
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:53,480
Quarter in the square jar.

1633
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:54,560
Quarter in the square jar.

1634
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:55,360
Rocket rides.

1635
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,620
Quarter in the jargon jar.

1636
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,240
I'm selling rocket rides.

1637
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:03,060
I think that sponsor was supposed to shoulder some of the financial burden.

1638
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:03,480
Sure.

1639
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:09,540
The late 90s Disney company kind of losing its footing in a lot of areas.

1640
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:14,760
So there was definitely some of that in the air, but it's like, I'm still so curious.

1641
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:20,300
Who ruined Tomorrowland with their pulling the budget?

1642
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:21,000
Chevy?

1643
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,760
Actually be blamed for this.

1644
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:23,320
Hummer?

1645
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:23,800
Don't know.

1646
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:25,960
There's Disneyland Paris, I think.

1647
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,280
That ultimately.

1648
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:29,640
That's what destroys the Disney Decade.

1649
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:30,580
That's what destroys.

1650
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:31,140
Yeah.

1651
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,140
Well, I hate to, I'm sorry.

1652
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,280
I'm going to bring this up.

1653
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:37,280
The ornate nature of Disneyland Paris.

1654
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:43,460
Was this not informed by the level of detail of Mr.

1655
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:43,940
Baxter?

1656
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:49,680
And him wanting to, for it to be the most elevated Disneyland park that there was.

1657
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:54,700
Now, of course, this is all approved by Eisner, who's chasing this European credibility that

1658
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:55,760
he never quite gets.

1659
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:00,300
I don't want to throw either of these men under the bus.

1660
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:01,320
Of course not.

1661
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:02,360
I'm whispering it.

1662
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,580
That's how much I don't want this to get out.

1663
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,200
Well, when you're involved in a company, you're not.

1664
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,480
It's not all home runs.

1665
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:13,340
I'm sure you can look at any Imagineer and maybe there's a few things that didn't work as well.

1666
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:15,080
You know, so.

1667
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,060
For every look at Katzenberg for every Shrek, there's a Quibi.

1668
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:19,340
Yeah, right.

1669
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:20,320
I mean, not for every Shrek.

1670
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:23,480
He made Shrek two and three and he didn't make that many.

1671
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:28,100
Maybe he probably didn't make a lot of upstart companies that didn't work.

1672
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:28,800
Yeah.

1673
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,020
So yeah, I mean, it's a good question.

1674
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,320
I don't know specifically.

1675
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:38,720
And it's so much of even as much as like a books, Imagineering books are out there.

1676
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:43,640
There's so much that's just not quite known and will maybe never be known.

1677
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:47,420
Because it's just not as documented as other stuff in Hollywood.

1678
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:48,120
Yeah.

1679
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:48,360
Yeah.

1680
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:53,840
Well, certainly not if the books are published by Walt Disney or Ipion Publishing.

1681
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:04,200
I think the expectations too with France, they should have just sent every citizen a free ticket.

1682
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:05,820
They should have sent it.

1683
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:07,500
Every citizen?

1684
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,620
Every citizen in France.

1685
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:10,840
There's not that many of them.

1686
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:13,400
Population of France.

1687
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:13,920
Look it up.

1688
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:14,480
Look it up.

1689
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:17,040
How much do you think there are in people in France?

1690
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:18,420
30 million?

1691
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:19,240
That's a lot.

1692
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:19,860
That's a lot.

1693
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:20,580
Yeah.

1694
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:22,820
And it's 67 million.

1695
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:23,440
Oh, okay.

1696
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:25,260
Still not that many under 100 million.

1697
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:26,420
Not that many.

1698
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:27,060
Not that many.

1699
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:27,420
Okay.

1700
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:28,300
Here's what I'm saying.

1701
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,080
67 million at what price?

1702
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:33,300
I had a heart attack if you said that to him.

1703
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:33,800
Let's even go down.

1704
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:35,840
Let's say 60 million.

1705
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:36,980
Here's what I'm saying.

1706
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:42,980
They were trying too hard to tailor an American product to French taste maybe.

1707
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:49,320
If they try the American way of like a fire sale, like come on in.

1708
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:56,300
I love the idea that the fix for Disneyland Paris was don't appeal to the French culture at all

1709
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:57,580
and then give them one free ticket.

1710
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,020
No, appeal to them but get them in the door.

1711
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:00,880
Oh, okay.

1712
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:03,680
So you do want them to like change the Haunted Mansion around.

1713
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:04,440
Don't change anything.

1714
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,920
I mean you say don't change anything.

1715
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:10,160
Because like they change Haunted Mansion and like Main Street is different because it was like

1716
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:11,960
the idea was like this isn't going to appeal to the French.

1717
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:17,280
I think aesthetically I think all of that is successful but you need to get butts in the seats.

1718
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,740
You need to get people through the turnstiles.

1719
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:20,700
Free ticket initiative.

1720
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,580
Let's say I marked this down a little bit.

1721
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:30,520
Let's say that it was 60 million in 92 and let's say that the tickets were 50

1722
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,660
dollars euros at the time.

1723
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:35,060
This is 3 billion dollars.

1724
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,760
They have now given away 3 billion dollars.

1725
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:42,520
So that's what they needed to do as a starting point was give away 3 billion dollars.

1726
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:48,040
Okay but how many in 2009, 2010 free ticket on your birthday.

1727
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:50,300
How many did they give away that year?

1728
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:51,740
Okay that's not a bad point.

1729
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:52,140
I see.

1730
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:53,640
Not a terrible point.

1731
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:58,380
But that's still that requires you to like know about you don't get it in the mail.

1732
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:01,400
You're not sent to that free thing.

1733
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:03,980
It's like the U2 album on your iPod.

1734
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:05,420
Something everyone loved.

1735
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:15,820
I would imagine they had to do some stuff like that just not as widespread as what you're saying.

1736
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,220
Okay how about smaller?

1737
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:21,160
Free school field trips for a few months.

1738
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:23,220
You get the kids.

1739
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:24,500
You hook them.

1740
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:25,960
That's not a bad idea.

1741
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:27,160
You get the chaperones.

1742
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:30,180
You get the teacher and they're like oh this is pretty nice.

1743
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:31,180
This is kind of good.

1744
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:32,740
We can't say anything about chaperones.

1745
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:34,260
We've done too many.

1746
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:35,340
Yeah there's too much.

1747
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:36,700
You're stuck with it.

1748
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:42,160
Yeah yeah I wonder if there was anything like that that happened.

1749
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:47,240
They're so worried about like outreach and stuff and they were worried about the

1750
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:53,100
reception to it so I do wonder maybe there's a story of what they tried to do in regards to that.

1751
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:56,300
It's a fresh baked baguette with Mickey ears.

1752
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:57,240
Maybe that's all they did.

1753
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:01,340
They just posted a picture of that baguette and they said come and eat.

1754
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,340
Oh they didn't even send them.

1755
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:03,200
Yeah they didn't send them.

1756
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:05,200
Yeah yeah they showed a picture of the baguette.

1757
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,900
Their mouths are water.

1758
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:08,140
We understand the French.

1759
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:08,940
They'll be.

1760
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,440
That's a question for Eisner or Tony.

1761
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:17,160
Now I want to look up because McDonald's has certainly tailored part of the menu

1762
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:19,000
to local tastes.

1763
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:20,400
I mean they have the classics.

1764
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:21,440
That's true.

1765
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,100
They do do that.

1766
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:26,180
I mean all the fast food changes a little bit depending on where they are in the country.

1767
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:28,300
But I think they did a bunch of weird fake.

1768
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:31,660
The French like it this way so we'll do it this way and then they

1769
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:34,880
ignore just like massive ones that they want to drink in the parks.

1770
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:35,980
That's true yeah.

1771
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:38,900
Yeah they just they over thought like you know.

1772
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:42,340
They like the sun so that's what but they also don't like the red.

1773
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:48,060
So we'll put these promenades here you see that and they're like booze give us booze.

1774
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:51,520
I've been I've said this before a couple times on the show I've been skeptical of like hearing

1775
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:55,880
Tony back to me like the French like scary and they like funny but they don't like scary

1776
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:56,620
and funny together.

1777
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:57,640
I'm like is that true?

1778
01:18:58,020 --> 01:18:58,200
Yes.

1779
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:58,920
Who said that?

1780
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:00,760
Yeah some of this is a bit.

1781
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:02,520
And is the Haunted Mansion that funny?

1782
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,960
Are you laughing like crazy on the Haunted Mansion?

1783
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:08,200
And then you laugh and you laugh.

1784
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:10,320
I am amused by the Haunted Mansion.

1785
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,600
Now the film of course.

1786
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:12,160
We're all still laughing.

1787
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:12,900
The film we're not talking about.

1788
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:13,640
Which one?

1789
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:17,400
It's hard to know even which but yeah so I was like I don't know.

1790
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:21,180
The masterful scene stealing of Hassan Minaj.

1791
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:24,840
Yeah of course we know all that but yes sometimes.

1792
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:26,900
Is he lying about those ghosts too?

1793
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,200
Don't know what to think anymore.

1794
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,220
It's hard to know.

1795
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:33,740
We'll ask Tony about that as well.

1796
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:39,460
What do you think about the Netflix special The King's Gesture and the factuality?

1797
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:42,720
I am sure like when I asked him if he ever like thinks about imagineering

1798
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:46,740
like a Seinfeld ride on TV and he was like very much I watch old movies.

1799
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:50,320
So he should definitely know like a recent stand up.

1800
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:50,900
Up to date.

1801
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:55,080
What you think of Nanette?

1802
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,760
Okay what have we missed?

1803
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:02,240
So I guess we've missed more complaining about this.

1804
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:02,800
Have we gone at all?

1805
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,240
It's just okay here we go.

1806
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:05,700
Something you were saying earlier.

1807
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:10,740
Something that I think makes or breaks a one of these orbiter type rides.

1808
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:15,060
Astro orbiter you know of course it's not up on a platform.

1809
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:17,420
So the view is lesser already.

1810
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,260
Can't see your car in the parking lot.

1811
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:23,580
But beyond that I watched ride crews of almost all of these.

1812
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:24,300
Oh yeah yeah.

1813
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:27,100
And it started to give me a sense of what you need.

1814
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:31,420
And I think it has to be not a claustrophobic spot.

1815
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,440
But also near enough to one thing.

1816
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:39,480
One landmark so that you feel like you got kind of close to that.

1817
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:43,800
Like that space mountain is so spectacular in Paris in Discoveryland.

1818
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:44,140
Right.

1819
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:47,180
So when you whip kind of right by it and especially at night.

1820
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:51,180
You know little neon swooshes looking really cool everywhere.

1821
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:56,420
And you maybe want to get even if it's distant you want to have a pretty good

1822
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:59,820
castle view an elevated castle view that you wouldn't otherwise have.

1823
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:06,160
I feel like Shanghai I felt I watched the ride through and like.

1824
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:09,480
Oh that's a pretty good way to see that castle which is a beautiful castle.

1825
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:13,520
The hub you would think well that's cool because you're in the famous Disneyland hub.

1826
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:16,200
The original park and there's the castle.

1827
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,460
But it still is very small.

1828
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:19,720
It's still pretty far away.

1829
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:23,940
You don't feel like you got it's maybe only cool if you got a double decker bus right there.

1830
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,820
Or if fireworks are going off.

1831
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:27,600
But basically it's neither here nor there.

1832
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,100
It's very tight so you don't get a grand vista.

1833
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,800
But you're also not close enough to anything cool.

1834
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:37,220
And this really is what I think kills Disneyland Astro or there.

1835
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:38,040
Yes.

1836
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,060
Yeah yeah you're losing in every category.

1837
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:40,600
Yeah.

1838
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:41,220
Essentially.

1839
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:48,600
Yes.

1840
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:52,880
Contemporary way back there in a night view of contemporary.

1841
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:53,440
Yeah.

1842
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:58,280
A stunning piece of 20th century American architecture.

1843
01:21:58,300 --> 01:21:58,560
Yes.

1844
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:02,680
And way off in the distance which you couldn't see from down below.

1845
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:04,220
So that's a cool thing there.

1846
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:05,200
Fireworks.

1847
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:08,140
You can time Florida like the people mover.

1848
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:13,300
Probably harder to do with the Astro Orbiter but you can time it in theory with fireworks.

1849
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:14,020
Yeah.

1850
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:14,420
Yeah.

1851
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:18,460
Yeah I think that's actually a good criteria for these being in the Disney parks.

1852
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:20,240
Is that you need at least one of those.

1853
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:26,940
You at least at least need height to see things that are cool and you can't see or you need

1854
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:33,200
being even cool and you can see like a close by ride or building or interesting thing.

1855
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:36,080
Height but proximity could give you points too.

1856
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:41,940
Which is like third I think.

1857
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:43,200
It's pretty far back there.

1858
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:45,080
But it is cool but it's not.

1859
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,320
It's more for the people looking at it than it is for the people riding it.

1860
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:48,580
Yeah.

1861
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:51,180
Let me bring up the area where you might have to give some points.

1862
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:56,400
And this area is innovation where we're doing things that are different than the other round

1863
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,920
and rockets in the other parks.

1864
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:02,680
And I think there's been innovation in the more recent Chinese parks.

1865
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:06,700
Hong Kong you've got it's called Orbiteron.

1866
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:08,080
We're back to Orbiteron there.

1867
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,860
Hong Kong you've got 14.

1868
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:25,380
They fit 14 in there and it's these bigger wider flying saucers and you get four per vehicle.

1869
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:28,460
So you're not stuck in a really boring line.

1870
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:33,000
Besides that there's not too much going on that's unique about it.

1871
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,480
But a flying saucer is kind of a neat thing.

1872
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:38,080
But you can get your whole family in that car maybe.

1873
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,560
Side by side in Hong Kong right?

1874
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:42,580
Side by side in Shanghai which is jet packs.

1875
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:43,900
Oh you mean that you yes.

1876
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:45,140
It's not but to crash.

1877
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:47,180
Somebody in front of you behind you.

1878
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:47,620
Yeah yeah.

1879
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:49,260
Yeah sure sure sure.

1880
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:52,300
Mike you should have taken one of your paramours.

1881
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:57,140
You should have written one of your ill-fated like.

1882
01:23:57,420 --> 01:24:00,200
He means paramour but that was a truly strange way of saying it.

1883
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:01,580
Oh yeah paramour.

1884
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:02,380
I fucked that up.

1885
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:02,960
You're talking about paramour?

1886
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,040
Paramours.

1887
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:05,040
No that's just an error.

1888
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:12,120
No I'm saying like you should have taken one of your you know the ones that got away

1889
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,320
when you were in Florida.

1890
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,480
You should have been like let's go ride Astro Orbit.

1891
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:16,260
Because it's like lap seating.

1892
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:17,040
Oh right right right.

1893
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:19,020
Because you kind of yeah you kind of.

1894
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,740
So you grind up against the bat yeah.

1895
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:21,840
Well it's like the Matterhorn.

1896
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:23,960
Scott has his Matterhorn story like this.

1897
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:24,760
Yeah.

1898
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:25,880
That's a brief one.

1899
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:26,360
I know.

1900
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:30,300
We get to be in a bumpy car with lap seating right next to your mom.

1901
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:31,140
That might have.

1902
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,840
What a grand date this will be.

1903
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:34,360
That might have solved all my problems.

1904
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:37,380
It's just taking a nice young lady on the Astro Orbit.

1905
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:37,800
Yeah.

1906
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:41,460
We're sort of coded referring to something that happened on club three.

1907
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:45,720
Where Mike told I want to say the most scandalous story in history.

1908
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:48,920
There were some people online that were like this fucking story.

1909
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:49,940
This is nothing.

1910
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:51,280
And I'm like you're not wrong.

1911
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:52,220
You're not wrong.

1912
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:53,920
But it wasn't inside your head.

1913
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:54,180
Right.

1914
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:55,780
Your head it bounced around.

1915
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:56,820
It bounced around.

1916
01:24:57,660 --> 01:25:00,820
Like the excellent sound quality at the Sphere soon to open.

1917
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:01,600
Yeah.

1918
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:02,820
The Sphere is a giant.

1919
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:07,620
It was magnified just as much as a you as a edge guitar riff inside the Sphere.

1920
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:08,460
That is.

1921
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:10,940
That should be maybe one of the spheres.

1922
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:14,120
The Sphere is like a representation of your own brain.

1923
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:15,720
And you can go in there.

1924
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,780
Maybe they do like sort of therapy for you in there.

1925
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:18,640
Like you're alone.

1926
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:19,880
You pay a lot of money obviously.

1927
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,340
And then you just get like hit with all your memories in the Sphere.

1928
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:26,220
And then it like cares you of any angst you've got.

1929
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:27,920
Would it?

1930
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:28,260
Taylor?

1931
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:28,800
Well it depends.

1932
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:33,680
If you're talking about like ASMR or soundbath maybe.

1933
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:37,380
If I really analyze the thing I just made up 30 seconds ago.

1934
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:42,260
I guess what I mean is that they tailor make a Sphere experience for you and all the psychological

1935
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:43,680
problems you're dealing with.

1936
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:50,760
Because it's just such a big immersive space that there's representations of all the history

1937
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:53,120
and your past and the sound is so clear.

1938
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:53,980
And it's like your own.

1939
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:54,740
What are the representations?

1940
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:57,420
Does Darren Aronofsky have to make a movie for me?

1941
01:25:57,420 --> 01:25:57,760
Yes.

1942
01:25:57,820 --> 01:25:59,880
Darren Aronofsky is involved in what I'm talking about.

1943
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:04,980
So it's a big therapy where you have to get a very famous director involved.

1944
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:09,760
Award winning director is constructing some sort of nightmare for you to live.

1945
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,960
By the way there's only four rich people in their therapy.

1946
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:13,460
Oh well there are betters.

1947
01:26:13,660 --> 01:26:14,300
Oh yeah of course.

1948
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:15,460
They get up at 5am.

1949
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,980
So obviously they're better than us.

1950
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:19,140
Scary time.

1951
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,040
I don't like it.

1952
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:23,060
The sun's kind of coming up.

1953
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:24,340
I can't get back to sleep.

1954
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:25,520
I gotta use the bathroom.

1955
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:31,140
The nightmares are going to be like this is like your name is Tim Cook.

1956
01:26:31,140 --> 01:26:34,900
Your alarm has gone off at 520am.

1957
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:37,680
Yeah right.

1958
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:39,300
I can't rise and grind.

1959
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:43,180
Animated alarm clock.

1960
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:46,920
And it's ringing and the ringing is so clear from the speakers.

1961
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:49,260
And then he leaves and he goes I'm perfectly cured.

1962
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:49,920
By the way.

1963
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:50,860
Thank you Darren Aronofsky.

1964
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:57,080
Are they up converting like Requiem for a Dream and Pie and Mother for the speaker?

1965
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:59,400
I don't believe that's on the cards.

1966
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:02,420
I don't think they waive an overall Aronofsky deal.

1967
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:04,900
No I think he went and filmed some elephants for them.

1968
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:09,860
But you think he gets his friends and family like guys we're gonna watch another Real Big.

1969
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:10,680
Oh maybe.

1970
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:11,820
We're gonna watch the whale real big.

1971
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:12,440
On the Real Big.

1972
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:13,780
You wanna go watch the Real Big?

1973
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:15,800
Do you think there's maybe.

1974
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:17,240
You wanna go to the Real Big?

1975
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:23,240
And the emoji outside it's like Requiem for a Dream's played inside.

1976
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:27,940
The emoji outside's making like the kissy face or it's the poop emoji.

1977
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:31,140
The last couple months of the Sphere before it closes do you think it'll

1978
01:27:31,140 --> 01:27:33,340
just be like showing Rocky Horror at night?

1979
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:36,080
And by this you mean in 2024.

1980
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:37,880
2024.

1981
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:40,240
I don't know.

1982
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:41,520
Like either time.

1983
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:42,760
Depends on when it opens exactly.

1984
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:44,160
I may die Rocky Horror.

1985
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:49,640
I mean the place would just be that many forks being thrown at the screen.

1986
01:27:49,780 --> 01:27:50,460
Well I don't think it would.

1987
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:54,320
Oh yeah I don't think it would work because of the different like the curve of the seats.

1988
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:57,620
I think you're just hitting people in the next row with your forks.

1989
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:59,740
Do they throw forks in the Rocky Horror show?

1990
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:00,580
Oh at midnight.

1991
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:02,340
Yeah at midnight they do a whole.

1992
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:03,220
I've never done it.

1993
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:04,000
There's a lot of participant patients.

1994
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:05,520
What are the forks for?

1995
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:06,180
I don't know Jason.

1996
01:28:06,580 --> 01:28:06,920
I forget.

1997
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:09,580
Are we not conflating the spoons at the room?

1998
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:11,980
Well that's where it came from.

1999
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:13,200
Is it the forks?

2000
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:13,980
Do they throw toast?

2001
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:15,440
I always thought they threw toast.

2002
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:16,240
I've never done that.

2003
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:17,400
Do they have to bring toast?

2004
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,440
Forks, Rocky Horror picture show.

2005
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:20,540
I thought it was forks.

2006
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:21,280
I could be wrong.

2007
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,960
I thought the spoons thing was a nod to Rocky Horror.

2008
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:28,080
Now I've only seen Rocky Horror once but I don't remember any forks.

2009
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:29,860
You didn't see a midnight screening of it.

2010
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:30,620
No no.

2011
01:28:30,660 --> 01:28:33,360
Because that's when the nonsense happens as far as I'm.

2012
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,980
I'm searching some articles for forks.

2013
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:38,360
I swore there was throwing stuff at the screen.

2014
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:40,880
There is throwing stuff for sure but I don't know.

2015
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,400
I think toast might be correct.

2016
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:43,200
Okay.

2017
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:43,960
I think it's toast.

2018
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:44,920
Maybe it's toast.

2019
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:45,860
But here's a guide.

2020
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,500
Yes toast for sure.

2021
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:52,000
I don't know if toast makes more sense because you're not going to hurt anybody if you hit them.

2022
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:53,180
Yeah that's true.

2023
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:54,740
Forks do seem dangerous.

2024
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:55,380
Yeah.

2025
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:55,900
I wonder is there anything.

2026
01:28:55,900 --> 01:29:00,420
Brad refers to having taken the wrong fork in the road a few miles back.

2027
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:02,600
Maybe everybody throws forks at that.

2028
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,200
Okay.

2029
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:04,260
All right.

2030
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:06,060
It could be.

2031
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:06,400
I don't know.

2032
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:10,900
I legitimately don't know but this also does feel like conflating the room.

2033
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:11,620
I'm not sure.

2034
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:18,380
But we'll know when we're seeing it on the Sphere screen at midnight in late 2024 or early 2025

2035
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:20,440
because they do not show what else to do.

2036
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:22,320
All right.

2037
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:23,440
We're doing porn.

2038
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:24,240
All right.

2039
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:24,860
Everybody cut.

2040
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:26,880
You're allowed to jerk off.

2041
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:27,900
You just saved it.

2042
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:29,080
You just saved the whole thing.

2043
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:32,740
There is a lot of production of that sort of thing in Las Vegas.

2044
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:33,500
So you know.

2045
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:33,560
Porn.

2046
01:29:33,740 --> 01:29:35,140
No you just let it out.

2047
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:40,600
Like if it's we got to get butts in the seats and if that's if what it takes is looking at butts

2048
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:43,940
and showing your bare butt and touching somebody else's butt.

2049
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:46,680
This Sphere is for orgies now.

2050
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:47,760
My James Dolan.

2051
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,040
Laurel you've saved the Sphere.

2052
01:29:50,980 --> 01:29:51,500
My goodness.

2053
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:55,940
Lauren Boebert can get whatever she wants grabbed in here whenever she wants.

2054
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:00,760
Maybe her specific thing is Beetlejuice.

2055
01:30:00,820 --> 01:30:02,380
We will play Beetlejuice.

2056
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:04,580
We will play a film version of the musical.

2057
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:05,840
We'll play the first movie.

2058
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:09,440
We'll play an early cut of the second movie that I can't believe they're making.

2059
01:30:11,980 --> 01:30:12,540
Okay.

2060
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,220
Other innovations in Shanghai.

2061
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:18,240
We have finally stopped using all of the same words.

2062
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:20,600
Wait that's not true because the word jet is in there.

2063
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:20,980
No yeah.

2064
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:21,760
It's not Astro jets.

2065
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:22,780
It's not Tomorrowland jets.

2066
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:23,620
It's not rocket jets.

2067
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:24,680
It's jet packs.

2068
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:27,540
And here finally we've got an actually new thing.

2069
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:29,360
Is it still a rocket round and round?

2070
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:31,680
Yes but you now have restraints on.

2071
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:35,120
It's that kind of ride and sorry Mike you got dangling legs.

2072
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:41,760
It has become a dangling leg ride but good views picturesque sweeping views of you know

2073
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,600
you get your Tron ride in there which looks cool.

2074
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:49,300
You get your beautiful Shanghai castle but it's finally a new type of experience which

2075
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:52,840
also speaks to Shanghai in general I think kind of an innovative park.

2076
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:53,220
Yeah.

2077
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:56,580
Let's not just do the same exact stuff so I give them credit for doing jet packs.

2078
01:30:56,600 --> 01:31:00,460
Similar to like the silly symphony swings in California Adventure or like an old carnival.

2079
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:01,260
Does that bother you?

2080
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:01,840
Yes.

2081
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:02,340
Really?

2082
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:05,240
Yeah yeah especially if you're on the outside of it.

2083
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:06,860
That freaks me out.

2084
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:10,200
I'm like I'm going right into the water or I'm going right onto the concrete.

2085
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:10,620
Sure.

2086
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:11,680
I'm exposed here.

2087
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:14,520
I always liked it as a kid but the older I get even the more.

2088
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:19,140
Did you like when it was the big orange because at least you were enclosed a little more.

2089
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:25,480
Did I like the big orange better than the same maybe I felt comforted by being inside

2090
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:26,200
the big orange.

2091
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:28,600
But then you might just go slam against the wall.

2092
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:30,320
I was still stressed probably.

2093
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:32,000
If you smacked that orange.

2094
01:31:32,860 --> 01:31:38,260
What about Zephyr golden Zephyr do you feel me were enclosed in that because you're kind

2095
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:38,960
of surrounded.

2096
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:40,900
Yeah I guess so.

2097
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:44,580
It's a similar thing but yeah legs not dangling on the golden Zephyr.

2098
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:45,220
That's true.

2099
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:46,960
So I'm in a little vehicle.

2100
01:31:47,020 --> 01:31:48,600
Is something going to like cut your foot off.

2101
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:51,140
It just feels too exposed.

2102
01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:54,360
I don't know it just feels like I need to be in a little bubble.

2103
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:59,560
You know like Jason says he likes to get under the pillow the pillow fort or like the what

2104
01:31:59,560 --> 01:31:59,920
does he say?

2105
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:00,960
It's his research fort.

2106
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:01,660
His research fort.

2107
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:04,860
I like to be in that in a vehicle a ride vehicle.

2108
01:32:04,860 --> 01:32:07,400
I like to be just nice and cozy.

2109
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:08,280
Or a ride womb.

2110
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:09,600
A ride womb yeah.

2111
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:10,080
Okay.

2112
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:14,760
So I mean I'm sure there's an example that I'm not thinking of that I'm like Soren my

2113
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:16,340
legs dangling and I'm comfortable with it.

2114
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:16,580
Okay.

2115
01:32:16,580 --> 01:32:17,840
But that's such a gentle.

2116
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:22,520
It also may be maybe the quality of Soren makes you just like I'm gonna.

2117
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,140
Yeah maybe the music.

2118
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:26,280
You don't give that up for silly symphony swings.

2119
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:27,020
Right.

2120
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:28,720
That's ultimately just just swings.

2121
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:32,300
Does this are you not going on if you make it to Shanghai are you going on.

2122
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:35,820
I'll do no I'm gonna do it I'll do it look I'm gonna do it I'm gonna prove to all the

2123
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:39,080
kids and the adults and the old folks that I'm cool still.

2124
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:42,880
Well you got to learn how to how to say I'm cool in Chinese.

2125
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:44,520
Of course yeah that's number one.

2126
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:46,140
That's number one yeah.

2127
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:48,640
I don't know if jet packs if you control it.

2128
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,000
I don't know if you've got a question.

2129
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:51,420
I didn't see that.

2130
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:54,240
Or does it just go all the way up or does it like up and down.

2131
01:32:55,260 --> 01:32:55,700
Interesting.

2132
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:57,160
In a pattern of their own design.

2133
01:32:57,680 --> 01:32:58,560
That's a good question.

2134
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:02,980
I was thinking too that there was some element of like jet packs that they were going to do

2135
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:06,900
for that initial Avengers ride that looked because you were legs dangling and little

2136
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:07,440
chairs.

2137
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:11,100
I don't know if it looked like it was like bungee cord like but there was going to be

2138
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:16,880
some version of you're in that type of a chair and then you're being swung around in front

2139
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:17,840
of the screen or something.

2140
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:18,660
Oh yeah yeah.

2141
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:22,120
So I feel like that was part of it at least from that art we saw.

2142
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:26,740
Maybe they'll get it in a different country because it's not happening here.

2143
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:27,760
It's not happening here.

2144
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:34,760
So oh and then here to keep speaking to innovation to throwing out the rules.

2145
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:40,380
I think Tokyo has done the ultimate Tokyo thing and in the recent past they've said

2146
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:42,720
why do we need a Jets ride.

2147
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:44,040
This is gone.

2148
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:50,260
It is replaced by Happy Ride with Baymax which is one of those kind of whip arounds

2149
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:51,860
like Mater's Junkyard Jamboree.

2150
01:33:51,980 --> 01:33:52,620
Sleeper Ride.

2151
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:54,380
Very pleasant genre of ride.

2152
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:55,540
Very cute.

2153
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:57,220
With the Baymax aesthetic.

2154
01:33:59,020 --> 01:34:00,620
It seems like it's a fun little light show in there.

2155
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:05,100
And just like physically such a fun feeling.

2156
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:08,300
A much more fun feeling than you would expect seeing it.

2157
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:08,980
Yeah.

2158
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:09,460
Yeah.

2159
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:10,780
Just such a really cool.

2160
01:34:10,860 --> 01:34:17,260
Seems like nothing but then also like it felt like a little thrill to me so I was nervous

2161
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:20,160
taking my then two-year-old on it but he loved it.

2162
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:23,420
He just laughed and laughed at it so it wasn't like too much for him.

2163
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:23,700
Right.

2164
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:23,920
Sure.

2165
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:29,700
So it's a good whole family ride so that's really smart and this is also right next to that.

2166
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:34,100
Am I correct that Tokyo has no Autopia anymore?

2167
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:35,920
The true way of the future.

2168
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:36,700
Right.

2169
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:37,220
So they are.

2170
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:43,060
So clearly Tomorrowland needs to be followed on all fronts which might include here in

2171
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:43,420
Disneyland.

2172
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:48,520
Is it killing us if we have no version of this ride in Disneyland at all?

2173
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:49,540
I don't think any of us care.

2174
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:50,600
I don't think anybody cares.

2175
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:54,360
I mean it'd be neat to get it back up on top of that platform but not a priority.

2176
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:55,460
Way down in the list.

2177
01:34:55,460 --> 01:35:00,160
Yeah well Tokyo is getting that cool Space Mountain redo too.

2178
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:03,100
That's a true game changer.

2179
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:09,440
And they're suddenly, if we're measuring Tomorrowlands, isn't that gonna get that one

2180
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:10,200
up to number one?

2181
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:10,820
Oh yeah.

2182
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:19,660
If in California they were to do that and then do Tron like half a block down, imagine.

2183
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:20,340
Yes.

2184
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:25,140
Just these cool looking future oddball buildings like that.

2185
01:35:25,140 --> 01:35:26,100
Very much so.

2186
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:36,880
than maybe typical stuff that we discuss because a lot needs to be done.

2187
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:44,700
Is there any version of Astro Orbiter that is salvageable besides the obvious of putting

2188
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:45,820
it back on the platform?

2189
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:47,980
How do we make this more of something?

2190
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:51,360
Is it going with this jetpack thing?

2191
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:58,120
Is there some way to incorporate an IP or a story, dare I say, which somehow makes it

2192
01:35:58,120 --> 01:35:58,860
more essential?

2193
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:02,440
Yeah it's a good question.

2194
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:03,240
I don't know.

2195
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:09,040
It would have to be like Star Wars or Guardians I guess at this point of space-ish.

2196
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:16,080
Could you do, could this somehow be an experimental Tony Stark vehicle?

2197
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:16,520
Yeah.

2198
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:18,900
Which then once you see it just goes round and round.

2199
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:22,340
But if you could get some VO from a fake Robert Downey Jr.

2200
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:23,320
They've got the guy.

2201
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:24,280
We're gonna have a couple of them.

2202
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:24,840
Yeah we're gonna bring him.

2203
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:25,280
Do some smirking.

2204
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:27,700
We need to test him out.

2205
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:29,100
Oh you think we will?

2206
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:30,060
Yeah we'll do it.

2207
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:32,620
Let's get those three guys at once.

2208
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:34,280
Pepper?

2209
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:34,860
Pepper?

2210
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:37,640
Yeah we can do it.

2211
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:38,340
That's a good key.

2212
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:39,440
I guess that's how you do it huh?

2213
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:39,720
Pepper?

2214
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:40,500
Hey happy.

2215
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:41,120
Get out of the key.

2216
01:36:41,740 --> 01:36:42,780
Hit the ignition.

2217
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:47,860
It's a Dennis Miller.

2218
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:48,740
Dennis Miller yeah.

2219
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:49,120
Yeah yeah.

2220
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:52,620
Climb aboard one of Dennis Miller's experimental rockets.

2221
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:53,680
Now we're talking.

2222
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:57,600
Dennis Miller is the character that's the in for this ride.

2223
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:01,820
It's a representation of the whirlwind you're in when you're in one of his sets of references.

2224
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:05,180
Hey look babe it's not the longest okay.

2225
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:08,140
It's not the longest jaunt but it's at least something.

2226
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:14,680
You're gonna be flying faster than a tomato aimed right at Michael Eisner's head in 87.

2227
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:21,580
Tony yeah you could do it like jetpack style in their little iron man kind of suits on the

2228
01:37:21,580 --> 01:37:23,160
out like on the back of it.

2229
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:24,120
This is pretty good.

2230
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:25,160
And that would be fun.

2231
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:27,580
Some stark industries.

2232
01:37:27,740 --> 01:37:28,840
I don't like this being in the front.

2233
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:30,120
I think you gotta move that.

2234
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:30,420
Yeah.

2235
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:32,900
It's weird to have like here's a big marvel thing right at the entrance.

2236
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:33,380
Right.

2237
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:38,800
This ain't bad if they're gonna have and we're we don't have a lot of marvel rides yet to be honest.

2238
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:39,440
No.

2239
01:37:39,540 --> 01:37:43,680
This is kind of a simple ride having a nice little this is kind of a legit good idea.

2240
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:46,760
Okay I'm gonna toss this out.

2241
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:50,880
One of the things that I had been most delighted by in the last few years.

2242
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:59,400
In Toy Story Land the little green men version of the Baymax ride and the Mater ride

2243
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:08,620
is like kind of enclosed and they're playing like loud techno covers of like the Toy Story songs.

2244
01:38:08,860 --> 01:38:10,000
And they're like.

2245
01:38:10,180 --> 01:38:12,060
By the way by red hot chili peppers maybe.

2246
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:14,160
Oh no sorry Scott.

2247
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:15,920
Banded in lions who beat the moops.

2248
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:19,920
And there's just crazy like colored lights going.

2249
01:38:20,420 --> 01:38:21,280
If you could.

2250
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:23,500
You want to enclose this.

2251
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:29,040
I don't want to enclose it all the way but sort of like the orange or sort of like the

2252
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:33,100
Disney World Astro Orbiter where there's some stuff on the outside.

2253
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:36,100
You get some colored lights on those things.

2254
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:39,720
The only way I agree with that is if it has to be on the ground

2255
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:43,360
and you're not going to get to see because you know I like to see the sights.

2256
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:47,860
So if it has to be on the ground and you want to give some more lights and stuff to look at

2257
01:38:47,860 --> 01:38:50,380
then maybe I could see what you're saying.

2258
01:38:50,980 --> 01:38:51,980
But where does that go?

2259
01:38:52,060 --> 01:38:53,060
Is that a hub thing?

2260
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:54,300
Yeah I don't know.

2261
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:58,620
That also I think that's an alien thing not a green army man.

2262
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:00,300
No the little green.

2263
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,720
Oh you mean the little green man.

2264
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:02,920
If you demolish.

2265
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:04,160
The pizza planet.

2266
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:10,760
In the demolished version of Tomorrowland Redo and Disneyland then you got options.

2267
01:39:11,740 --> 01:39:17,020
This ride also being I don't think I like this as much as Tony Stark's experimental spinner

2268
01:39:17,020 --> 01:39:23,000
machine but it being something where you're like strapped in with the aliens.

2269
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:25,220
That's something.

2270
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:28,200
I mean they're already represented in Astro Blasters I guess.

2271
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:28,860
Right.

2272
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:34,320
But like this is going to be the last you know space we're not getting anything else that works

2273
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:35,040
for space.

2274
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:39,840
Tomorrowland bombed we're not going to get no properties will not be our.

2275
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:41,940
John Carter 2 is not coming any time soon.

2276
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:46,760
No unless you just unless I don't want them to call these the Tron jets and then we don't

2277
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:49,000
and you make it look like Tron but then we don't get the real Tron ride.

2278
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:51,020
They still talk of Tron 3.

2279
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:52,960
They're still talking about it.

2280
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:53,660
Oh yeah right.

2281
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:56,900
So the guy was mad that he couldn't make it because of the writer's string.

2282
01:39:56,900 --> 01:39:58,240
He was made of the writer's string.

2283
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:00,440
So yeah.

2284
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:02,940
Please let me make another bomb with Jared Leto.

2285
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:08,300
Disney one one IP bomb with Jared Leto is not enough for this company.

2286
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:12,600
Please let us pay this man more to not deliver for us.

2287
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:13,240
Yeah.

2288
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:17,860
So maybe it's another little Tron offshoot maybe.

2289
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:18,920
I don't know.

2290
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:23,880
Yeah there's nothing like this and wait wait if they all look like that you do the flying

2291
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:25,780
saucer kind then it's the disks.

2292
01:40:25,780 --> 01:40:28,640
Now we're doing the flying disks.

2293
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:29,360
Yeah yeah yeah.

2294
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:30,480
Yeah okay sure.

2295
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:31,360
The Tron frisbees.

2296
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:31,880
I'm into that.

2297
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:33,100
Call it the Tron frisbees.

2298
01:40:33,220 --> 01:40:33,760
That's what everybody would call it.

2299
01:40:33,780 --> 01:40:35,280
Tron frisbees game grid.

2300
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:37,220
Game grid frisbees yeah.

2301
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:42,680
A general bigger oh god this is take I mean I still again this doesn't replace the roller

2302
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:47,580
coaster but you take that stupid carousel building and that is the game grid.

2303
01:40:47,620 --> 01:40:49,760
That's a big that's a giant arcade now.

2304
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:51,840
Why isn't Starcade a Tron?

2305
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:56,340
Yeah that should be a Flynn's Wreck-It Ralph mashup.

2306
01:40:56,660 --> 01:41:01,900
That was so great when they made it an arcade for Wreck-It Ralph.

2307
01:41:02,220 --> 01:41:07,340
I think the Flynn's arcade they put over by Electronica in California Adventure.

2308
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:08,260
That was great.

2309
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:08,860
That was really cool.

2310
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:13,080
They don't yeah I just think they're like money wise they don't think that that's worth

2311
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:16,140
it other than just a promotional opportunity to have an arcade.

2312
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:17,500
Just doesn't make sense.

2313
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:23,980
That magic key holder lounge with tiny electric billboards for West Side Story was really

2314
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:24,460
bleak.

2315
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:25,500
Really rough stuff.

2316
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:26,780
I never went I never got to go.

2317
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:31,600
Well I got a slip of paper that once I entered a code and went through several levels on a

2318
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:35,180
Disney website I got a gift card for Disney worth ten dollars.

2319
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:44,680
So yes I made money by to give back to them by figuring out what the hell that lounge was.

2320
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:46,300
By one and a half sodas.

2321
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:50,080
Yes at Disney prices.

2322
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:52,700
It's one and a half to Sonny's.

2323
01:41:52,700 --> 01:41:54,160
The sleeve of a t-shirt.

2324
01:41:57,240 --> 01:42:02,840
But I mean something that ain't bad I think I think you put it up top you give it a little

2325
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:06,780
story because where you know what one thing maybe the only thing that helps the Disneyland

2326
01:42:06,780 --> 01:42:12,300
version is that little I do kind of like that voiceover like the Astro Orbit.

2327
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:12,920
Oh yeah.

2328
01:42:13,060 --> 01:42:14,800
I never would you guys ever go on this ride.

2329
01:42:14,940 --> 01:42:15,360
I kind of only.

2330
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:16,060
Not for a while.

2331
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:17,880
Yeah it's been like this is like a once a decade.

2332
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:20,700
It's just it's an unpleasant line to stand in at Disneyland.

2333
01:42:20,700 --> 01:42:21,160
Really boring.

2334
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:25,500
And it's what I forget there's a term for it's one of those lines where it just it stops.

2335
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:25,780
Switchbacks.

2336
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:27,200
Switch no not switchback.

2337
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:28,260
That's the wraparound.

2338
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:31,540
Yeah yeah but there's it's just one of those lines where you know it doesn't continuously

2339
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:33,160
move which always psychologically better.

2340
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:33,500
Yeah.

2341
01:42:33,620 --> 01:42:35,160
It's a stop and start line.

2342
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:36,560
Yeah you just stare at it.

2343
01:42:36,580 --> 01:42:37,220
Yeah so.

2344
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:42,640
You start to wonder and you see people walking by next to you free with their futures ahead of

2345
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:42,880
them.

2346
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:43,140
Right.

2347
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:45,080
And I've put myself in a line cage.

2348
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:51,800
Yeah and it's not a fun line to stand in and ultimately it's like rides real short.

2349
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:52,180
Yeah.

2350
01:42:52,180 --> 01:42:58,240
And you just you don't go I assume I'll go when the child is old enough to go.

2351
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:01,000
We'll do it often because it's an early one.

2352
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:08,020
I'm not as germaphobic as I was in the last few years I feel like but I try to avoid packed

2353
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:10,340
elevators when I can still.

2354
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:11,320
Oh for Disney World you mean.

2355
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:18,140
Anywhere packed elevators are a little mentally still like oh this feels nasty.

2356
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:18,860
Sure.

2357
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:21,260
So you won't be going for a little while.

2358
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,880
You don't like the Disney World one either then.

2359
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:28,180
Well that's what I know I'm saying you're saying problems with the Disney World one

2360
01:43:28,180 --> 01:43:31,800
waiting in line that when you have to get in the elevator which for a while they were

2361
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:33,940
setting up one party at a time.

2362
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:34,440
Oh right.

2363
01:43:34,580 --> 01:43:34,720
Yeah.

2364
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:36,640
Which seems like it's going to take a while.

2365
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:38,420
Yeah very very slow.

2366
01:43:38,420 --> 01:43:39,000
Yes.

2367
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:41,580
Yeah I wonder if that was a reason to move it too.

2368
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:45,600
We don't want to just like the elevator system is pretty.

2369
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:46,140
Yeah.

2370
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:53,480
For a ride that doesn't have a ton of capacity to have to like make people do an extra step

2371
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:54,740
to get to it I understand.

2372
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:59,260
Like if you did put it up in front of like Space Mountain or something right there and

2373
01:43:59,260 --> 01:44:03,120
there was a way to easily load like that's at least it's elevated and it's not.

2374
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:06,120
You don't have to send an elevator up if you have ramps and things.

2375
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:07,940
And yeah yeah sure but if you're blocking.

2376
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:13,180
Passageways well this is all a lot of marks down I'd say for Florida but what do we do

2377
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:16,920
we think having examined them all and it's hard to say because we haven't done Hong Kong

2378
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:20,840
we haven't done Shanghai what do we think is number one of this genre.

2379
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:22,320
Oh good question.

2380
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:27,520
It's hard because yeah like the elevation at Disney World seems great.

2381
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:28,240
Yeah.

2382
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:29,340
And I've done it so yeah.

2383
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:31,040
I think I still give it to that.

2384
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:32,220
I think that wins.

2385
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:36,740
Aesthetically it is the best of both worlds you've got your planets I think those are

2386
01:44:36,740 --> 01:44:38,520
painted wonderfully vibrantly.

2387
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:43,180
Yeah they still look good they keep those pretty up to like still looking good.

2388
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:47,000
I think Hong Kong has some flying saucers.

2389
01:44:47,020 --> 01:44:47,340
Yeah.

2390
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:55,920
Just having four people per vehicle 14 vehicles that's nearly 50 people every go around and

2391
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:57,020
it's more comfortable.

2392
01:44:57,340 --> 01:45:00,060
Yeah I'll tell you though the sights aren't as good you don't get the sights.

2393
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:00,560
That's how you're not.

2394
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:01,840
Well I mark it down for that.

2395
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:09,240
It's going to be hard for people of a certain age to turn down seeing the contemporary from

2396
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:09,800
far away.

2397
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:10,440
Yes.

2398
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:13,200
That's really what it comes down to I think your point earlier was correct.

2399
01:45:14,420 --> 01:45:18,580
Even if you don't like that you know it's still there's still yeah there's neon and

2400
01:45:18,580 --> 01:45:19,420
there's space mountain.

2401
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:25,140
Yes there's other stuff that's good too but for this group can't really it's hard to beat

2402
01:45:25,140 --> 01:45:27,600
being able to see the contemporary from a ride.

2403
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:31,640
It makes me so I love looking at it from afar then I'm going in it and being up there and

2404
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:35,720
looking back the other way and seeing the Astro Orbiter with an E from there.

2405
01:45:37,300 --> 01:45:44,240
There's also that well this this should be on the pre-do tomorrow but that giant platform

2406
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:49,320
above like loading space mountain just that big empty nothing.

2407
01:45:49,460 --> 01:45:50,720
Mike was kind of saying that right.

2408
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:51,140
Yeah.

2409
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:52,320
That's just with a target.

2410
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:52,640
Right.

2411
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:53,560
Yeah.

2412
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:54,180
What is it.

2413
01:45:54,180 --> 01:45:54,620
Excuse me.

2414
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:55,260
Why is it there.

2415
01:45:55,300 --> 01:45:57,440
That's just what the movie theater is below it.

2416
01:45:57,820 --> 01:45:58,140
Yes.

2417
01:45:58,140 --> 01:45:58,460
Yeah.

2418
01:45:58,460 --> 01:46:04,340
There's so much weird the old space mountain like line and like it's so much better.

2419
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:07,400
I mean that's the speed ramp right up to it.

2420
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:08,040
It just feels like.

2421
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:09,300
My era speed ramp era.

2422
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:09,900
Speed ramp.

2423
01:46:09,900 --> 01:46:10,480
Yeah right right.

2424
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:17,280
Yeah it just there's so many like it's never gotten the biggest renovation so it feels like

2425
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:21,260
all these different decisions have just led to it with all these kind of confusing things

2426
01:46:21,260 --> 01:46:21,920
being stuck.

2427
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:26,280
The fact that I mean it did get a big renovation but they had to undo all of it.

2428
01:46:26,340 --> 01:46:26,860
Yeah that's true.

2429
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:30,640
It's so unpopular that it just went all the way backwards.

2430
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:36,400
Yeah but not not not the money that it needed I guess it did get renovations but like it

2431
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:39,680
felt like it didn't get its like new fantasy land.

2432
01:46:39,740 --> 01:46:43,880
Both parks got a new fantasy land especially like the Disneyland overhaul of fantasy land

2433
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:47,060
when you see what it looked like before is unbelievable.

2434
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:47,420
Yeah.

2435
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:48,780
Because it feels like it's trash.

2436
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:50,160
It looks like shit.

2437
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:51,680
The old Disney fantasy land.

2438
01:46:52,020 --> 01:46:52,460
Carnival.

2439
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:55,840
And you're like wow I this feels like it's been here forever.

2440
01:46:55,840 --> 01:47:01,180
Of course it looks as good as this and then you see the old video but like it's

2441
01:47:01,180 --> 01:47:06,400
tomorrow has never gotten like full it doesn't ever get the full thing it needs.

2442
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,480
No it never gets the love.

2443
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:09,700
It never gets the full love.

2444
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:12,780
Really what we need ultimately for tomorrow land is love.

2445
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:15,940
Well love is certainly the most important thing.

2446
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:20,180
Is Disneyland the worst one of these.

2447
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:21,560
Oh interesting.

2448
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:23,720
Maybe.

2449
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:24,760
I think so.

2450
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:29,180
I think the other ones have little facets that make it jetpacks is new.

2451
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:30,960
Hong Kong loads better.

2452
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:32,720
Japan's is blown up.

2453
01:47:33,140 --> 01:47:36,060
The placement is really Paris is the same ride but it's prettier.

2454
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,700
It's got prettier stuff around it.

2455
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:39,480
It's hard to get the placement out of the equation.

2456
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:43,360
So maybe it's not so cut and dry if I don't think about the placement at Disneyland.

2457
01:47:44,420 --> 01:47:45,860
But I see no other option.

2458
01:47:45,940 --> 01:47:48,180
If you put the placement in it's for sure the last one.

2459
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:48,900
Yeah.

2460
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:49,220
Yeah.

2461
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:50,560
I'm whispering again because I don't want to.

2462
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:56,480
I have a this is like a this makes me sad to ask but I feel like I have to ask it.

2463
01:47:57,120 --> 01:48:01,520
Is Astro Orbiter the worst ride in Disneyland Park.

2464
01:48:02,020 --> 01:48:02,500
Wow.

2465
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:04,520
That's something I hadn't even considered.

2466
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:08,860
Because like and it's not even I think that's actually a strong park.

2467
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:09,620
Yeah it's a really strong park.

2468
01:48:09,620 --> 01:48:10,700
That's the worst.

2469
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:16,440
But like maybe by what is what and let's so we take California Adventure out of there.

2470
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:18,760
It's only it's only Disneyland Park.

2471
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:20,820
This was a grim thing to realize.

2472
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:22,420
I feel like it might have to be.

2473
01:48:22,660 --> 01:48:23,380
That's interesting.

2474
01:48:23,700 --> 01:48:26,380
It's a lot of heavy hitters in that park.

2475
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:30,780
It really is and they don't have any of the like you know actively bad

2476
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:33,280
journey into imagination with figment.

2477
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:34,940
Stuff that decayed to the point.

2478
01:48:34,940 --> 01:48:36,940
Yeah there's nothing that is so.

2479
01:48:38,620 --> 01:48:42,560
I mean I don't like Autopia but people like it.

2480
01:48:45,380 --> 01:48:46,480
There's some scenery.

2481
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:47,840
I got to do with a kid.

2482
01:48:47,960 --> 01:48:48,800
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

2483
01:48:49,420 --> 01:48:51,000
That's true kids like to drive.

2484
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:55,660
Yeah I want it I want it to be something else.

2485
01:48:55,940 --> 01:48:59,580
We just we just spent we made it to 90 I believe talking about this ride.

2486
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:04,260
I don't want to end the episode by saying this is the worst ride in Disneyland.

2487
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:05,520
Feels so grim.

2488
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:06,740
Gadgets go coaster.

2489
01:49:07,060 --> 01:49:09,140
No no that's kind of fun.

2490
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:09,520
Jason.

2491
01:49:09,620 --> 01:49:10,420
It's kind of fun.

2492
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:12,920
Well but this is kind of Astro Orbiter is kind of fun.

2493
01:49:13,180 --> 01:49:15,340
I haven't done the new I don't know what they did to it.

2494
01:49:16,060 --> 01:49:16,940
Not much.

2495
01:49:16,940 --> 01:49:17,400
Not much.

2496
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:22,540
Do you have to bring in this feels like throwing this feels like you know like

2497
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:27,200
throwing relatives under the bus or something the the the main street rides.

2498
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:33,100
But that's only because they like are very modest in their expectations.

2499
01:49:33,220 --> 01:49:33,740
You mean like Lincoln.

2500
01:49:34,040 --> 01:49:35,120
No like the buses.

2501
01:49:35,680 --> 01:49:35,980
Oh oh oh.

2502
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:36,780
Oh the Omni bus.

2503
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:40,320
What's that you're gonna get he's gonna choke you he's gonna get as mad as I got earlier.

2504
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:41,900
You say that the buses are the.

2505
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:46,980
We're not going to be able to breathe all the looney tune smoke that's going to be left in this room.

2506
01:49:49,540 --> 01:49:50,400
Is it this.

2507
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:52,640
What's what are we missing something.

2508
01:49:52,740 --> 01:49:54,420
It's bottom it's.

2509
01:49:54,540 --> 01:49:55,880
It's not Casey Jr.

2510
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:57,000
That's great.

2511
01:49:57,260 --> 01:49:57,940
So I don't.

2512
01:49:58,080 --> 01:49:58,540
Dumb always.

2513
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:00,400
It feels weird.

2514
01:50:00,660 --> 01:50:03,160
It feels weird I don't even like calling Astro Orbiter the worst.

2515
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:04,100
This feels too.

2516
01:50:04,220 --> 01:50:05,560
I don't think I can comfortably say it.

2517
01:50:05,580 --> 01:50:06,820
What about the term least essential.

2518
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:07,960
Maybe yeah.

2519
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:08,920
That might be it.

2520
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:11,800
I don't think Astro Orbiter is actively bad.

2521
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:14,740
I think if I went on it tomorrow I'd have a great time.

2522
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:18,420
But you just weigh all these things against it and what it could be.

2523
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:22,860
And then it just that it but it's like clogs up the pipes of this park.

2524
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:25,760
I could say I could comfortably say bottom five.

2525
01:50:25,940 --> 01:50:26,340
Yeah.

2526
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:27,680
Maybe I could say that.

2527
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:28,380
Wait wait.

2528
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:31,140
Finding Nemo submarine.

2529
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:33,760
Well yeah that's pretty unpleasant.

2530
01:50:33,820 --> 01:50:34,620
And chills.

2531
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:38,680
That I guess.

2532
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:40,480
What the support for it is.

2533
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:42,620
Because I would.

2534
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:45,920
I would rather do Astro Orbiter if I had a choice.

2535
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:46,860
I'm picking Astro Orbiter.

2536
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:47,820
I might too.

2537
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:49,840
Yeah the Nemo.

2538
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:52,340
I don't know if that's going to be interesting to see if that's it.

2539
01:50:52,340 --> 01:50:56,460
That's one that's another like Tony saved it ride supposedly.

2540
01:50:56,680 --> 01:50:59,860
And the older folks are the submarines are so important to Disneyland.

2541
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:03,020
And that's another one where I don't think the three of us care that much about it.

2542
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:03,760
Yeah yeah.

2543
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:05,020
And I like the lake being there.

2544
01:51:05,060 --> 01:51:05,640
That's great.

2545
01:51:05,740 --> 01:51:06,720
I like in general the.

2546
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:07,920
Attic of all of it.

2547
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:10,980
But I'm sure we'll talk about the history and think that's cool.

2548
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,640
And they had the mermaids out and they did but I don't that Nemo.

2549
01:51:13,660 --> 01:51:14,720
I never go on it.

2550
01:51:14,860 --> 01:51:16,020
No I don't ever do it.

2551
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:17,560
I don't remember the last time I went.

2552
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:20,040
Maybe I went out right when it was we did the redo.

2553
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:20,520
Yeah.

2554
01:51:20,540 --> 01:51:21,780
But I think that's all that's it.

2555
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:25,800
I think I'm I just almost want to throw it to that.

2556
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,360
So that we don't end an episode about the attraction by calling it the worst ride.

2557
01:51:29,580 --> 01:51:30,020
That's good yeah.

2558
01:51:30,020 --> 01:51:34,620
And if we then do finding Nemo submarines then I might feel the same way and say.

2559
01:51:34,620 --> 01:51:37,740
You know what Astro Orbiters the one that sucks.

2560
01:51:37,820 --> 01:51:39,540
Maybe I'll fall in love with it.

2561
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:43,060
I'm curious here I'm just going to what's the oh this is Carly Wisell.

2562
01:51:43,100 --> 01:51:44,280
Ah what did she say.

2563
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:46,120
What did she call that she puts.

2564
01:51:46,540 --> 01:51:47,020
Oh interesting.

2565
01:51:47,940 --> 01:51:48,880
One on her list.

2566
01:51:49,020 --> 01:51:51,240
Storybook land canal boats at the bottom.

2567
01:51:52,060 --> 01:51:55,520
And then yeah then Nemo then Casey Jr.

2568
01:51:57,400 --> 01:51:58,920
Someone's asked for the show.

2569
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:02,460
Astro Orbiters as far as Jason's concerned for putting that the Casey Jr.

2570
01:52:02,620 --> 01:52:03,120
So low.

2571
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:04,760
I mean Casey Jr.

2572
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:05,840
is delightful.

2573
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:07,240
Storybook boats.

2574
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:08,400
That's a boat.

2575
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:09,800
It's a functional boat.

2576
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:11,580
You at least get to ride in a boat.

2577
01:52:11,580 --> 01:52:12,480
You're in a boat.

2578
01:52:12,740 --> 01:52:13,280
There's something.

2579
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:15,280
Yeah.

2580
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:18,220
The Nemo subs I'm more comfortable.

2581
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:21,160
She says plagued by two small rocket pods.

2582
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:23,600
Yeah and reliably lengthy sun soaked weights.

2583
01:52:23,820 --> 01:52:25,260
Yes at a minimum it's dizzying.

2584
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:26,760
I'm comfortable saying bottom five.

2585
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:28,600
I don't know if I'm comfortable saying worst ride.

2586
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:28,980
Yeah.

2587
01:52:28,980 --> 01:52:30,520
She put it right at it is five.

2588
01:52:31,140 --> 01:52:33,940
I almost feel guilty but she's not wrong.

2589
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:38,420
I think you in this conversation you have to have Roger Rabbit's cartoon spin

2590
01:52:38,420 --> 01:52:44,980
unless they get it up to Tokyo quality which I said I went on and it's spectacular there.

2591
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:48,400
I think it's in top 10 in Tokyo but bottom five.

2592
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:48,960
I think that I.

2593
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:49,460
Disneyland.

2594
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:50,480
Interesting.

2595
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:54,120
They don't maintain it well and that stupid Jessica Rabbit thing.

2596
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:57,740
Well ever since they put the code on it's raised levels in my mind.

2597
01:52:57,740 --> 01:52:58,540
It's top 10.

2598
01:52:58,540 --> 01:53:00,200
So that was my big problem.

2599
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:01,540
You give it modesty points.

2600
01:53:01,820 --> 01:53:04,700
Yeah so ever since they covered up Jessica Rabbit I've liked the ride a lot better.

2601
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:07,160
And I like that she looks like a peeping Tom.

2602
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:10,620
Please come and peep at us in Orlando.

2603
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:15,320
But hey look you know you determine what you determine and I think we all we have to

2604
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:16,720
admit this doesn't go very high.

2605
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:20,700
Do I want there to be rocket type attractions in the parks?

2606
01:53:21,120 --> 01:53:21,340
Absolutely.

2607
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:27,000
I challenge Disney to set their sights for the future and elevate this thing.

2608
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,440
Perhaps literally just put on top of the platform.

2609
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:30,200
It's not that complicated.

2610
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:31,000
You could just put it up high.

2611
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:31,320
Yeah.

2612
01:53:31,340 --> 01:53:31,640
Yeah.

2613
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:32,040
And I wouldn't mind it.

2614
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:34,600
You got to rebuild the platform but you know it's not so crazy.

2615
01:53:34,740 --> 01:53:35,700
You do have to do that.

2616
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:36,580
It's not so crazy.

2617
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:39,140
But the people mover was so just make it what it was.

2618
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:40,760
Just go backwards.

2619
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:42,000
The past is the future.

2620
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:42,480
Okay.

2621
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:43,560
It's what we all want.

2622
01:53:43,860 --> 01:53:44,000
All right.

2623
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:46,080
It's so obvious anyway.

2624
01:53:46,300 --> 01:53:46,940
Kill the past.

2625
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:48,240
Don't do what.

2626
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:49,280
Despite the future.

2627
01:53:49,700 --> 01:53:51,020
Last Jedi don't do it.

2628
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:52,300
Oh that's the last Jedi quote.

2629
01:53:52,900 --> 01:53:53,260
Kill the past.

2630
01:53:53,260 --> 01:53:56,380
You know what I'm saying kill the past or something destroy the past.

2631
01:53:56,380 --> 01:53:57,140
Kill it if you must.

2632
01:53:57,640 --> 01:53:58,820
Memorable lines they are not.

2633
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:02,700

2644
01:54:31,060 --> 01:54:34,680
And on my way out the door I think I thought of another good one.

2645
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:36,160
This is this one's more blue sky.

2646
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:39,780
I don't know if they're going to do it but I was like what else do we talk about in this episode

2647
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:43,920
that we have positive feelings about that we could inject into this embattled ride.

2648
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:47,220
Shaq why take space out of it.

2649
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:53,380
The tower is Shaq and he is trying to swat at basketballs.

2650
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:59,560
To block them to defend his team and you are in the basketballs.

2651
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:04,360
We've all heard of Shaq food but what about Shaq future.

2652
01:55:06,980 --> 01:55:08,380
I don't think we can see anything.

2653
01:55:08,820 --> 01:55:09,820
Yeah what about it.

2654
01:55:09,900 --> 01:55:11,040
What about it.

2655
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:13,240
Imagine what could be.

2656
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:15,000
Full Shaq overlay of Tomorrowland.

2657
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:18,480
Would anyone have a problem.

2658
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:20,460
Here's the answer Shaq.

2659
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:21,620
All right go with me.

2660
01:55:21,620 --> 01:55:23,980
It's outside of the box.

2661
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:25,260
Shaq everywhere.

2662
01:55:25,480 --> 01:55:25,900
Blue sky.

2663
01:55:26,120 --> 01:55:27,980
If the budget is high enough yeah great.

2664
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:29,660
Start middle of star tours.

2665
01:55:30,340 --> 01:55:33,140
Hey star tours what's going on it's me Shaq.

2666
01:55:33,300 --> 01:55:35,220
I know I'm from a different galaxy in time.

2667
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:37,000
Just want to check in make sure you guys are good.

2668
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:37,860
Need anything.

2669
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:41,740
You know a good place where I can reopen my barbecue restaurant.

2670
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:43,600
I'm taking investors right now.

2671
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:44,900
Be better than pizza port.

2672
