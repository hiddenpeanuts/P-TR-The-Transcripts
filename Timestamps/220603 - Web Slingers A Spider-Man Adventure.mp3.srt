1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,400
Warning, the following podcast contains hard pieces of spider web fluid, devil dinosaur,

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,760
train car disappointment, and three podcasters made entirely out of mutant bees.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,840
It's Web Slingers, a Spider-Man adventure on today's podcast, The Ride.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,240
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast hosted by three men who were bitten

7
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,540
by a radioactive theme park nerd and have been dealing with it ever since.

8
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,280
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

9
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,520
Yeah, and the worst thing is I didn't even stop that, you know, other...

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,280
You wanted to be bitten is what you were saying?

11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,320
No, no, I'm saying like after I tried to go to like a theme park convention, the robber

12
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,080
was running out and I could have stopped him.

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,240
I could have stopped him and told him about like...

14
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,240
What was he stealing?

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,240
Magic journeys.

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:19,760
I don't know, like maybe the recently returned Bugsy, not Bugsy, who's the...

17
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,240
Oh, from Epcot.

18
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,240
Yeah.

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
It's not Bugsy.

20
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,240
Not Busby.

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,240
It's not Busby Berkeley.

22
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,240
Not Busby Berkeley, no.

23
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,240
No, I wish.

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,680
You would have stopped if some sort of Busby Berkeley relic were being stolen from a museum.

25
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,640
They're stealing Busby Berkeley's body.

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,440
Yeah, that's Scott Garen talking about Busby Berkeley in the first seconds of this podcast.

27
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,880
Oh yeah, we're off to the...

28
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,640
You know, you think you're looking at an episode title that seems like something current and

29
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,440
relevant and relatable.

30
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:52,240
How quickly can we get to the guy who did all of the swim dance numbers.

31
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,440
Yes, big musical numbers.

32
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,640
Jimmy Cagney's tuxedo from the end of Footlight Parade.

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,760
A hundred years ago, a person named Busby Berkeley made movies with a lot of dancers.

34
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
A lot.

35
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,720
Practical effects, baby.

36
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,920
In-camera edits.

37
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,160
And Jason's never been the same.

38
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,360
I've never been the same.

39
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,680
Yeah, what gave me permission to be weird?

40
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,120
I guess I'd have to say the Busby Berkeley movies.

41
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,680
Well, one young Hollywood star inadvertently nodded to the song and dance routines of the

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,960
past that we'll touch upon today.

43
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,720
I have no idea what that refers.

44
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,080
Oh, it's a Tom Holland thing.

45
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,080
I'll get to it.

46
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
I'll get to it.

47
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,080
Okay, okay.

48
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,920
Is that when Tom did... did he do Umbrella on...

49
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,960
Yes, he did Umbrella, but it started as singing in the rain.

50
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,760
And he's also on board for a...

51
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,520
I believe he's playing Fred Astaire at a biopic.

52
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
Oh, right.

53
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,160
Oh, this is... you must be so excited.

54
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,160
I'm much more...

55
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
I mean...

56
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,200
Another 100... a person who's a dead 100 years.

57
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,800
I am much more excited.

58
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,680
I'm much more skeptical of the Chris Evans, Gene Kelly biopic.

59
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,680
Is that a joke?

60
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,680
No, that's real.

61
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,680
That is real?

62
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,680
That's real.

63
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,400
It should be Channing Tatum because he can really dance.

64
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Oh, okay.

65
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
Yeah.

66
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
But you don't think Chris can learn?

67
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
I don't know.

68
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
We'll see.

69
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
We'll see.

70
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,920
Michael Douglas couldn't play the piano and the Liberace movie was pretty good.

71
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
That's true.

72
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
Yeah.

73
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,920
I mean, Pretty Good is one of my favorite movies.

74
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,920
I know, yeah.

75
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,920
Yes, that's an understatement.

76
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
It was marvelous.

77
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,680
That's what it was.

78
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,760
Yeah, anyway, our origin story, I was trying to say, was we got bitten by a man who loved

79
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,760
theme parks.

80
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,760
Yes.

81
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,880
Well, and I think that what this podcast is for the listeners is if they were not bit

82
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:42,720
themselves, then we provide a special vehicle that allows them to imagine what it would

83
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,560
be like to have been bitten by a radio.

84
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,560
Very true.

85
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,040
Yeah, I guess you're in the Nerder vehicle.

86
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,040
That's good.

87
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,040
No second E.

88
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,040
Dot, dot.

89
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,440
We provide you the Nerder vehicle to simulate what it's like to be stuck how we're stuck

90
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,440
all the time.

91
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
Exactly.

92
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,720
So yeah, it's a good, it's a safe way for you to live out what we do with every day.

93
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:12,920
Which you know, speaking of delving deeper into this world and us and everything that

94
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,960
we do, we have a little announcement here at the top of the show.

95
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,560
So many people who are listening to this may already be subscribed to our Patreon podcast,

96
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,240
the Ride the Second Gate, which we thank you so much for doing that.

97
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,600
The Patreon subscribers quite directly keep the show running and allow us to focus on

98
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,520
it and make it as good as it can be.

99
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,080
And besides that, we have a lot of fun over there.

100
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,840
I think we get crazy and indulgent and obscure and off topic and get to talk about it.

101
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:51,320
The late shift and about Sebastian Jackal and you know, because we're, we contain multitudes.

102
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,440
They're all pointless multitudes, but we do contain them.

103
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,440
Dead ends.

104
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,440
Yeah.

105
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,680
So what I'm getting at is we have so much fun over there, deep diving into our crazy

106
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,120
interests and into this, especially into this crazy theme park world.

107
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,280
We've decided that it's time to go even further, push things even deeper.

108
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:19,880
It is time, ladies and gentlemen, to open the third tier of podcast, the ride, a third

109
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,240
gate, if you will, beyond the second gate.

110
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,320
But if you thought I just revealed the name, that's not exactly right.

111
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,400
It's not podcast, the ride, the third gate, because we think of it as a little a little

112
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
more than that.

113
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:42,880
What we want this to be is a VIP lounge, an exclusive VIP lounge for the ultimate podcast,

114
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,360
the ride fans.

115
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,360
And that is why we are cutting the ribbon on podcast, the ride club three.

116
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,080
Welcome to club three.

117
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,880
We right now are issuing you an auditory invitation.

118
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,200
This is it. It's a super swanky private club within the second gate.

119
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,440
You guys excited? I'm excited.

120
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,240
Sounds good. It sounds curious.

121
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,320
Yeah. Listeners, you can enjoy you can feel what it was like if it was the mid 80s and

122
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:20,120
you were an executive vice president at a microchip manufacturer and oil company, Boeing,

123
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,800
an oil company who's about to just like really fuck up Alaska.

124
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,560
You know, yeah, that you get like up above the ride.

125
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,800
There are like three couches and then free orange juice.

126
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,960
Yeah, there's a mini fridge full of tabs, tabs and frescoes.

127
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:41,360
That's right. This is a mini fridge full of frescoes for your mind and for your ears.

128
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,760
And if that doesn't sell you on it, I don't know what will.

129
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,080
So what happens in podcast, the ride club three?

130
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,800
Well, keep in mind, it is still the second gate.

131
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,560
So you get the perks of podcast, the ride, the second gate.

132
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,120
You get your three bonus episodes every month.

133
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,480
But you also get the main feed episodes like this one you're currently hearing right now.

134
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,040
Ad free. You can listen to them without ads.

135
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,280
I mean, we can still ask us if you want to hear our our better help.

136
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,960
Oh, yeah. We'll still send them to if you're craving the ads,

137
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,880
we can still make sure that those get to you and you can kind of like piece them off

138
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,120
like little little quick bites as it were.

139
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,160
And of course, yeah.

140
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,320
The nice thing about advertising is it alerts you to goods and services

141
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,400
you might not otherwise know about.

142
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah, we don't want to take away that privilege from you.

143
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,520
But if for some reason, if you just if you want to hear an unbroken conversation

144
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,920
instead of one where we one of us suddenly butts in with different audio quality

145
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,480
or a voice you've never heard before and will never hear again, but then if you want to,

146
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,200
if you just want unbroken pockets, right episodes, that's happening over there.

147
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:51,280
Plus only on Club Three will you get one more bonus episode each month with topics

148
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,760
chosen by you, the audience.

149
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,600
And I think we want to see how far we can go, how deep we can go, how obscure we can go.

150
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,640
We are going to ask you for your dream podcast, The Right Episodes, how crazy

151
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,320
into things that we have talked about into like if you want to hear like we're going to talk about

152
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:18,240
the 1997 Disney Vacation Club planning guy, you want to watch that and we're going to talk

153
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,480
about whatever is the deepest thing you want to delve into.

154
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,080
That's what we're going to do over there.

155
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,160
Yeah, maybe even just like a chapter of that guide.

156
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,560
If you have a specific, yeah, reason.

157
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,400
Oh yeah, alert us to specificity.

158
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
Yeah, we are more than willing to break things up.

159
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,480
As you know, yeah, as you're aware.

160
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:39,600
I can ask my mom to dig out the VHS one we surely have somewhere in a box and we can compare it to

161
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,920
whatever one someone ripped to YouTube.

162
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,320
Oh yeah.

163
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,960
See if there are different things.

164
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,840
Quality, yes.

165
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,600
Where does it fuzz out?

166
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,000
How bright are the colors?

167
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,920
I don't want to now give your mom extra work, but if she's going to start digging through the box

168
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,560
then she's got to find those school plays too.

169
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,600
We got to get some Jason's school, but that seems like a great thing to do over in Club 3.

170
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,960
Well, I've got a little bit.

171
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,920
I've got a little.

172
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,840
Oh, you don't say.

173
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,520
I will have to cut it up.

174
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:12,640
I started watching some of what I ripped and remembered that we actually did have microphones

175
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,040
and lavaliers and stuff, but the one thing to try and get people's voices to carry that

176
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,480
weren't particularly good at projecting because there were children, they had floor mics and

177
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:32,720
everyone is wearing adult shoes that are probably two sizes too big on plywood stage extenders.

178
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,920
So a lot of what I'm hearing is thunk, thunk, thunk.

179
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,920
People might want to hear what a 12 year old Jason stomping around in big shoes.

180
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,880
If you can believe it, like 10 to 12 year old Jason pretty good at raising his voice.

181
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,760
So I actually probably over.

182
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,920
I do talk over the thongs.

183
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,160
You can hear me over the do you have any line in your head that you might have said,

184
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:04,480
especially as even if it's just a like, Hey, or like officer, I remember very

185
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,560
specifically saying in a sinister German accent, very she.

186
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,560
Oh, wow.

187
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,760
Like there is the girl.

188
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,800
At first I was like very chic and then I realized, oh, that's a V in where.

189
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,640
Yes.

190
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,400
That was the only direction they gave me for the German accent swap,

191
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,320
stop the W's for V's.

192
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,920
And then they're like, there's a movie called IQ about Albert Einstein, his nephew fall in love.

193
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,400
So me and my dad and my family went to like blockbuster and found like, okay,

194
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,160
here's the VHS IQ and I'll watch this.

195
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,520
And most of the movie went right over my head, but I was just like watching the scenes with

196
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,560
worked well enough.

197
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,720
Wasn't there a movie where like Fred Astaire had a German accent you could have gotten into?

198
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,600
I don't know.

199
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,560
There's probably some.

200
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,360
You might not have been willing to do that for a different time.

201
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:51,920
That's true.

202
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,440
Yeah.

203
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,080
Yeah.

204
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,080
And who knows what the movie selection was like at movies.

205
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,920
Is that the name?

206
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,480
That was a chain that had a little cow and 3d glasses and the logo.

207
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,360
Sounds to me like a club three, the movies.

208
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,800
We're going to talk about your.

209
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,520
Oh man.

210
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,560
The movies cow.

211
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,440
The movie cow.

212
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,960
There's so much.

213
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,120
It's really up to you, except for the first one, which we, which is up right now.

214
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,360
If you want to hear an extra bonus episode beyond the second gate, we have picked the

215
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,840
first one, which I think is a good starting point because if we're going to watch, you know,

216
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,880
crazy old stuff that we are very nostalgic for, I think a good starting point is the

217
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,400
classic VHS that so many of us had Disney sing along songs, Disneyland fun.

218
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:36,720
Of course.

219
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,520
There were all those sing along song compilations that were clips from the movies, but I think

220
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:47,760
we all the most loved the one where you actually got to go into the park and, uh, you know,

221
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,840
run around with Roger Rabbit and that zippity doo da rap and all that stuff.

222
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,240
Yeah.

223
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,200
It was really fun.

224
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,320
I was watching it this morning and making notes, praying I had picked the right one.

225
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,880
And then finally towards the end, I was like, ah, there, there she is.

226
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,000
There's an old friend.

227
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,240
There is she.

228
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,400
There is she.

229
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,520
There is the shiny queen.

230
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,240
There is she.

231
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,720
So, uh, if you go, if you go to podcast, the ride, the second gate club three right now,

232
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,080
you get this episode you're listening to ad free, you get Disney sing along songs, Disneyland fun.

233
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,440
It's just the beginning of the monthly extra bonus episode that you'll get.

234
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,560
And we'll try to figure out some other fun stuff to do over there because we

235
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,040
appreciate you supporting the show so much.

236
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,640
Uh, so club three, it's the third level of the podcast and it's just an extra

237
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,760
three dollars a month on top of the five that you might already be paying for the second gate.

238
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:41,920
Yes.

239
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,000
Before that you get more us, more fun and less ads.

240
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,960
Sounds good to me.

241
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,440
Good question.

242
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:47,760
Yeah.

243
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,040
We're excited about this.

244
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,040
Please come join us and, uh, thanks Aaron for the name club three.

245
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,760
You're on fire with the names lately and the logo.

246
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,080
Go check all that out.

247
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,800
And the logo.

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,520
Uh, yeah, of course the $5 tier still three episodes a month.

249
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,360
An added benefit of club three.

250
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,400
What that means is that you are going to get an RSS feed where all versions of the show

251
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,080
show up in one place.

252
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,640
Oh boy.

253
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,720
Three logos, all fighting to the death.

254
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,360
All fighting.

255
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,080
Which will win.

256
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,720
Oh yeah.

257
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,560
How's that going to even think about that?

258
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:16,720
Yeah.

259
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,120
Crazy.

260
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,760
We want to cloud those artists.

261
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,200
We don't want anybody else sneaking in.

262
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,560
We don't want any, any choppos and Marans and Carvies and spades.

263
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:26,720
No.

264
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,440
Keep them out.

265
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,320
Us only.

266
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,200
That's right.

267
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,520
Wow.

268
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,840
So there you go.

269
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,080
Patreon.com slash podcast, the ride where the usual stuff happens and this.

270
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,080
And with that said, uh, let's get to today's topic.

271
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:47,120
Web slingers, a spider-man, a spider-man web singers, all caps, a spider-man adventure.

272
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,760
And then forget the dash in spider-man.

273
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,600
Of course, the dash, uh, always there for spider-man part of the weird

274
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,720
like fifties and sixties comic guys just making up stuff as they love.

275
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,400
So Batman has no hyphen.

276
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,960
Spider-man does have an hyphen.

277
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,240
Superman, no hyphen.

278
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,040
No hyphen.

279
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,320
X-men has a hyphen.

280
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:07,920
Right.

281
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,800
Is it a Marvel thing?

282
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,320
Was there, is the dash Marvel?

283
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,240
Is that a Stan Lee affectation?

284
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,640
Maybe.

285
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,440
Yeah.

286
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,320
That's a good question.

287
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,320
Um, did the star wars droids have hyphens or are they just.

288
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,920
Yeah, there's hyphen in right?

289
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,320
R2D2?

290
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,840
R2D2 does.

291
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,400
R2-8.

292
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:22,880
BB-8.

293
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,280
BB-8.

294
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:23,840
BB-8.

295
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,320
BB-8.

296
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:24,800
BB-8.

297
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,040
Yeah.

298
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,080
R2-8.

299
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,560
Okay.

300
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:26,800
Yeah.

301
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,040
Yeah.

302
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,080
You got your dashes in there.

303
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,280
C3PO.

304
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,120
We got, yeah, C dash 3PO.

305
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,600
3PO.

306
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,080
Okay.

307
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,320
Yeah.

308
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,800
Yeah.

309
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,720
IG-88 has a dash.

310
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,200
Which one?

311
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,240
IG-88.

312
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,200
The bounty hunter.

313
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,160
The bounty hunter, Scott.

314
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,880
IG-88.

315
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,320
He's got kind of a long pencil.

316
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,280
He's like gray.

317
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,920
He's got like a long, what would you describe his head?

318
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,760
He's a robot who's very tall.

319
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,160
He looks like a giant pencil kind of, but he's gray.

320
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:50,880
Yeah.

321
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,760
Very tall.

322
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,320
He shows up in like one shot of.

323
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,280
All the Empire Strikes Back.

324
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,000
In Empire Strikes Back.

325
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,800
One shot?

326
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,520
One shot.

327
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,800
And then an IG-type droid shows up in the first Mandalorian.

328
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,040
Yeah.

329
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,360
Tyka.

330
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,000
And quickly blows up.

331
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,840
YTT is his, well not quickly.

332
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,960
He's in there for a few.

333
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,040
Okay.

334
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,200
But then he does blow up strangely in the,

335
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,240
spoiler alert, in the finale.

336
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,920
There's a scene where Vader has brought all the bounty hunters together in Empire Strikes Back

337
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,360
to go get Han Solo.

338
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,560
That's where Boba Fett is in.

339
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,560
Basque is in there.

340
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,760
Basque is another bounty hunter.

341
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,480
He's not a droid.

342
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,000
He is a, I forget.

343
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,320
He's kind of reptilian, isn't he?

344
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,800
Yeah.

345
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,440
Something like that.

346
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,480
I'm, people are going to be mad.

347
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,040
I don't know what, what alien species he is.

348
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,240
Boss is in there.

349
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,440
Kelsey Grammer's.

350
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:31,840
Boss?

351
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,080
Yeah.

352
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,480
Kelsey Grammer.

353
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,480
Cable character.

354
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,840
Stars character boss.

355
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,160
Yeah.

356
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,400
Yeah.

357
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,520
He's one of the bounty hunters.

358
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,880
Um, so yeah, anyway.

359
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,280
Uh.

360
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,680
As we all know, like that hyphen is a bonus.

361
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:50,960
Like, uh, more punctuation in a ride title has usually been a successful thing for Disney

362
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,920
in recent years.

363
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,560
It's been a big thing.

364
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:52,720
I guess so.

365
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,680
We make fun of all the dashes and doodads,

366
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,520
but they're, they're often on pretty great attractions and successful attractions.

367
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,080
You're right.

368
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,320
Yeah.

369
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,800
But it is a weird new modern thing to just as much as much many words and as many other

370
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,520
little things.

371
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,320
I don't know.

372
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,680
It's so many qualifiers.

373
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,040
Yeah.

374
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,800
But yes, you're never getting Space Mountain.

375
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,520
Yeah.

376
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,640
The branding is just has to be so the brand, like it just has to go through probably like

377
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,960
focus groups or something.

378
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,680
I don't know.

379
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,800
Um, which to this, to that end, I don't know.

380
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,920
This isn't so bad.

381
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,760
You get your all caps web sling.

382
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:33,680
And that's an interesting, I don't know why it has to be screamed at you, but, um, you

383
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,120
know, I guess it's, I guess it's fine.

384
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,840
You know, you're, we're getting off a little easier than other attractions.

385
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,080
Yeah.

386
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,400
Yeah.

387
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:38,880
It's fine.

388
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,520
Look, it's fine.

389
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,720
It's just, it's funny.

390
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,520
That's all it is.

391
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,400
It's a little silly.

392
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:48,640
We just want a little, we just, we yearn for the days of a simple name like, uh, uh,

393
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,600
mountain, big thunder mountain or space.

394
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,920
Don't forget railroad though.

395
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,360
Disneyland railroad.

396
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:55,680
Oh yeah.

397
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,680
No, no, big thunder mountain railroad.

398
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:57,920
All right.

399
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,320
That's fine.

400
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,280
That's complicated.

401
00:16:59,280 --> 00:16:59,600
Yeah.

402
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,080
Escape from the haunted mine, but zoom it would be today.

403
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,280
There's a, that's yeah.

404
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,280
With like, got some more punctuation at the end.

405
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,760
Exclamation point, like question mark, question mark, exclamation point.

406
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,000
Yeah.

407
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,280
Haunted mine.

408
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,960
I forgot already.

409
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,320
Jason, I happened to be in the park briefly yesterday and I was like, oh yeah, there's

410
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,360
ghosts on this ride.

411
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,640
I forgot that.

412
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,280
Big thunder.

413
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,680
Yeah.

414
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,400
It's a ghost.

415
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,200
Ghosts.

416
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,520
The ghosts are the reason that the train is out of control.

417
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,560
I was like, did we talk about that?

418
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,280
Yeah.

419
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,080
I think we did.

420
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,880
The spirits of the mountain are angry at all the mining.

421
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,600
There's a narration.

422
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,600
Uh, literally, uh, uh, there's on the train, the narration.

423
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:39,920
Yeah.

424
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,040
When you're on the train, it says big thunder and like talks about the spirits who have

425
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,320
made the train go out of control.

426
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,720
The guy, like at the beginning, the, the wildest ride in the wilderness.

427
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,440
We may have spent 45 minutes talking about this three years ago.

428
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,480
I don't remember any of them.

429
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,360
I don't think so.

430
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,360
I've never known about spirits.

431
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,280
He's Jason said we did talk about this.

432
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,240
I mean, if, hey, find me a sound bite, I could have.

433
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,000
Well, I think Dennis McNicholas brought it up as well because he wrote that script.

434
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,320
Sure.

435
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,760
And I think he was leaving supernatural stuff.

436
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:12,960
Okay.

437
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,400
Well, so anyway, so you don't see them.

438
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,200
They're just around.

439
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,600
Yeah, I know.

440
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,080
I guess they're like, they aren't coming out of the geysers.

441
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,360
It's a, again, I'm your guess is good as mine.

442
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,960
I was like, is there ghosts on this ride?

443
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,400
And Jason goes, oh yeah.

444
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,760
I go, oh, okay.

445
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,920
Anyway, I just might, maybe it's gone.

446
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,160
Maybe the piece of information out of my brain is gone.

447
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,520
I think it's the sort of thing like some of the older rides where it's like, well,

448
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,280
you can just enjoy this on the surface level.

449
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,080
But if you really dig down, we had a store, you know, we have a.

450
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,680
But that story of element is only available if you're on the train, which I find, I guess I like.

451
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,560
Cause like, if you're just on big thunder, you're just like, well, here we go.

452
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,520
Nah, blah, blah, blah.

453
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,560
And then that's it.

454
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,920
But if you're on the train.

455
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,560
Wait a minute.

456
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,600
Sorry, I got confused there.

457
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,360
You're saying that when you're taking the Disneyland railroad, they tell you about spirits.

458
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:57,520
Yes.

459
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:57,760
Yeah.

460
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,400
They wait.

461
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:58,640
Okay.

462
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,360
I missed that.

463
00:18:59,360 --> 00:18:59,600
All right.

464
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,000
All right.

465
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,720
Yeah, sorry, sorry.

466
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,920
Not the big thunder.

467
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,240
Okay.

468
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,800
Okay.

469
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,040
So I see that narrator.

470
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,440
Yes.

471
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:05,840
Weird.

472
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840
No, I don't think I know about this.

473
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,520
I couldn't, I couldn't remember.

474
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,560
And again, maybe we're going to look really foolish when somebody goes back.

475
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,080
Well, of course you talked about it.

476
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,000
We're going to get John Stewart.

477
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,480
We're going to have a posing clip that we.

478
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:18,800
Yeah.

479
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,680
We're going to just such hypocrites we will be.

480
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:21,840
Yeah.

481
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,240
I'll boot up the old Marvel Unlimited and read the comic series and see what they pull.

482
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,640
Sure.

483
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,120
We know they.

484
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,760
Sure, they're in there.

485
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,320
I'm just saying.

486
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,520
I completely forgot.

487
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,760
Bartamus Bullion is in the comics.

488
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,560
Yeah, I know.

489
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,400
We talked a little bit about that on the episode for sure.

490
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,800
Anyway, so we're talking about who?

491
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,440
It's Spider-Man?

492
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,040
Yeah, we're talking about web slayers.

493
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,280
Other park, the different park across the way.

494
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,640
Yeah, which has been open for about a year now.

495
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,200
About a year?

496
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,960
It's kind of hard to believe.

497
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,880
So maybe now we can evaluate it with a little bit of, you know, greater context.

498
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,040
We've done it a couple times now.

499
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,240
I think all of us.

500
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,720
Yes.

501
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,200
Yes.

502
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,240
And yeah, Mike and I were there a few days after it opened and Scott, you wrote.

503
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,680
Did you write it for the first time when we went with Griffin Newman?

504
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,320
I think so.

505
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,160
I'm trying to remember.

506
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,200
What's in my head is that I've done it three times, but I'm not exactly sure.

507
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,080
With that, let me say this.

508
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,920
And I don't want to put an air over this.

509
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:25,920
I don't want to chill the episode, but I might as well just be forthcoming and get the conversation

510
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,600
moving by saying this.

511
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,560
I do not like this.

512
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,040
I have landed there.

513
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,840
I'm not trying to, not trying to be negative, not trying to be an edge lord.

514
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,560
I have been, there were things about it that didn't sound that good to me when it was in

515
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,040
development.

516
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,440
I think we all talked about them, but I was hoping against hope that those things would

517
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,360
not end up bothering me in the final product.

518
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,560
And I think after a number of times and the three of us just did it together recently

519
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:58,400
on the hot dog canoe day, I think that's where I have to lock it in.

520
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:58,800
Okay.

521
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,760
You're locking it in now.

522
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,040
I don't want to lock mine in now.

523
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,960
Oh, you don't have to.

524
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,840
And maybe the conversation will lead us all to different opinions, but I feel like I should

525
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,240
just be clear and forthcoming about that.

526
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,880
But do you, am I, am I crazy?

527
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,520
Am I wrong?

528
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,600
Well, I think there's a lot to consider for this ride.

529
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:27,120
I mean, one, it has an uphill battle in that there is already a 20 plus year old Spider-Man

530
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,960
ride that you could argue is the best ride.

531
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,520
Maybe the best current running ride.

532
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,720
And I think the Tower of Terror in Orlando is giving it a run for its money.

533
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:47,280
They're tied kind of neck in neck in terms of like stuff I have loved at various ages

534
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,720
and still have stuck with me.

535
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,600
And I'm still delighted.

536
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,040
Tower of Terror and Spider-Man are the two best rides in the country.

537
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,040
Yes, in the country.

538
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,440
I have not been out of the United States much.

539
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,320
I have not seen the parks around the world, so I don't want to gauge on those.

540
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,600
I might have to toss all the Hagrid's in there.

541
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,880
I was pretty fond of Hagrid's.

542
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,040
Maybe time won't keep it a classic, but as far as like coming out of the gate, how much

543
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:17,680
I loved it on the day, I put that in a top of, because I was declaring it best ride in

544
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,280
Orlando, but I don't know.

545
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,880
That's just, might just be me.

546
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,360
Guardians is on my list.

547
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,440
It's better than the Orlando Tower of Terror.

548
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,480
So that's what I, yeah, I believe it is.

549
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,320
Do we talk about this?

550
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,120
I think so, yeah.

551
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,840
Okay.

552
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,760
And the reason it edges out is because the actual thrill part of it is more interesting

553
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,320
to me.

554
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,360
That's how it wins.

555
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:37,600
Yeah.

556
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:37,920
Wow.

557
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,680
I don't think that's insane.

558
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,000
Because it's an empty, because again, now I'm spoiled.

559
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,720
I'm spoiled by things to look at and enjoy while the actual drop stuff is going on.

560
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,440
Sure, sure.

561
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,160
But you're, yeah, something about this name, when that it is called a Spider-Man adventure,

562
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,680
it does almost feel like it is not the Spider-Man adventure.

563
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,640
Yes, that's in Florida and Japan.

564
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,640
And it is, yeah, boy, that is it.

565
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,280
That is awesome.

566
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:03,600
Right.

567
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,840
I was almost wondering if like, had we mythologized it too much to just hit us all the right way

568
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,680
in 99, 2000 or whatever, whenever we first did it.

569
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,640
And then when I was down there for that bachelor party, everybody was just like,

570
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,120
just blew their heads off.

571
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,400
It's so good.

572
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,360
It's really fun.

573
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:29,040
I have to say that the 90's Spider-Man cartoon, so by extension, the Spider-Man ride in Florida,

574
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,720
because it's pretty similar, like it's it's they've made some changes for the ride,

575
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,320
but that is my favorite portrayal of Spider-Man outside of the comics.

576
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,480
Like I think the more than any movies.

577
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,880
He's a little too handsome.

578
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,640
Yeah, he's a little too handsome, but he's he's kind of like regular kind of regular every man.

579
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:54,720
I think of the movies, I do think I like Tom Holland, the best of the actors who have played

580
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,680
Spider-Man.

581
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,120
I like Tobey Maguire as an actor.

582
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,800
I think he's a little too emo as as Peter Parker.

583
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,800
And I am excited to see Tom Holland.

584
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:10,400
The current status quo for the Tom Holland Spider-Man is a little more of down and out

585
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,640
as opposed to like awkward teen and down and out is kind of like when Peter Parker shines,

586
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,560
like he kind of the whole thing of the Spider-Man no way home.

587
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,320
Is that what it was called?

588
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,360
The newest one.

589
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,160
The newest one.

590
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,640
Yeah, OK.

591
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,600
They all have homes.

592
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,240
That's our day.

593
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,120
They're all homes.

594
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:36,080
Homes that is it kind of sold me like by the end of the movie, I'm like,

595
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,520
oh, yeah, suffering is it's kind of intrinsic to Spider-Man in the way that like,

596
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,560
yeah, Bruce Wayne is going to have dead parents, you know, like.

597
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,280
They have reversed engineered the origin of the original origin of Spider-Man in the movies now.

598
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,480
So this is spoiler alert.

599
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,400
If you haven't seen these home movies,

600
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,320
he starts out as like little Tony Stark, like mentee.

601
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,400
And then we get to the point at the end of the last movie where no one remembers he's

602
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,600
that Peter Parker is Spider-Man, including MJ, including his best friends.

603
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,200
And now he's like alone with no money and no one knows who he is.

604
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,320
Which I don't like when they did it in the comics because it was stupid.

605
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,360
And Scott, just so you know, when they did that storyline, this storyline in the comics,

606
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,120
it wasn't Dr. Strange doing magic to make everyone forgetting.

607
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,960
It was literally the devil.

608
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,520
Spider-Man made a deal with Mephisto, the devil.

609
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,520
Geez, so Sebastian Shackle.

610
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,440
So essentially made a deal with Sebastian Shackle.

611
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,200
Now, Scott, it's not Mr. Mastopheles, the character from Cats, right?

612
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,320
Yeah, that's from Cats.

613
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,400
It's not Mr. McPhisto.

614
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,440
Bono's character from the what, Pop Mart tour?

615
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:43,940
Yeah.

616
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,200
Or can we out that one of those live shows recently that you really wanted to come out

617
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,800
and say you were Mr. Mike Phisto?

618
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,760
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

619
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,120
Jason and I were like, might be going a tad obscure there.

620
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:55,620
Vetoed.

621
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:56,720
Yeah.

622
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,280
Just let me say the words I want to say, guys.

623
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,200
You didn't say it, but you were right.

624
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,840
Like I inferred what you meant is that we should do the full YouTube Pop Mart tour episode

625
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,440
before I come out and do that bit.

626
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:07,840
Oh, boy.

627
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,560
That's what you said.

628
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,000
Part three is going to be a very fraught place for me, especially.

629
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,560
I have thought about Mr. Mike Phisto before.

630
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,060
Yeah.

631
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,240
There's also a kind of a dirty, sexual thing.

632
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,960
And then that word Mike Phisto, like I don't want a weird.

633
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,880
I get you're the one finding it.

634
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,080
You found it in eating.

635
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,560
And Ash is not crazy.

636
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,600
That's not crazy.

637
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,320
Eating ash.

638
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,320
No, but I didn't hear it right away.

639
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,960
But well, you're more like Phisto again.

640
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,480
We're just getting deep into your.

641
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,920
This is like, yeah, this is a name you imagine yourself having.

642
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,240
No.

643
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,960
OK, there's no I'm not thinking about fisting.

644
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,800
OK, that's I don't want to be too bawdy on the main feed here.

645
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,640
This is what they say that you get on Club Three.

646
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,320
That's to they say that a hero can save us and Mike Phisto is not going to stay here and wait.

647
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,440
Although I guess it's just like Kit Phisto, the Star Wars character.

648
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,000
That's true.

649
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,040
And that's I guess who I don't know anything about, but I assume is really good at.

650
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,440
Well, that's a George.

651
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,560
That's in George Envision.

652
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,920
That was the characters kind of the ultimate fister.

653
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,720
The opening day, we went to Galaxy's Edge.

654
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:20,560
Mike was really considering that he was very delighted by the Kit Phisto statuette.

655
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,360
Yeah, well, he loves all the fistos out there.

656
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,360
He's finally with his brethren.

657
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:25,840
Are you talking?

658
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,440
I think you're talking about Plo Koon.

659
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,280
Was it Plo Koon?

660
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,200
I think you're thinking of the Plo Koon statue.

661
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,760
I don't know.

662
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,040
We were going through a kid.

663
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,640
Fisto phase at the time.

664
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,600
So there might have been a kid.

665
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,720
Fisto toy or something.

666
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,800
This don't Plo Koon are Jedis.

667
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,040
Yeah.

668
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,520
So anyway, not pod racers, not pod racers.

669
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,200
It's not Klo Poon, which that would be sexual.

670
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,000
That would be sexual.

671
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,160
Yeah.

672
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,360
His name was Klo Poon.

673
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,040
Maybe that.

674
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,280
I mean, look, there's going to be a lot of streaming shows.

675
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,520
So maybe Plo Koon has a brother.

676
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,160
Well, you know, why not?

677
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,160
Disney wants to get as much Star Wars out there as they can.

678
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:10,720
Why not be the first corporation to embrace their own, not a triple X porn parody?

679
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,160
Why not start?

680
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:17,120
They allow these odd little podunk companies to make the porn parodies.

681
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,160
Disney should.

682
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,640
Yeah.

683
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,160
Disney plus XXX.

684
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,520
Imagine the announcement, like the upfronts kind of thing, where Chay Peck comes out and then

685
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:32,080
he kind of like then Tinkerbell shows up and she like stands on top of the plus and then it tips

686
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,960
to become an X.

687
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,000
And then she makes two more X's of here with the pixie dust.

688
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,040
That's right.

689
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,800
Transitions from like, and that's why we're excited about the subscriber growth of hot star

690
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,600
services in Asia.

691
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,760
And now moving on to other streaming territories.

692
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,000
If I could get the red lights, please.

693
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,800
Oh, Tink, what are you doing here?

694
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,960
I think they've got a Disney probably secretly owns a bunch of adult companies.

695
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,680
Oh, yeah.

696
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,120
It's just time for them to come up.

697
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,960
Because if the goal is 12 new Star Wars series every year, they're eventually going to run out

698
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,640
and have to start doing porn.

699
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:14,960
Yeah.

700
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,360
Porno.

701
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:15,760
Yeah.

702
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:22,560
They bought the rights for the James Gunn web series that is a parody of the Bang Bust,

703
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,600
but they just pick people up and give people rides with Craig Robinson.

704
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,560
We all remember this James Gunn project, right?

705
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,360
James Gunn directed.

706
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,600
I'm sure it's not a thing he would like people to forget.

707
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,560
I don't remember.

708
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,920
Well, Google it, I guess.

709
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,400
From the minds that brought you guardians of the galaxy.

710
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,400
The twisted, beautiful twisted mind, I think is what they said in the Suicide Squad trailer.

711
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,280
You're two descriptors of the mind.

712
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,440
That's what it was, if I recall correctly.

713
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,240
Not twisted.

714
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,040
Come on, give me a say something nice, too.

715
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,360
Yeah.

716
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,480
No, it is a compliment.

717
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,920
Yeah, but like, you know.

718
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,960
Twisted is cool.

719
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,040
Say something nice about how my mind looks.

720
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,540
Yeah.

721
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,680
I've lost my mind.

722
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,640
I was saying I like Tom Holland.

723
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:08,000
I hadn't seen that lip sync battle performance where he like really does some crazy dancing

724
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,520
and stuff, and then I found out the context of that was like years old.

725
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,920
He'd only been Spider-Man in one movie or so.

726
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:21,280
I think it was to promote the first like movie with Zendaya and she is on it and he's like

727
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,920
dancing towards her and they hadn't started dating yet.

728
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,920
That's the moment.

729
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,560
He's very like flirty and everything.

730
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,800
But then he fully commits to a very complicated dance routine and just does an insane flip.

731
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,200
He can do a lot of those flips himself.

732
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,400
He does flip.

733
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,520
I think he flips more than Garfield and McGuire, for sure.

734
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:49,200
Yeah, so my respect went way up for him in that respect.

735
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,400
I like Colin DeLau, too.

736
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,760
I think it's a good take on the character.

737
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:59,440
I think in the 2000s, I really think Gyllenhaal would have been interesting if they had gone

738
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,560
with that recasting.

739
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,920
I think Topher Grace, too, probably would have been a good Peter Parker.

740
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,000
I agree and instead he was Venom.

741
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,720
He was Eddie Brock.

742
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,720
Topher Grace was Venom before.

743
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,760
Oh, that's who that is.

744
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,080
Yeah, before Eminem did the Venom song.

745
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,720
He could come back.

746
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,160
He could come back.

747
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,800
He could come back.

748
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,000
Everyone can come back.

749
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,960
Yeah, so Spider-Man, I'm a big fan of that first.

750
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,600
Yeah, the original ride is unbelievable and I don't know how you...

751
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,640
Well, I guess I do.

752
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,360
There was the rumors for a while a couple years ago.

753
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,680
I think we all remember when we would look at patents for ride systems that never made it.

754
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,600
It's still happening.

755
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,160
It's still happening.

756
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,920
They just announced the one with the vehicle damage, which is a pretty cool idea.

757
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,200
And there was something a couple years ago.

758
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,600
It was like a swinging sort of mechanism that would be like hanging from a coaster kind of

759
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,240
a thing that would be going through like big practical cities.

760
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,960
I guess that could be the ultimate Spider-Man attraction.

761
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,760
The one in Orlando is pretty perfect.

762
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,120
Well, let me say this.

763
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,480
This might be issue number one for me.

764
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:14,240
If you want to live out fantasies of the character, which is not necessarily what this attraction

765
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,200
is going for, but it is giving you...

766
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,120
It's creating a construct where you get to shoot webs.

767
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,440
And I'm like, is that...

768
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,840
Now, granted, I'm not really a Spider-Man kid or anything, but I think it's never occurred to me

769
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,400
to want to shoot webs.

770
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:38,240
Now, shooting webs up to a tree over there so I can swing really far.

771
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,120
Now, that's something.

772
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,640
And that's kind of what you get to do in the Islands of Adventure ride.

773
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:52,160
To me, the important part is the swinging around, not the shooting objects, which just sounds...

774
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,400
Well...

775
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,600
Look, if I look down at my own wrist and a weird,

776
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,960
gucky substance came out of it, I'd be really freaked out.

777
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,240
I don't think I want that at all.

778
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,520
So, yeah.

779
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,480
So, okay.

780
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,600
So, a couple things.

781
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,920
First of all, in Canon, and they just address this in the new movie,

782
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,280
Garfield makes his own...

783
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,960
A mechanical web shooter.

784
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,840
Does Garfield?

785
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,640
Garfield has it.

786
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,680
Garfield has it.

787
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,560
And the other two don't.

788
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,480
Tom Holland has mechanical.

789
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:23,840
They do.

790
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,720
This is Andrew Garfield.

791
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,240
The character Garfield is not...

792
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,880
So, the cat doesn't come out in the multiverse.

793
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,960
The dog sleeping at my feet does not shoot webs.

794
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,320
Not the dog who's here right now.

795
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,560
Andrew Garfield.

796
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,800
Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland do the...

797
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,960
Spider-Man has made web shooters because he's also a brilliant scientist.

798
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,240
That is Canon in the comics.

799
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,680
Tobey Maguire has organic web shooters.

800
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:51,120
He has a little hole in his wrist that they explain in the movie.

801
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,480
Oh, I do not want this.

802
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:52,880
Yes.

803
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,240
And there is a gag where they're like, wait, you just do that?

804
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,440
They're in the new movie.

805
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,960
The three of them are standing around.

806
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,720
Spoiler alert, they're all in the new movie.

807
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:06,960
There was two days before they started doing TV spots where they're all standing around.

808
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,840
A shocker.

809
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,200
Who could have a med?

810
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,160
It certainly didn't seem for eight months ahead of time.

811
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,840
Like, that's where it was going.

812
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,600
They were not constantly spotted by shooting locations.

813
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,680
One of them did not immediately leak it while doing press for another project.

814
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,360
Yeah.

815
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,360
Yeah.

816
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:31,120
I guess I'm agreeing with you that the swinging has always been the thing,

817
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,520
regardless of which Spider-Man it was.

818
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,240
That's the big thing.

819
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,560
That's when the first video game came out that was pretty good.

820
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,400
And I forget which system it was even for.

821
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,560
The whole big thing was, oh, wow, the swinging is the thing.

822
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,800
That's the transformational experience you would want to have in an attraction

823
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,760
or a video game or in your deepest dreams, your biggest fantasies.

824
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,680
Swinging and your deepest desires.

825
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,480
Swinging and tying guys up.

826
00:34:59,280 --> 00:34:59,920
Well, I don't know.

827
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,040
Tying guys up, I don't.

828
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,800
Webbing bad guys.

829
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,360
I see what you're saying.

830
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,640
Webbing bad guys.

831
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,520
Sure, sure.

832
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,960
So like when we were younger.

833
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,120
That's what I was searching for, in your web dreams.

834
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,720
In your web dreams.

835
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,200
What is your deepest fantasy in your web dreams?

836
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:19,840
Shooting your bullies at school with your organic web shooters that come out of your

837
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,120
webs that come out of your wrist.

838
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:21,620
Yeah.

839
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,040
Yeah, yeah.

840
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,480
That was number two, I think.

841
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,840
That was number two.

842
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,360
And then I guess number three would be like shooting a little web at your bully's mouth

843
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,600
to cover his mouth so he can't talk anymore.

844
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,320
So you're like, shut up, pal, or whatever.

845
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,560
But yes, the swinging is the thing.

846
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,240
So yeah, well, I want to go through the whole queue and everything.

847
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,680
But yes, let's just start with this.

848
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,840
Absolutely, that's the thing.

849
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:48,160
And I don't think you don't have to be a Spider-Man expert to think that.

850
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,680
That's, I'm sure, 99% of everyone who ever thought they could be Spider-Man or wanted

851
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,440
to be Spider-Man was like, the number one thing I want to do is fly through the air.

852
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,040
You've got a character with his own built-in ride mechanism.

853
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,440
Yes.

854
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,800
He has one.

855
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,720
And you do, you get to do it incredibly in the universal.

856
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,360
Right.

857
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,760
The webbing is concussive.

858
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,200
It's like blasts.

859
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,200
And Spider-Man has shot web bolts.

860
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,560
Occasionally, shoots little web bullets basically to knock guys out.

861
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:26,000
Yeah, so if you're breaking down what's going on, he's shooting a little hard piece of webbing

862
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,320
that can hit something.

863
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,680
And it's hard as a robot and blow it up.

864
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,120
He's not using the web.

865
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:37,680
I assume the web, when you get hit with a normal web stream, it's kind of soft.

866
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,120
There's a little impact.

867
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,240
But he is doing something.

868
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,320
I don't know exactly how he, you know, because he, of course, makes this motion with his

869
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:44,560
hands.

870
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:51,360
He puts the two fingers down on his web shooters or in Toby's case, on his own biology.

871
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:52,960
Biology.

872
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,240
In his own hand.

873
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,040
Goo holes.

874
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,880
When you shoot your soft stream goo out of your biology.

875
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,480
Toby uses his own biology to shoot.

876
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,480
So, so yeah, so basically there's got to be something different,

877
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:15,520
that you do to make the web harder, to make it a hardened piece of projectile webbing.

878
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,880
Why do all the shooting right?

879
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,360
We got so gross in Toy Story Mania.

880
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:19,840
I don't know.

881
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,280
Gross here in web slingers.

882
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,920
They had it in various video games.

883
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,680
They would have different kinds of webbing or different tricks and stuff, different costumes,

884
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,240
the armor.

885
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:33,360
He had this silvery armor for one or a handful of issues in the comics.

886
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:33,600
Right.

887
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,920
He specifically uses it to fight slash help.

888
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,320
Wilson Fisk's son, the Rose.

889
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,600
Did you call him Wilson Fisk?

890
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,040
Wilson Fisk.

891
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,600
Okay, good.

892
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,960
Wilson Fisk's son.

893
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,440
Thank God.

894
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:44,880
The Rose.

895
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,160
And then a character named Nightwatch, Marvel's Nightwatch, who is just Spawn.

896
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,000
They just had a character that was Spawn.

897
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,640
After Todd McFarland left and created Spawn, they created a character.

898
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,560
It's very much like wrestling comic books, where people are just like,

899
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,520
I'm just going to do this.

900
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,360
I'm just going to do Batman.

901
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:03,840
Yeah, yeah.

902
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,200
So, yeah.

903
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,880
So there's precedent for him using the webbing like this,

904
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,760
but he's almost exclusively using webbing on this ride in this way,

905
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,240
which is not the primary way the webbing is used.

906
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,520
No.

907
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:25,760
So yes, you are 100% correct that if you want the experience of Spider-Man,

908
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,800
you want to swing, you want to do some creative stuff with it.

909
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:34,000
You don't want to just flail your arms wildly, shooting hard pieces of web

910
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:41,040
at an onslaught of robots that just is coming at you at an insane fast rate.

911
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:42,960
Boy, oh boy.

912
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:49,360
Now you can web, if you move your hand forward and pull to the side,

913
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,480
you can web a spider bot and fling it at a bunch of other.

914
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,320
But then the onslaught of spiders, spider bots keep coming

915
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,200
and you start panicking going, ah, and then your hands just go.

916
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,320
You stop thinking of all the fun creative ways maybe you could use.

917
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,200
Any moment of strategy is tough to kind of stick with and keep.

918
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,400
You know what we might owe, and I think a lot of listeners know this,

919
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,960
but just like, since we haven't said spider bot before,

920
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,240
can we just synopsize this?

921
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

922
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,480
They're these cute little guys.

923
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,520
They're cute little guys.

924
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:21,760
Done, man.

925
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,320
I'm going to the next part of it.

926
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,600
Start webbing, cute little guys.

927
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,200
You're at an open house at Peter Parker's, at the lab.

928
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,840
Okay.

929
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,200
So this is, yeah.

930
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,040
It's a new creation for the theme park universe.

931
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,160
It's not in the movies.

932
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,920
It's not in the comics, which I like this.

933
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,720
I like the idea they've built out of mythology just for the theme park.

934
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:47,440
The thing at Avengers campus, which is a place for the Avengers to work and live and wave.

935
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,000
And wave.

936
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,560
Yeah.

937
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,920
And have beers.

938
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,200
Have beers that get poured.

939
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,080
Shoot up from the bottom.

940
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,880
Yeah, from the bottom.

941
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,840
Opposite pour.

942
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,340
Yeah.

943
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,440
So yes, it's an institute.

944
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,240
It's where the young minds of the Marvel universe, Marvel theme park universe come together.

945
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:04,960
Yes.

946
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,680
It's WEB, the Worldwide Engineering Brigade.

947
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:07,920
Yes.

948
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:15,440
A complicated acronym, which is ironic because this attraction was delayed due to the worldwide

949
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,560
COVID pandemic.

950
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:17,520
What is that?

951
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,080
The worldwide COVID pandemic is not the Worldwide Engineering Brigade.

952
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,200
No, don't.

953
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,720
I know you were confused.

954
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,520
I know you were confused.

955
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,320
Don't be confused.

956
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:33,920
So yeah, so it's now built into the canon of Avengers campus and Peter Parker played

957
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,440
by Tom Holland, who's in the ride.

958
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,160
And it's fun now because I feel like they lock all these people into making sure they're

959
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,040
in the ride.

960
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,920
Sure they don't get any extra money, but that's the difference now that you get to see like

961
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,120
the most famous version at the moment of these famous version of this character at the moment

962
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,680
in the ride.

963
00:40:53,040 --> 00:41:00,160
And he is creating spider bots that are cute as they're little guys, as Jason said, and

964
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,160
they're like, they look like little toys.

965
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,720
They sell the actual toys too, which is very smart.

966
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,640
And he's built these spider bots, I guess, to help build stuff.

967
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,800
They build and tear things down.

968
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,200
They can eat up something really quick.

969
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,560
But then scram with all its little legs, you know, put something together.

970
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,360
They're like 3D printers, I guess.

971
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,160
Yeah.

972
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,840
But then also the opposite of it.

973
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,200
They're 3D destroyers.

974
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:32,240
Yeah, break down material and then build new things with it.

975
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,080
And the only there's it starts with one and he's doing his presentation and focusing on

976
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,800
us, but he's kind of all over the map a little bit.

977
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,200
So he doesn't realize that the one multiplies and multiplies and multiplies.

978
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,880
And before you're out of that pre-showroom, there are so, so many.

979
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:55,360
And what is what was meant to be an open house at Webb becomes now a mission through

980
00:41:55,360 --> 00:42:01,920
Avengers campus with high stakes, as they say, to help Spider-Man take down all these

981
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,800
spider bots.

982
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,300
Yeah.

983
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,720
So compliments on this ride.

984
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,360
Yeah, it is the most current.

985
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,640
It is Tom Holland.

986
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,960
It's the one that everyone sees in the movies at the movie theater and the big blockbusters.

987
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,640
All the kids like, you know, go to see the Spider-Man they know.

988
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,720
Also, the ride, you get to go through the locations from Avengers campus.

989
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:25,840
Yes.

990
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,520
A positive, very fun.

991
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,240
Yeah, like that.

992
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:28,720
Sure.

993
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:35,840
Together makes it a coherent little ecosystem in a very galaxy's edge way where you land

994
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,280
the Millennium Falcon and you see all the other stuff in B2.

995
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,880
I like that they're tying stuff together and making them tangible places.

996
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,880
Including not to jump too far ahead, the Avengers Quinjet hangar.

997
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,880
Take a good look and enjoy it now because you're probably not going to see it for a

998
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,600
while.

999
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,880
So yes, because that's where the building.

1000
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,520
Yeah, right.

1001
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,320
Yeah, that's where the ticket was going to be.

1002
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:02,320
But that is not, I don't think on anyone's radar right now in the Imagineer.

1003
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:07,200
I mean, it's on their radar, but it's not in the money, money side of things.

1004
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,960
The spider bots got in there.

1005
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,240
Yeah, destroyed the plans.

1006
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,600
They destroyed the plans and went and filled out a bunch of pink slips for all the people

1007
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,960
working on the ride.

1008
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,600
Oh no, they ate all the shareholders value and turned it into pink slips.

1009
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,440
They just, oh, and the spider bots also went to all the Imagineers in California's houses

1010
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,160
and destroyed them.

1011
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,440
They're going to have to move to Florida.

1012
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,240
Made them move.

1013
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,560
They built a new campus.

1014
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,560
At that terrible lake.

1015
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,120
Across the country.

1016
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,000
At that terrible lake.

1017
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,960
Jason ate.

1018
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,480
Hey, I think history has come around and proven me right when the governor of the state is

1019
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,560
openly hostile to the company that is relocating here in Florida.

1020
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,280
The issue remains, why do you hate the lake so much?

1021
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,000
You hate that body of water.

1022
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
You're so mad at Lake Nona.

1023
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,480
That's just the name of the prefab, realtor, pseudo neighbor.

1024
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,040
No, but it's a big, no, it isn't just where the Imagineers live because people wrote us

1025
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,560
and said Lake Nona is cool.

1026
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,760
It isn't the entire, it's not only the Disney.

1027
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,400
Lake Nona, you're thinking, okay, here's what's going on.

1028
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,960
Jason's thing of Lake Nona is an idea, is an idea, concept.

1029
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,400
The concept of moving to Florida, Lake Nona represents to you, right?

1030
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,560
Well, I think it's just like the idea of moving to Westwood or like if all of Westwood was

1031
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,160
like the Americana mall.

1032
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,080
But I don't think that's true.

1033
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,800
I don't think it's only planned housing for Imagineers.

1034
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,200
They may move there.

1035
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,160
I think it exists.

1036
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,840
I think, yeah, that is there.

1037
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,040
But there's a greater community and I think a very nice lake.

1038
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,520
I'm sure the lake is nice.

1039
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,040
No, I'm sure the lake is nice.

1040
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,120
We don't support, okay, we don't support the move to Florida.

1041
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:49,200
No, but the lake visually might be nice and that's what we've heard.

1042
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:49,600
Sure.

1043
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,880
That's really what we're talking about.

1044
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,560
It's like a real city that isn't just a place that they made a Imagineers move.

1045
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,360
That's what I'm saying.

1046
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,560
The Florida government.

1047
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,840
And the end of the airplane runways that it butts up against are beautiful, really good.

1048
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,360
Can you provide, this is, so you're saying this is like if you live there, your building will shake.

1049
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,640
We'll need a Google map.

1050
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,600
We gotta get a Google map.

1051
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,640
We, I don't know.

1052
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,360
You seem very confident that you know everything there is to know.

1053
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:17,200
We wouldn't know anything about airplanes shaking the locations we're in.

1054
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,400
But we love Burbank though.

1055
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,520
Yeah, we do love Burbank.

1056
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,040
So it's not a problem.

1057
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,440
Yeah, it's not in the middle of Florida.

1058
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,200
Lake Nona here.

1059
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,520
I'm still, you're standing in Sofa.

1060
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,480
You hate Lake, we gave you a chance to say you don't hate Lake Nona.

1061
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,000
You hate Lake Nona.

1062
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,880
There's a Nona Golf Club and Country Club right next to there.

1063
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,960
Oh boy, I bet the members of that are nice.

1064
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:40,880
This is funny.

1065
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,120
So anyway, Lake Nona, there's still by the way planning on, again, I don't want to make it,

1066
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:47,920
I want to make it clear.

1067
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,960
I don't think that the Imagineers should have to be forced to move to Florida.

1068
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,440
No, we're not.

1069
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,400
I think we're very clear about that.

1070
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,520
We're very clear about that.

1071
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,520
I'm saying you have to remove not all of Lake Nona as an evil place.

1072
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,760
Have we not convinced you of this?

1073
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,040
No, I think I've come back around to my original position of like,

1074
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,440
oh, this kind of sucks that you got to uproot.

1075
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,040
No, that's not what we're saying.

1076
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,880
We don't like that they had to move.

1077
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,120
I think I've gotten an obscene amount of like YouTube ads for like,

1078
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,720
start your tech, you know, start your tech startup in Lake Nona.

1079
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,280
Like live, work.

1080
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,560
You've gotten ads for Lake Nona?

1081
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,480
I've gotten ads for Lake Nona.

1082
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:22,880
Yeah.

1083
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,120
What?

1084
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,080
I've watched enough Florida based theme park stuff.

1085
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,240
Oh my gosh, I got to see these ads.

1086
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,160
Look, Lake Nona is a place that has biomedical research facilities

1087
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,520
and a college of nursing.

1088
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,280
You aren't mad at those, are you?

1089
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:35,920
I think he is.

1090
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,560
I think he is.

1091
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,480
I think he hates the nursing school.

1092
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,160
He hates every bit Lake Nona.

1093
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,520
You want to wipe off the earth.

1094
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,640
I don't know that the people going to that nursing school

1095
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,080
are going to be able to live anywhere near that nursing school

1096
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:51,120
with the current push to gentrify.

1097
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,760
Are you familiar with what happens when areas get gentrified

1098
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,440
like Silver Lake or Los Feliz?

1099
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:58,480
Yes.

1100
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,720
But that's what they are literally trying to do to this Lake Nona community.

1101
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,600
You're sure that the people who work at the hospital can't?

1102
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,760
Look, there's only one thing to do here.

1103
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,160
Lake Nona episode has to happen.

1104
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,680
Like everywhere else.

1105
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,400
We're going to have to do it.

1106
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,240
I don't understand what the problem is.

1107
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,960
Like every other city in America, the crunch of housing costs and stuff

1108
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,680
is getting worse and worse in central Florida.

1109
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,480
So I think it's a net negative to force.

1110
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,800
The forcing is not.

1111
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,800
We don't like the forcing.

1112
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,960
Look, I don't know what your two problem is.

1113
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,360
You're so.

1114
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:33,600
No.

1115
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,080
Okay.

1116
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:34,560
Okay.

1117
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,360
Hold on.

1118
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,880
I feel like we've explained this 10 times.

1119
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,920
I don't understand this bit.

1120
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:39,920
The bit is funny.

1121
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,400
Okay.

1122
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,880
The first time we ever talked about Lake Nona,

1123
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,640
I think what had happened is you were,

1124
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,920
it sounded like you were just trashing whatever Lake Nona was.

1125
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,920
Assuming that it's like a planned community

1126
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,240
that's only a place they make people live.

1127
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,840
Or it was just like kind of a desolate bad place to live.

1128
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:01,360
Now, maybe actually what you meant really was that you were just in general upset

1129
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,000
about them moving the imaginary people to Lake Nona,

1130
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,720
which we don't like.

1131
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,040
Might have been coming out, which we agree with you.

1132
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:07,600
Yes.

1133
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,400
I'm using it as shorthand to like force.

1134
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,120
But that's what we're saying.

1135
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:11,520
That's not.

1136
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,960
Tons and tons of employees.

1137
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,560
In the first episode, you were coming off,

1138
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,960
like you were saying you hated that actual place

1139
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,360
and that was a terrible place to live.

1140
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,320
And then we got a few, just a couple messages of people saying,

1141
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,360
well, Lake Nona is actually kind of nice and I like Lake Nona.

1142
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:29,040
Like, yeah, I am sure the neighborhoods are plenty nice.

1143
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:35,600
I'm saying whatever mixed use horror show of like overpriced apartments and work, live,

1144
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:40,640
we work bullshit that they are forcing people to uproot their lives from Southern California,

1145
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,200
which is great, and move to Florida,

1146
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,480
which has now become openly hostile towards the employees

1147
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,080
and the company they're working for.

1148
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,040
Of course, we don't.

1149
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,880
The Florida government, we don't.

1150
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,320
It's a shit show over there.

1151
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:52,960
Yeah, we hit.

1152
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,280
Oh, yeah.

1153
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:53,760
Florida's one of them.

1154
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,640
But it was just funny.

1155
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,800
The first time you were ever talking about it was just funny

1156
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,120
because it sounded like you had been to like Nona,

1157
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,520
knew everyone door to door was shitty

1158
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,120
and the place was like a wasteland of like sludge and stuff.

1159
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,360
So that's what we were joking about the first time.

1160
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,480
And that's why people.

1161
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,040
So I think also to justify this joke,

1162
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,680
which I honestly I didn't want us to take a whole part of.

1163
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:13,920
Sure.

1164
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,400
No, not the.

1165
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,880
I was just making a quick joke just to call back to it.

1166
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,480
But the reason I think I thought that that what we were saying made sense

1167
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,840
because people email this being like, oh, I think like Nona is pretty good.

1168
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,280
A couple of people mentioned it.

1169
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,280
So I think that's what how it was coming off.

1170
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,200
I guess you just in general being mad.

1171
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:36,160
No, I was using it as shorthand to refer to whatever this Disney creative campus

1172
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,880
because that's what all the articles were just using short.

1173
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,880
When you say like, no, no me.

1174
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1175
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,200
I mean the concept.

1176
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:45,440
Yes.

1177
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,000
So there so what so what I can get you to agree to is

1178
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,440
is there are people in Lake Nona who have nothing to do with any of this and the lake itself isn't a problem.

1179
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,680
That's that's where the disagreement came from.

1180
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,640
And that's what was funny about it, because I think people like like Scott and I was backing up.

1181
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,240
We were saying where you just came off like you were like saying this lake looks like shit,

1182
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:08,480
like the physical lake looks like shit and it's a bad place to live that area.

1183
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,400
I mean, yeah, sure.

1184
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:20,800
I don't think this is worth the amount of ire it's getting you guys worked up in.

1185
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,600
I'm not mad.

1186
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,720
I just think it's funny.

1187
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,360
The way that it played out is funny.

1188
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,680
And then me calling it back, I think is funny.

1189
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,920
But I didn't mean I didn't mean it to go back here.

1190
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,320
I just thought last time we said it, it was like fun.

1191
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,080
Like I thought it had been settled.

1192
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:34,880
That's all.

1193
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,240
Yeah, no, I think I thought it was settled as well.

1194
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,600
I'm sorry for I just.

1195
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,680
But OK, anyway, I think we've said our.

1196
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,280
I guess we move on.

1197
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,200
I think we're mostly on the same page.

1198
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,200
That's I think it was just like I think we all mostly agree on everything.

1199
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:49,920
I think so.

1200
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,080
Yeah, I guess that's why I'm confused why you are so confused.

1201
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:58,160
Because I was just making a call back to the joke about you hating the lake itself.

1202
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,840
I said that Lake Jason hates, which is just I think I miss that bit.

1203
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,200
That there's always there's been a lot of confusion.

1204
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,160
I think there's been a lot of time it ever came up.

1205
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:08,560
Yes.

1206
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,120
And now we leave it to the listener to sort out.

1207
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,880
And do parse through.

1208
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,160
You figure out what happened.

1209
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,360
Now we got to this point.

1210
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:15,840
I remember.

1211
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,200
OK, so right before we started into this discussion of it, I remember going,

1212
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,720
oh, yeah, I can make a joke about like the old like donut thing, which we did to like

1213
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,800
there were two mentions of, I think on the show.

1214
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,080
I said, oh, this will be a funny little callback where I say, oh, Jason hates that lake.

1215
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:28,880
And then here we are.

1216
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,960
I we had the same conversation again, too.

1217
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,480
So yeah, I just I honestly I didn't mean it.

1218
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:40,720
I just we have to what we have to do is put this aside and and this has to be about teamwork.

1219
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,680
Because that is the message of the web of this ride.

1220
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:43,760
Yes.

1221
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,720
And a web in general.

1222
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,000
Well, and that's what web is all about is teamwork.

1223
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,200
Yeah, we know this.

1224
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:49,920
Yes, it's true.

1225
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:55,200
They that is why you go on this attraction and you are thinking I got to get a better score

1226
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:55,920
than everybody.

1227
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,600
But that's not what you should be thinking.

1228
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:57,760
Right.

1229
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,440
You have to be working together.

1230
00:51:59,440 --> 00:51:59,680
Yes.

1231
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:05,840
Which is a notion that I only understood after watching several YouTube videos and that I don't

1232
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,200
understand based on this going on the ride.

1233
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,400
Yeah, it's also like kind of set up idiot proof.

1234
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,040
So you can't work against each other.

1235
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,200
I guess you could work.

1236
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:22,240
Oh, no, I was curious of what happens if you go on if you have four people in your party

1237
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,120
and no one slings whips if you just sit.

1238
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,560
Does it just start to Spider-Man just take care of everything because it just has to move along.

1239
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:35,040
And there's certain beats of it and certain, you know, you move from up here, you move down

1240
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:40,560
south and Spider-Man is in the cage and the Tavern collection and it drops like all that's

1241
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,160
going to happen no matter what.

1242
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:47,280
Yeah, it seems like there's like a base animation here that's going to happen and you just you add

1243
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,680
you it's customized based on what you do.

1244
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,960
And there are different things and like secrets and stuff in the same way the Toy Story has

1245
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,520
like kind of unlock situations.

1246
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:00,320
But it's like the basic the basic version of it, I think plays out like you're saying in a normal

1247
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,800
way or what the normal way for the program is.

1248
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:09,040
But yeah, I don't the ride is still too popular to like go on and have a fun like don't shoot

1249
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:14,000
anything like there's not like if you're going on it like I don't know that I've seen any videos of

1250
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,880
like look what I did.

1251
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,240
I want to web shooters and I lied down on the seat look like look what happened.

1252
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,240
We're not experimenting like you would be with a ride that's been there for a decade.

1253
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:27,600
The line has never not been very long that I have seen.

1254
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,200
And let me say this.

1255
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:37,680
The thing that has become my the torch that I'm carrying, I guess, skippable versus unskippable

1256
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,400
cues.

1257
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,440
This is the most skippable cue I've ever seen.

1258
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:46,240
You're standing in that you're just going around and around in that courtyard is like two like

1259
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:51,440
weird gun inventions and four signs with a with a scientist on it.

1260
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,120
And I've only done it and it's been 50 minutes.

1261
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,640
I would know the pre show.

1262
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,600
I like I like Tom Holland fun little routine.

1263
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,760
I like that when they auto call Tony Stark and he goes, no, no, no, like that.

1264
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,440
But that outside cue I would love to never do again.

1265
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,200
It's kind of a heat trap.

1266
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:14,320
Yeah, you know, we could really use another thing from universal fans everywhere.

1267
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:15,600
Yeah.

1268
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,160
Well, they've got a bunch of gizmos everywhere.

1269
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,840
Why don't they invent some build them into the gizmos.

1270
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:31,680
I like the profiles of like the other geniuses, like the other not who's in there.

1271
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,760
Doreen Green Squirrel Girl is in there.

1272
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,920
The character Squirrel Girl, Lunella Lafayette, Moon Girl.

1273
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,120
She's friends with a giant dinosaur named Devil Dinosaur.

1274
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,240
Yeah, that's good.

1275
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,440
There's good little stuff.

1276
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,320
OK, yeah, you're right.

1277
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:50,400
The outside cue is not great.

1278
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,080
There's little signs, at least, that show other Marvel characters, which if you know

1279
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:58,160
the names like Jason, I know some of these names, you go, well, there's the name I know.

1280
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:58,800
Harley.

1281
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,720
And you get a little keener.

1282
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,680
That is the character's name.

1283
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:10,400
The character that I leaned over after the Avengers funeral scene and I went, who was that kid?

1284
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,520
You were like, it's the kid from Iron Man 3.

1285
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,720
I'm like, oh, yeah.

1286
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:19,040
Tony Stark befriends a kid in Iron Man 3.

1287
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,160
And he helps him rebuild the Iron Man suit.

1288
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,040
Is that what happens?

1289
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,880
He's kind of a boy genius, too.

1290
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,520
There's a lot of kid geniuses in the Marvel universe.

1291
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,760
Yeah, and this is like Mensa or the gifted program.

1292
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,400
I see.

1293
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,760
Webb, that's what Webb is.

1294
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,800
Were we in programs, the three of us, as we were kids?

1295
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,800
Because I was in the gifted program.

1296
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,440
Yeah, there's a lot of pressure on me in the gifted program.

1297
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,080
Oh, no, my brother was in it.

1298
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:48,160
And then later on, there was like an additional, like a more broader,

1299
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:56,400
gifted program that for whatever reason I was not put in, but I was allowed to go on the

1300
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,160
field trips that they got to go in on.

1301
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,120
I have no idea what the logic of this was.

1302
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,000
I did get to go.

1303
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,800
There would be like extra like the kids who were actors, like there would be workshops

1304
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,560
or stuff that I would occasionally get to do.

1305
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,160
Gifted, you were a gifted actor.

1306
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:10,640
Thank you.

1307
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:12,720
And still am.

1308
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,680
Still remain, yeah.

1309
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,800
Can't get arrested in this town, but I like that they guys know.

1310
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,480
Well, look, we need, listeners need to put us in things, okay?

1311
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,120
Podcasters only add additional.

1312
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,880
That's all our, that's our last thing.

1313
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,600
You said the quiet part loud, Mike.

1314
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,040
Hey, we're getting old.

1315
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,880
So yeah, now I've lost my train of thought on this.

1316
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:36,160
There's signs with some care, but you would agree that you could have the signs and then have.

1317
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:37,680
A better cue.

1318
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,480
Anything else.

1319
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,000
Yeah, because you're really just looping around.

1320
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,520
You know what I don't like is that you're going into this backstage area

1321
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:49,360
there's some forced perspective around there and there's a weird kind of crane piece that you're

1322
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:54,880
very far away from and you think that that's a big mechanical crane that's building some new exciting

1323
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,720
thing at Avengers campus.

1324
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:01,280
And then the queue gets you right to the bottom of it and the forced perspective is ruined.

1325
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,280
And you're like, this is just a little crane.

1326
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,480
It's a tiny crane.

1327
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,040
Yeah.

1328
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:09,920
An ant man, maybe it was an experiment at the labs that made it tiny.

1329
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,960
Slightly tiny.

1330
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:16,960
So yeah, no, the outside, like there needs to be some more like whimsy in that outdoor line.

1331
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,320
I don't think they're ever going to change it.

1332
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:22,720
There's not much room, but it is like, I don't, we really haven't talked about like

1333
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:28,880
cue patterns, the patterns of certain cues, like the way you kind of crisscross through.

1334
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,360
And for whatever reason, this one feels very unpleasant.

1335
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:36,000
I think it's like too confusing for me where I kind of like I'm going through the queue and I keep

1336
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,280
going, well, wait, what do I have to do?

1337
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,720
And you were kind of going looking ahead.

1338
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,520
I agree with you completely.

1339
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:47,040
There is a way that you can spread these things out where you feel like you have made progress.

1340
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:47,840
It's a psychological thing.

1341
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,200
Or you get like a big, you know, if like, if you're stuck in traffic,

1342
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,120
and then you get a surge, oh, actually we kind of, hey, we kind of went straight away

1343
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:59,600
there for a little bit and now I'm stuck again, but it felt good to go a little fast.

1344
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:03,920
And the more that you're clustered and just like, wait, there's another switchback and

1345
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,600
another switchback and another switchback.

1346
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,080
Totally.

1347
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:06,480
Yes.

1348
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,560
And it's, yeah, there's something, it could be the same amount of time you wait,

1349
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:15,040
but if the line is structured in the right way, it feels better.

1350
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,000
And I don't know, I don't have the equation for what that looks like.

1351
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,280
What's the good way to do it.

1352
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,520
But this feels, this is like one of the worst ones as far as making you feel like,

1353
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,040
oh God, where do we have?

1354
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:25,920
Oh, I'm confused.

1355
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,880
I thought we were closer.

1356
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,760
We're not closer.

1357
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,920
You know what I think it is is just physical footprints.

1358
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,600
And I understand that they are working with what they had to work with.

1359
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:37,760
This is built out of the shell of the, it's tough to be a bug theater and it's kind of

1360
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,280
amazing how little changed.

1361
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,520
I think they fit it all in that theater building.

1362
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,280
There's not a ton of space here.

1363
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,280
I was about to compliment the queue for rise of the resistance where you're,

1364
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,120
there's so many rooms and you don't feel like you're doing a lot of switchback.

1365
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:56,800
So it feels brisk even if you're in a long line because like new room, new thing to look at.

1366
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,600
But that's a huge physical footprint too.

1367
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:03,520
So that's some of the challenge that if you don't have a lot of space,

1368
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,720
to put that line, it can feel like a bummer to be there for a while.

1369
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:07,120
Yeah.

1370
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,480
And they, yeah, they did their best.

1371
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,320
There's not any, there's no room here.

1372
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:15,520
So I get it that this is what they needed to do, but it is a bad line.

1373
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:15,920
Yeah.

1374
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,760
It is a bad line to wait in.

1375
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,880
It's not great.

1376
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,680
It did have the virtual queue for the first little bit.

1377
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,280
It was open the day we were there.

1378
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,680
It was before the magic keys started.

1379
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,840
I think we bought one day tickets.

1380
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:33,840
We had to all like jump on our phones to do the 7 a.m. virtual queue.

1381
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:34,320
Got it.

1382
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:42,080
Got in the car and the group was pretty, like the group got called when I was pulling into

1383
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,120
the parking garage.

1384
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:43,440
Oh yeah.

1385
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,280
You were walking out of the parking garage.

1386
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,640
So it was a little stressful.

1387
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:50,800
And then like, I'm like running to get over there.

1388
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:55,360
And then you were like, oh, there's, they've been doing a buffer.

1389
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,280
This is like the third day it's been open.

1390
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,040
Like no one knows what's going on.

1391
00:59:59,040 --> 00:59:59,120
Yeah.

1392
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,560
It's like, oh, I should have double checked that before I like.

1393
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:05,040
You shouldn't have like dead sprinted.

1394
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:05,200
Yeah.

1395
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,560
Tom Cruise style sprinted.

1396
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:10,480
Tom Cruise with the arms, with the like very sharp arms.

1397
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:10,720
Yeah.

1398
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:11,120
Yeah.

1399
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:17,120
So yeah, that we, I guess we've still waited for a while on that one, but yeah, you can

1400
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:20,800
do Lightning Lane now for it, I guess, and skip.

1401
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:26,480
Although people just Lightning Lane that I was with yesterday and they still felt like

1402
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,920
they were waiting, like they went into the ride and they came out like 30 minutes later.

1403
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,480
And I was like, that was the Lightning Lane for like.

1404
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:32,880
Yeah.

1405
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:33,920
Like that took forever.

1406
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:38,720
I felt that with Lightning Lanes and with Rise and with this Spider-Man ride.

1407
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:39,120
Yeah.

1408
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:42,000
Lightning Lanes and Virtual Queues have still all made it.

1409
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,920
You're still given this thing like an hour minimum of like, it is not like you're suddenly

1410
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:48,880
just in there.

1411
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,520
Lightning Lane should get you right on the ride.

1412
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,160
Virtual Queue.

1413
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:52,720
Okay, sure.

1414
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,760
It's like you're waiting and there's a little extra, but like if you're paying

1415
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:00,160
$15 for one ride, you should walk onto the ride.

1416
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,600
You should be able to do as much like it shouldn't take 30 extra minutes.

1417
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,680
You paid an extra $15.

1418
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:10,960
Yeah, I know Kevin Perger has talked about this in his feature length, Defunct Land video

1419
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:15,840
about Fast Passes, but I was reading like posts on Reddit because we were talking about

1420
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:19,440
Lightning Lane and I was reading about Fast Pass Lightning Lane stuff where like former

1421
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,920
cast members were talking about doing it and the different like at some point in time,

1422
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:31,760
they had a red, green, yellow system and it would be based on like 10 to 1, 15 to 1,

1423
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:39,200
25 to 1, which would be like 10 Fast Pass guests to one regular guest and that's why

1424
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:44,240
Stand By Alliance would get so bloated because they were letting in.

1425
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,720
They had to make the Fast Pass seem like it was worth it.

1426
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,760
The trouble and in theory, you would want the Lightning Lane to be even more

1427
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,760
worth it because you're shelling out money.

1428
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:00,560
You're not just shelling out like the time to do the research of the Fast Pass or go

1429
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,320
and get a little ticket or whatever.

1430
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,800
My crazy or has Lightning Lane just made all of it much worse?

1431
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:12,160
I feel like the park was so pleasant right before Lightning Lane and lately just like,

1432
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,600
boy, everything's 45 minimum.

1433
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:20,320
Well, they're still I think inflating the times to make you buy Genie Plus and Lightning Lane.

1434
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:24,320
I was saying that the other day, but I was there a couple days ago and it was nothing

1435
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,280
but sizable.

1436
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
You were finding that lately the lines have been, I'll be honest, the last time I was there,

1437
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,200
which was yesterday, I didn't go on any rides so I actually didn't.

1438
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,240
Oh yeah, I only went on two because it was just one of those days.

1439
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:36,960
Oh, you went on the train.

1440
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:42,480
We went on the train and Mike got off at Toontown and I rode it back to Main Street and then rode

1441
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,280
it all the way again.

1442
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,920
You just raced in two loops?

1443
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:50,160
Yeah, my leg was really hurting yesterday so I was just taking, I rode the train and

1444
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,840
rode around a couple of times and went in some shops on Main Street and then got out of there.

1445
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:54,960
Wow, wow.

1446
01:02:54,960 --> 01:03:00,480
And we were at the front to get into the queue for the train and Jason asked the cast member

1447
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,880
there, he goes, is the Lily Bell running today?

1448
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,120
And she's like, no, sorry.

1449
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,840
I've been doing this for 10 years and it's never worked.

1450
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:08,400
It's never.

1451
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:14,560
Back in 2011, 2012, there was a lot of people online going like, if you go to City Hall

1452
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:19,440
and ask about the Lily Bell and it happens to be on the tracks and there's not a private

1453
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:24,560
party booked for it, you used to be able to get a certificate or a ticket that you present

1454
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:28,240
it to the conductors or to the train people and they would let you in.

1455
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,280
And I have never successfully done that.

1456
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,240
It's one of the things.

1457
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,440
I've happened to Mark Twain.

1458
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:38,320
I have not ridden in the nice decorated train car.

1459
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:39,440
It's your white whale.

1460
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,320
We gotta make that happen.

1461
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:45,920
Also yesterday we said how many trains are on the tracks because we were waiting a while

1462
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,320
and they're like, there's only two so it's taken a while.

1463
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,080
Yeah, I think I might be standing.

1464
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,760
Yeah, I've been waiting a long time for this train.

1465
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,760
So yeah, no, everything they've done lately has made guest experience worse.

1466
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:01,280
Yeah, it seems like Disney World's been awful lately.

1467
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:05,120
Yeah, I have not been, obviously, but yeah, Disney World seems like there's even more problems.

1468
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:05,920
I will say this.

1469
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,640
I had talked about Genie Plus.

1470
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,080
This will be real quick, I promise.

1471
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:10,960
Genie Plus.

1472
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:15,440
I did use Genie Plus on a day a couple of months ago and I've conquered it.

1473
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,160
I know how to do it.

1474
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:21,680
It's basically the same as the FastPass Plus.

1475
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,880
So it's the same checking.

1476
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:29,520
I can check it all day and get an immediate time if I check well enough.

1477
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:30,080
I see.

1478
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,480
Okay, you know how to surf it.

1479
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:38,800
I surfed it all day with friends who were in from out of town and we did everything.

1480
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:39,440
Delivered for them.

1481
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:39,940
Good.

1482
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,320
You did that for park reservations too.

1483
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:45,920
You and I were hunting to get me a park reservation because we have each other's

1484
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,880
tickets and it is like...

1485
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,560
I checked enough and got Jason a reservation for the next day.

1486
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:53,060
Yeah.

1487
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:58,640
When people cancel, they open up and if you are watching it, you can hop on it real quick.

1488
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:04,800
The only thing is you can open three different web pages that give you multiple different views

1489
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,560
and then you keep getting logged out.

1490
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:06,880
Yeah.

1491
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,440
You're constantly getting the emails saying you've logged in.

1492
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:15,520
I sat on the couch for like 30 straight minutes and hit back and forward on the

1493
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:20,000
calendar and then finally I saw when I clicked it, I got it.

1494
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:20,880
Geez.

1495
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,960
Well, this is a Spider-Man type.

1496
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:23,280
Yeah.

1497
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,000
A heroic action.

1498
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,040
Web checkers.

1499
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:25,520
Yeah, yeah.

1500
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,240
Web being the internet.

1501
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:35,520
I shot my organic web checking shooter, my biology at the computer.

1502
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,280
You experienced your check dreams.

1503
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,240
My check dreams.

1504
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,600
So yeah, the queue outside...

1505
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:48,160
I will say once you get inside though, I do think some of that stuff is cool and I like

1506
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,960
sort of the feeling of it being lived.

1507
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:51,520
Yeah.

1508
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,800
People have their stuff there.

1509
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,200
The Marvel characters have their...

1510
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,200
I don't know, their civilian stuff.

1511
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,240
There's a bike hanging inside the gate, right?

1512
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,920
Yeah, and there's like a million...

1513
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,200
That's Squirrel Girl's bike.

1514
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:03,920
That's Squirrel Girl's bike, yeah, yeah.

1515
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:10,160
Cassie Lang who is Ant-Man's daughter and then the comics becomes Ant-Man.

1516
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:12,640
Ant-person?

1517
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:13,440
Ant-person, yeah.

1518
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:14,560
I'm not sure.

1519
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,720
But she has a locker.

1520
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:22,400
She has one of the lockers and then it's got a little door on it, like a little ant-sized

1521
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,320
ladder and door on the bottom of it.

1522
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:25,760
I like that.

1523
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,920
The graffiti outside, there's a tag.

1524
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,880
There's like graffiti tag and it's autographed Miles Morales.

1525
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:33,600
He did the...

1526
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:33,840
Yeah.

1527
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:38,000
Which raises a lot of multiverse space questions.

1528
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:38,240
Right.

1529
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:42,800
He exists in the theme park universe but does not exist in the MCU proper yet.

1530
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:48,800
That is a big gripe I have with the current state of Marvel after that Dr. Strange movie

1531
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:54,320
because in this ride, there's a clock set to 616, which is...

1532
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:54,560
616.

1533
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:59,120
616 is the main continuity Marvel universe in the comics.

1534
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:05,120
But in the Dr. Strange movie, someone says to Benedict Cumberbatch,

1535
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,480
you're from the 616.

1536
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,840
Your universe is 616.

1537
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,040
And I'm like, wait a minute.

1538
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:13,200
But you've been saying that the movies are their own universe and the theme park is their

1539
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,120
own universe and the comics are their own.

1540
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:18,640
So they show all different numbers by your own multiverse logic.

1541
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,560
So you walked out.

1542
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:21,920
Any times I feel like I...

1543
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,080
I mean, I'm livid.

1544
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:29,680
Look, if I feel like I'm not into this stuff anymore and then I see this stuff and I get

1545
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,920
real gassed up, I was like, I guess I'm still invested.

1546
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:33,520
Kind of makes me feel better.

1547
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,120
That is interesting because I actually liked...

1548
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,240
I see what you're saying though.

1549
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:40,000
I didn't think about it when they said 616, which is the comic book universe,

1550
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,600
because there's been multiverses in the comics forever and they have different names for

1551
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:44,480
the different universes.

1552
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,720
But yeah, I guess you're right.

1553
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,600
I guess they should have made the movie something 617.

1554
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:51,120
Yeah.

1555
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:52,960
It's like area code, basically.

1556
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:53,200
Sure.

1557
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:54,560
So...

1558
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:55,840
Like, artsy burser.

1559
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,760
Or 169?

1560
01:07:58,640 --> 01:07:59,600
Like 16 by 9?

1561
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:00,640
Like movie widescreen?

1562
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,000
I'm not sure.

1563
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:02,480
That's cute.

1564
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:03,360
It's not a time.

1565
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,680
It is cute though.

1566
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,080
In this universe, there's a 169.

1567
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:08,960
Yeah.

1568
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:09,680
160...

1569
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,560
Oh man, body-ness.

1570
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:13,040
Oh no.

1571
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,280
That isn't the Raspik ratio either, is it?

1572
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,080
16 by 9.

1573
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:16,560
16 by...

1574
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,760
Oh, you're saying 16 by 9.

1575
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,800
16 by 9.

1576
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,600
169.

1577
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,480
But when you say 169, then it's dirty.

1578
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:26,480
Wait, what Jason wants is for one of these movies to have 169.

1579
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:27,760
Okay, we'll solve it.

1580
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,760
We'll call the universe 235.

1581
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,440
Like the one...

1582
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:32,640
That's a time.

1583
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,520
Yeah, that is a style of widescreen aspect ratio.

1584
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,400
But get a 169.

1585
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,320
But get one of these movies, please.

1586
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,560
I have a question about this ride.

1587
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:47,200
I asked this when I was on it with you guys, and maybe I am dumb for not knowing the answer.

1588
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:53,120
And I kind of get it, but I think it just speaks to the confusion of this ride.

1589
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:59,280
That in the ride vehicle, it's starting, and I ask, why can't I sling webs?

1590
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:00,880
Like...

1591
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,160
Oh, what's that?

1592
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:03,840
Is it the vehicles doing it?

1593
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:04,560
It's the vehicle.

1594
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,440
Yeah, it's the vehicle.

1595
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:12,640
Okay, I know that it's fake, and I'm just in 3D glasses, and it's scanning my body,

1596
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:13,840
which is very cool.

1597
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:14,720
I like that moment.

1598
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:19,920
You're looking down at your little frame that's being mo-capped live,

1599
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,760
and that's very responsive and great.

1600
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,560
But let's say that it really was...

1601
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:28,240
Okay, if this is reality, where's the webs coming from?

1602
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:32,720
Do I have metal things on my wrist that aren't...

1603
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,080
Or are they coming out of my body?

1604
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,520
I think they're coming out of the vehicle.

1605
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,680
I think they're coming out of the vehicle.

1606
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:42,800
But if you're willing to dish out $35 and maybe $30 on top of that,

1607
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:46,880
you can buy the Web Power Band and the other Web Tech add-ons.

1608
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:50,480
And then it's coming out of your hands in the reality of the ride?

1609
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:56,080
Well, then, in theory, the power-up that that gives you,

1610
01:09:56,240 --> 01:10:02,480
the first one gives you multi-fire webs, and then the others personalize it to other character

1611
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:03,680
kind of powers.

1612
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:06,560
Ghost, spider, Iron Man, rescue, other characters.

1613
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:12,160
There's basically a little accessory you can buy to put on your wrist

1614
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:17,200
that makes the gameplay differently, and you have different sort of powers.

1615
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:20,160
But if we're talking about the reality of the ride, I think, yeah,

1616
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:25,280
when you don't have one of these purchasable things, the vehicle is shooting.

1617
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:26,800
Out of what?

1618
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,560
Little holes in the front?

1619
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,920
Little, like, rotating?

1620
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,120
I don't know the answer is what I'm saying.

1621
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,000
It's kind of a little screen.

1622
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,680
Yeah, I kind of know that we know.

1623
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:38,160
But if I'm looking at the vehicle, where are my webs coming from?

1624
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:40,400
I think there's tiny little holes in the front of the vehicle.

1625
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,120
A little grill.

1626
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,320
I mean, screen like a car, a little grill.

1627
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:44,800
I see.

1628
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:45,360
I think there's a little grill.

1629
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:50,880
I think it's like in Minority Report when Tom Cruise is moving stuff in the air,

1630
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:55,200
and his hands are dictating where things are going and kind of doing things.

1631
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:59,120
I'm like the Travago guy moving deals into place.

1632
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,400
Like the Travago guy.

1633
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,080
In the virtual space, the Travago guy.

1634
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:05,920
This initially was a Travago ride, and then they sort of added the overlay.

1635
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:09,440
And then they're like, oh, it's too hot.

1636
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,880
This guy's too hot.

1637
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:11,520
Now that's Travago.

1638
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,480
Got to get him out of here.

1639
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,400
The Travago ride is something that I would like because it's a checking and deals.

1640
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,520
It's about checking, and a cool, swarthy guy.

1641
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,000
You'd get on it, and like, you don't get 3D glasses,

1642
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,720
they just ask you to unbutton your shirt a couple notches.

1643
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:29,360
Yeah, so I like the original version, the Travago ride.

1644
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,640
But yes, I think.

1645
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,080
So the answer is I think.

1646
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:39,520
And I will say a gripe I would have with this ride is they throw so much stuff at you right away,

1647
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,240
which is a newer thing with a lot of rides.

1648
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:46,080
Where like Avatar or something where it's like there's so much information you have to learn.

1649
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,760
You have to learn that Webb exists.

1650
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,720
You have to learn that Spider-Man has built all these things,

1651
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,800
but they've also malfunctioned, and he's trying to get Tony.

1652
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:57,760
He doesn't want to tell us Tony Stark, and this happens within so quick.

1653
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:02,400
You can miss, I think, all these details if you go on five times, like whatever.

1654
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,160
He says, get these vehicles ready.

1655
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,840
And you're like, what are these vehicles?

1656
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,360
And it's not just a car or something.

1657
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,600
Oh yeah, it's like, also I invented something else.

1658
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,080
Get in them.

1659
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:12,400
Right.

1660
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:19,200
It's like so much thrown at you really quickly that I think, yeah, it was just like,

1661
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:24,400
we're, you should all, hey, we're here and we're going to all train like Spider-Man.

1662
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:28,080
Pass through some portal and now you can shoot webs.

1663
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,760
Go get in this car and do it.

1664
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:36,000
Yeah, yeah, but they throw so much backstory to justify what you're doing.

1665
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,600
And it's, yeah, it's similar to the Avatar pre-shows where you're just like,

1666
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,280
it could be simpler like Big Thunder.

1667
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,240
Woody has invented a machine that takes people.

1668
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:52,800
Woody has broken the rules of reality where toys have to pretend that they aren't alive

1669
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,600
for people and he shrunk you down to the size of a toy.

1670
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,880
And he's also invented a special vehicle with a special string and ball.

1671
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,880
This is too many things.

1672
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:06,560
And let's just break down real quickly how the string and ball gun works.

1673
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,880
Let's see the side view of it when it was being built.

1674
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:12,720
Like so much detail and you're like, yeah, okay.

1675
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,440
Not that all this stuff doesn't really hurt the ride experience

1676
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,400
because it is what it is.

1677
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,200
But it is confusing.

1678
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:22,560
I just think it's weird that I don't know the clear answers to these,

1679
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:26,080
I think very basic questions about what's happening on it.

1680
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:32,000
I do wish they did that complicated Toy Story backstory for the old Toy Story Zoe trope

1681
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:32,720
that used to be.

1682
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,400
They would move around that the one, the old timey like.

1683
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:37,840
The animation thing.

1684
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:42,000
Yes, the statues that spin real fast and they're all a little different.

1685
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,040
And then when they project strobe lights on it, it looks like they're animated.

1686
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:48,720
Which I believe has ended up at the Academy Museum.

1687
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:51,840
The new Oscars Museum.

1688
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:52,480
Yeah, yeah, it is.

1689
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,160
I saw somebody just told me they saw it there.

1690
01:13:55,440 --> 01:14:01,360
Yeah, so yeah, hey, we're all, I grant you spider powers.

1691
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:01,920
Get out there.

1692
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,320
Yeah, that'd be fine with me.

1693
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,120
Doesn't that, they could do, it's a magic.

1694
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,000
Anything can happen.

1695
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,920
Yeah, Dr. Strange said.

1696
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,320
Yeah, Dr. Strange, which, okay.

1697
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:15,520
Maybe that leads me into my next little discussion point.

1698
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:21,680
Because we can talk about what happens in the levels and where the spider bots get loose

1699
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:22,560
and what happens.

1700
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:26,400
But something that does not happen, and the listeners probably know this, is that there

1701
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:34,240
is not a villain as opposed to the Spider-Man ride in Florida where you encounter many villains,

1702
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:35,280
nothing but villains.

1703
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,200
This is completely villain free.

1704
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:40,640
And I understand that the plot does not necessitate it.

1705
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:47,440
But again, what if you go to the Quinjet hangar and a villain got in there and then

1706
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,480
you're gonna fight the villain?

1707
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,320
There's a big spider bot, that's good.

1708
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,600
But why am I, are we sure?

1709
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:54,960
Are we sure no villains?

1710
01:14:56,080 --> 01:15:01,840
Why is it definitively, it just seems like it'd be, and again, I don't know Spider-Man

1711
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:02,640
very well.

1712
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,600
I couldn't name all the characters in that Orlando ride, but they're all cool.

1713
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:06,400
And I like when they show up.

1714
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:10,480
You're saying why isn't Michael Morbius, the living vampire on this ride?

1715
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,600
And I agree with you.

1716
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,000
Why isn't Morbius Spider-Man's nemesis?

1717
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,720
He's more of an anti-hero than a nemesis.

1718
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,320
Well, maybe he helps sometimes.

1719
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,240
Scott, I'm right there with you.

1720
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:28,400
I do know a little more about Spider-Man's bad guys and he's got a great rogues gallery.

1721
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:29,520
Like he's got so many.

1722
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:30,160
He's got a deep bench.

1723
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:30,800
The bench is deep.

1724
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:31,200
Deep bench.

1725
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:32,240
Deep bench.

1726
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:33,040
Of these rogues.

1727
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,200
Even beyond Sinister Six.

1728
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,040
Of course there's a Sinister Six.

1729
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:37,840
So deep.

1730
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,200
He even just take those.

1731
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,760
He's got Swarm, a man made of mutant bees.

1732
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:42,320
Mutant bees.

1733
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,240
Entirely out of mutant bees.

1734
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,200
Not just partially.

1735
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,560
He doesn't just have a bee hand.

1736
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,080
Entirely out of mutant bees.

1737
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:54,640
He's got the Rose, Wilson Fisk's son who leaves a rose as a calling card when he kills people.

1738
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,160
Yeah, the Sinister...

1739
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:00,320
Well, of course in Florida it's the Sinister Syndicate.

1740
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,160
Because there's only five of them.

1741
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,120
And they are off the top of my head.

1742
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,400
Dr. Octopus.

1743
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:06,960
Sandman.

1744
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:07,600
Hydra Man.

1745
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,200
No, Hydra Man.

1746
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,680
Electro.

1747
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:12,080
Shriek.

1748
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:12,640
Shriek.

1749
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,120
And Hobgoblin.

1750
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,160
Not Green Goblin.

1751
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:16,640
Yeah.

1752
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:17,840
Hobgoblin's the pumpkin one?

1753
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,240
It's very similar to Green Goblin.

1754
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:20,960
Came along in the 80s.

1755
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:21,760
But he's orange.

1756
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:22,480
But he's orange.

1757
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,200
I see.

1758
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:23,920
Cool costume.

1759
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:24,320
Very good.

1760
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:24,800
Good list.

1761
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,200
Yeah, I mean, great.

1762
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:30,720
Like, and I don't expect them to repeat what's in that attraction.

1763
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:32,880
But something, I just like...

1764
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:35,920
Again, it's one of those where we like the story.

1765
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:39,680
And the way that they've missed out on a little fun maybe in Galaxy's Edge

1766
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,840
by backing themselves into a story corner.

1767
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:42,160
Yeah.

1768
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:44,400
Maybe we're missing some fun here.

1769
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,040
Yeah, I'm not sure what the rationale is for it.

1770
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:49,680
Because like, Spider-Man creates the problem himself

1771
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:53,200
by making these self-replicating robots.

1772
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,280
Which, yeah, seems like a huge mistake.

1773
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:58,480
Yeah, and I don't think of Spider-Man necessarily as self-defeating.

1774
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:02,560
I think he gets in like tough spots because he has to make hard decisions

1775
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,720
and balance his double lives.

1776
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,880
You're saying Spider-Man does not self-sabotage.

1777
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,560
He doesn't self-sabotage.

1778
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:09,520
I think you're right.

1779
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:14,880
Sometimes he does, but it's because something in the other part of one of his lives,

1780
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:20,960
either his civilian identity or his secret identity, you know, his superhero identity,

1781
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:27,040
he's usually something goes wrong because he's trying to take care of something else.

1782
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:32,720
Yeah, but he is not self-defeating in that specific way like he is on this ride in a way.

1783
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,560
He really is negligent here.

1784
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:38,080
But I guess he's still just a kid and he's been given like,

1785
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:44,240
just like a giant country's military budget to build whatever he wants in this new thing,

1786
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:46,320
this new company, I guess.

1787
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:51,600
That Tony Stark is funny because Tony Stark is still alive in the Marvel theme park universe.

1788
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,120
Is his voice a little odd?

1789
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:55,040
Yes, but he is alive.

1790
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,160
About that, can I?

1791
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:05,760
So they just announced recently that they're putting web slingers at the Disneyland,

1792
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:10,240
Walt Disney Studios park, at Disneyland Paris, at their Avengers campus,

1793
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:13,520
and they announced it with an Iron Man video.

1794
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:16,480
And I just, what do you guys think of this Iron Man?

1795
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,120
You're saying it started, we're hearing Iron Man right now?

1796
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:25,620
Yeah.

1797
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,560
You may know me.

1798
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,280
You mean like, dude?

1799
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,080
Like Dr. Evil.

1800
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,760
How about no Scott?

1801
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:58,640
Yeah, it is a little Dr. Evil.

1802
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,400
I'm glad someone else said it too.

1803
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:04,800
I was going to say it's like, you know, everyone, everyone who's ever been on Saturday Night Live

1804
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:09,520
does impressions of Lorne Michaels, but that's like the worst, that's like a guy who thinks he can,

1805
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,000
who can't.

1806
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,040
Yeah, yes, the show goes on.

1807
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,240
Yes, I'm Lorne.

1808
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,600
C minus Lorne.

1809
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:18,080
It's hard.

1810
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:21,440
They get, look, Downey, you got, Downey had a lot of leverage because he was first.

1811
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,280
So he didn't have to do all this stuff.

1812
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:28,560
Yeah, it's also like, I believe that Iron Man, I think that's the animatronic that's going to be

1813
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:35,200
in line for first flight, which is the redone, the redone rock and roller coaster.

1814
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:42,240
But helpful to do Iron Man because one, you don't need to make it look like human face.

1815
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:43,840
It's a little robotic already.

1816
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:52,800
Do we know, are they playing like, either like Iron Man, Black Sabbath Iron Man, Oral ACDC?

1817
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,960
On the ride? That's a good idea.

1818
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,960
I don't know. That is a good idea, Mike.

1819
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:03,520
The other question we had is, will that web slingers have footage of the events of the ride

1820
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:08,000
going through their Avengers campus versus ours? Or will it be like Soarin' where-

1821
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:08,880
Oh yeah, that's a good question.

1822
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:14,480
For years in Florida, you were soaring over Southern California's Disney park.

1823
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:15,200
I don't know.

1824
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:20,560
We'll see, but I would just like to, I would like the idea that rock and roll stays in that building.

1825
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:22,160
I don't like the idea that rock has left.

1826
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,640
I don't want to lose rock.

1827
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:26,080
I don't want to lose rock.

1828
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:29,360
And yes, people have sent me the Aerosmith residence.

1829
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,920
It has been postponed because of Steven Tyler going into rehab.

1830
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:32,880
That's sad.

1831
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:33,440
I saw it.

1832
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:33,940
Jeez.

1833
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:36,640
Losing rock.

1834
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:39,760
Yeah, but rock will, he'll rock again.

1835
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:41,360
Nimgaloo will rock again, I believe.

1836
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,960
So yeah, I will real quick.

1837
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,120
I like the lockers in the queue too.

1838
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:50,320
You see those lockers, they're like painted, like, you know what I'm talking about?

1839
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,800
Well, that's what I was saying, Cassie, Ant-Man.

1840
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:53,680
Oh, you were talking about those.

1841
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:54,640
Yeah, the lockers.

1842
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,240
I thought there was another thing I was missing, but yeah, there are like all these lockers

1843
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:00,160
and they're all kind of painted like their outfits.

1844
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:00,960
The heroes, yeah.

1845
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,800
Like the heroes' outfits, which I think that's cool.

1846
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:09,200
But yes, the ride itself, it's disorienting.

1847
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:14,480
It is tiring in a way.

1848
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,640
Like Toy Story is tiring, but this one's tiring.

1849
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:22,240
And even like, maybe your arm doesn't hurt as much, but your brain

1850
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:23,840
is like more tired.

1851
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,120
It's just exhausting.

1852
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:33,760
After a very hot line, and then you go flail around, you gotta flail those arms a lot.

1853
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:40,160
And as a, you know, we, all right, so we just did the canoes and there was the discussion

1854
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:43,520
of the physical exertion there.

1855
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:49,600
I'm much more tired after web slingers because the canoes, it's this one repetitive motion

1856
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:53,360
that's kind of calming as opposed to just, ah, everywhere.

1857
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:54,160
How does this work?

1858
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:55,920
Is this even the right way to do it?

1859
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,920
What if I swing this way, that way, that way?

1860
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:02,400
Like it's, yeah, I think it is mental and physical exhaustion.

1861
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:06,640
And then to your point a little earlier is that, yeah, and then you don't even have

1862
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:12,400
the satisfaction of seeing one of Spider-Man's rogues gallery like hanging from the web

1863
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:12,800
at the end.

1864
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:16,320
Like we did something, like really we should be more like upset by the end of the ride

1865
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,960
because we're like, look, Tom, you did this.

1866
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,120
We're just cleaning up your mess, Spider-Man.

1867
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:21,840
Yeah.

1868
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:22,320
You know what I mean?

1869
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,120
There's like some odd-

1870
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,720
It's a little more maybe.

1871
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:25,520
Right, exactly.

1872
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:29,360
I mean, he thanks us a little bit, I think, but it's like we're not even helping him on

1873
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,800
some like bigger threat.

1874
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,880
It's like you screwed up, dude.

1875
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:37,440
And now instead of us having like a leisurely training session, we had to clean up your

1876
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:42,480
mess and we didn't have the leisurely time, which I think if this Spider-Bot thing wasn't

1877
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:46,800
happening in the narrative of the ride, we would get to do more of what we're saying we want.

1878
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:52,160
Test out the webs, use it to pull like a barrel over, use it to swing.

1879
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:54,080
We get to really take our time.

1880
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:58,960
But that being said, Tom Holland, Spider-Man is screwed up and now we're paying the price.

1881
01:22:59,520 --> 01:22:59,920
Yeah.

1882
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:00,480
Wow.

1883
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:07,440
I mean, I think the other thing that I, it's not as big of a deal as the rogues gallery,

1884
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:12,400
but I do think Spider-Man is, I mean, it's trite to say nowadays.

1885
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:17,280
New York City is a character, but Spider-Man is a New York superhero.

1886
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:18,880
He lives in Queens.

1887
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,800
That was like a big part of it.

1888
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:28,400
He's a regular guy from an outer borough and that is a thing that you get in the Florida

1889
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:28,640
one.

1890
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:31,840
You go through New York, you swing through New York.

1891
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,360
You're missing New York.

1892
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,200
Would you say New York is a character?

1893
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:38,960
I unfortunately did.

1894
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:41,840
I miss it a little, but I do like say,

1895
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:48,960
this is all taking place in the old Stark Motors factory and stuff.

1896
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,320
Like the campus.

1897
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:55,280
I think now that they filled it out, I think the thing I was skeptical about early on,

1898
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,200
will they keep adding characters?

1899
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,480
And they have kept that up.

1900
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,880
It's like new movies and shows have come out.

1901
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,480
Other characters have been showing up.

1902
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:05,680
We can't say enough good things about all the amount of characters that have popped

1903
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:07,600
in and out and quickly gone.

1904
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:10,800
They're for like two days and then they're gone.

1905
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:14,400
Loki in his prison outfit was there for like two days and then he's gone.

1906
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:20,080
I think it's clever that one of the scenes in the ride, you end up in Pym Test Kitchen

1907
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:23,760
and they're getting big and small and the pretzel gets big.

1908
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:28,880
Well, as far as Avengers campus, I think we were a little bit in the middle on it initially.

1909
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,840
I will say I've grown to like the campus a lot more.

1910
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:32,320
I agree.

1911
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:37,040
And I look forward to going there and just hanging out and chilling out there.

1912
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:38,880
I think that's good about it.

1913
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:44,320
I think that bar is very strong and I've had good things at that restaurant.

1914
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,720
We said in the show, like Ant-Man walking around with the Bugs Land little thing.

1915
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:49,280
That's fun.

1916
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,240
I mean, that's terrific.

1917
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:50,960
They're like adding.

1918
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:57,680
It feels like they're easily able to add little ideas to it to keep it alive,

1919
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,360
which is great.

1920
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,480
I mean, that's what you want.

1921
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:02,000
Yeah.

1922
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,880
The nice thing about like comic book logic is like,

1923
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:07,520
yeah, you can't do anything and justify it pretty easily.

1924
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:08,580
Yeah.

1925
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,920
So, yeah, as far as Avengers campus as a whole,

1926
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:16,000
I certainly have a lot more fondness for that area now

1927
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,640
and look forward to going there when I'm in the parks.

1928
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:22,480
But I mean, maybe we're winding down here,

1929
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:27,680
but if I have to say if I like the actual ride experience of Spider-Man,

1930
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:30,640
I would have to say I don't.

1931
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:31,140
Wow.

1932
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:31,640
I don't.

1933
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:32,160
Wow.

1934
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:32,400
Wow.

1935
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,200
It's too much.

1936
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:33,440
You met me.

1937
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:35,040
It's too much.

1938
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,960
Now, is it?

1939
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:42,160
I mean, I'm trying to think because basically it comes back to what we were saying earlier

1940
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:48,160
about how the thing with Spider-Man is you were never imagining just shooting hard pieces of web.

1941
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,960
That wasn't the thing that you dreamed of doing.

1942
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:52,000
You wanted to swing.

1943
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,400
Now, if it's a different character, if it's Cyclops from the X-Men

1944
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:59,440
and he has his, of course, Ruby Quartz visor on,

1945
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:00,320
we know he has that.

1946
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:03,520
That's his thing that protects his eyes from just going out of control

1947
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,280
shooting his optic blasts.

1948
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,120
Which are concussive, not heat based.

1949
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:15,280
Cyclops's optic blasts won't melt you, but they'll throw you into a wall at such a high speed.

1950
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:16,000
It could kill you.

1951
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:17,680
If that makes sense.

1952
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:20,880
Do you know who Cyclops has got?

1953
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:21,380
No.

1954
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,680
James Marsden's classic performance.

1955
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,680
He's got a yellow visor on and there's a red thing here.

1956
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:31,120
Yeah, maybe.

1957
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,080
You've seen him.

1958
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:33,360
Anyway.

1959
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:34,560
Or it could be Iron Man.

1960
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:35,200
Iron Man shoots.

1961
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:35,700
Sure.

1962
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:44,320
So it's like, it almost felt like it's the wrong character to do this with.

1963
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,760
I think you would still find it.

1964
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,480
Oh, there's an idea.

1965
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:49,760
Yeah, I think you would still find it a little bit too fast and disorienting

1966
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,840
and like some of the same issues.

1967
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:57,120
But I think that it might be more fun because at the very least you're kind of,

1968
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:01,520
you're in the head space of the character that this motion makes more sense for.

1969
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:04,720
So like Cyclops would like kind of, depending on what Cyclops,

1970
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:09,440
like he would touch the side of his visor to like shoot a laser beam, essentially.

1971
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:13,040
So say it was a Cyclops ride and you're shooting like you're,

1972
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:15,840
and the thing is like tracking your eyes and you're looking up and down

1973
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:18,960
and you would pretend you're hitting the side of your face or something.

1974
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:22,560
That at least I would kind of be in the head space of a kid when I was little.

1975
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,080
And I would be like, this is cool.

1976
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,920
I'm doing what Cyclops does.

1977
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:28,800
I'm shooting things and I'm shooting them fast because that's what's,

1978
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,640
that's what I wanted to do, like to use his powers as a kid.

1979
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:37,760
So there's a bunch of other characters I feel like who this ride makes more sense for.

1980
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:38,560
Hmm.

1981
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:39,760
Yeah, that's an interesting pitch.

1982
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:40,240
Yeah, yeah.

1983
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:44,800
But yeah, I mean, I don't, it's not going to happen, but it's,

1984
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:49,760
I get why they ended up with this because it's a very small footprint

1985
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,960
and they had to do something that felt action packed.

1986
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:57,600
I mean, they're doing, trying to, you know, serve 10 different ideas or 10 different

1987
01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:59,760
mandates, maybe got to be action packed.

1988
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:03,440
Got to feel like you're, you are the superhero, which is the whole big thing.

1989
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,720
But yeah, I feel like a different character makes more sense.

1990
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:09,220
Yeah.

1991
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:17,920
I think, well, I was going to say kind of an inadvertent nod to the Florida ride in that the

1992
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:25,920
in-between moments, there are a lot of pipes and barrels in crates, those classic theme park things.

1993
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:30,080
But again, the Florida one, usually there's practical effects.

1994
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:31,840
Usually there's mist something.

1995
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:36,160
Sometimes there's just a pipe that explodes at the hobgoblin's bomb gets out of the way.

1996
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:36,880
That's incredible.

1997
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:37,200
Yeah.

1998
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:38,720
There's nothing in these hallways.

1999
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:39,200
Yeah.

2000
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:44,560
And, and so you kind of see the like behind the scenes a little too much when like

2001
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:48,560
you go by two screens and you settle at the first one or the second one.

2002
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:53,280
Especially there's the notion that you're hopping all around Avengers campus.

2003
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:54,720
Now you're in the Pym lab.

2004
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:57,920
Now you're in the, the Tavon collection, the guardians.

2005
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:58,240
Yeah.

2006
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:01,600
But there's no way you did that travel.

2007
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:06,000
There's no way you made it actually to all those places because you just went around a corner.

2008
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,480
So you never feel like I'm, it doesn't go fast enough or simulate the idea that like

2009
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:13,920
now you're whipping over to the guardians fortress and now you're over here.

2010
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:17,360
And that, and the other thing about those places is they're kind of empty.

2011
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:19,280
Like where are the other people?

2012
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:24,240
Like I'm not even saying like it'd be cool to have Ant-Man or some of the guardians or like

2013
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:26,160
rocket or going like, what are you doing?

2014
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:31,520
But even just having a guy go like the classic, like, hey, Spider-Man, like just, you know,

2015
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:35,520
a dock worker yelling like, Spider-Man, what are you doing?

2016
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:36,560
You want those New Yorkers.

2017
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:43,040
Well, she, you know, the real heroes, the citizens of New York.

2018
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,720
You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us.

2019
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:45,360
All of us.

2020
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:46,080
That's what you want.

2021
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:47,200
That character.

2022
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:53,280
I think, and that would probably be a pain in the ass to program, you know,

2023
01:29:53,280 --> 01:30:00,160
the fast and furious digital people, like people running around in title safe exits or whatever.

2024
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:04,480
But I think it might fill it out if you're going to keep it Spider-Bots,

2025
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,800
like it'd be kind of cool to see people reacting.

2026
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,160
Like what is going on?

2027
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:10,080
We're calling Iron Man.

2028
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:14,400
There should be, it should be almost like they're in the same way that star tours you,

2029
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,480
there's the rebel spy and they take a picture.

2030
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:22,080
They should like be face mapping people out in the park live and then throw them on the,

2031
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,880
in the ride.

2032
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:25,360
So you see like people you've actually passed by.

2033
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:25,760
Right.

2034
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:26,240
Yeah.

2035
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:26,740
Every day.

2036
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:28,660
Yeah.

2037
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:34,400
There's just such a tiny amount of space there that, yeah, some of that stuff doesn't feel

2038
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:40,640
as seamless as any of the practical transition things on Spider-Man or Transformers,

2039
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:44,720
which goes from screen to screen and still gives you some feeling of like, oh yeah,

2040
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:47,360
I've, I'm just sort of turning around in the world.

2041
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:48,560
Yeah.

2042
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:54,080
I mean, I think a lot of the, the busyness of the footage comes from like the Millennium Falcon.

2043
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:57,920
It's not the same ride every time because it has to render your actions.

2044
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:02,400
It has to render what's going on on screen based on your actions,

2045
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:04,240
blowing up things and stuff.

2046
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:04,480
Yeah.

2047
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:08,800
But I've come around a little more on this ride because I figured out the easier way to do it

2048
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:14,000
is you just punch, you just punch kind of like Spider-Man's black costume in the car too,

2049
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:19,600
where like you would shoot and venom, which his webs shoot from the back of his hand,

2050
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,360
top of his like wrist.

2051
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:22,240
Not here.

2052
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,960
Not here, not the underside, but the top of your hand.

2053
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:30,400
And that is much more pleasant and that's how you've actually been able to get decent scores.

2054
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:33,840
But it's so much less satisfying than doing the Spider-Man motion.

2055
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,160
I really liked the black costume as a kid.

2056
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:36,720
I did too.

2057
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:37,440
So for me it's working.

2058
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:38,240
The main thing.

2059
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,400
Yeah, that main motion is fun.

2060
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,680
This is what you want.

2061
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:44,560
You want, you've been doing it for over, yeah.

2062
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:45,280
Can we hear that?

2063
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,480
The sound of one hand clapping.

2064
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:46,640
Yeah.

2065
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:55,040
I mean, I appreciate that they've color coded each rider with your webs and the scoreboard,

2066
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:56,960
but it's so busy.

2067
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:59,600
It's really confusing and I don't like the feeling of,

2068
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,800
hey, I actually did okay in that one.

2069
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:05,760
Well, maybe I'll keep going with the strategy I've been using.

2070
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,080
Next round, I did way worse.

2071
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,000
I don't like the inability to learn.

2072
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:16,800
I don't know how to get better at this and maybe it is this teamwork thing.

2073
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:19,200
You might have to go into it with a plan.

2074
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:23,280
I watched a video that was saying, all right, just everybody go after the Spider-Bot.

2075
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:29,520
As soon as you see him or try to, there's like lasers you can activate in the Quinjet

2076
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:33,360
area that will just decimate all of the Spider-Bots.

2077
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:37,360
But at the same time, who wants to be in that line and then be the guy going,

2078
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,600
okay, guys, so we got to come up with a plan here.

2079
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:43,040
Because all right, huddle up, stop having fun and side conversations and

2080
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:44,880
playing the game with your phone.

2081
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:48,880
We got to get down to business if we want to be the team that takes this for the day.

2082
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,240
You don't think Jason and I would do that?

2083
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:51,280
I mean, I guess so.

2084
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:52,880
Yeah, we probably would do that.

2085
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:54,080
No, I'm the problem.

2086
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,720
Like, focus up here.

2087
01:32:58,720 --> 01:32:59,600
It would be nice.

2088
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:02,800
It's like, hey, can you put it on tired dad mode for our screen, please?

2089
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:03,200
Thank you.

2090
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:08,240
Yeah, I was trying to think of something else.

2091
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:11,360
Yeah, I was saying I've come around on Avengers campus.

2092
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:15,680
I think I've come around on the ride more because I'm starting to figure out the tricks.

2093
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:17,680
I've definitely blown up a lot of barrels.

2094
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,560
Yeah, I think that's helped.

2095
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:25,840
Yeah, I understand all of the limitations of it, but it's like,

2096
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:30,160
it's still, even though it took me probably a while to figure out to get a higher score on

2097
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:36,880
Toy Story, initially, just it was very satisfying pulling the cord and shooting a thing out.

2098
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,480
Instant something happened.

2099
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:41,120
Instantly, yeah, like intuitive.

2100
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:46,000
It was an instantly like pleasurable experience to do that motion.

2101
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:49,600
And this one is still like, I've done it maybe four times now and I'm like,

2102
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:52,240
okay, one of these days, I'm really going to get it.

2103
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,200
And it's difficult.

2104
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:57,840
And I feel in a similar way, like, it makes sense.

2105
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:03,280
It's been built in the same era as Millennium Falcon because it kind of feels a little over

2106
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:06,560
thinky and like, oh, you have to be part of this.

2107
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:11,760
Whereas some of it you go, I could just watch a video of you guys doing this.

2108
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:14,560
Yeah, like, it's a little more exciting.

2109
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:18,480
And it feels like, I wonder if there was any consideration to just having

2110
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:23,120
just a straight up training program that was somewhat exciting.

2111
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:24,320
Like, all right, I'm Spider-Man.

2112
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:27,360
I'm going to show you how to web swing or whatever.

2113
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:32,720
And like, we all do this and we all shoot a web and then in 3D, the car feels like it

2114
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:36,080
swings and we're swinging and swinging and swinging and swinging.

2115
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:38,400
And then the vulture shows up and you got to fight it.

2116
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:38,960
Sure, great.

2117
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:39,760
And it goes wrong.

2118
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:40,720
Something goes wrong.

2119
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:44,160
But I feel like if you could like, if the car like just kind of rocked itself a little bit

2120
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:49,040
with a decent 3D screen, at the very least, you could kind of give everybody the sensation

2121
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:52,800
that we were going and you could still have like the web appear in your 3D.

2122
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:59,360
And like, I feel like there's moments like that that would stick longer in your mind.

2123
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:02,000
And it's in a similar way to Millennium Falcon where your brain is just like,

2124
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,200
I got to figure this out.

2125
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:07,440
And it's not so many memorable things in the video game part of it.

2126
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,680
The lack of just moments.

2127
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:14,320
Yeah, I remember the coaxium part when you crash in Millennium Falcon, I guess, is the one I

2128
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:15,040
remember.

2129
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:19,360
I remember that I've been in a lot now, but it's not, as we've said before, it's not like

2130
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:21,120
the stuff on Star Tours we remember.

2131
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:24,960
Where you remember so many moments and big things that happen on Star Tours.

2132
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:28,640
And a lot of it is because you're not just frantically doing something.

2133
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:29,120
Yeah.

2134
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:31,120
Yeah, I don't think I am.

2135
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:38,240
And maybe I'm not the target for it, but like there was a moment in Doctor Strange, I feel like,

2136
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:42,480
where they reference one very specific element from one of the TV shows.

2137
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:45,040
And I had remembered that from the TV show.

2138
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:49,280
I was like, oh, huh, that's kind of a fun little callback.

2139
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:55,920
But that doesn't feel as satisfying as, yeah, like you were saying, Star Tours.

2140
01:35:55,920 --> 01:36:00,480
Or falling at the end of Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man, then you're caught in a big web.

2141
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:03,520
Or like Transformers, where Bumblebee catches you.

2142
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:05,600
That, yeah, I guess.

2143
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,520
The finest moment in right-dom.

2144
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:14,800
That was one that I am still very, that was the original maybe too busy screen ride for me.

2145
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,160
Transformers.

2146
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:16,720
Yeah.

2147
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:17,440
One of those great moments.

2148
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:18,000
Fine.

2149
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:19,680
Watch your words.

2150
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:22,640
You're going to have a big garage fight.

2151
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:24,240
I mean, yeah, that'll be a big thing.

2152
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:32,000
Yeah, you want moments like that, like the big drop into Bumblebee or whatever it is.

2153
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:36,240
You want songs where none of us can remember when the songs play.

2154
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:38,160
And it turns out we were both correct and they're different.

2155
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:38,880
Both right.

2156
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:39,760
But they're different parts of the-

2157
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,120
In a way both wrong.

2158
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:42,800
That's all confusing is the point.

2159
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:44,960
And you want to get thanks as you were thanked by-

2160
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:47,120
Yes, that's true.

2161
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:53,360
You are, the solution keeps being make it more like Transformers, the ultimate ride.

2162
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,280
It's always in life in general.

2163
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:57,440
Less interactivity, more Brookheimer.

2164
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
More, has Brookheimer produced those?

2165
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,560
Transform, wait, now Michael Bay?

2166
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:03,040
Michael Bay directs them.

2167
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:04,400
I always got those two confused.

2168
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:05,600
Brookheimer, I don't remember.

2169
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,200
I think Brookheimer's involved in producing.

2170
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:08,000
Michael Bay then.

2171
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,600
I think that I always get those two mixed up.

2172
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:10,640
But they work together.

2173
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:11,780
Sure.

2174
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:17,060
So, yeah, I think, I just think there was maybe even a simpler version of it.

2175
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:20,580
That yeah, wouldn't have been as good as Orlando because they don't have the room or whatever.

2176
01:37:20,580 --> 01:37:24,900
But would have left you going, oh, that was a cool little use of space and it's a fun,

2177
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:28,420
whatever, C ticket, B ticket, whatever you would call it.

2178
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:32,500
And you could still have a lot of the elements that they have in there.

2179
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:35,940
Oh, I remember one of the things I wanted to say that I don't think we've mentioned yet.

2180
01:37:35,940 --> 01:37:36,900
I like Sharon.

2181
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:38,900
I like the voice assistant.

2182
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:40,100
Uh-huh.

2183
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:41,140
I didn't know that name.

2184
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:42,020
Throughout the ride.

2185
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:48,340
They say it real quick at the top and I think in the pre-show, pre-show room.

2186
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:51,060
I don't know, I just like that voice.

2187
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:52,500
I think it's a good performance.

2188
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:55,540
I think they play off Tom Holland pretty well.

2189
01:37:55,540 --> 01:37:57,140
I don't know who does that voice.

2190
01:37:57,700 --> 01:37:58,260
Oh, I don't either.

2191
01:37:58,260 --> 01:38:02,260
At first, I thought it was Alison Brie, but now I don't think so.

2192
01:38:02,260 --> 01:38:03,780
I think it might just be a voice actor.

2193
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:05,940
Is she original to the ride?

2194
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:07,780
I think she's original to the ride.

2195
01:38:07,780 --> 01:38:08,820
So I like that.

2196
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:09,380
Yeah, you're right.

2197
01:38:09,380 --> 01:38:09,940
Yeah, yeah.

2198
01:38:09,940 --> 01:38:16,740
And add some fun levity and giving the computerized dire stakes of what's happening,

2199
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:18,260
but makes it kind of casual.

2200
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:19,940
Now it's really, really bad.

2201
01:38:19,940 --> 01:38:20,340
Yeah.

2202
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:27,940
I think that's a thing that they started in the first Iron Man movies came out and then as the

2203
01:38:27,940 --> 01:38:31,700
I-Five, as Siri and all the voice assistants got better and better.

2204
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:33,700
I was like, well, they were kind of right about that.

2205
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:36,020
I got to give them credit.

2206
01:38:36,020 --> 01:38:36,900
I like Jarvis.

2207
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:37,700
I like Friday.

2208
01:38:37,780 --> 01:38:40,580
You know, a lot of AI sharing.

2209
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:41,220
Yeah.

2210
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:42,020
Sharon was it?

2211
01:38:42,020 --> 01:38:42,740
Did it stand for?

2212
01:38:42,740 --> 01:38:43,620
It has to stand for something.

2213
01:38:43,620 --> 01:38:45,060
I don't know if it stands for something.

2214
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:48,900
Is it just a nod to Mrs. Ozzy Osborne herself?

2215
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:52,740
I think, yeah, I think it's a nod to Sharon.

2216
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:56,180
To Sharon and Ozzy or Ozzy screen Sharon.

2217
01:38:56,820 --> 01:38:58,580
Remember when he would just yell Sharon?

2218
01:38:59,780 --> 01:39:00,900
Yes, I do remember that.

2219
01:39:01,940 --> 01:39:07,380
Well, she should be in the universe because as I said, I want Iron Man to be playing in Paris.

2220
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:09,460
So maybe they have to work on it.

2221
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:10,100
They made it worked out.

2222
01:39:10,100 --> 01:39:10,900
I'm not sure.

2223
01:39:11,620 --> 01:39:12,660
Okay, I see.

2224
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:12,980
Yeah.

2225
01:39:13,540 --> 01:39:15,540
To work out Sharon Osborne.

2226
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:16,740
Welcome to the MCU.

2227
01:39:18,260 --> 01:39:22,180
She's in a post credit, the third post credit scene and the last one.

2228
01:39:22,180 --> 01:39:23,700
Whoa, can you believe it?

2229
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:28,340
Well, we do it.

2230
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:29,220
I think we did it.

2231
01:39:29,220 --> 01:39:29,540
Yeah.

2232
01:39:29,540 --> 01:39:30,100
Yeah.

2233
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:34,020
And I will once again, apologize to the lake and the residents of Lake Nona.

2234
01:39:34,900 --> 01:39:40,660
I am going to work on finding a shorthand for the Disney mixed use boondoggle thing.

2235
01:39:40,660 --> 01:39:42,580
So I don't insult the whole neighborhood.

2236
01:39:43,780 --> 01:39:45,220
You finally understand.

2237
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:45,940
You do get it.

2238
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:46,900
I get it.

2239
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:47,860
I get it now.

2240
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:50,180
It only took me 15 months.

2241
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:55,380
Sometimes I'm a little stupid.

2242
01:39:56,180 --> 01:39:56,820
I don't know.

2243
01:39:56,820 --> 01:39:57,300
I didn't know.

2244
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:57,620
Say that.

2245
01:39:57,620 --> 01:39:58,420
Hang on.

2246
01:39:58,420 --> 01:39:59,380
We weren't calling you stupid.

2247
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:02,740
As we were doing the last hour of the podcast upcoming,

2248
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:06,660
there's a person in my brain going, hey, remember when we had that Lake Nona

2249
01:40:06,660 --> 01:40:07,860
argument earlier today?

2250
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:09,940
And I'm like, yeah, yeah, I'm trying to finish a podcast.

2251
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:10,420
Yeah.

2252
01:40:11,060 --> 01:40:13,060
It's really straight, just like you didn't load it.

2253
01:40:13,060 --> 01:40:17,220
Like all the Lake Nona feelings, all replicated like spider body.

2254
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:17,700
Yes.

2255
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:19,620
Took over our brains and bodies.

2256
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:24,580
You were trying to clearly do one bit and I thought I was just being

2257
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:30,100
frank and discussing details I had read about in various editorials and all.

2258
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:31,620
I didn't think any of it was a bit.

2259
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:37,700
It seemed like an earnest discussion, it felt like to me, which I hope makes any sense.

2260
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:42,820
Listeners who do not, they don't remember why this came up in the first war.

2261
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:45,140
Yeah, people going back, like listening.

2262
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:49,860
I will find a new podcast and start with the most recent one and just go backwards.

2263
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:54,740
Well, the people who do that on this, like the Marvel universe,

2264
01:40:54,740 --> 01:40:59,380
it's full of slight nods to things from way back in the mythology.

2265
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:03,140
Oh, there's a tough to be a bug reference.

2266
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:07,940
The 3D glasses are like in a pile somewhere.

2267
01:41:07,940 --> 01:41:09,220
Is there like a claw game?

2268
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:10,740
There's a bunch of those like

2269
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:14,500
capsules that you find in like vending machines or claw game kind of thing.

2270
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:18,260
There's a pair of the bug 3D glasses sitting in that mix.

2271
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:20,100
Yeah, I like that.

2272
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:24,660
It's not, we get what it is.

2273
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:26,660
I don't want to be so negative.

2274
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:30,740
I think like, I didn't feel good saying, oh, that's, you know what?

2275
01:41:30,740 --> 01:41:33,700
You can try to think of any argument on its behalf.

2276
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:36,900
I think that all ages aspect is good.

2277
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:38,340
I think it's very little.

2278
01:41:38,340 --> 01:41:39,220
Yeah, you can be little.

2279
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:40,020
Yeah.

2280
01:41:40,020 --> 01:41:40,660
Yeah, yeah.

2281
01:41:40,660 --> 01:41:45,780
Which and most, most like expensive new, especially superhero IP,

2282
01:41:45,780 --> 01:41:50,660
or there is a high requirement and yeah, it's cool that this is forever.

2283
01:41:50,660 --> 01:41:55,380
I bet this, this might be, this might, if we had a guest on the show who was five years old,

2284
01:41:55,940 --> 01:42:00,820
they might offer a different, they also would say, I liked, I liked when the

2285
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:04,980
spider came out and they would have been gone two hours ago.

2286
01:42:04,980 --> 01:42:05,860
I, yeah.

2287
01:42:05,860 --> 01:42:11,620
And so it's not, I don't have ownership over the current Spider-Man or even the MCU,

2288
01:42:11,620 --> 01:42:17,940
I guess, and because also Marvel has been pumping out the 90s cartoon is on Disney Plus

2289
01:42:17,940 --> 01:42:22,900
and they keep putting out action figures that look like the ones that we bought as kids,

2290
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:25,780
but they're much nicer and significantly more expensive.

2291
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:26,660
Oh, I have them.

2292
01:42:26,660 --> 01:42:27,460
I do have them.

2293
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:29,140
And I, I still have them on the card too.

2294
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:32,340
And you know me, I'm an out of box guy, but I have not opened any of them.

2295
01:42:32,340 --> 01:42:35,220
I know it's getting harder and harder as the cards get nicer.

2296
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:36,180
Yeah.

2297
01:42:36,180 --> 01:42:37,380
Especially the oversized card.

2298
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:38,180
I have the kingpin.

2299
01:42:38,980 --> 01:42:39,300
Yeah.

2300
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:40,500
Such a big card.

2301
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:46,100
The only Spider-Man I feel ownership over is when any of the Muppet Babies are Spider-Man.

2302
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:49,940
Just go, like I was like, I'm not is remembering this right.

2303
01:42:49,940 --> 01:42:55,060
If you Google image Spider-Man Muppet Babies and you can see Skeeter and Scooter and

2304
01:42:55,620 --> 01:42:59,940
animal is where Spider-Man swinging around and then takes his mask off and it's animal.

2305
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:03,940
I think the first I ever saw Spider-Man was probably within Muppet Babies

2306
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:07,780
and thought that it was like an only in Muppet Babies.

2307
01:43:07,780 --> 01:43:09,300
Oh my gosh.

2308
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:09,860
Star Wars.

2309
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:10,500
I feel like Star Wars.

2310
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:14,020
Star Wars Muppet Babies is a great, I think.

2311
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:14,820
Star Wars too.

2312
01:43:14,820 --> 01:43:15,140
Yeah.

2313
01:43:15,140 --> 01:43:18,020
I think Kermit is Indiana Jones at some point.

2314
01:43:18,020 --> 01:43:18,660
I remember.

2315
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:19,620
All of them.

2316
01:43:19,620 --> 01:43:26,980
When I was in college, I was a PA at a comedy festival where the Henson people did that

2317
01:43:26,980 --> 01:43:28,420
puppet up, the puppet improv.

2318
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:35,220
I was helping them load their crates the last day and I talked to Brian Henson,

2319
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:36,260
not realize it was him.

2320
01:43:36,260 --> 01:43:39,620
I was like, oh yeah, I work on lots of Henson.

2321
01:43:39,620 --> 01:43:41,940
I work on lots of stuff and lots of DVD release.

2322
01:43:41,940 --> 01:43:44,660
I was like, do you think we'll get Muppet Babies on TV?

2323
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:46,420
Like 21 year old me is asking.

2324
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:49,460
Then immediately I realized who I talked to.

2325
01:43:49,460 --> 01:43:51,540
I'm like, do you think we'll get Muppet Babies on DVD?

2326
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:52,420
I would love that.

2327
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:53,940
Well, that's good.

2328
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:55,860
You had the year of power.

2329
01:43:55,860 --> 01:43:58,980
And the answer seems to be no.

2330
01:43:58,980 --> 01:44:02,820
I don't believe we ever got like a definitive or even a streaming.

2331
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:03,380
What did he say?

2332
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:05,220
He's like, oh yeah, there's a lot to figure out.

2333
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:07,940
You know, we certainly heard that, you know?

2334
01:44:07,940 --> 01:44:08,420
Yeah.

2335
01:44:08,420 --> 01:44:10,660
So, but yeah, original Muppet Babies.

2336
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:13,780
That was appointment television for me at a very young age.

2337
01:44:13,780 --> 01:44:18,980
That's how I learned when things would be on the same time on TV.

2338
01:44:18,980 --> 01:44:21,060
I was like, gotta be up by 10 a.m.

2339
01:44:21,060 --> 01:44:22,500
Gotta be in front of the TV.

2340
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:23,780
Muppet Babies is coming on.

2341
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:26,100
Oh, that's another Google image.

2342
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:27,460
Star Wars Muppet Babies.

2343
01:44:27,460 --> 01:44:33,940
And there is a Leia Miss Piggy hugging baby Kermit.

2344
01:44:33,940 --> 01:44:34,420
Oh yeah.

2345
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:36,900
This is the cutest thing I've ever seen.

2346
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:38,500
There's no cute argument here.

2347
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:39,780
This is very loving.

2348
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:41,860
Piggy Leia.

2349
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:43,940
This is pure love right here.

2350
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:44,500
That's nice.

2351
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:44,740
Yeah.

2352
01:44:44,740 --> 01:44:45,780
You can't be mad at that.

2353
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:48,980
You know what I would want to ask the listeners is,

2354
01:44:50,260 --> 01:44:53,300
did anyone, whether you are adult or child,

2355
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:57,060
have you bought the attachments?

2356
01:44:57,060 --> 01:45:01,700
Have you bought the web tech add-ons or have you bought the remote control spider bots?

2357
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:05,060
Because I think they thought those would be a big hit.

2358
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:08,900
And they kind of got rolled out when they were doing that warehouse store.

2359
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:09,700
Deep pandemic.

2360
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:10,420
It was confusingly.

2361
01:45:10,660 --> 01:45:11,300
Deep pandemic.

2362
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:12,900
A very dark time for the company.

2363
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:16,020
You could tell they just had everything like in crates.

2364
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:18,660
They had crates ready to go with all this stuff.

2365
01:45:18,660 --> 01:45:22,420
And so I think it was a little anticlimactic, some of that stuff.

2366
01:45:22,420 --> 01:45:25,540
The web tech add-ons were announced like a month before the ride.

2367
01:45:25,540 --> 01:45:25,780
Yeah.

2368
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:28,980
And when you're talking about this on Avengers campus where people were like,

2369
01:45:28,980 --> 01:45:30,420
Disney with an upcharge.

2370
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:32,260
And you're like, have you ever been to Disney before?

2371
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:34,660
Do you have seen Harry Potter wands?

2372
01:45:34,660 --> 01:45:35,860
What are you talking about here?

2373
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:36,660
Are they helpful?

2374
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:38,020
Are they fun?

2375
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:41,700
They seem like they'd be very fun take home toys for kids.

2376
01:45:41,700 --> 01:45:45,620
I said at the time, if I was a kid, that would have been really cool.

2377
01:45:45,620 --> 01:45:48,980
And I think I even use Cyclops' visor as an example of like,

2378
01:45:48,980 --> 01:45:52,740
if it was like they had all your heroes stuff and as a kid,

2379
01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:54,260
you could get it and then take it home.

2380
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:55,060
That would have been awesome.

2381
01:45:55,060 --> 01:45:56,500
I would have thought that was so cool.

2382
01:45:56,500 --> 01:46:00,340
And the idea that it would change the ride, that is a cool idea.

2383
01:46:00,340 --> 01:46:00,580
Yeah.

2384
01:46:00,580 --> 01:46:05,380
They have some little diecast web vehicles or spider bot ones.

2385
01:46:05,380 --> 01:46:07,060
There's a Doctor Strange one now too, isn't there?

2386
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:09,780
Like a Doctor Strange thing you can buy.

2387
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:10,340
Oh, maybe.

2388
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:11,780
I think it's new.

2389
01:46:12,340 --> 01:46:13,620
So yeah, I guess, yeah.

2390
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:16,180
I think that it's a cool, fun thing.

2391
01:46:16,180 --> 01:46:19,460
And as just a toy, it fires a little string and that's neat.

2392
01:46:19,460 --> 01:46:23,300
But I think it does not guarantee you to do better in the game.

2393
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:25,140
That's what I seem to have caught.

2394
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:31,940
But don't quote me on that ever because I'm not the person who's going to buy this wrist.

2395
01:46:32,580 --> 01:46:35,700
It's still very funny that they had so little room.

2396
01:46:35,700 --> 01:46:38,340
The massive store is in another land.

2397
01:46:39,140 --> 01:46:41,940
That's still pretty funny to me.

2398
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:42,500
Really?

2399
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:42,740
Yeah.

2400
01:46:43,780 --> 01:46:44,660
Cramming it in.

2401
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:46,580
Well, they got something in there.

2402
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:48,820
Avengers Campus has a ride.

2403
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:53,300
I don't know when it will get its next ride, but at least we can say this.

2404
01:46:53,300 --> 01:46:59,780
It is a ride that you can go on and have opinions about as we did.

2405
01:46:59,780 --> 01:47:05,220
Your kids who are really good with phones and tablets and computers are going to love it.

2406
01:47:05,220 --> 01:47:06,420
That's, I think, the issue.

2407
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:06,660
Yes.

2408
01:47:06,660 --> 01:47:07,300
Yeah.

2409
01:47:07,300 --> 01:47:09,780
Get your four to nine-year-olds there.

2410
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:13,860
Your 36-year-old family members and friends will be confused.

2411
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:15,380
We're tired.

2412
01:47:15,380 --> 01:47:16,740
My wrist hurts.

2413
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:18,420
Our bodies are falling apart.

2414
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:20,820
My voice is tired.

2415
01:47:20,820 --> 01:47:22,180
I better end the show.

2416
01:47:22,180 --> 01:47:24,260

Eventually.

2424
01:47:48,340 --> 01:47:53,060
Right now we picked the first one, but it will become an interactive experience like

2425
01:47:53,060 --> 01:47:53,860
Web Slingers.

2426
01:47:53,860 --> 01:47:54,420
Exactly.

2427
01:47:54,420 --> 01:47:56,420
A Spider-Man adventure.

2428
01:47:57,540 --> 01:47:58,900
So great.

2429
01:47:58,900 --> 01:48:00,260
Good talking about it.

2430
01:48:00,260 --> 01:48:04,580
And I hope it made everyone's web dreams come true.

2431
01:48:04,580 --> 01:48:05,140
I hope it.

2432
01:48:05,140 --> 01:48:06,900
I hope it agreed with your biology.

2433
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:08,660
