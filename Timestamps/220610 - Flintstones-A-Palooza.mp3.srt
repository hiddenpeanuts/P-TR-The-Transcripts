1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,480
Warning, the following podcast contains a nightmarish RV campground, vitamin talk, men

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,800
in the concrete business, and a wide ranging look at themed entertainment featuring the

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,800
Flintstones.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,000
Hello, Dum Dum.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,800
It's Podcast The Ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,720
Welcome to Pod Rock The Ride, a Pod Rock about themosaurus parks hosted by three cavemen

9
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,640
in the year 30,000 BC.

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,800
I'm Scott Graniter, joined of course by Mike Carlstone.

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
Hello.

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,800
Hello, how are you?

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,640
Oh, yabba dabba doo to you.

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,760
Yabba dabba doo to you.

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,600
And yabba dabba doo as well to Jason Shelidon.

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,840
Sure, yeah, I'm glad you had something, because I was coming up short.

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,800
Why, can we do it again, because I've already forgot who everyone's.

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,520
I'm Scott Graniter, and you are Mike Carlstone.

19
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,520
Carlstone, okay, got it.

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,520
And that's Jason Shelidon.

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,520
Oh, yeah, okay, got it.

22
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,520
I'm going to forget it in five minutes, but I love it.

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,520
I don't know that it'll come up again.

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,520
That's a good point.

25
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,520
I don't think it'll be, yeah, I won't.

26
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,520
Although now I'm tempted to, to just like quiz.

27
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:33,520
We don't really like address each other by full names generally on the show once we get

28
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,520
rolling.

29
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,320
No, I'd say only if there's some, it's like an issue about like hotel booking.

30
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,240
It's like something really mundane, and that will provoke Jason to say Michael.

31
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,240
That's true, yes.

32
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,240
He's in his most parental.

33
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,960
Save $30, Michael!

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,000
His most parental tone, he will scold me by using my full name.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yes, that is true.

36
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,480
That's going to happen.

37
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,320
And we'll see if it happens today, please use my full Flintstone-ified name.

38
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
Which was Michael Carlstone?

39
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
Carlstone, I believe.

40
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,320
Carlstone, yeah, yeah.

41
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,320
That's pretty clean.

42
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320
Scott Granator.

43
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,320
Granator, which is a Ninja Turtle character.

44
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,320
Oh, really?

45
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,960
Which is one of the Dimension X rock soldiers, so I will not forget this anytime soon.

46
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
Oh, so it's good, it helps.

47
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,960
It's great.

48
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
It's not like a double up.

49
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,080
I mean, you're stealing from the most beloved IP in my mind of all time, but that's okay.

50
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,080
You're stealing valor.

51
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
You're stealing Turtles valor.

52
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,520
Stealing Dimension X valor.

53
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,160
Well, I was, because it could have been Graveler, too, so if I need to switch.

54
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,000
No, I think keep it as is.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay, okay.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,160
Oh, and you know what, I also wanted to thank the long-horned bird who was recording everything

57
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:47,080
that we say, who's pecking it onto a big, a round tablet, and that is how people will

58
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,600
be listening to this here at Forever Dino Studios.

59
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,200
We've got a video version running, if people want to check that out, on the YouTube, and

60
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,720
I think it'll be a good one for it, because we were packed to the gills with visual aids

61
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,960
for this one.

62
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:09,080
It seems important, I guess it struck us all, because today we're talking about the Flintstones.

63
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:15,360
The Flintstones, as they appear in the world of theme parks, which is oddly a lot, I think

64
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,360
we found.

65
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,360
Yes.

66
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,600
And it's all over the theme park universe.

67
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,160
So this is just, this is a grab bag of all the weird ways that the, our old pals, America's

68
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,680
favorite prehistoric family.

69
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,680
Yes.

70
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,240
Beating out who?

71
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,840
People in, there's like in Spaceship Earth, there's like cave drawing robots.

72
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,840
Yeah.

73
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
They're out.

74
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,480
Did you guys like the Flintstones growing up?

75
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,480
Yes.

76
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,480
Yeah, I did too.

77
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,480
Scott?

78
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,400
Yeah, I guess so, but I was wondering like, where, how did I see it, where did I see it,

79
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,520
it seems like it was just kind of ingested into the, injected into the bloodstream.

80
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,680
Yeah, I mean, syndication I think plays a big part.

81
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,840
It's kind of ubiquitous, it's just like around, in addition to syndication, Flintstones vitamins

82
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,840
growing up.

83
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,840
Well that, I think that's maybe my most serious.

84
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
Pebbles, cereals.

85
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
Yeah.

86
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,840
Fruity Pebbles is my number one.

87
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
Sure.

88
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,240
Flintstones vitamins number two, then the actual show, the Flintstones is number three,

89
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
I think.

90
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
Yeah.

91
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,240
I think.

92
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,520
Or no, Flintstones, the movie Flintstones with the Jetsons is number three.

93
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,520
Then the show Flintstones.

94
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,960
What about Push-Up Pops, do you remember those?

95
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,960
Oh, Push Pops.

96
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Orange Push Pops.

97
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Re-changing my lineup.

98
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,880
Yep, do it again.

99
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,520
Fruity Pebbles, Flintstones vitamins, Flintstones, no Push Pops, Flintstones Jetsons, then the

100
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,640
regular show, then Flintstones kids, the kids show from the 90s.

101
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,360
Was, were they kids or is that where Bam Bam and Pebbles are teenagers?

102
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,120
Oh, that's a, I think they're.

103
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,560
That's a different, I think that's different.

104
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Let me look.

105
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,440
There's a kids, there's definitely one where they're all like, where it's Fred and Wilma

106
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,000
and they're like six years old.

107
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,040
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

108
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,960
As opposed to later years where Pebbles and Bam Bam get married.

109
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,680
Different show, Flintstones kids, I'm looking here, these are toys I had because they were

110
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
on discount.

111
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,920
And these are when they were children.

112
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,200
So Pebbles and Bam Bam have not been conceived.

113
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,760
They have not been, they're just an idea.

114
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:13,160
No, because all the current, all the people we know are babies, which of course is a different

115
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,000
timeline than the one where Fred and Wilma meet.

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Wait no, they might not meet.

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,120
I think, is it Barney?

118
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,320
The Viva Rock Vegas prequel timeline, which I think doesn't pair them up.

119
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,760
I think you see them both, both pairs get together in that movie.

120
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,200
So they didn't, if they knew each other as babies, they all forgot.

121
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
Right, yes.

122
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,800
We're going to have to keep amending these lists because I think we'll remember more

123
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,120
Flintstones stuff as we go.

124
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,000
Because now I'm just remembering the Flintstones McDonald menu when the first movie came out.

125
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,600
And I believe like glasses they had like in the same Batman Forever style, they had Flintstone

126
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
glasses.

127
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,320
And before I saw the movie, I was so excited to see the Flintstones movie.

128
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,360
I think the Flintstones movie was one I knew was around, I knew about it.

129
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,320
But I feel like everyone in my family, Scott, much like your family, it's saying like maybe

130
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,320
skip Power Rangers.

131
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,240
I think everyone was kind of like, oh yeah, I don't know about that.

132
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,840
Yeah, I think I can pass on this one.

133
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:14,440
Now I'm like, I think I would probably like it more because there's Kyle McLaughlin in it.

134
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,440
Yeah, that's great.

135
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,440
And he's pretty good.

136
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,640
And John Goodman, of course.

137
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,360
Yeah, yeah, it's great actors.

138
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
That's true.

139
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,040
Entire Elizabeth Perkins, it is like super stacked with great people.

140
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,440
Jonathan Winters.

141
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,440
Oh, yeah.

142
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,440
Terrific.

143
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,440
Yeah.

144
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,080
The movie made me feel odd as a little kid.

145
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,680
I felt weird watching it and not just there's like some sexy Halle Berry stuff.

146
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,880
Anytime you were in the theater with your parents, I've said this boy Ace Ventura, it's just like

147
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,680
I was being like attacked.

148
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,880
I was just like, get me out of here.

149
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,280
And I don't even remember what it is in Flintstones movie.

150
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,720
She's kind of like sidling up to him.

151
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,880
Yeah, like a sexy sax will start playing.

152
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,320
Yeah, Sharon Stone, of course.

153
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,320
Sharon Stone, right.

154
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,680
Anytime in a movie when I before the age of like 15, if a sexy saxophone played, boy,

155
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,960
was I uncomfortable.

156
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,040
Boy, was that I had to get out.

157
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,640
If my parents were in the room, forget it.

158
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
I was mortified.

159
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,840
And what instrument did you play in marching band trumpet?

160
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,080
You not so you avoid it.

161
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,800
The saxophone, not that lascivious saxophone, not that slinky sultry.

162
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,400
No trumpet is stiff.

163
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,280
Yes, that's an instrument.

164
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,840
That's a regular instrument for chase young men.

165
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,360
That's a monogamous instrument for marriage, for when it's a marriage between you and the

166
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,840
trumpet. And it's something that, you know, it's for its conservative values.

167
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,640
That's what I thought when I started playing it.

168
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,440
Is the trumpet the one that plays like, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then,

169
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,920
then? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

170
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,760
Not a very that's the bugle.

171
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,560
Oh, you're right. OK. Yeah, yeah.

172
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,640
It's the yeah, it's the same fingerings.

173
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:01,720
Well, see, you manage to sexualize and can I, Brett, can you bring up this picture,

174
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,840
the Katie group photo picture I sent?

175
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,600
And again, we sent approximately seventy five.

176
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,080
I sent seventeen between photos and videos.

177
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:21,080
So I have a big memory is the characters, the Hanna-Barbera characters at King's

178
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,360
Dominion and at the Paramount Parks, like even pre Paramount ownership,

179
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,920
King's Dominion, Kings Island, the Hanna-Barbera characters were there.

180
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,880
And there was this image of a bunch of them hanging out.

181
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,400
This. Oh, I see.

182
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:44,040
It's it's Fred and Barney and Yogi and Scooby and Hong Kong, Hong Kong,

183
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,480
Fooey and then is that Captain Caveman?

184
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,200
Yes. Yeah.

185
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,760
And this was on all of their like promotional material brochures and stuff.

186
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,200
And this was just seared in my mind before a lot of extended relatives.

187
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,440
Why? What about this?

188
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,120
Because all my friends are there.

189
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,400
All my pals from television are there.

190
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,200
Captain Caveman, one of your good friends.

191
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,920
But Barney is it because so so just to describe to the listener,

192
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,120
because we are back on video if you want to switch over and look at some of this,

193
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,000
because again, we have a hundred photos.

194
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,520
But Barney is got his arms outstretched.

195
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,880
He's about to like welcome you with a warm hug.

196
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,000
Captain Caveman looks weird and he's making some weird symbol,

197
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,680
which I don't even know what that is.

198
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,200
And then a lot of waves like Yogi's waving, Fred's waving Scooby.

199
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,400
Fred looks like a kind of a triumph.

200
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,920
Yeah, we did. Yeah.

201
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,160
Fist in the air.

202
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,200
But it's stuff we like.

203
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,960
They are all hanging out in the park.

204
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,760
They all work in the park. They live in the park.

205
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,120
It's stuff we like.

206
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,120
We love it. We love that.

207
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,000
We do love it.

208
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,680
There was this other ad to Brett.

209
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,320
Could you play that video ad I sent?

210
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,200
And this this was, I think, a big

211
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,000
I think we'll all recognize it as soon as we see it.

212
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,040
But this was a big, big part of your brain.

213
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,120
For loving me. Yeah.

214
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,280
Hannah Barbera and.

215
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,520
Yeah, if Flintstones in general,

216
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,160
it's funny because there's we realizing slowly now that we've ingested

217
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,480
so much Flintstones in our many years, but none of it is like

218
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,800
so incredible that we are like we do.

219
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,560
We love Flintstones more than like the Mack tonight commercials from McDonald's.

220
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,960
No, no, I don't.

221
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,160
But yeah, and look how quickly we were willing to sell out the show.

222
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,480
Like that was the point.

223
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,720
And the show is fine. I don't think the show is bad or anything.

224
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,200
But it definitely it always was around.

225
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,280
It was like elevator music or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

226
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah, this is this is an older ad.

227
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But I think we all know lunch is over.

228
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,000
Now back to work.

229
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,960
Hi, Mr. Flintstone.

230
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,520
Greetings, Rocky, my boy, Packer Winston's.

231
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,760
Please. Oh, you.

232
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,520
And cigarettes, Mr. Flintstone.

233
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,320
Oh, real cigarette.

234
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,560
They really got so huge.

235
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,680
It's half of his face.

236
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,120
You really enjoy smoking.

237
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,840
No, it's what's up front.

238
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,880
Yeah, Scott, it's up.

239
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,120
That's where we're.

240
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,840
Steps out ahead of the crowd with their exclusive blend.

241
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,720
Choice, golden tobacco's specially selected and specially processed

242
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,560
for filters.

243
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,960
Well, hold it. Hold it.

244
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,680
You know what you mean?

245
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,000
What are you pitching Winston's at me for?

246
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,480
You know, I never smoke nothing else.

247
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,880
Just practicing, Mr. Flintstone.

248
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,360
Everybody knows that Winston tastes good like a cigarette.

249
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,880
Of course. See you soon.

250
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,520
Clap Jason's whole like comedic voice is basically based on this commercial.

251
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,160
Yeah, kind of. I forgot about it.

252
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,200
I'd forgotten the details.

253
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,480
And then I was like, wait, what's in this Flintstone sell cigarettes back in the six?

254
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,920
And the answer is yes, there is multiple ones because they were.

255
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,000
Yeah, they were like a prime time cartoon, which was unheard of at the time.

256
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,520
Yeah, it was like a cartoon for adults, even though you watch it.

257
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,480
And there's nothing like obviously there wasn't a lot of crazy stuff

258
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,400
on regular live action prime time.

259
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,520
But it's all 60 years old.

260
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,440
The more also is yes.

261
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,600
This came on in 1960.

262
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,440
Yeah. 62.

263
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,000
So like my mom was a big Flintstones person.

264
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,200
I don't know that she has like quotes ever, like in the same way that Simpsons,

265
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,360
you go, remember that moment, but she just liked the Flintstones a lot.

266
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,880
So well, there's one quote that just I feel like I say once a week.

267
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,720
It is. It already is a Jason drinking game.

268
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,760
I feel like you will never miss an opportunity.

269
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,440
That's true. It's a living.

270
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,800
But I don't even think that looms large.

271
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,880
I think that looms large for like our generation.

272
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,040
It's a kind of ironic.

273
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,680
Yes. Way a little bit.

274
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,480
Yeah, exactly. I would love to know the count on that, by which we mean

275
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,720
this is like the the birds who are the slaves, essentially of the all the cavemen.

276
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,440
That that's something they will say like when they have to do something very unglamorous.

277
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,240
Like they're like the dishwasher, like they're a dishwasher, the garbage disposal,

278
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,480
or like birds are basically in place of a machine that would do some work.

279
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,640
And then you like see the like pain on the bird's face as the bird turns to the camera,

280
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,840
breaks the fourth wall and says, it's a living.

281
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,560
Yeah, this is one of those like, do you think that was said 70 times or once?

282
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,280
I have no clue. I can't. I have zero.

283
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,080
I know. Yeah, because it might have been once and it was like memed in a way.

284
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,840
I think it's like every other episode. Really?

285
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,600
I feel like it's a go to.

286
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,840
Interesting. I would love to know the full count or if there's a super cut or

287
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,560
we'll investigate this further.

288
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,200
Well, I'm sure we'll get like a Flintstones fan that we're going to get a lot of

289
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,400
information wrong today and we'll get some some notes.

290
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,680
Yeah. So we apologize. We're not Flintstone experts.

291
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,040
Will we or like would we have if that person hadn't died

292
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,320
three, two years ago?

293
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,920
The first Clinton administration.

294
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,840
Yeah, that's a good point.

295
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,000
That's a good point. There are a state will send us a letter correcting us.

296
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,120
Yeah. Speaking of getting things wrong, can you bring up that Kings Island brochure?

297
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,920
This is actually an opening brochure of Kings Island.

298
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,520
So they had the Hanna Barbera characters and it's got a feature

299
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,960
that I just really like about like old school printing.

300
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,840
You kind of saw it in like the costume characters, too, where like, oh, the fabric.

301
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,680
They seemed like they ran out of the one color fabric.

302
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,960
So they just cheat it like the five o'clock shadow.

303
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,200
If you'll notice, pink Fred with a white mouth.

304
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,440
Whoa, with white eyes into white

305
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,760
nose into white five o'clock shadow.

306
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,840
Yeah. And Scooby is there and Yogi is there.

307
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,840
And then who are those? The banana splits.

308
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,600
Banana splits. Right. Yeah.

309
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,320
So, yeah. And then a really scary like raid.

310
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,400
This is like a ground zero kind of like it's like a military

311
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,720
attack map, like they're going to drop bombs on risk.

312
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,800
Kings Island in Ohio risk.

313
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,520
It's a scary bullseye.

314
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,960
It gets like more red as it goes.

315
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,840
You know, 1972, all those conspiracy movies are coming out.

316
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,240
They're like government

317
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,960
parallax, you know, marathon man.

318
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,320
Yeah. It's the style, you know.

319
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,480
Yeah. So so there's so much Flintstones everywhere.

320
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,480
It's been with us for so long.

321
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,680
And I guess we'll never leave

322
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,520
because there's going to be more more stuff.

323
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,200
We haven't even talked about, I think, our favorite Flintstones character at all,

324
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,000
which is, of course, great.

325
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,480
Zoo. Yeah. Yeah.

326
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,720
I was going to I was thinking how this was going to go.

327
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,200
That like I'm sure we've talked about it before, but it did occur to me like I bet

328
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,160
Mike and Jason inordinately love great.

329
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,200
Of course. 100 percent.

330
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,520
He's our favorite. He's our favorite character.

331
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,440
And what is the how long did great?

332
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,760
Zoo. How long was he a presence?

333
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,320
Well, he's a leader season. I don't have the stats.

334
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,760
I'm sorry. A state of man.

335
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,840
Harvey Korman. It was Harvey Korman.

336
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,800
But I was going to apologize to the Flintstone expert that kind of like the

337
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,320
the deceased died 30 years ago.

338
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,440
Yeah. Harvey Korman also probably kind of like a cousin Oliver.

339
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,400
Yeah. A late period.

340
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,320
And more committed to and probably maybe more like than cousin.

341
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,960
Yeah. Cause it doesn't all of a really thrown away.

342
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,120
Yeah. Well, there's also stuff in comics of like like Batman has a

343
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,120
kind of great gazoo called Batman.

344
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,520
Superman has Mr. Mixy as Pitalik.

345
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,000
He's from the fourth dimension.

346
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,560
Most complicated word.

347
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,320
It's hard to say. Yeah, it's really hard to say.

348
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,000
And Gilbert Godfrey voiced him on the animated.

349
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,040
It's a trope. I wonder why.

350
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,600
It's a trope in fiction of like a weird little guy.

351
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,720
Magical man who annoys the shit out of you constantly and can do anything.

352
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,520
I mean, it's in it's basically Q and Star Trek.

353
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,840
It's like this.

354
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,160
It happens all the time.

355
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,640
This is a a fun guy that fucks with the main character.

356
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,000
And what and what did what day to day function

357
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,200
did the addition of this little alien?

358
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,840
What did he add to this caveman?

359
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,880
He insulted Fred constantly call him dumb.

360
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,440
Oh, hi. Oh, dumb.

361
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,320
Hello, dumb.

362
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,200
Oh, why is he?

363
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,280
Why does he show up?

364
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,800
I don't. I don't remember.

365
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,400
They ran out of honeymoon.

366
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,440
Honeymooners plots to rip off their episode.

367
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,920
They went far beyond.

368
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,320
I think they made a lot more.

369
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,520
Yeah, I think so.

370
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,960
So this is again, this is like in the same way that like

371
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,040
I'm a fan of Ivanu's more than I'm a fan of the lore of Ivanu's.

372
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,200
I'm a fan of great because you existing.

373
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,920
Yes, sure.

374
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,120
I'm not a gazoo head.

375
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,440
I don't know. Similarly, vaudevillian.

376
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,440
Yeah, it's a funny idiosyncratic performance

377
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,840
kind of in tone with the thing, but kind of not.

378
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,800
I guess Ivanu is more in tone with Power Rangers.

379
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,840
Yeah, somewhat. Yeah.

380
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,320
Still like a little bit old.

381
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,480
Like, I guess, I don't know.

382
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,760
I can't think of anyone who was like an old 30s vaudeville performer.

383
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,360
That was a character on the show before Ivan.

384
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,640
Yeah, I think I thought initially that when Duffy first showed up,

385
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,560
Duffy the Disney bear, I was like, who the hell?

386
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,720
What the fuck is this?

387
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,800
Like, is he going to be like a great gazoo type?

388
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,200
And then like, no.

389
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,400
You thought he's going to have magical powers.

390
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,960
I thought he was going to be like a weird little guy

391
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,160
that they just added into like, and of course, Mickey's teddy bear.

392
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,160
Hey, I'm Duffy. Hey.

393
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,240
You know that big date with Minnie?

394
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm coming along, too.

395
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,040
I'll be your Cyrano Duffy.

396
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,320
I'm turning your Cyrano Duff Burdra.

397
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm turning your T-bone steak into a piece of dynamite.

398
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,800
I'm going to make your life a living hell.

399
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,640
I'm Duffy.

400
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,840
Hey, Mickey, go off yourself.

401
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,480
I mean, that's something.

402
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,400
There's a lot more of a character there.

403
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,000
There's a yeah. Duffy.

404
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,680
Duffy is nice.

405
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,840
Seems to be his only trait. Yeah.

406
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,280
Yeah. And reality.

407
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,600
The only real media.

408
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Oh, I guess there's little books of it, but the only media is like the story,

409
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,240
the show in Tokyo Disney Sea.

410
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,640
And yes, he's got nothing.

411
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,440
Duffy's got nothing to do, nothing to say.

412
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,840
He's just nice and cute.

413
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah. And that's all he's got.

414
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,800
But I don't have him like tie Mickey's tail up into his shoelaces.

415
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,000
Yeah. Mickey trips and falls into a river.

416
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,400
And make him a little jerk.

417
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,480
Mm hmm. I think that's a good Jason's got a great idea that he thought.

418
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,120
Yeah. Duffy was going to be like Mickey's great gazoo.

419
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,840
I just in the sense that he just showed up out of nowhere.

420
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,400
And I was like, oh, what is what's going on here?

421
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,560
Well, I think they've you know, they've there's other characters

422
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,400
in the Duffy verse now.

423
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,160
So who knows who?

424
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,000
Joe Tony seems like more like he would replace a T-bone steak

425
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,360
with a stick of dynamite.

426
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,560
Yeah, he seems a little bit more rowdy, a little wild.

427
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,680
Well, Mickey is definitely wild in one way.

428
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,280
As we've established sexually.

429
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,360
Yes. Anyway, he talks.

430
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,920
We just do the sums and, you know, we can we can decide.

431
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,000
This is like a day in a theme park where we can all decide what ride.

432
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,520
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Hit first.

433
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,800
But let me just do the overview really quickly of the theme park

434
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,880
presence of the Flintstones, as Jason mentioned, was some of the older ones.

435
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,760
They're part of the Paramount Parks, the one time Paramount Parks,

436
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,680
Kings Island and Kings Dominion.

437
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,960
Longtime association with the Universal Parks

438
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,040
of the via the the Hanna-Barbera ride in Florida has been stuff

439
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,200
that Universal Hollywood over the years still was up till pretty recently.

440
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,160
I forget if there's anything now that Universal Studios has represented

441
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,400
both the cartoons and the John Goodman live action versions of everybody.

442
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,240
In here in Los Angeles, there's a place called Marine Land

443
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,080
that we've never talked about in like Palace Verde's.

444
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,480
That's been gone for a long time, but they did the Hanna-Barbera characters,

445
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,720
including Flintstones.

446
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,800
They appeared at Wonderland in Australia.

447
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,840
There were a bunch of weird tiny parks slash trailer parks

448
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:57,360
in Arizona and South Dakota and Canada and Australia's Wonderland,

449
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,080
Canada's Wonderland and Warner Brothers world in Abu Dhabi.

450
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,920
They knew a very new theme park, so they're still making new Flintstones stuff.

451
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,000
But if you listen, that's like everything but Disney and Six Flags, essentially.

452
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,200
Right. They've hit every category of theme, like a very confusing IP.

453
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,240
Right. It's just slipped and slid into every type of park they could get into.

454
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,840
And it feels like if Disney or Six Flags wanted them, they go, yeah,

455
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,200
put whatever you want to do.

456
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,800
We don't give a shit like they all licensed to anybody.

457
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,080
They don't seem to care that much.

458
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,120
Maybe. Yeah.

459
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,960
Nobody hates them.

460
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,320
Affordable. Maybe like licensing wise.

461
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,680
That could certainly be.

462
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,760
There was some the Canadian.

463
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,720
OK, we'll get into Bedrock City.

464
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,960
I mean, we could we could just be here all night talking about Bedrock City.

465
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,200
But there are multiple Bedrock cities.

466
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,360
The two American ones are connected.

467
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,280
But then there was a grip of Canadian ones

468
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,880
that all had like different stories of how they got off the ground.

469
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,080
And I feel like the number I saw floated was like five hundred

470
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,200
thousand dollars for the licensing.

471
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,800
Oh, and I'm like, that's that doesn't seem like a one time.

472
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,960
It seemed like a one time fee for Flintstones,

473
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,720
which are very recognizable characters,

474
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,920
and especially I think for an older generation as well, I guess beloved.

475
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,600
So, yeah, that does seem a little low.

476
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,240
But I don't honestly I don't have I was shocked when there was a list of bands

477
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,000
and how much they would charge.

478
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,560
A couple of years ago, there was a whole list like you could just hire

479
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,680
cheap trick for like forty thousand dollars.

480
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,640
And I'm like, what? Like, that's not necessarily the number.

481
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,040
But you are shocked at some of the numbers.

482
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,400
So I don't really guess I guess now that I'm thinking about it,

483
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,760
I don't have a good number of like what would you license

484
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,120
Beetle Bailey for for a theme park ride?

485
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,600
Right. How much is Beetle Bailey cost?

486
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,200
In twenty twenty two.

487
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,480
Well, how do you find that?

488
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,960
It seems like a lot for Beetle Bailey. Yeah.

489
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,440
I mean, how do you to an accountant?

490
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,640
How would you say priceless?

491
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,200
How would I say that?

492
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,960
I guess you would say not for sale.

493
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,760
Yeah. High and lowest.

494
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,880
I wanted to make a e-ticket high and lowest ride.

495
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,640
What are we talking? Twenty twenty K.

496
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,800
Is that too low?

497
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,120
Well, knowing that you're going to get millions and millions in return,

498
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,720
I guess that depends on who it is.

499
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,040
You're going to have to like force kids out.

500
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,360
OK. But if OK, if I wanted to do just an immersive family circus

501
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,080
walkthrough down, you know, on Ventura somewhere. Mm hmm.

502
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,600
And I'm charging five dollars a ticket.

503
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,360
OK. For how forever?

504
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,320
Forever in perpetuity.

505
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,880
I'd like to quit the podcast and I devote my time to a walkthrough

506
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,080
family circus attraction, which I know you appreciate.

507
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,080
I see your big family.

508
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,560
Yeah, I've been with him before.

509
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,120
Blondie. You're in the experience.

510
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,040
You're in the strip. Yeah.

511
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,800
Yeah. So like what?

512
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,680
This is for another episode where we we start asking.

513
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,600
Well, we just we each pick a different King Features Syndicate property

514
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,000
and we call the lawyer for King Features Syndicate

515
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,560
and we figure out what the fee is.

516
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,960
Yeah. And see what to get.

517
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,800
So an episode will be that you get a number of this comic distribution company.

518
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,520
Yeah. Which is a first company.

519
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,680
Right. And it's a Hearst company. Mm hmm.

520
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,560
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

521
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,560
Oh, yeah.

522
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,600
Because one of the things I was going to say is I do wonder

523
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,200
if Hanna Barbera was not the most litigious company,

524
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,080
because another thing I remember growing up

525
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,840
is between miniature golf courses or like family fun zones,

526
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,480
a lot of off brands, Flintstones painted or statues.

527
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,880
And there's some stuff today where I'm like, did they just give up?

528
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,720
Did they just give up on the license or enforcing the license?

529
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,560
I found something often international waters that I'll mention towards the end.

530
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,680
It seems like maybe they just yeah, maybe just they don't have a legal person.

531
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,960
Yeah. Or I mean, who Hanna Barbera is owned by Warner Brothers now, I believe.

532
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,680
So maybe they just they've just had so many new daddies over the last few years.

533
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,160
They're just like, no, we don't have time for this.

534
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,720
Corporate. You're speaking in corporate terms.

535
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,880
New daddies. Yeah.

536
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,760
They had AT&T daddy.

537
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,200
Discovery, Discovery Daddy.

538
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,600
You know, too many daddies.

539
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,560
What an issue.

540
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,480
You want to dive into this bedrock city?

541
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

542
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:20,600
Yeah, Bedrock City is this series of I mean, you would you that

543
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,960
you would call them theme parks.

544
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,800
They are called theme parks, but they're also like campgrounds is what they are.

545
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,680
They can park there and yeah, you can sleep on the ground.

546
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:37,600
All sort of off the beaten path, not too close to anything too populous.

547
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,520
Hey, Brad, I'm just going to spin the wheel here.

548
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,720
Just pull if you see a picture somewhere of a shady looking desolate campground.

549
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,720
We'll just bring it up to have something up to talk about.

550
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,320
But but as we as that comes up,

551
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,280
I believe the first one was in 1966, right as the show ended

552
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,040
in the town of Custer, South Dakota.

553
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,760
It's about half an hour from Mount Rushmore.

554
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,000
Yes. Custer sounds like a great spot.

555
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,520
Before it was Custer, it was called Stonewall.

556
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,000
So they keep shifting between civil warish names.

557
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,280
And I looked on the Wikipedia of Custer and there are two notable residents.

558
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,280
And one of them is just listed.

559
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,720
The parenthetical is just convicted murderer.

560
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,000
Got it. Got it.

561
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
So a lot going on in Custer.

562
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,160
I believe that both of the places that we're talking about

563
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,600
started because they're here. This is a great one.

564
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,960
OK, wonderful. Thank you, Brett.

565
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,680
We're looking at the Flintstones

566
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,960
in front of what is some nature in the background.

567
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,280
There is this.

568
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,000
This is I think is pristine bedrock city.

569
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,120
This is this is when things were going great.

570
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,000
Yeah, still looks like I mean, it looks like there's like a walk around

571
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,480
Barney, who just looks like he took a big mallet to the head.

572
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,960
Like it squished him down by half.

573
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,600
Yeah. And then he like lipoed all the muscles out of his body.

574
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,480
Yeah. And heads were designed by whoever designed the Zodiac Killers

575
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,480
perlap sack. This make no mistake.

576
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,800
This is a terrifying photo.

577
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,640
The place looks like shit.

578
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,600
And it is by far the best photo of Bedrock City I have seen.

579
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,360
That seems correct. Yes, because things are going well back then.

580
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,800
Look at what these now we're seeing details up on this big screen TV

581
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,440
that I had not seen before.

582
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,160
The odd scatter shot choices in how to represent Fred and Barney,

583
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,200
like, for example, plush heads, right?

584
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,400
Barney, I'm sorry. OK, Barney regular arms.

585
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,720
But Fred plush arms.

586
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,360
Yeah, I think real hands poking through at least through one of them.

587
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,800
And then and then it goes to just bare human legs, but then plush feet.

588
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,200
Yeah, which is good because the ground looks hot.

589
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,120
They are just walking on rocks.

590
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,240
So you don't want people actually barefoot, even though that would be

591
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,760
Flintstones realistic. Yeah.

592
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,800
Really strange. And then look at Barney's pupils to just beady whites.

593
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,640
That is a kind of consistent with Barney.

594
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,720
Sometimes Barney was just pupils in the cartoon.

595
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,480
I think his look has evolved, but for a while he was just dots.

596
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,120
Barney sometimes has a very Homer Simpson kind of like eyeballs

597
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,640
going different places look to make him look vacant. Yeah.

598
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,480
And it is certainly captured in the photo we're looking at here.

599
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,680
So they got the essence of the character for sure.

600
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,160
I mean, I wouldn't mind.

601
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:40,680
I'd rather hug Fred because there is more plush involved.

602
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,080
It feels more like you're hugging a cartoon. Yeah.

603
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,720
Barney, just bare muscular arms.

604
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,120
A very sunburnt. Yeah. Yeah.

605
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,040
Barney can. Yeah.

606
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,760
Barney looks like somebody killed Barney

607
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:57,120
and is wearing his head on top of their head and the shirt is draped over.

608
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,040
And that's it.

609
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,800
They can make it through this shift at Bedrock City.

610
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,760
Then they can like make it live in the mountains forever.

611
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,160
Yeah. Squirrels and worms and see how long they make it.

612
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,960
Exactly. Now, the second Bedrock City, I saw an anecdote that like

613
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,320
they had walk around Fred and Barney, but the second

614
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,400
Bedrock City is in Arizona.

615
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,160
And it's 30 minutes from the Grand Canyon.

616
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,320
It's kind of in the middle of nowhere.

617
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,360
So they had to get rid of the walk around Fred and Barney

618
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,800
because they did not have enough locals.

619
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,840
They could not find enough people willing to work that day to make the commute.

620
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,800
There's we have when new theme parks open.

621
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,040
It's like, well, this can be a source of jobs.

622
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,960
And that's what they thought.

623
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,760
Except nobody lives in the place where they needed the jobs. Yeah.

624
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,960
So jobs not wanted can't be filled.

625
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,400
So that's why what you find in the both Bedrock City locations

626
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:56,000
more so is a bunch of plaster, plaster characters.

627
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,000
And look, again, we sent such a pile of bread.

628
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,320
Feel free to just freestyle.

629
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,360
Let's just see some odd

630
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,160
some of the frightening.

631
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,120
OK, well, you started with the my.

632
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,800
Yeah, I said I love this.

633
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,520
I have this picture I sent to you.

634
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,560
This is insane. What are we seeing?

635
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,960
OK, so bigger picture here. Yeah.

636
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,640
You are OK.

637
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,320
In theory, you're looking at all the stuff in Bedrock.

638
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,840
You're seeing where the characters live and you're seeing, you know,

639
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:29,920
the post office and the city hall and the different parts of town.

640
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:35,720
But in this case, we're in the bank and there is a bank robbery in progress.

641
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,080
We're looking at a currently at large

642
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,680
masked criminal holding up something.

643
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,920
Is it a gun?

644
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,640
I'm not sure how much guns were addressed in the Flintstones.

645
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,080
I remember that Kyle McLaughlin in the movie has a weird contraption

646
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,400
that fires pebbles. Yeah.

647
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,000
Which I was like, that's pretty good.

648
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,360
They thought they figured out a way to give them a gun.

649
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,440
Yeah. In this rock movie.

650
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,080
I'm not sure what this bad guy's holding.

651
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,520
A very alarmed woman.

652
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,640
There's a lot of leaves all over her desk.

653
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,640
I don't know if leaves are considered currency.

654
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,680
We know that shells were shells were.

655
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,800
But I don't think leaves.

656
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,640
These are just real leaves that blew into this building, I believe.

657
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,440
I think so. It's a very dusty environment.

658
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,000
This general everything. So, yeah. So, yeah.

659
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,840
If you want to go, we're doing we're doing this on video.

660
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,040
If you want to take a look to after you've heard this or whatever.

661
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,880
And we'll post some of these photos.

662
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,640
But I just want to emphasize, imagine what a Flintstones park would look like

663
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,120
if it was dismal land, if it was Banksy's.

664
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,640
Oh, yes. Twisted version and everything looks like it's decaying.

665
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,960
Purposefully bad dystopian park.

666
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,880
Yeah. Also, it's an art exhibit.

667
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,680
So how much can you actually fill up the space?

668
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,000
There's a lot of vacant space, I feel like, at all these bedrock cities.

669
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,040
It's kind of hard because like in Arizona, beautiful, like big sky,

670
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:00,080
I'm sure in South Dakota, too, like a clean air, not a lot of pollution,

671
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,880
beautiful clouds.

672
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,040
And then when you tilt your head down a little and look at eye level,

673
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,280
it looks like children of men.

674
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:15,840
It looks like what the theme parks may look like without any children around.

675
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

676
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,160
Although post nuclear blast.

677
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,040
Although we don't probably be having a great time.

678
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,280
People like us, we'd be like, hey, there's no kids.

679
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,440
We get whatever we want.

680
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,960
Well, that's I mean, that seems like the main way that these places have existed.

681
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,120
They're both defunct now and in the last 10 years.

682
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,360
And I knew of them primarily from like we're going to go

683
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,040
we're going to sneak into Bedrock City and see what's there.

684
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,960
But I don't think it's always even sneaking into.

685
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,880
I think there is no there's not even like a wall you got to climb.

686
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,480
I think you just walk up and you're in it.

687
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,800
I think also that technically all of these places were supposed to give up

688
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,280
the copyright as part of the closure.

689
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,280
Yeah, one of them, the Arizona one is now called Raptor Ranch.

690
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,560
Raptor Ranch. Do you have the have you watched the promotional?

691
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,480
No commercial for Raptor Ranch.

692
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,640
Brett, can we get that Raptor Ranch video?

693
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,320
And I think we'll see how they dealt with

694
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,360
dealing with the Flintstones license. Yeah.

695
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,440
OK, OK. Interesting.

696
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,360
Because, yeah, it's you know, there's there's like when you were saying like

697
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,680
that's like it's spread out versions of the houses and there's just

698
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,880
there looks like there's miles between themed themed in quotation marks buildings.

699
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

700
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,600
It's a miniature golf course with no miniature golf.

701
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,920
Yeah, yeah. Perfect description.

702
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,280
Now, Raptor Ranch, not to confuse you further, listener,

703
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,560
the Raptors in question are not dinosaurs.

704
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,360
They're birds of prey.

705
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,400
Current existing birds of prey.

706
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,680
Falcons there.

707
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:44,520
Also, another thing to mention, this opened in August of 2020,

708
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,600
a terrific time for the travel industry, although kind of prescient,

709
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,480
kind of a good timing, because like people were looking for outdoor activities to do.

710
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,960
That's true. Yeah.

711
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,440
So some some might say Raptor Ranch people were the smartest of all.

712
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,840
Yeah, but I think it'll become clear how they dealt with all those bedrock stuff.

713
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,600
And we'll we'll we'll talk our way through it.

714
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,200
OK, so whenever you want to.

715
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,840
So it says before you visit the Grand Canyon, look up.

716
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:15,200
There's something wild and it's in red, not the white in the air.

717
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,120
OK, so they paid for a drone pilot.

718
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,040
They paid for like a drone operator.

719
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,520
This is a drone.

720
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,720
And we're seeing like shots of just RVs parked in a parking lot.

721
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,720
Very empty parking lot.

722
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:30,000
Still say there's still so it's all about Raptors and birds.

723
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,360
But then Yabba Dabba Doo means welcome here.

724
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,880
Yeah, there's still a sign.

725
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:38,800
Fred is still and there's like guys like with like string and falkens and owls

726
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,920
and feeding falcons and there's this owl guy running around.

727
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,320
And it's it's yeah, there's a lot of cute birds and all this is a

728
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,680
falcon eat a critter.

729
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,440
Was that a mouse?

730
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,400
It looked like, yeah.

731
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,200
So so we're just seeing a lot of birds.

732
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,840
They have like the helmet on.

733
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,800
So what you're saying, but then explore bedrock.

734
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,560
They just said, fuck you.

735
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,160
Even it kept going since the 60s, motherfucker.

736
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,320
All there, the post office bedrock lives.

737
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,160
They got that drone in and what and what I like what they've done is they

738
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,560
run if you're a hipster, you can be there.

739
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,800
We encourage abandoned type YouTube videos.

740
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,560
Hipsters can do the diet that brought a source slide like Fred Flintstone

741
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,640
getting off his job.

742
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,800
And then there's a souvenir shop of knives,

743
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,400
you know, geodes, emergency supplies, hostess and cam.

744
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,760
And then park your RV there.

745
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,600
You can spend the night at Raptor Ranch.

746
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,440
You could spend the night with the rest of your walking dead caravan.

747
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,160
And why do they just do a close up of an empty?

748
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,880
Well, Scott, that's a water hookup.

749
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,200
That's a water hookup.

750
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,280
For an RV. They have water.

751
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,480
Yeah, you can get you can hook hook it up and then you can get the shit

752
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,680
out of the toilet in the RV.

753
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,760
Yeah. And then they paid for this drone footage.

754
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,440
So they're going to make the use of it.

755
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,360
And they're just going to keep doing it.

756
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,360
So bedrock lives at Raptor Ranch.

757
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,480
Bedrock lives. They have got it clean.

758
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,160
They have not changed a thing about it.

759
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,360
They didn't add a coat of paint to any of the buildings.

760
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,800
Well, they still also have a diner

761
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,560
that I think is just Fred's diner.

762
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,200
I could be wrong about that.

763
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,480
But they it's like lightly themed.

764
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,840
Um, they're and they serve like

765
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,000
fruity pebbles, pancakes and cocoa pebbles, waffles.

766
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Smart. So shit you guys like.

767
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,080
I ate one of those like a month ago.

768
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:37,640
I ate a waffle topped with fruity pebbles, strawberries and maple syrup.

769
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,560
And about a month ago in 2020, I made a fruity pebbles cheesecake for Thanksgiving.

770
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,880
During the pandemic. Yeah. Really?

771
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,200
How did that turn out? It was good.

772
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,280
It was fruity pebble crust.

773
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,760
You make crust out of fruity pebbles.

774
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,840
Oh, the crust is. Yeah. Wow.

775
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,280
And like, yeah, it's good.

776
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,040
Maybe I'll do it again.

777
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,120
I feel like maybe do I need to like get reacquainted with fruity pebbles in an episode?

778
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:02,280
Like we've been talking about this kind of like, isn't that like isn't the sweetness insane?

779
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,080
Or do you like when you pack it together?

780
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,280
There's some. Yeah, I mean, it is sweet.

781
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,360
I don't. I'm trying to remember.

782
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,280
I'm trying to think like what's the sweetest cereal.

783
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,720
I guess it is.

784
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,880
But there is something I don't know if it's like a chemical.

785
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,960
There's an extra chemical in there that makes you want to have like

786
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,240
the same four bowls of it in a row.

787
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,760
But there's something about it because there's plenty of sweet stuff that I go.

788
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,040
I have one and I'm done.

789
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,160
But fruity pebbles, there's some weird.

790
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,800
There's like some sort of drug.

791
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,400
There's like cocaine in it or something.

792
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,600
Do you think they've changed the like chemical makeup since you were?

793
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,600
They've changed the chemical makeup of so much food.

794
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,320
Yeah, apparently. Like it used to be.

795
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,320
Yeah, it used to be owed.

796
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,720
And now it's all just corn syrup and other weird shit.

797
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:44,000
And yeah, it's all we're all being slowly poisoned by all major food companies,

798
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,560
I think, in America. Sure. Yeah.

799
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,400
But yeah, no, they've I've said this before on the show.

800
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,120
I remember when tricks changed, I remember tasting tricks and going,

801
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,920
these are different.

802
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,240
And I never said it out loud because who would have been in a podcast?

803
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,240
Who would have believed me?

804
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,680
And I didn't have a podcast yet.

805
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,040
So I'm sure they have.

806
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:05,880
But fruity pebbles does retain a lot of my like I retain my love of it,

807
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,560
despite the fact that it's 60 percent poison.

808
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,800
Yeah, you know, it's more so used to be 30 percent poison than 100.

809
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,280
Yeah. So we'll do a we should do Jason.

810
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,880
I bring in our favorite childhood food indulgences.

811
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,600
And by childhood, you mean this last Thursday. Sure.

812
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,040
Yes. I guess really what I'm looking for a title that better describes

813
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,080
that we started enjoying it as a childhood and maintained it well into our thirties.

814
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,840
Makes make Scott eat like me.

815
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,440
Yeah. The name of this episode.

816
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:43,600
Omakase treat Omakase, the Japanese tasting venue, the multi course.

817
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,240
So yeah, a word that I only know, because that's what

818
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,360
Jeffrey Katzenberg wanted to call quibby.

819
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,720
I would not have known this fancy sushi.

820
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,120
So we'll bring it in. Yeah.

821
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,920
Well, yeah, Michael, I'll wear Pebbles family.

822
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,200
I'll cover little debbies.

823
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,880
Yes. Well, both dresses of Jason have both dresses, waiters.

824
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,800
And we'll come in like with little like the thing draped over

825
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,120
with the fruity pebble pattern on your bow tie.

826
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,600
The free bows are available.

827
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,320
There's no way they're not available.

828
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,520
That's like every fruit, every fruity pebble thing and Cocoa Pebbles is all like,

829
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,720
I feel you can get that.

830
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,640
I really can get a three piece fruity pebble suit at its sugar.

831
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,080
I know that's not right, but I feel like I see enough of that

832
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:29,360
like advertised to me on Instagram that you can get like Pringles,

833
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,360
like a Pringles wedding dress.

834
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:36,080
Yeah, like there's so much weird like food branding clothes lately

835
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,400
that I think whatever you think of is is available.

836
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,320
The wedding ceremony where the you see the bride come in

837
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,760
and she's in a Pringles pattern and then it cuts to the groom

838
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,680
who looks like Mr. Pringle.

839
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,120
Yeah. Pringle in his Joseph A.

840
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,640
Bank X Pringles limited edition suit.

841
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,120
Yeah. So we'll see.

842
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,480
Now, not everything at these

843
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:07,440
bedrock city parks are poorly done because the South Dakota one

844
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,160
has an animatronic show, the Flintstone Trio,

845
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,240
as which is built by Sally Dark Rides is when I saw it,

846
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,160
I knew I'd seen it before.

847
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,760
Sally Dark Rides, our favorite makers of bizarre,

848
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,160
sometimes janky theme park attractions, but some of our favorite oddities.

849
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,840
And so this is a Sally Dark Rides original.

850
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:35,120
It's the Flintstone Trio is Fred Wilma and Dino.

851
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,640
Dino on drums.

852
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,480
It seems like for the good a good length of the end of the run

853
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,480
of the Flintstone Trio, the Dino's arms had broken and did not move.

854
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,560
Sure. And his drumsticks were just sitting in his hands motionless.

855
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,960
But they, you know, nevertheless, you heard the drum sounds.

856
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,400
Did you find a clip of that?

857
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,040
I did. Yeah, I have two clips.

858
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,600
You can't really hear well.

859
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,040
I'll just I'll just break.

860
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,880
Go to Wilma song because there's a couple of songs

861
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,800
and it's really hard to hear.

862
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,320
But the Wilma song, I believe, is a recognizable song.

863
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,200
But it was, yeah, just like a Chuck E.

864
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,880
Cheese animatronic show with three robots that did move a little bit.

865
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,120
And yeah, it's not well documented.

866
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,880
This is a VHS or not, I guess.

867
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,440
But what's the old way we'd record?

868
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,880
What's the format?

869
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,680
Maybe I'd still call it.

870
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,320
I guess sometimes you would take the VHS.

871
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:34,960
Yeah. But anyway, so it's a so it's a very grainy, very poorly sounding.

872
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,360
We had one of the and my mother would not let me touch it.

873
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,760
Do you think it was a Faberge egg?

874
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:45,560
Like I was just going to immediately push it over from a far height.

875
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,240
Was she did she did you break things a lot as a kid?

876
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,640
No, I don't think any more than any regular kid.

877
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,520
So you OK, you weren't like a butter fingers or something.

878
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,280
I don't think so.

879
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,200
I don't think I was.

880
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,760
I would not call myself naturally graceful as a kid or an adult.

881
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,880
Oh, yeah. So.

882
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,240
Did you have butter on your hands a lot like you would slip?

883
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,280
They would slip through your hands.

884
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,840
I don't think I was a particularly sticky kid either.

885
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,680
Well, but I think you would be good.

886
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,240
Well, that would be good in this case.

887
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:14,760
You would help.

888
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,240
But that keeps the camera in your hand.

889
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,920
And I didn't make the connection of like, because we did take it to Disney World.

890
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,160
And God knows where those those are probably in a box.

891
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,040
So there are once or twice, I think.

892
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,440
But I don't think it occurred to me to tell one of my parents

893
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,320
we're going to go on this ride.

894
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,320
We're going to go on World of Motion.

895
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,360
And I want you to videotape the ride.

896
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:40,880
I have a video outside World of Motion that I was recording with my family in Epcot.

897
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,840
And I'm so annoying behind the camera because I go, oh, yeah.

898
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:48,480
I'm like, hey, dad, hey, dad, dad, look over here, dad, dad.

899
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,400
And you're like, why are you doing like just capture the moment?

900
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,120
Yeah. Cinema verite, you know, like, let's get a real real life reaction to you.

901
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,200
You're not trying to influence.

902
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,560
You're the documentarian.

903
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:04,560
Well, I had an era where I thought I could be like Tom Green and get a rise out of my parents.

904
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,880
Oh, yeah. But of course, I wasn't going to do anything as X rated as how Tom Green got a rise out of his.

905
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,840
But so I had no plan.

906
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,080
I just similar to you.

907
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,600
I think I'd probably just like, oh, hey, mom, mom.

908
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,440
It's so annoying.

909
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,400
Yeah, because like I have a high like, hello, dad.

910
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,240
Hello, dumb dumb. Yeah.

911
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,800
I had nothing to.

912
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,000
That would have been funny, at least.

913
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,200
Yeah. I had nothing to say once he turned around.

914
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,800
It's like wave the camera, dad.

915
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,280
Wave, wave.

916
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,520
And then he's like, yeah, where are you going with this, pal?

917
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,400
You are making this drive worse.

918
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,800
Yeah, that's all you're doing.

919
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,840
You're making this more annoying for both of us.

920
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,600
Have a game plan if you're going to call your dad on camera.

921
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,440
OK, let's play this clip from the Flintstones.

922
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,120
It's trio. The trio.

923
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,160
Stone Trio Lounge in South Dakota.

924
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,800
Yeah, I came across this.

925
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,480
This is my guy. Yes.

926
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,000
And then Fred responds here, right?

927
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,840
You're my girl, too, will mom.

928
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,080
So I mean, this is it.

929
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,520
You can you can stop it because the very curious.

930
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,800
It's so clacky.

931
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,320
The robot noises are so loud.

932
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,240
You have to imagine that it's not just the recording

933
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:25,040
that when you were actually watching the show, the clacks are overpowering

934
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,040
the actual singing and music.

935
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,640
This is now I like that this is from the video.

936
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,400
What you can tell is that this was a theatrical presentation.

937
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,680
The lights are off.

938
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,040
You are like it is time to watch this children.

939
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:41,440
And there's some younger than my son kids having to watch this

940
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,760
and being very patient.

941
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,480
But this is not a checky cheese where you can sort of ignore it.

942
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,800
Yeah. If you want. Oh, yeah.

943
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,520
No. Yeah. Lights down.

944
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,280
This is what we're doing for the next 15 minutes or.

945
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,480
This is like we're going to need to be quiet here for this.

946
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,760
This and also this is mostly you would.

947
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,640
Have to imagine they were like, well, this is actually this is the least

948
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,560
this place looks the least like someone has been murdered here

949
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,360
of all the bedrock city.

950
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:10,200
Yeah, definitely. It's kind of it's impressively well done, I would say.

951
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,040
Apparently, all these places would get updated

952
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,120
statues and like like Hannah Barbera would send them

953
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,680
sure a new Betty or whatever.

954
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,480
But not in all the cases.

955
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,400
And again, I like Brad, let's just just freestyle it.

956
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,480
But I'd say especially if you see a

957
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,320
a Toronto or a Terrell Dactyl that looks like it's

958
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,920
struggling. Yeah, that's the one I want to see the most.

959
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,840
Maybe we can just find a way to flip through frightening

960
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,160
imagery because like, yes, some they kept up.

961
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:49,120
And I bet the priority was a little bit like you got to keep Fred pristine.

962
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,880
But he has to look the most like a character that isn't melted in the sun.

963
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,760
And the the main the main four, the Flintstone four.

964
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,080
Yeah. But everybody else had a rough time.

965
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:05,160
Yeah, it was in a lot of the literature about the police.

966
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,680
They talk about here it is. Oh, yeah.

967
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,960
Yeah. Look, this is like this is a Terrell Dactyl.

968
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,840
Well, it's I guess it's being born out of a giant egg, but it's flailing

969
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,440
in what looks like.

970
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,640
I mean, it looks like he's getting splashed in tar.

971
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,320
It looks like this is the moment of being trapped in time.

972
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,200
This is haunting.

973
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,640
Tar pits. This is a haunting picture.

974
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:26,960
Or it's birthing.

975
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,120
Well, it's that's a black. That's an egg.

976
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:34,000
Yeah. I mean, that is literally what's happening, but it's it's so horrifying.

977
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:38,160
And unless if that if that egg is just pure black inside,

978
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,760
then it's boy, it sucks to be a dinosaur.

979
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,240
Very Cronenberg.

980
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,240
Yeah. Oh, yeah. This is this is.

981
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,120
Yeah, this is if you're a kid, you can see this.

982
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,520
You're like, oh, my God, like life is horror.

983
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,400
This is how you get a record player.

984
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,080
This is that rock. Right.

985
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,760
Oh, yeah. And then this is how your life starts.

986
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,200
But then you're destined to just work for some family.

987
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,560
It's pressing your beak against stone, grinding you down

988
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,280
until you can't work anymore.

989
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,680
And then what? Yeah. What becomes of you? All right.

990
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:11,720
You can either be a lamp or you can be an assistant director on a music video,

991
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,480
which is a detail from the Universal Studios.

992
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,080
Yes. Yeah. That's a prime job.

993
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,680
Is there anything else we can flip through in terms of a little post photo?

994
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,120
Yeah. Imaging imagery.

995
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:27,520
But it's so just literally imagine like, imagine like

996
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,800
they call somebody like the Flintstone killer or something.

997
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,000
And he has like a basement that he's like made to look like the scenes from.

998
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,880
From. Oh, here we go.

999
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,160
I like this guy. Now we're in there.

1000
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,600
So there was the bank robbery, but now we're in jail.

1001
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:47,040
And there is a guy in kind of not prison stripes, but more like cow hide.

1002
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,800
Yeah. And he is bald with gray on the sides.

1003
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,960
And he's giving a big thumbs up.

1004
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,880
And I like this because I feel like this is I picture this guy

1005
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:00,400
being a white collar criminal. Oh, I think this is a made off.

1006
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:05,560
This is the made off of bedrock who had and who has accepted his fate.

1007
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:09,240
He knows that he scammed and embezzled Fred's.

1008
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:13,360
And he's like, this thumbs up to me signifies the justice system is working.

1009
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,000
This is Bernie Mineral.

1010
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,480
That's good. Yeah, I like that.

1011
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,160
Fred's boss's name, Mr. Slate, Mr.

1012
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,320
Slate, that's not Mr. Slate.

1013
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,600
I don't think he was gray.

1014
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,960
Yeah, he was. And he was a shorter guy, too.

1015
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,720
No, Mr. Slate was never punished for exploiting his work.

1016
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,000
This is Mr. Slate. Yeah.

1017
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,120
In case. Big round.

1018
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,400
Oh, yeah. You know what I'm saying here.

1019
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,040
Got big glasses.

1020
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,000
I was thinking, you know, I was thinking of Spacely Spraw.

1021
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,680
I was thinking Mr. Spacely from Jetsons, a tyrant.

1022
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,680
There's a shorter guy in a tire. Yeah.

1023
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,240
And then you find out in the Jetsons movie from the 90s.

1024
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,200
It's like, no, there's people.

1025
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,920
There's little guys. There's little, little.

1026
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,240
Oh, yes. Yeah. Little like Furby type.

1027
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,760
Yeah, they were displacing them to to get sprockets.

1028
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,120
Yeah. Right.

1029
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:02,440
They also make George Jetson rap, which is a very uncomfortable display

1030
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:07,160
for this actor, like probably in the probably not too far from passing away.

1031
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,360
And he's got to learn where rapping is quickly.

1032
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,480
I have not watched the Jetsons movie in a long time, but as a kid, I did like it.

1033
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,760
Yeah, that would that was one where it's like we got a VHS

1034
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,360
somehow, either as a gift or whatever.

1035
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,760
So it's like it was on repeat, you know, DuckTales movie had that.

1036
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,920
Watch it on repeat.

1037
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,400
Love early CGI.

1038
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,520
Great. Yeah, music videos. So great.

1039
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,040
So that's a bunch of crazy bullshit out of Bedrock City.

1040
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,280
Have we missed any detail?

1041
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,360
Wait, do we say the fact that it was the owners of two cement plants

1042
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,680
who came together and that's why this happens?

1043
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,720
They're like, well, we got the cement.

1044
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,320
Well, that's hey, that's half the battle.

1045
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,760
I that actually explains a lot.

1046
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,920
It explains quite a bit.

1047
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,760
It doesn't quite explain why, like

1048
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,840
Wilma and Betty look so absurd,

1049
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,520
you know, like abstract art.

1050
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:06,040
And then Pebbles is like big, like a giant head, like small.

1051
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:10,000
I guess you couldn't do a regular size Pebbles because you would be like doll size.

1052
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,880
I mean, they yeah.

1053
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,440
But then you'd be like, oh, it's.

1054
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,720
There were not concerned with scale here because actually in the in a lot of the

1055
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,800
advertising, they were touting the 20 foot Dino.

1056
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,120
That was the big thing.

1057
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:27,160
Like I found in multiple like ads like come see the 20 foot Dino.

1058
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,080
Which he was not, obviously, he's there.

1059
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,760
He's their pet. He's the size of a collie or something.

1060
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,400
Right. Bigger. Yeah.

1061
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,360
Bigger than a collie.

1062
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,800
I guess so. Great Dane.

1063
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,560
Sure. Yeah. Big as a bit.

1064
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,000
The biggest dog. Yeah.

1065
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,440
So Marmaduke. But not. Yes.

1066
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,560
He's Marmaduke size.

1067
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,720
How much do you think the rights for Marmaduke cost if I want to do a pop up

1068
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,080
restaurant based on Marmaduke?

1069
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,800
Look, not much because they just cranked out a movie on Netflix that no one's even.

1070
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,200
Is it out? Yeah.

1071
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,360
Pete Davidson. Oh, well, they got.

1072
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,280
Yes. Yeah. They got like the biggest.

1073
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,800
Everybody knows every move of this guy.

1074
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,760
And yet he put out he managed to put out.

1075
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:09,400
Wow. Be in a Marmaduke movie now that nobody like, you know, if he goes outside,

1076
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,920
you know, if Pete Davidson like he's like one of the top 10 most famous people in

1077
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,920
the world. Yeah.

1078
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:19,640
So if he so he I guess he found a way to finally get some privacy and that is

1079
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,360
voicing a Marmaduke movie.

1080
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,920
Yeah. What do you remember?

1081
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,400
This isn't Pete Davidson, but like years ago, they made a top cat movie

1082
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,600
mostly screened in Mexico.

1083
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,160
I think you brought this up on the show.

1084
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,400
They made a second top cat movie.

1085
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,840
Yeah. It's a prequel to the first right top cat movie.

1086
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,560
I think we have talked about this top cat movie.

1087
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,840
We're looping around. Yeah, there's a lot of these forming.

1088
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:48,880
Like, oh, yeah, like we're at we're at round three of this thing.

1089
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,640
I'm talking about international releases of the top cat.

1090
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,880
I'm sure I'll check. Just watch.

1091
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,800
I should just watch it.

1092
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:56,920
Should I want to see this?

1093
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,760
I want to watch this Marmaduke movie.

1094
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,680
And then I want to buy the rights to make my own Marmaduke movie.

1095
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,920
I think you're in.

1096
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:07,400
I mean, I don't know how it's just a matter of like talking to the bank, but you're

1097
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,840
like, OK, it's not an amount of money you couldn't attain.

1098
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,680
Let's get a sheet.

1099
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,080
I want a full sheet from King Features Syndicate and like what each

1100
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,360
what each thing costs and what how what the length of time is like.

1101
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,200
Yeah, I wonder if you were like, we got Pete Davidson from Marmaduke.

1102
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,760
And they're like, great.

1103
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:29,600
OK, top cat, the movie 2011 Roku chattel and freebie.

1104
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,720
So you're going to for to.

1105
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,240
Hmm. OK. Freebies.

1106
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,760
Places need content. These. Yeah.

1107
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,880
These these Hanna Barbera characters have not been maybe treated

1108
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,920
with such pristine care like they sort of if you got a thing,

1109
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,320
they'll let you do whatever you want.

1110
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:49,080
Top Cat begins the 2015 movie name.

1111
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,400
That's the prequel. Yeah. Top Cat begins.

1112
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:55,120

1113

We got to know. Freebie again.

1114
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:01,160
Freebie, to be and Voodoo free.

1115
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,600
The free wing of Voodoo.

1116
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,880
Top Cat rising. What's the next one called?

1117
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,520
Yeah. More Top Cat. More Top Cat.

1118
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,920
Top Cat. Top Cat ends. Top Cat ends.

1119
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,440
Well, yeah, we'll figure out all the pricing.

1120
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,000
Who's Top Cat? Oh, yeah.

1121
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,400
Who plays it? Is it an actor?

1122
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,240
Not an American actor.

1123
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,520
You've despite knowing more about the Top Cat movies,

1124
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,760
plural than any man, you don't know who is Top Cat.

1125
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,160
Tom Cruise.

1126
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,360
The they do not.

1127
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,640
They list a few voice actors.

1128
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,080
They do not list the voice actor of Top Cat.

1129
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,880
Let me know. I am the.

1130
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,280
Maybe it's an A.I.

1131
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,880
It's like the Luke Skywalker voice.

1132
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,640
They literally couldn't find anyone.

1133
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,120
No one was willing to do it.

1134
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,800
The most out of work actors.

1135
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,440
Well, most of them actors said they didn't want to.

1136
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:59,120
They didn't want to just tackle such a big, big role like that.

1137
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,320
Yeah. Yeah. They didn't want to let people down.

1138
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,560
Yeah. No, you're setting yourself up for a fall.

1139
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,240
What's the Joker sequel called?

1140
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,840
And is that going to be the next Top Cat?

1141
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,480
Folly Folly do.

1142
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,400
Doesn't doesn't sound right.

1143
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,800
It means like always.

1144
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,720
I did look at the French.

1145
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,120
So it's a walking Phoenix Joker.

1146
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,720
They announced sequel.

1147
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,560
And did you see this guy?

1148
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,480
No. Which movie is this going to rip off?

1149
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,160
This is it's going to raging bull.

1150
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,800
Folly, I do.

1151
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,080
Mm hmm. That's the that Joker Folly.

1152
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,600
OK. And the French reference being a medical term

1153
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:37,280
pertaining to a mental disorder which affects two or more people.

1154
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,640
Some sort of Joker.

1155
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,280
Another Joker in the movie.

1156
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,760
How many Jokers can we get in one movie?

1157
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,800
So the movie equivalent of that video of the 10 Jokers going down

1158
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,440
the escalator at the comic.

1159
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,320
Yeah. What do you how to if I'm pitching on and I know this is a Flintstone episode,

1160
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,360
but if I'm pitching on it, I say get Leto in there.

1161
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,280
Yeah. Why not?

1162
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,320
Let's watch the world burn.

1163
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,800
Jared Leto, walking Phoenix Jokers.

1164
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,680
What was it again? Something off folly folly.

1165
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,520
I mean, I love the shirts.

1166
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,640
I love like walking through a mall and seeing a shirt where seven Jokers are all.

1167
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,600
OK, pool together.

1168
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,160
So if we can get them all, let me amend Nicholson.

1169
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,720
Mm hmm. And walking.

1170
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,920
OK, I don't know what shape you get them all in.

1171
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,240
Why not? OK, it's like you're ready somewhere to go.

1172
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,360
I mean, I don't know.

1173
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,560
We'll add a Joker with each.

1174
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:35,040
Oh, get the deleted scene Joker for the new Batman deleted scene.

1175
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:39,640
Which I thought I thought was a joke after I fell for some deepfakes.

1176
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,800
I was like, well, surely this is I mean, this saw.

1177
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,760
Did you fall for different deepfakes or the same?

1178
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,600
No, no. The other runner to Jason.

1179
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:52,240
There. But no, I like after the Tom Cruise thing, I saw that Joker scene.

1180
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,440
I was like, this is awful.

1181
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,200
There's no way this is real. Right.

1182
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,720
And then it's like, oh, no, it's very.

1183
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,320
So you're saying after the Tom Cruise.

1184
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,000
So Jason, a couple of times, I thought Tom Cruise,

1185
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,560
yeah, lept over Keegan Michael Key.

1186
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,320
Yeah. At a comic con or something.

1187
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:10,520
Yeah. I saw that clip like, you know, 8am watching on my phone,

1188
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,240
lying on my back, still like without my glasses.

1189
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,680
I was like, pretty fun. OK.

1190
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,240
But then that threw off like you're you're just believe

1191
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,360
like believing anything you saw for a couple of weeks is what you're saying.

1192
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,120
Yeah. So then when you saw the Batman scene, you thought.

1193
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,240
So I saw the Batman scene later.

1194
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,720
But you thought that was like deepfaked.

1195
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:32,000
I thought it was like when people make like fake trailers.

1196
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:35,040
I just cut. They just chop and screw stuff.

1197
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,800
Yeah. Like made himself up to look like a scary guy

1198
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:41,400
and then cut himself into the Robert Pattinson Batman.

1199
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,640
Yeah, something like that.

1200
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,760
But no, it's real.

1201
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,640
Jason thinks January 6th was deepfaked now.

1202
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,440
Well, they put they they they put faces of good upstanding

1203
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:56,560
Maga people on to the kangaroo cord of this current Congress.

1204
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,560
There's a few freedom fighters and then a bunch of clowns.

1205
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,600
We're going to have to do the deepfake challenge eventually here.

1206
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,600
I'm going to have to start learning how to do it.

1207
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,960
Oh, it's like you make a deepfake for to see if it tricks Jason.

1208
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,840
I guess. Yeah, I guess that's what the challenge.

1209
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,040
I guess that's what the challenge will be.

1210
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,000
I'll have to figure out how to do that. Yeah.

1211
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,800
Well, I was trying to I was trying to get a beta invite for this.

1212
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,080
Do you guys know about I think it's called Mid Journey?

1213
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:25,280
This is like the AI thing where you can plug in phrases

1214
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,200
and it'll generate just nonsense.

1215
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,560
Yeah, I tried it.

1216
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,120
Did you get a good one? Yeah, you can just do it.

1217
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,480
It's a website. Yeah.

1218
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,760
I wasn't letting me access it.

1219
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,520
It's a way I have a link for it.

1220
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,440
I don't know if I did. I tried it like two days ago.

1221
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,800
The developer, the developers in Lake Nona say and why you know it.

1222
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,080
Yeah.

1223
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,840
He heard you're on the no list.

1224
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:51,280
They did not like whatever burner discord username I made to access it.

1225
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,920
Yeah, so you can just what Jason's talking about is you can do

1226
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:59,840
like you just put two words in and it'll generate like nine weird pictures.

1227
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,240
So somebody put in like I'm trying to remember like an example.

1228
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,280
It was like a puppet something and then like it kind of like

1229
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:11,280
blurrifies photos where it's like thumbnails of like,

1230
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,320
I don't know, say it's like a elf, but a human man.

1231
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:19,720
And it like makes like a human man with like elf snout or snoot.

1232
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:24,160
I think Stephen Heck of the Block Party podcast,

1233
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:28,440
I believe generated one that was Roseanne getting attacked by wild dogs

1234
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,880
at a subway and it looked pretty good.

1235
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,360
You can do it.

1236
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,680
Or wild dogs running on the field at the World Series.

1237
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,320
It's just crazy.

1238
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,880
You can get some. Yeah, you can.

1239
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,680
There's some people like it's weird with the AI the computer can like put together, but

1240
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:43,600
we'll do some of that, too.

1241
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,640
And I'll quiz you on those, I guess.

1242
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,040
Yeah. Well, they have a certain look about them.

1243
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:53,120
I want to generate like Barney Rubble cries at a Tony Robbins seminar.

1244
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:59,320
I put in Alf Mary's Pam Anderson and it didn't and it didn't work.

1245
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,600
What? It just didn't.

1246
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,480
It wasn't like good because I thought it was going to be anything.

1247
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,920
And I was doing it on your phone right now.

1248
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,280
I let me find the see if I can find.

1249
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,440
Can we do something with the Flintstones?

1250
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:11,960
Yeah. You guys talk amongst yourself while I figure out where this was.

1251
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:16,560
OK, OK. I you know, there's also this is one of them had a volcano

1252
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,240
called Mount St.

1253
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:22,480
Wilma, one of them had there's a Mount Rockmore, which I like because it's already

1254
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,080
a it's already a mountain, right?

1255
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:31,880
So we have to further rock uponify a thing that is rocks, that is chiseled rocks.

1256
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:38,200
But so that is Fred Barney Dino and the founder of the town, Mr.

1257
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:43,640
Granite built, which is a character I would I don't recognize offhand.

1258
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,120
No. So but like that.

1259
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:52,120
But he's the only one who deserves to be there because like Fred is not like

1260
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:57,760
the king of the town, like Mount Rushmore is our presidents, our leaders.

1261
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,840
Fred's just a guy there.

1262
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:03,560
Like, why does he get to be on and Dino his dog?

1263
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,720
Yeah, that doesn't make sense.

1264
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:11,200
Resident and also his pet pet are up there with this town and his pal next to.

1265
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,440
Yeah, they got to reevaluate who they're putting on.

1266
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:18,040
Yeah, I mean, some of the characters, they just made, you know, I don't really

1267
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:23,280
remember the school teacher who was kind of horrific looking in Bedrock City.

1268
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,960
Like that one is not aged well.

1269
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,800
A lot of the generic characters have really not aged well.

1270
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,800
You can kind of identify Wilma and Betty.

1271
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,760
Yeah, I have found the website.

1272
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,120
I'm just started with an easy one.

1273
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,760
I just put Flintstones money.

1274
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,760
Let's see if they just generate too much traffic.

1275
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,440
OK. Oh, it's a problem.

1276
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,480
Yeah, it's not too popular now.

1277
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,680
Oh, geez. Well, so we can't.

1278
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,880
I'll keep trying. I'll keep reloading it as we go.

1279
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,000
Can't steal it for our content.

1280
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:57,680
Maybe we should move on to some other Flintstones stuff

1281
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:01,880
because it was not just depressing defunct RV parks.

1282
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,240
The Flintstones up until not that long ago were still a presence

1283
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,920
in Universal Studios Hollywood. Yes.

1284
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:12,520
There was. Yeah, I mean, it started with this stage show,

1285
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,640
but it kind of lasted for a while.

1286
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,760
The Carnival Games at Universal Studios until recently,

1287
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,880
the whole area was a Rock Vegas.

1288
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,440
It was Rock Vegas Casino. Right.

1289
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:31,920
So that was like a pretty big footprint and a barbecue restaurant.

1290
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,720
Yes, which is the last was the last holdout of Flintstones, basically.

1291
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,880
Yeah. Demolished for Wizarding World construction.

1292
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:44,200
If you wanted to get just blasted with just the craziest

1293
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:48,840
like barbecue smoke, you would walk by there and it was just unbelievable.

1294
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,600
It was just open air grill. It was wild.

1295
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:54,720
It's lots of sort of like like kind of nasty looking.

1296
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,560
Oh, every part of it.

1297
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,040
Deceiving in the sun.

1298
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,720
I never ate there. It might have been fine.

1299
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,400
It looked awful. It didn't smell great.

1300
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,320
Like it was a very strange thing, especially after all the Flintstone

1301
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:09,280
presence was gone. Other than that, it was a very weird

1302
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,400
thing. Just walk by.

1303
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,400
And that opened well after.

1304
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:17,120
Sorry, were you saying that that opened for the sequel Flintstone?

1305
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,360
Like didn't I'm not sure.

1306
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,960
I don't know when it all went in the restaurant because the the stage

1307
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,400
show was like 94 to 97.

1308
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:28,520
So pretty on point around the feel like the restaurant and stuff

1309
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,800
didn't come along until like 2000.

1310
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,080
What like much later?

1311
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,880
That might have been Rock Vegas promotional.

1312
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:39,240
OK, Viva Rock Vegas to capitalize on the mania.

1313
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,720
Of course, we all remember America.

1314
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,200
Wow. When they were I might have talked about this before,

1315
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:47,000
how I just remember seeing a newspaper article saying, hey,

1316
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,320
they're going to make a prequel.

1317
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:51,920
And because it's Las Vegas, there's going to be different types of rocks.

1318
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,360
Like that was the press release before the movie got made.

1319
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,160
Get excited, everybody.

1320
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,840
Different types of rocks will be in this.

1321
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,440
And have you seen Viva Rock Vegas?

1322
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:05,440
I did. It was one of my first pandemic views.

1323
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:06,400
Yeah, I thought that's.

1324
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,640
Yeah, it might be why it came up before.

1325
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,360
This one's only this is only a second timer

1326
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,400
as we talk about as things that we've talked about many times.

1327
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:16,480
Not a three or a four.

1328
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:22,400
It'll enter the our five timers club is stories that we've told five times.

1329
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,880
Yeah, that we've.

1330
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,760
Is Viva Rock Vegas?

1331
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:31,680
Is any of the cast back?

1332
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,560
No, no. Right. OK.

1333
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,720
No, no, all new, all the younger.

1334
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,240
Oh, OK. Yeah. So that was this opened in 2000.

1335
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:44,600
So opening of Flintstones barbecue place in 2001,

1336
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:48,480
I can kind of see the justification and the games, too.

1337
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,640
Yeah, I make sense. I was just yeah, when I was saying it was so weird,

1338
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,360
it's because it was the only one left.

1339
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,600
The only thing left there.

1340
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,800
It doesn't make sense when you see the budget was 83 million

1341
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,040
and it made 59.5 million.

1342
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,200
The movie, not the movie.

1343
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:05,440
Yeah, OK. I do not have the financials.

1344
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,040
I don't know the margins.

1345
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,680
I wish each restaurant would release.

1346
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:12,680
I wish I wish John Taffer would would rescue some.

1347
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,640
We could get so much more content out of that if we knew the financials

1348
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,960
for each individual restaurant in each theme park.

1349
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,160
Oh, now we're talking.

1350
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,880
Yeah. Oh, that would keep us away from rides for so long.

1351
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,000
For years.

1352
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,440
Or the thing we do is so actively try to avoid the bottom line of rest

1353
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:31,240
in park restaurants. Oh, all right.

1354
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,760
Back to the bulk cement statue.

1355
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,720
Back to the excess cement they had to put somewhere.

1356
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,960
Let's let's talk a little about this, this live show.

1357
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:47,320
And I've got a clip here at Universal Studios ad, which starts with a flying.

1358
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:50,960
This is kind of in 30 seconds gives you a pretty good view

1359
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,040
of what happened in this show.

1360
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,200
This is so it was the show was called The Flintstones Show.

1361
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:02,360
This was a musical that I definitely saw and I liked a lot.

1362
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:07,200
I really enjoyed this show and would look forward to it from this

1363
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,200
this ad that will play.

1364
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:15,880
There was I saw a still ad for it as well with a tagline,

1365
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,840
and the tagline was Yabba Dabba, do it live,

1366
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:23,840
which unfortunately now I just go straight to the bill.

1367
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:28,640
Oh, right. Yeah, I was going to say that's completely taken up and fuck it.

1368
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,240
Well, you have a David to it live.

1369
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,880
I want to give a quick update that I've been refreshing my phone

1370
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:40,120
with different prompts, and the one that worked was Flintstones sexual.

1371
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,040
Oh, no. No, no.

1372
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,960
It is up here. Can you show it?

1373
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,640
I can. It's it's not again.

1374
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,880
This is what I'm saying, where it's not like everything is perfect.

1375
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:50,560
But I'll show you guys first.

1376
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:54,120
And some of them, it looks like Fred has a penis for a nose.

1377
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,760
OK, that might be the best.

1378
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,320
This doesn't get. Yeah, yeah.

1379
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,160
I'm not offended.

1380
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,000
I'm not terribly offended by any of that.

1381
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:06,040
That looks a lot like some of the statues in the bedrock city.

1382
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,520
Yeah. So like, that's the kind of just.

1383
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,040
I think you can go like really specific.

1384
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,400
Yeah, like Fred.

1385
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,000
Fred Flintstone buys big red gum.

1386
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,600
OK, I'll try that buys big red.

1387
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:22,920
All right. Give that a shot while we play here this clip of the

1388
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,960
the Flintstones show.

1389
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,640
With the new Flintstones show, a live rock

1390
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:40,280
Stravaganza with mammoths and dynamite special effects.

1391
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,240
It's the most spectacular.

1392
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,920
That's the main thing I want to talk about.

1393
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:48,320
Fred falls backwards into a volcano.

1394
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:49,960
We get one more play on that.

1395
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:54,280
Fred falls backwards into a volcano, gets shot straight up into the air.

1396
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:56,600
Very Tim and Eric kind of shot up.

1397
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,920
Yeah, yeah. Very digital.

1398
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,800
The sound with mammoths

1399
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,920
and dynamite special effects.

1400
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:05,160
He's playing guitar when it happens.

1401
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:06,360
Mystery. Yeah.

1402
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,360
But David. Yeah.

1403
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:09,760
New Flintstones show.

1404
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,960
Incredible sound.

1405
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,640
Yeah, well, let's get into general.

1406
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,840
I for the part.

1407
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,200
But I love that moment.

1408
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,520
And I was like, yeah, this I don't remember.

1409
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:23,320
I do not recall witnessing what Fred Flintstones death potentially.

1410
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:25,240
Yeah. Look at that face to.

1411
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:26,880
Oh, my God.

1412
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:27,680
Where am I?

1413
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:30,680
And then the just the rocket shot out of the.

1414
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,680
So I was like, what is this?

1415
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,080
How does this actually play out in the show?

1416
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,720
And in the show, I think it's all dummies.

1417
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:41,000
I believe that a dummy gets yanked up out of the ground

1418
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:44,160
and then further closer to the audience.

1419
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,400
Another dummy returns.

1420
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:49,480
So it's like a dummy getting shot straight up into the air,

1421
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:52,560
coming right back down and then, oh, look at this back.

1422
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,160
Oh, my God. Wow.

1423
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:57,200
So it's like it's like the Spider-Man at Avengers campus.

1424
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,600
But they did it 20 years earlier.

1425
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,720
Yes. Yeah.

1426
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,080
An animate. Not a guy.

1427
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,440
If it's just a dummy, we can flail it around.

1428
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,240
Break all its limbs. Stunt Tron.

1429
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,520
This was the original stunt Tronic. Yeah.

1430
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,480
Yeah. Fred Flintstone at Universal.

1431
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:13,040
And I have to give this show a little bit of credit

1432
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,840
because it seemed like they did spend some money on it.

1433
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,520
Yeah. Or like the sets are pretty good.

1434
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:19,720
Yeah, there's a car.

1435
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:24,280
That's big. There's town and there's the Flintstones house.

1436
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:26,800
And then this rock video.

1437
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:31,840
Yes, they fly to Holly Rock on a pterodactyl plane,

1438
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,520
which you see in the commercial.

1439
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,480
Little deceptive because it kind of seems like a ride vehicle

1440
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,520
you will get in. Not the case.

1441
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:42,320
Fred and Wilma get in it and it just kind of goes around stage.

1442
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,000
It doesn't fly over you. Right.

1443
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,760
No, it didn't. That's not true. It does fly over.

1444
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:48,080
It does fly over. No, I recall that.

1445
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,600
And I recall this. It's actually pretty impressive.

1446
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:55,680
They bring out a I mean, it is like some major theme park

1447
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:59,480
engineering, like this huge prop comes out.

1448
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:03,080
They roll it out, this this puppeted pterodactyl

1449
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:07,080
and the mouth moves and they hook it up to ropes in front of you.

1450
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:10,760
And then the row and then four actors get on it.

1451
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:14,440
It does a full loop above some of the audience.

1452
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,840
OK, it was extremely impressive.

1453
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:23,160
But what I remember is that when I went, the it got stuck halfway through.

1454
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:26,800
So there was just a long, long segment

1455
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:30,280
where the actors have to fill the time somehow.

1456
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:33,560
And they kind of would refer to what's going on.

1457
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:38,920
And I just remember it being an early my mom saying, no, this is this is not planned.

1458
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,480
So they're covering their improvising.

1459
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,840
This may be actually the Flintstones might have been the first I ever

1460
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,080
learned of improvising.

1461
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,960
So you think it's just to stall for time

1462
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,200
while something bad is happening?

1463
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1464
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:53,760
No, I don't.

1465
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:57,240
Not an inaccurate description of a lot of improv shows I've seen.

1466
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:01,560
What's it's stalling for time while you've said that?

1467
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,120
Well, you're while your bad life is happening.

1468
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,720
This will fill it. Yeah.

1469
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,520
You promised a showbiz

1470
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:14,400
a career at the end of five different classes and five thousand dollars.

1471
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,720
It's like I got stuck on this pterodactyl.

1472
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:21,400
I was always taught the trick that if you're hard up for an idea,

1473
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:25,040
you're blank out a little just cross the stage and then you have the time

1474
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:29,160
to think of an idea and it gives the audience a visual to look.

1475
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,320
That's the strategy. Really?

1476
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:31,840
Yeah. Go walk over there.

1477
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:35,440
Yeah. Yeah. Walk. Move a little because it draws the eye

1478
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,200
and it gives you a little time.

1479
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:40,560
If you would see our old Jason Nye's improv shows, you know, he was crossing

1480
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,600
Chris Cross and Lads and Rhymes the show.

1481
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,200
Man, he's playing a lot of characters playing tag.

1482
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:49,240
A lot of children running from stage to stage. Yeah.

1483
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:54,160
Yeah. No, I I thought the sets and the costumes and everything looked good.

1484
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:58,720
This is filled with, I think, one of the things that has made

1485
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:03,040
the Flintstones kind of like work in different eras, which is all the stone jokes,

1486
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,680
all the rock jokes.

1487
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,800
It is timeless humor.

1488
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,040
It kind of works. And the audience is into I mean, there's a little I mean,

1489
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:15,440
the the sign that said, I think you're supposed to say toys, the source

1490
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:21,280
like toys are or is it toys are toys are our source?

1491
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:23,440
Yeah. Hmm. Good question.

1492
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,640
Not sure. Some are more clean.

1493
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:28,080
B.C. Hammer,

1494
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,480
Mastodona, New Kids on the Rock,

1495
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,000
B.C. Hammer appears to be played by a white actor.

1496
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:36,880
So, all right.

1497
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:42,160
The premise, by the way, being that Fred Flintstone passes an audition

1498
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,400
to be the star of the first rock video,

1499
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:51,400
despite not being a musician, he beats out B.C.

1500
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:56,040
Hammer and Mastodona and people who come in the whole act.

1501
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:59,280
Right. He just kind of like slaps his knees a little bit.

1502
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,640
And somehow it's him.

1503
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,480
Well, because they're doing like a star search kind of auditions

1504
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:08,080
at the Water Buffalo Lodge, which they just call star search.

1505
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:11,760
They don't rockify that.

1506
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,520
No, no, they do Ed McRock.

1507
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:18,960
But but not but not but and it's not man becomes rock.

1508
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,120
Yeah. They Walter concrete.

1509
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,040
That works. That's good.

1510
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,680
Stone. Very clean.

1511
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:27,760
Very clean. Oliver.

1512
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,480
We need a director of our rock video.

1513
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:35,600
And that the director of our music rock video will be Oliver Stone.

1514
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,160
I think that works pretty well.

1515
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,600
There's a lot of music video statics and natural work killers.

1516
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,240
And that's why.

1517
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:43,920
Yeah. Tilted light at Dutch angles.

1518
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,040
Yeah. Yeah.

1519
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,680
Joshua Herbivore start to lose it.

1520
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,840
I like that. I know.

1521
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:52,480
No, you guys don't like Joshua Herbivore.

1522
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:55,600
I guess I admire the length of the wall.

1523
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,120
That's like a cross of a stage. Yeah. Yeah.

1524
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,600
There's been a line.

1525
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,960
There was a running gag in it that the

1526
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:07,080
stuff is now known as fire.

1527
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,560
It was previously known as a

1528
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,720
and they get a lot of mileage out of that.

1529
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:12,920
The audience seems into that.

1530
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:16,920
There's a joke about was the film in the line of a

1531
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,800
reasonably topical. OK.

1532
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,960
Yeah, I was going to say, yeah, are there I watched a little bit other.

1533
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,720
They're on topical. It's not Jeannie.

1534
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:27,760
It's not I don't think they changed them up.

1535
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,880
Yeah, there's one where they say that

1536
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:35,400
we wish a happy birthday to actor George Burns.

1537
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,080
He's 22. Pretty solid.

1538
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:42,920
And then the you hear somebody close to the cameraman go, ha ha ha.

1539
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:47,040
The my ha ha ha.

1540
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,520
That joke's timeless, though.

1541
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,120
Yeah, that's for the parents.

1542
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:53,080
Yeah. Who is our perennially old?

1543
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:55,000
Because it was Larry Kit.

1544
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,800
There was a layer. I think there's a Larry King is old joke in every episode

1545
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,120
of Conan while I worked there.

1546
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:03,480
And who is our forever old now?

1547
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,640
Do we even do that post covid?

1548
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:11,080
Because we know that all the ones we love like like Herman Cain are imperiled.

1549
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,840
I don't know. Yeah, that's true.

1550
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:16,280
I don't even want to say the name of the person I thought.

1551
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:19,280
Oh, I know. Yeah, because I don't want to curse with the podcast.

1552
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:23,480
The right. I don't even I don't think I think I know who you mean.

1553
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:25,720
We're talking about it.

1554
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:28,720
You think about popping in a DVD?

1555
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:31,320
I am thinking about a DVD.

1556
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:34,840
I'm thinking about that media, that physical media that you're talking about.

1557
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,560
Yeah. Yeah. Just thinking about your DVD.

1558
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,560
But I won't say yes.

1559
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,360
That's as far as I'll say. But yes.

1560
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,640
But you don't even I feel like it's different.

1561
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:46,800
Like, because I think people I think maybe something has changed culturally

1562
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,840
because it was probably Betty White before that.

1563
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:51,280
Yes. But now we don't want to curse these people. Right.

1564
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,800
And nobody's mad that they're old.

1565
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,360
We love that that we celebrate. Yes. Right.

1566
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,520
It's a different thing.

1567
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:00,600
It's like there was I've sensed some rage in a Larry King joke.

1568
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:02,080
Oh, sure. How long is that?

1569
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,320
Maybe people that might be incorrect.

1570
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,360
Yeah, I don't know about I mean, it depends what I know.

1571
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,840
You just like to listen to some of the angriest comedians.

1572
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:12,520
So maybe they were really like laying in in a poor Larry toward the end.

1573
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:16,720
Oh, pulling out the old Bill Hicks, the old Bill Hicks.

1574
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,000
You know where I'm coming from, is the bill.

1575
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,720
Hicks was doing Larry King bits 30, 40 years ago.

1576
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:25,600
Update I've I checked, by the way.

1577
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,600
Thank you for allowing me to check on camera

1578
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,760
because I've been refreshing, refreshing, refreshing, keeps giving me

1579
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:32,600
your dream come true.

1580
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,920
It's my dream to do it on the podcast live.

1581
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:36,840
So finally, it worked.

1582
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,200
Fred Flintstone buys Big Red Gum.

1583
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:44,640
And it looks like nothing like what the prompt is.

1584
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,640
We are not selling what is interesting.

1585
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,840
We have done AI or two bad.

1586
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:53,400
This doesn't look like the art that I had been seeing.

1587
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:54,640
This is what I've been seeing.

1588
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,000
Maybe there's a different AI that you've been seeing,

1589
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:58,600
but I've seen a ton of these.

1590
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:03,240
I'm going to try to try to get in nine picture grids of like little like,

1591
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,560
I guess, icons like looking.

1592
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:10,360
It's this thing that's happening that is that's really long winded

1593
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:15,040
to describe that has failed us every time we tried to get a really good

1594
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:17,440
joke, a good joke going here.

1595
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,720
And it's just we're eating shit at every turn.

1596
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:23,080
It's letting us down because all these some of you sometimes you see it

1597
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:24,280
and you go, oh, this is so funny.

1598
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,080
Look what somebody did.

1599
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:28,480
And now we've just we've really well, because this is new fangled.

1600
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,320
Oh, I've dropped and you're so mad.

1601
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,320
He dropped his key.

1602
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,040
Hey, don't. All right.

1603
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:35,040
He's going to be throwing them next. I'm upset.

1604
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,520
Don't slice our faces up.

1605
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:37,880
Mike, it's not bad.

1606
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:40,400
I'm going to put my keys on the table here.

1607
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:43,600
I this is it's new fangled technology.

1608
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:47,520
And the Flintstones teaches us right that they had everything they needed

1609
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:51,320
back then. This is actually something that's occurred to me about all like

1610
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:54,880
because we've all right, you know, and we'll touch on some other things.

1611
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,960
But there's there's you can go visit Bedrock and the Flintstones

1612
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:01,040
in a lot of different theme park settings.

1613
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:05,720
But none of them are exactly blockbuster attractions that everybody loves.

1614
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:09,920
And it's like, is that because like, boy, you know what I'd love to do

1615
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:13,080
is to go be in the Stone Age?

1616
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:16,880
I'd love to. I don't think that's is that anybody's

1617
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:20,560
desire? No, but I like having my laptop here.

1618
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,440
Uh huh. I get what you're saying.

1619
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:26,680
I think, though, the one in

1620
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:27,960
the one over the what is it?

1621
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,680
Warner Brothers World.

1622
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:30,880
That's the newest one.

1623
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:35,080
Yeah, that at least captures some of it, at least it's colorful

1624
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:39,520
and it's full of characters that your parents or grandparents enjoyed.

1625
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:43,320
And the voices sound vaguely like to pay respects to your grandma.

1626
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:46,120
Yeah. So it's not like, oh, I wanted to drive.

1627
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:50,800
I wanted my feet to rub against the pavement while I was driving a car.

1628
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,440
I don't think that's an experience people wanted.

1629
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:57,240
I don't think there's anything in the Flintstones that you would want to happen

1630
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:01,720
to you. Maybe that maybe you want to have some of the big ribs, the big ribs, I think.

1631
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,720
Although, Jason, did you want the big when you were a kid and you saw that,

1632
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:07,800
because that would stress me out when that because at the start, in case

1633
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:11,600
you don't know the iconic opening of the Flintstones and I say that like jokingly,

1634
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,240
but I guess people might not know it.

1635
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:17,000
And you've been listening to an hour and a half of Flintstones

1636
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:22,200
a show or the actor Al Lewis, who's been dead for 40 years, comes up a lot.

1637
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:26,160
The opening of the Flintstones, they go to like a drive in and a big

1638
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:31,960
like dinosaur sized rack of ribs gets put on the side of their car.

1639
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:37,000
It's from they ripped open a Brontosaurus chest and yanked his ribs.

1640
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,080
Yeah, they fucked up Fred's bulldozer dinosaur.

1641
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:43,960
So basically, yeah, this is former crane is what you're looking at.

1642
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:46,480
And they put it on the side of the car and the car tips over.

1643
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,800
I think there's a variation on what happens to it, too.

1644
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,800
And I'm remembering another thing that happens, too.

1645
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,120
But I think the one I go, it impales Fred.

1646
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,720
It goes straight into his brain.

1647
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,640
It's just not his death.

1648
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,760
Twenty two minutes of of a funeral.

1649
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:03,480
The other the other thing that always happens is like Dino locks him out of the house.

1650
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:06,280
Yes, that happens, which does happen in the stage show.

1651
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:10,200
OK, well, that's good. Or the cat, because there's also a cat who I don't think.

1652
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,640
Oh, wait, no, it's the cat.

1653
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,080
It's in the theme song.

1654
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,760
Then the cat will stay out for the night.

1655
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,160
Right. Yes, because and I don't have a clip of this,

1656
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:24,480
but there's a really insane too high of budget music video

1657
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,960
made on the set of the Flintstones movie.

1658
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:31,800
But with the not the B 52s, but the B C 52s.

1659
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:35,280
Nice. And they made the whole cast be in it.

1660
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:39,840
They like took a shooting day clearly to end with like a hundred extras

1661
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:41,920
all in the caveman clothes.

1662
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,480
But all these esteemed actors, as we were saying,

1663
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:49,920
John Goodman and Rick Moranis, like nothing gets access to Rick Moranis anymore.

1664
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:54,240
Back then, you could get him to be in your music video for hours

1665
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:58,520
banging on a xylophone made of bones with other bones.

1666
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:03,320
And that that name that lyric about the cat, then the cat.

1667
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,560
And they make Halle Berry do it.

1668
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:08,760
So this is weird clip where it cuts to her just to say the word cat

1669
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:12,080
kind of sensually makes me uncomfortable.

1670
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:16,040
Yeah. Sexy sax and a woman saying no, thank you.

1671
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,800
With with bedroom eyes.

1672
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,080
Oh, yeah. No, no, no, no, no.

1673
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:23,480
I recommend the music video. Sure. Sure.

1674
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:27,840
Well, back in the night, what an insane it shows you how much waste there was.

1675
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:31,040
The glory excess of the 90s where you get a band

1676
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,920
and they do a big music video about the movie and the old days, which I know.

1677
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,640
Top Gun, they got the Lady Gaga song.

1678
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,480
Yeah, we're getting back to it.

1679
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:41,600
Yeah. A throwback kind of a thing. Yeah.

1680
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,760
But I really real quick, I just want to say, did the ribs thing stress you out

1681
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:47,320
as a kid or did you like that? Oh, I thought it was funny. OK.

1682
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:49,920
But you didn't say like, I want to eat a dinosaur's ribs.

1683
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:53,360
Oh, no, I guess I never really thought about it.

1684
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:54,760
I mean, I guess could be a mammoth.

1685
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:58,160
I could be a mammal, a big man. Were there mammoths in the show?

1686
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:01,600
Like big tigers? Yeah. I think all of all of that.

1687
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,400
Ever since the Blue Milk revelation, I just I'm always.

1688
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:09,120
You think I'm just always dreaming about meeting because that never occurred

1689
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,760
to me as a big Star Wars fan as a kid.

1690
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:12,560
I never thought, oh, I want to try that Blue Milk.

1691
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,280
It always looked gross.

1692
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,480
But ever since you said that you want to try the Blue Milk,

1693
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:20,600
I wonder what famous food moments in movie and TV you were thinking,

1694
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:22,600
oh, I'd like to try that.

1695
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:25,880
Well, I was talking about food stuffs.

1696
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:30,440
The bedrock city, the Atlas, there's some good Atlas

1697
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:34,200
obscura photos and like entries about this place.

1698
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:38,160
And they they're old enough that they mentioned that according

1699
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:44,280
to a public Google Plus review, Fred's Cafe has the best prices in the area.

1700
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:49,480
Now, I don't know what else is in the area besides tumbleweeds

1701
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:54,280
and like nuclear waste, like lingering nuclear waste.

1702
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:58,720
But Fred's Cafe did serve fish, a sore as sandwiches.

1703
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:01,320
So if you want a big fish sandwich,

1704
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:06,600
approximately a little under 500 miles from the Pacific Ocean

1705
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:11,200
in the middle of the desert in Arizona, Fred's Diner, Fred's Cafe,

1706
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,560
whatever they called it, is your spot to go.

1707
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:16,200
I went to Chris Angel's restaurant, Kblip.

1708
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:16,880
That's true.

1709
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,640
About as far from anything as this sounds.

1710
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:22,560
So I I'm not above this kind of shit.

1711
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:25,160
I specifically asked you how you felt after you ate there.

1712
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:27,160
You said you held up fine and like it was OK.

1713
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,120
So you're shocked.

1714
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:28,960
You loved it. Yeah.

1715
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:29,800
So I might. Yeah.

1716
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:34,120
Maybe all my favorite food awaits in deep deserts.

1717
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:37,400
Still an hour away from major attraction.

1718
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:38,760
Yeah. Cafes.

1719
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:42,440
I think I there was various travel blogs that stopped at this place.

1720
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:46,240
And I just saw one of their entries was like, where to get fudge by the Grand Canyon?

1721
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:49,120
So the universal treat fudge.

1722
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:53,120
So you can get a fish or a sandwich, and then you can drive another

1723
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:56,480
30 to 50 miles and find a fudge shop by the Grand Canyon.

1724
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,560
What is your favorite fudge of all time?

1725
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,480
Oh, I like to strip.

1726
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:04,520
I mean, it's very popular at the Jersey Shore.

1727
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:08,400
Yeah, no. But I mean, like, is that is that where you would if you could get any fudge

1728
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:12,200
right now and you would say, say you were to impress Scott,

1729
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:15,680
say Scott never had fudge before because he doesn't he doesn't eat the treats that we do.

1730
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:20,360
And which fudge, if it was easily available, would you get desert island fudge?

1731
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:23,520
Yes, it would be Jason's desert island island fudge.

1732
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:27,080
You know, it's if you go to like Ocean City,

1733
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:31,080
you might be a Frelinger's guy or Shriver's guy or fudge kitchen guy.

1734
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:34,040
A lot of these places are like 100 years old at this point.

1735
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:37,000
And still using the same kettles or like taffy making.

1736
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:37,800
That's what makes it good.

1737
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:39,160
Probably a good move.

1738
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:41,480
I think fudge kitchen is a good place to start.

1739
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:46,200
Kind of famously always has people with trays giving out samples of fudge.

1740
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,280
That's on the Jersey Shore.

1741
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:50,160
Yes, that's in numerous towns at the Jersey Shore.

1742
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:51,200
OK. Yeah. All right.

1743
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:55,040
So how would you even say like that fudge compares to like a Disneyland fudge?

1744
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:58,640
Um, I haven't had a Disneyland fudge in a while.

1745
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:02,320
I think I got the like churro fudge, like kind of a vanilla cinnamon fudge.

1746
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:03,280
Right. It was pretty good.

1747
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:06,320
OK. It's kind of hard to mess up fudge, honestly.

1748
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:10,480
OK, so you're not even you don't have maybe like, oh, my God, this is the ultimate fudge.

1749
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:16,040
I like a simple chocolate because I find like walnuts or nuts and fudge kind of overwhelms.

1750
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:17,960
The flavor. No. Yeah. Oh, OK.

1751
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:19,760
I'm agreeing with you. Yeah. Yeah.

1752
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:22,480
OK. So fudge factory. Yeah.

1753
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,880
Is that what you said? Fudge kitchen. Fudge kitchen.

1754
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:26,040
They have a big.

1755
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:30,360
Impossible to remember brand name, but they have a big like kettle.

1756
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:33,640
Like Scott Granator. You use a paddle like you whip it.

1757
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:35,360
I think that's why they're fun.

1758
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:39,760
You use a paddle to make a paddle to whip it in a big copper kettle.

1759
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:41,560
Oh, wow. Yeah. OK.

1760
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:43,680
So it's like what we did when we were in the Disneyland.

1761
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:45,800
We were rowing. Yeah, kind of.

1762
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:50,200
Yeah. So imagine that's all like, you know, chocolate and milk and sugar.

1763
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:53,960
OK. And if somebody told you that there was a paddle coming for your ass,

1764
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:58,000
but maybe the paddle is covered in if it's great.

1765
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:03,200
You got to lick the fudge kitchen paddle after it's been in the copper kettle.

1766
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:06,520
I this is this is a future present for Jason.

1767
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:09,320
Yeah. Giving up giving him a big paddle paddle.

1768
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:13,320
But maybe maybe this is a thing because I think you can still buy

1769
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:17,760
like a carnation fudge kit, which is like a can of condensed milk, cocoa,

1770
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,560
like everything you need in one box and a little ore.

1771
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:25,680
Uh, I think you can substitute a spoon or a spatula.

1772
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:30,800
I tried one more time with this AI, because I said, God, we tried twice.

1773
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:32,040
Let me try three times.

1774
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:34,400
So I wrote Flintstones Avatar.

1775
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:37,960
Oh, and let down yet again.

1776
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,800
This is not a merger of the Navi.

1777
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,000
No, it doesn't work. It's not working.

1778
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,440
This thing sucks.

1779
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:47,360
Yeah, this is the worst thing we've ever done.

1780
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:51,640
I think I was looking on a different website and it makes it look a lot smearier.

1781
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:56,000
It's like a lot with Fred has like a little way fairy wings, but I don't know.

1782
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:59,000
It looks like there's one that's like blue, but this this sucks.

1783
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,840
I'm so sorry. Let's throw your phone.

1784
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:02,880
I edit this out. Let's edit all of this out.

1785
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,400
Scrap it. Scrap it.

1786
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:10,360
And it all references to Navi out of the podcast.

1787
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:13,320
Do you want to? But not not every episode because there's

1788
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:15,680
yes, every episode referenced in every episode.

1789
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:18,280
Even Dragitar. Oh, jeez.

1790
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:20,640
Oh, I remember one thing.

1791
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:24,720
I found there's a clip online of like one minute or 10 minutes,

1792
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:29,600
a few minutes of the there was a brief stage show at King's Dominion.

1793
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,240
Oh, OK. With Flintstone characters.

1794
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:34,160
And that also involves them going to Holly Rock.

1795
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:36,400
OK, perfect. So I think this is post.

1796
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:40,720
This is post paramount because they say like, oh, they make movies here

1797
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:45,600
like Days of Boulder, which is a days of thunder reference.

1798
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:49,680
Likely said, because there was a days of thunder simulator.

1799
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:52,600
The traction. Oh, right. Right. Right. OK.

1800
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:55,120
Days of Boulder. That's what your end.

1801
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:57,360
Now, no one wants to see you.

1802
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,920
The Flintstones then go watch movies about rocks.

1803
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,520
Don't they want to imagine maybe they can't.

1804
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,720
I don't think they can. Are rocks their god?

1805
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,400
It's probably what they think.

1806
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,920
But it's not their money. Seashells are their money.

1807
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:12,840
Or like sand dollars, I think. Right.

1808
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,160
I think it's a mix.

1809
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:15,360
I'm not thinking about it.

1810
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:16,280
There's another Flintstones.

1811
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:18,920
There's so much like there's a man called Flintstone movie

1812
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:23,360
that I think was like a spy parody that Fred was in that I think I watched

1813
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,320
when I was sick once, which made me hate it,

1814
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,160
which I feel like there's stuff that's associated with when you were little

1815
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:32,160
and you're sick and it just ruins whatever you're watching sometimes forever,

1816
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:33,920
unless you watched it again.

1817
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:36,360
But then there was one and maybe it was that or maybe no, it was something

1818
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:41,400
in the 90s where Sylvester Stallone was parody and he was Sylvester Stallone stone.

1819
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:42,960
That sucks.

1820
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,280
It's Stallone stone. Stallone stone.

1821
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:47,000
Yeah, that's pretty rough.

1822
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,840
That's like Sylvester Stallone stone.

1823
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,760
I don't know. Yeah, that's not very good.

1824
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,920
Sylvester Stallagite?

1825
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:56,520
It rhymes with stone.

1826
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,480
You gotta use. I guess you gotta do the stone.

1827
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:00,360
Yeah. Yeah. Stone.

1828
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:01,480
Well, you know what?

1829
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:07,080
Hey, when then you put us in the driver's seat and we made out like that app.

1830
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:09,560
We bungled it. Yeah.

1831
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:12,120
I mean, this is what that's why you pay those.

1832
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:17,160
That's why they paid those 70 year old men to write all of those.

1833
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:18,760
No, they poured over it.

1834
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:22,520
They poured over. They were so, oh, we can't think of the right name.

1835
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:24,920
Oh, they didn't say like, oh, what is it?

1836
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,920
Oh, yeah. OK, well, let's go to lunch.

1837
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:29,800
Their eyes totally dried out because the room is just filled

1838
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:32,320
with Winston cigarette smoke.

1839
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:33,120
Well, they sponsored it.

1840
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:35,040
It was sponsored box after box.

1841
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,120
It was that crafty.

1842
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:37,160
The writers.

1843
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:40,400
Can I ask for a photo also of if you see like a there's

1844
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:44,480
there's a black and white photo of a guy of a shirtless guy.

1845
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:49,200
And I just want to make sure you guys saw this picture of what

1846
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:52,680
the voice of Fred Flintstone looks like.

1847
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:55,320
Alan Reed, not Alan Hale.

1848
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:58,800
Alan Hale is the skipper with the lobster barrel.

1849
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:02,080
Alan Reed, look at this man.

1850
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:06,200
There's a black and white photo of a guy with no shirt.

1851
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:10,880
And he is he's got a ship wheel, a captain's wheel.

1852
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:13,560
And he's so sweaty.

1853
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:15,960
This is the voice of Fred.

1854
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:18,800
Hey, we've heard this guy's voice our whole lives.

1855
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:23,360
And he's this and he's it's that kind of insane body.

1856
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,880
That's what strong people looked like.

1857
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:27,400
He looks like a hundred years ago.

1858
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:29,360
If you know wrestling looks like George Animal Steel.

1859
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,400
If you ever seen the movie, I would.

1860
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,200
He's played by.

1861
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:36,160
Why can't I think of the guy's name?

1862
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:39,320
I forget it's one of the wrestlers that plays him.

1863
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:41,960
But yeah, I don't know.

1864
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:44,520
It's usually George Animal Steel plays the older wrestler.

1865
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:45,760
Excuse me. Oh, I see.

1866
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:46,920
And I can't think of his name.

1867
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:49,720
But yeah, it's like an old kind of barrel chested.

1868
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,560
That's kind of like I just are.

1869
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:56,640
Are there even bodies like this now where you are jacked

1870
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:58,600
but also have a big belly?

1871
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,680
George, the animal steel played tour, John.

1872
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:03,200
Yes, yes, yes. I got confused.

1873
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:04,000
Yeah, sorry. Yeah.

1874
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,280
This was the fittest man in America.

1875
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:08,480
It is. This is a by the way.

1876
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:09,280
Yeah. Take a look.

1877
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:12,840
Trying to steer away from the many, many women chasing after him.

1878
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:14,760
This guy is Alan.

1879
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:16,320
No, I'm Mary.

1880
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:19,200
He's probably 31 years old here.

1881
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:20,160
I think so.

1882
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:22,560
It's probably younger than the three of us, for sure.

1883
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,720
Yeah. In his 50s.

1884
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:27,920
Hannah and Barbera would call him kid at this point.

1885
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:28,560
Yeah. Yeah.

1886
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:31,200
Slow your roll, kid, on these contract negotiations.

1887
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:32,320
He looks like Fred.

1888
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,920
I'll say that. He looks like, oh yeah, that guy would do Fred's voice.

1889
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:36,560
Sometimes you're surprised.

1890
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,440
Sometimes you're like surprised when you see him, but not.

1891
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:39,840
No, no. This is insane.

1892
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:43,200
I think this is what people this is what like Trump

1893
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:46,200
acolytes think he looks like underneath the suit.

1894
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:47,320
Like, oh, sure.

1895
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:50,160
They're like they know that he's not skinny.

1896
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,400
So they got to account for that.

1897
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:55,280
But they get but he can only be brawny.

1898
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:57,120
Right. That must be what's going on.

1899
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:00,920
If he were to take that suit off ever, he looks like he looks like

1900
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:02,520
1910s boxer.

1901
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:05,320
He looks like a smiling, old timey, strong man

1902
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:08,760
who just got a barrel of vegetable oil thrown on him.

1903
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:11,040
And he's thrilled. He's happy about it.

1904
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:13,800
Most people if you ask about presidential candidates,

1905
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:14,880
who would you want to have a beer with?

1906
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:19,520
But they but it's with Trump people, it's like who could wrestle an alligator

1907
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:22,360
if an alligator showed up at my front door?

1908
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:27,840
Yeah, I mean, I there's definitely a section of people, I believe.

1909
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:29,640
Yeah, what you're saying is correct.

1910
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:33,480
I also there's probably just a section that literally just like you,

1911
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:36,640
if you got into their brain, it's just like they see like the handsome

1912
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:40,760
the most like Zeus, they see like the most handsome version of like King Triton.

1913
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:44,080
Oh, yeah. They just don't even just like a little squish.

1914
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:48,600
And it corrects every like they've they've got a you've got a perma

1915
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,600
Instagram filter on every piece of footage.

1916
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:54,360
Yeah, you've described that the section of the of the supporters

1917
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:57,040
who have maybe like a fingernail in reality.

1918
01:31:57,800 --> 01:32:00,640
Yeah, I'm describing to do the logic of.

1919
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:03,800
Well, yeah, I've been playing that logic.

1920
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:07,120
Yeah, yeah. And I'm just saying like there's a little bit of reality going on.

1921
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:10,760
My the people I'm talking about, I think it's more like literally King

1922
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:15,200
Triton at the end of The Little Mermaid, because they see like the toughest man alive.

1923
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:17,520
Yeah, which, yeah, newsflash folks.

1924
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:21,000
So so they're not the case that that is half the electorate.

1925
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:25,560
And then the other half is people who hold like the most insane set of opinions,

1926
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,720
just no consistency of just like, well, sure.

1927
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:28,920
Well, everyone should have health care.

1928
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:30,640
We need to do something about global warming.

1929
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:32,760
We cannot get rid of the death penalty.

1930
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:36,080
We need that. Our society will fall apart.

1931
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:38,680
King Triton says so. Yeah.

1932
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:40,920
King Triton said so.

1933
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:43,040
Trump is King Triton.

1934
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:45,720
So, yeah, yeah, this is a fantastic picture of this.

1935
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:47,400
As long as we can.

1936
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:50,560
But let's also is there anything we have to say about this recent ride?

1937
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,040
Oh, this Abu Dhabi. I'll say this.

1938
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:54,720
It looks good. It kind of does.

1939
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:56,640
It's not like the first proper.

1940
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:01,240
If you don't ever haven't seen a video, it's the first like actually fully committed.

1941
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:04,440
There is like Kings Island at one of these places that a dinky

1942
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:07,800
something called Fred Flintstone splashdown.

1943
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:10,160
But I don't think you got any robots on that thing.

1944
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:11,880
But this is this is a boat ride.

1945
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:16,160
It's a tame flume ride where you go to bedrock and there's,

1946
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:19,360
you know, a screen.

1947
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:24,200
It's like a there's a turntable where they spin the boat around and you see the

1948
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:28,160
iconic, you have a daba do opening of Fred leaving work

1949
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:31,720
because he's like every American man, he hates work with a passion.

1950
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:34,800
Yeah, I think that opening goes a long way.

1951
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:36,600
I think people like the opening.

1952
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,480
I think the opening glued in people's minds.

1953
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:42,080
I think the song is catchy. Oh, of course. Yes.

1954
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:47,920
Yeah, there's a there's a lot, I think, that made the Simpsons so ubiquitous.

1955
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:50,480
It is the and the and the Flintstones.

1956
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:54,360
Well, the Flintstones.

1957
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:00,240
Well, you were thinking of the fact that it was parodied on the Simpsons.

1958
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:03,120
Was parodied where Homer jumps out of the plan.

1959
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:05,960
Yeah. Homer, yeah, hits a chestnut tree.

1960
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:11,160
But the Flintstones is like a ubiquitous reference that like TV networks

1961
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:14,560
and movie studios nowadays try to like generate out of nothing.

1962
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:18,280
Yeah, it's the iconography is so strong still with the Flintstones,

1963
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:22,800
which maybe goes to my point earlier, like I don't know how many classic plots

1964
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:25,840
people might remember, but they know they love the opening.

1965
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:28,120
They know they love the characters.

1966
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:30,640
They like, yeah, the aesthetic of it maybe.

1967
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:33,360
And again, we're going to be bombarded with all your letters.

1968
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:36,880
So sorry for people going to say you're wrong.

1969
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,880
There's like 10 classic Flintstone episodes.

1970
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:42,000
And there's also like the little nuggets of like,

1971
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:45,240
if you walk up to people on the street and you go 10 million strong, like,

1972
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:47,600
will they say, grow, grow?

1973
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:54,000
Yeah, yeah. Which I could those vitamins be good for you?

1974
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,120
I don't know. We had them growing up.

1975
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:58,680
I mean, I guess they probably have to pass some test, but who knows?

1976
01:34:58,680 --> 01:34:59,920
I kind of like the taste of those.

1977
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:03,000
I love the taste of those. Maybe I'll make a cheesecake with ground up

1978
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,440
Flintstone vitamins. Oh, delicious. I love I love Flintstone vitamins.

1979
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:09,120
I remember when they added.

1980
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,360
Was it Bam Bam to that to the vitamins?

1981
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:15,000
They added a character in the 90s, and it may as well have like

1982
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,160
thrown me an extra birthday that year.

1983
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:19,040
That's how excited I was.

1984
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:22,120
I remember that I should see because they added like say was Bam Bam

1985
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:25,000
because it did bother me that all the characters were not eatable

1986
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:26,760
because I wanted to eat all the characters.

1987
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:30,120
I want to eat all my friends because it was fun taking vitamin every day

1988
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:31,920
when you eat one of the Flintstones.

1989
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:34,320
You could pretend you were the biggest dinosaur.

1990
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:36,440
Yeah. Chewing all of these cavemen.

1991
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:37,840
Yes. Ending their lives.

1992
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:41,440
Did they have to have a meeting where like, well, can we put Bam Bam in there?

1993
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:45,000
Wouldn't the kids expect him to be like hit and stuff with his club?

1994
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:46,960
Bad influence. Yeah.

1995
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:48,480
Yeah. Bam Bam. Kind of a.

1996
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,080
If we take the weapon away.

1997
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:53,800
A precursor to dinosaurs to baby.

1998
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:57,160
What's his face from not not the mama baby dinosaur.

1999
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:59,200
Baby Sinclair. Mm hmm. Yeah.

2000
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:00,760
OK. Sinclair. All right.

2001
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:02,680
I was wrong about what happened.

2002
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:04,880
OK, this is a this is a travesty.

2003
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:06,600
Well, it's cut the letter off at the pass.

2004
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:07,800
So this is going to be all right.

2005
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,760
Move. We're going to edit this into this front of the episode

2006
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:11,120
because it's so important.

2007
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,960
The vitamins are widely available.

2008
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:17,080
They were the shapes of Fred, Wilma, Pebbles, Barney, Betty, Bam Bam,

2009
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:19,600
Rebel Dino and the Great Gazoo for over 20 years.

2010
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:23,120
Betty was not included as one of the vitamins.

2011
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:27,720
However, after a grassroots campaign and the results of a Bayer

2012
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:31,280
telephone poll came in favor of including Betty,

2013
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:35,160
the character was added to the lineup in 1995, replacing what?

2014
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,680
The Flintstones car.

2015
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:40,560
They did the car and not Betty.

2016
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:42,440
Jesus. Come on.

2017
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:45,400
Wow. Betty's like a main Betty's like a main character.

2018
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:48,000
Was this the Stone Age when all this happened?

2019
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:50,280
It really is shocking.

2020
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:51,360
How did we live like this?

2021
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:54,360
But does this car get more screen time than Betty?

2022
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,760
I don't know if Betty's in episodes.

2023
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:58,560
She's in a good amount of episodes.

2024
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:00,120
I feel like they got a lot of mileage.

2025
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:02,040
She's in every what do you mean?

2026
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:03,520
But here's the letters.

2027
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:05,600
Betty's in every episode.

2028
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:08,920
How many minutes does the car get versus Betty?

2029
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:10,600
Oh, she's in more than the car.

2030
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:12,840
This is an insane argument.

2031
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:14,240
But people know the car.

2032
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,960
There's a lot of the time.

2033
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:19,480
Here's the thing. I haven't watched a Flintstone episode in a hundred years.

2034
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:22,880
So I don't think there's just like scenes with like the shots of the car

2035
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:26,320
in the driveway over cool guitar.

2036
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:31,120
But you went out of your way to talk about the ribs knocking over the car.

2037
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:34,160
What Betty specific memories have you brought up?

2038
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:38,040
Her and Wilma are in the midst of making an anti-Betty.

2039
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:40,960
I'm not saying he doesn't want Betty in the vitamins.

2040
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:42,920
He's trying to make it like Betty.

2041
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:44,960
The car is more like we are Betty.

2042
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,160
We're all Betty fans.

2043
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:49,640
Jason is trying to say that perhaps the car is a more popular character

2044
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:51,480
than Betty in the original.

2045
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:54,720
I'm saying back in the day, they may have given her more screen time.

2046
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:56,400
There's another the car.

2047
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,360
I think the car Betty was more in the show.

2048
01:37:58,360 --> 01:38:01,000
But people remember the car.

2049
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,320
Yeah, I think people remember Betty.

2050
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:07,760
Tell me tell me some qualities of Betty Rubble.

2051
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:09,880
She's nice. Nice.

2052
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:11,640
OK, she's nice.

2053
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:13,680
She's nice. What's the quality of the car?

2054
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:15,960
And what's the quality of Wilma?

2055
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:17,880
We could name one of those, Dum Dum.

2056
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:23,920
The car isn't balanced well, clearly, or it shouldn't be.

2057
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:27,400
That's a rib problem, not a car problem.

2058
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:30,080
Look, what is Fred? What is Fred and Barney?

2059
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:32,240
What are their qualities? Dumb?

2060
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:34,400
They're both dumb. Wilma and Betty are smarter.

2061
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:38,920
I know how they they I know how they believe what a cigarette should do.

2062
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:42,960
There's another very funny commercial.

2063
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:45,000
Fine cigarettes. That's a quality.

2064
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:49,360
Is there a Bechtel test that is about vitamins, is about children's vitamins

2065
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:52,000
where there are women are well represented vitamins?

2066
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,440
I would say, well, most vitamins do not represent women at all.

2067
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,680
They're just plain pills.

2068
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:59,600
That's a good point. They don't represent men either.

2069
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,800
But that's not the issue.

2070
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:04,840
Is there another fighting for women to be all vitamins to be women shaped?

2071
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:08,920
It is crazy. And I will say all kidding aside, it is sexist.

2072
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:10,600
The Betty wasn't a vitamin.

2073
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:11,840
It absolutely is.

2074
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:14,160
Over the car. Mm hmm. That's crazy.

2075
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:18,120
Is there another vitamin that has characters on it?

2076
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:20,440
There has to be, right? Surely at this point.

2077
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:22,400
I mean, at this point, there's gummies, but not from our childhood.

2078
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:25,680
I feel like Flintstones was the only probably.

2079
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:27,120
What if this is industry wide?

2080
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:29,440
There's Disney vitamins and there's we're going to have to look.

2081
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:33,520
No, many there is a superhero vitamins with no Wonder Woman.

2082
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:36,240
Because they're the whole the whole and it's I think it's different,

2083
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:36,920
a little bit different now.

2084
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:38,480
But in the in the old days, we were buying toys.

2085
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:41,480
And I'm sure I've talked about this before, is that the female characters

2086
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:46,440
were not well represented because the philosophy was, well, these are boys

2087
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:50,920
toys and boys don't like the female characters, which not really true.

2088
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:54,200
It's just another like so they would be very hard to find in the cases.

2089
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:56,920
So I'm guessing it's the same like sort of philosophy of like,

2090
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:59,200
you know, a little boy is going to want it.

2091
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:02,880
Chew on a car more than Betty, you know, little boy.

2092
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:04,160
We need them to grow.

2093
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:08,120
We need them to be to be strong and growing like our song says.

2094
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:11,360
And if there's if they're throwing all those babies in the trash,

2095
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:14,560
they're we're going to have an entire generation of stunted growth.

2096
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:17,840
Yeah. Also, what's crazy about it is they couldn't just add Betty.

2097
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:19,840
They had to take one out. Yeah.

2098
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:22,320
What was removed again? The car.

2099
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:24,120
That was a switch out. OK, OK.

2100
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:25,720
So like, why didn't they just add one?

2101
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:28,360
Or is like there was a like either was a giant apparatus

2102
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:30,760
you'd seen in Mr. Rogers video that would make each vitamin.

2103
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:32,400
And they were like, we don't have room for another one.

2104
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:33,840
So we got to just get rid of the car.

2105
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:37,960
The pure unit cost of like the extra five cents per bottle

2106
01:40:38,160 --> 01:40:41,000
multiplied by however many million. Right.

2107
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,200
And also, you said they had the great Gazoo.

2108
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:44,920
Who is who?

2109
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:48,680
Or one season character that a lot of people didn't like.

2110
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:51,960
So I memory hold it in a in a way where like Bam Bam,

2111
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:54,000
because it was a member of Betty's family.

2112
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,440
And that made more sense to me.

2113
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:57,160
I didn't even remember Gazoo was in the light.

2114
01:40:57,160 --> 01:41:00,840
You had to do that to grapple with how this could have even occurred.

2115
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:01,640
Betty would not be in the.

2116
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:03,760
You were a completist even as a child.

2117
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:06,880
You wanted each full family unit. Of course. Yeah. Yeah.

2118
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:10,560
You wanted the full nuclear family, both nuclear families.

2119
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:13,680
And I also wanted to eat Mr. Slate, but that never happened.

2120
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:16,040
Although I guess it still could happen if we start.

2121
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:17,520
What is what happened with Betty?

2122
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:21,760
A Bayer telephone poll came in favor of Betty, which what?

2123
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:26,160
Bayer the company, not a it wasn't a Bayer didn't conduct a

2124
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:30,840
so does resulting in ads that say Betty's here.

2125
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:34,040
What what if this was and this was until ninety five?

2126
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,680
So we were all. Yeah.

2127
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:39,040
So I do remember them adding a character and it was Betty.

2128
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:40,360
It was not Bam Bam.

2129
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:43,800
But I was excited because it was a big oversight.

2130
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:44,640
It was weird.

2131
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:48,080
And I remember feeling it was weird that everybody wasn't on the vitamins.

2132
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:51,120
Yeah, we just gave up on the vitamins at a certain point.

2133
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:55,160
I have read and I say recently in the last five years,

2134
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:58,560
I have bought Flintstone vitamins and had them instead of my regular

2135
01:41:58,560 --> 01:41:59,840
multivitamin. Is that right?

2136
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:01,920
You know, it was just one so fun. It's fun.

2137
01:42:02,120 --> 01:42:04,560
If you compare that taste, how does that hold up?

2138
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:07,320
They're fantastic. They taste. They're delicious.

2139
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:10,000
I remember kind of like the it's kind of like a grape

2140
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,760
and then a slightly different grape and then maybe maybe a darker grape.

2141
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,920
It's like cherry orange grape.

2142
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:18,880
It's the fundamentals of popsicle flavors

2143
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:21,520
that we grew up with those three flavors.

2144
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:25,240
You could you start the day eating a little treat, a little piece of candy.

2145
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:27,080
It's like why gummy vitamins are fun.

2146
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:28,920
Yes. And I wish I'd buy sometimes as well.

2147
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:31,120
But they are not. Oh, you know, I have them right now.

2148
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:34,880
I go back and forth between like adult flavorless things.

2149
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:37,440
And then I'll do a gummy once in a while.

2150
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:40,120
Some of those gummies, female.

2151
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:43,320
These are all no way to know.

2152
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:45,400
Little blobs. These are sure.

2153
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:47,080
These actually do have a little coat of sugar on them.

2154
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:47,800
I'm thinking about it.

2155
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:49,800
I guess we have to assume that some of them are,

2156
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:54,520
because if gummy bears are able to reproduce and repopulate, then

2157
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:56,680
like the spider robots on the.

2158
01:42:56,680 --> 01:43:01,280
Oh, yeah. Well, that's a that's a nonsexual type of republic population, I guess.

2159
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:05,440
Yeah. So so you're so maybe gummy bears create themselves.

2160
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:07,120
That's very yeah.

2161
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:10,120
In which the gummy bears don't have sex. Right.

2162
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,560
So so what were we talking about?

2163
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:15,560
Flintstones, Warner Brothers.

2164
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:17,840
What's that? They have gummy Flintstone vitamins.

2165
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,920
Yes, I've seen this. Yeah. But are they characters?

2166
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:23,040
That's a good question.

2167
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:25,080
Yeah. So we'll do a whole look gummy.

2168
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:27,760
We'll do a whole gummy vitamins.

2169
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:30,200
Well, we'll start your own mccasey

2170
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:34,080
taste. We will give you a vitamin course.

2171
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:37,240
So I remember I know we're still recording, right?

2172
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:38,880
This is the we did. The tape didn't run out.

2173
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,960
Like we're still going here because I remember I just opened this up

2174
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:44,640
and I remember when they introduced the new Flintstone vitamins,

2175
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:46,920
extra C with immunity support.

2176
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:49,200
I remember this orange box and I'll show this.

2177
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:50,760
Why do you remember that?

2178
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:54,320
Because I remember I was very I like that close up on Jason's.

2179
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:56,200
Look at that rack focus. Look at that.

2180
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:57,040
That's a great shot.

2181
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:59,720
I could see your watch to Jason. You remember this?

2182
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:02,640
Yeah. So I was heavily.

2183
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:04,440
Yeah. What are you talking about?

2184
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:08,320
You remember when the box changed to be about a different version?

2185
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:09,480
It was a different version.

2186
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:11,320
And he says, yeah, wait a minute.

2187
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:13,560
You when did this? Why do you remember this?

2188
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:15,680
I just remember like going.

2189
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:19,160
We went to the grocery store and we got, oh, there's a new colored box

2190
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:20,600
for Flintstone vitamins in it.

2191
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:22,480
And they have a lot of different of course.

2192
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:24,360
Jason's even like worrying about something else.

2193
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:26,360
He's like, yeah, shut up. I got other shit to do.

2194
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:29,440
You remember when the box color changed? Yes, yes, I do.

2195
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:30,480
Well, I'm looking at all.

2196
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:34,720
They got multiple boxes, bottles like, oh, elderberry gummies.

2197
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:37,800
Why? I still don't understand why you were so excited about that.

2198
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:40,120
But you're like, here, let me get in different camera angles

2199
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:43,840
to show you that now it's orange because I realize that the thing.

2200
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,640
OK, earlier I am going to amend my list.

2201
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:48,760
I'm going to put Flintstone vitamins number one.

2202
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:52,440
Actually, clearly, because apparently I'm unlocking the most excited.

2203
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:53,880
I've seen you in months. I'm unlucky.

2204
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:57,360
It's the first time I get in all the cameras.

2205
01:44:57,360 --> 01:45:01,800
It's the first time I felt anything in maybe pre pandemic before pre pandemic.

2206
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:05,600
So, yeah, I still don't think I understood.

2207
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:06,720
Wait, wait, say it one more time.

2208
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:09,040
What happened? What's up with this box that was so interesting?

2209
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,960
There was a new Flintstone vitamins

2210
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:15,800
which had immunity, like vitamin C, extra vitamin C.

2211
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:19,120
And I remember going in the aisle because I think the regular box,

2212
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:21,960
maybe it was a little more red. Yeah, it was like this.

2213
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:24,320
This was more the color of it. Red.

2214
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:26,760
And then there was like one with and I remember when we started buying

2215
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:28,320
Flintstones with immunity support.

2216
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:31,560
And I remember in the same way that they talk about, you know, like you were looking

2217
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:34,600
like a kid in the 70s is looking at like Ziggy Stardust.

2218
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:36,280
He's staring at the album cover.

2219
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:39,640
I remember just like the image of this orange Flintstones

2220
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:42,640
plus immunity support box with extra vitamin C.

2221
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:45,200
I remember it so well and vividly.

2222
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:48,440
And maybe it wasn't exactly the thing I'm looking here, but it was was similar.

2223
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:50,400
Is it the color?

2224
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:52,880
It was the idea that you wanted the immunity support.

2225
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:55,280
I wanted but I was like this with any food.

2226
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:57,960
This is like a new flavor and this is a sequel.

2227
01:45:57,960 --> 01:46:00,560
It's Flintstones vitamins. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2228
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:05,360
But OK, yeah, we just I just came upon there was a cereal that was a comic strip cereal.

2229
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:07,760
I don't know if you guys remember this.

2230
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:10,400
Anything with characters, I was just

2231
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:15,680
color hammered with different colors, product art and like vitamin

2232
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:18,320
art was not that dissimilar from like toy art.

2233
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:23,520
Yes. So so in the same way you get in your room, you look at the liner notes of an album.

2234
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:27,960
I just took that Flintstones vitamin C box and I looked I was like,

2235
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:31,200
oh, wow, this is so cool and read every like eating

2236
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:33,880
Zeen, Zeen, a theme right.

2237
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:36,440
Oh, high in a core theme.

2238
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:38,520
Wow. Wow.

2239
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:40,880
This man, so many vitamins to explore.

2240
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:44,240
It's like an almost famous movie to be made about me and like eating

2241
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:46,720
like Ninja Turtle cereal and Flintstones vitamins.

2242
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:47,640
This is what I'm talking about.

2243
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:49,640
And I remember before we started here today, I was like,

2244
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:52,680
oh, you know, we probably could do a real like concise episode about Flintstones.

2245
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:53,960
But no, hell no.

2246
01:46:53,960 --> 01:46:59,320
Here's a picture of morning funny cereal, which we absolutely had a box of.

2247
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:01,960
So there which Family Circus is one of them.

2248
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:03,480
Yes. So is one of them.

2249
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:06,640
It's basically like there's a comic strip on the front and it's Beatle Bailey

2250
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:08,640
and High and Lowest and Dennis the Menace.

2251
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:10,840
And it's basically just looks like some version of tricks.

2252
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:14,320
And there it is right there for you.

2253
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,400
You've made the audience.

2254
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:19,640
They're all one person who you're showing shit to on your phone.

2255
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:21,120
That's a yes. That's what it is.

2256
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:23,680
And that's what the whole podcast exactly in general.

2257
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:26,160
So so, yeah, all that stuff just as a kid.

2258
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:30,120
They could easily trick you with packaging and everything.

2259
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:34,840
That being said, the Abu Dhabi Flintstones ride, I think is good.

2260
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:38,920
I think the robots maybe can move a little bit more, but it's a nice long ride.

2261
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:41,000
I think they've got references to the show.

2262
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,480
There's like a Beatles parody at the end of it.

2263
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:46,760
And I feel like they that's the closest thing to it being right.

2264
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:48,600
I don't think anyone will ever do a better

2265
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:51,680
unless Flintstones like has a crazy resurgence in popularity.

2266
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:57,000
I feel like that is kind of maybe the ultimate Flintstones ride in a lot of ways.

2267
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:58,240
I think so.

2268
01:47:58,240 --> 01:48:02,520
But however, you lost me because now I'm trying to find has anyone ever posted

2269
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:05,840
like I'm like, what do I search for Flintstones immunity support new

2270
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Flintstones immunity support excited childhood memory.

2271
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:11,600
I don't know what to find.

2272
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:15,000
And this bit like am I setting myself up for another?

2273
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,160
You never know with these things either.

2274
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:20,000
This is very singular, although not because it's both of you.

2275
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:24,840
Yeah. Or again, I am the it's got to know that when the new

2276
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:28,560
box with the orange was there, that it was important.

2277
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:32,400
I think people will remember that box.

2278
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,200
I don't think Jason was doing it.

2279
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:38,160
But is anyone's voice ever raised about it, which even Jason's did not.

2280
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:41,160
Even in his quick agreement, to be fair, though, he was busy with something else.

2281
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:43,080
So he didn't give us full energy to it.

2282
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:46,600
I was just making sure they are still appear to have all eight.

2283
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:50,080
OK, good. You know, but I'm not I'm not putting you down for nothing.

2284
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:52,680
I'm just saying that maybe if you had got full attention,

2285
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:54,640
you would have raised your voice in excitement.

2286
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:57,160
Yeah. Remember the orange.

2287
01:48:57,160 --> 01:49:00,120
You would have like gotten up and started doing Gangnam style.

2288
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:03,920
Well, TV was kind of a third parent.

2289
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:07,560
I know my parents were neglectful, but I just watched a lot of TV.

2290
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:09,040
Yeah, sure. And I did not.

2291
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:11,400
And that's why you were excited about commercial.

2292
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:12,800
And you wanted to eat them.

2293
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,560
Huh? You watch TV and you wanted to eat them.

2294
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:17,080
That's what I wanted to consume, though.

2295
01:49:17,080 --> 01:49:20,080
I needed I needed a little snack in the morning.

2296
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:24,320
I need a little sweet treat because there wasn't enough sugar in the orange juice.

2297
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:28,640
Two percent milk and the, you know, cookie checks.

2298
01:49:29,720 --> 01:49:31,280
OK, I've here.

2299
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:33,520
Look, I've never been more curious.

2300
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:36,760
If this is an important memory for anyone else,

2301
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:40,920
is the switch from Flintstones vitamins not a switch, just a new version.

2302
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:43,400
Yeah, new Malibu Stacy has a new hat.

2303
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:44,840
You know, it worked on us.

2304
01:49:44,840 --> 01:49:47,520
If you remember when that happened, yeah, please let us know.

2305
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:51,760
Here, fully like the immunity support helped me survive.

2306
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:53,240
Yeah. Bird flu.

2307
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,080
You're right. The mad cow.

2308
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:59,240
Who knows in the 90s what I have also never noticed a difference

2309
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:02,520
in how I feel when I take a multivitamin B12.

2310
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:05,040
I feel a little energy vitamins in general.

2311
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:07,880
It's like, well, what is what is it doing?

2312
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:08,720
Yeah. You know what I mean?

2313
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:09,360
Like it's like zinc.

2314
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:12,840
You're supposed to say zinc if you feel like you have a cold coming on or an illness,

2315
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:17,280
which I accidentally took once on an empty stomach and immediately vomited.

2316
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:19,160
Yeah. Big mistake. Yeah.

2317
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:23,160
Do that. But but supposedly zinc, there's some evidence that it helps.

2318
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:24,560
But ultimately, you'll never know.

2319
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:25,680
You take a zinc, you go to bed.

2320
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:26,920
Maybe it would have.

2321
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:28,720
You'll never literally know.

2322
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:31,600
Yeah. Other than just having the only time you'll know is like

2323
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:34,520
if you take a blood test and they go, you need more vitamin D or, you know, whatever.

2324
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:36,720
Right. Then you can like there's a measurable thing.

2325
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:39,960
But ultimately, yeah, it's not like you take a vitamin in the morning and you go like,

2326
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:42,120
oh, I'm out of work. I feel great.

2327
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:47,440
Well, you're you're both ruining our eventual business of podcast, the ride supplements.

2328
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:49,120
Oh, man. Oh, sure.

2329
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:50,360
We could make that happen.

2330
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:50,960
Yeah. Yeah. Still.

2331
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:55,600
That's where we say we wanted to come up with something that does do something.

2332
01:50:55,800 --> 01:51:00,160
And all of the pills are shaped like different female characters that we admire.

2333
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:02,000
Yes. Not one male character in.

2334
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,440
I was going to be not a car.

2335
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:08,400
Jean Grey, Aurora Monroe, all the Asian women from the X-Men.

2336
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:09,520
They're they're fictional.

2337
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:11,800
They're fictional women.

2338
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:14,520
Chasor Chase Meridian is the is my main pick.

2339
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:18,240
If we all have to draft famous women to be our in our vitamins,

2340
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:19,600
Chase Meridian is my number one.

2341
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:22,720
Just staring, Mike, just staring at the Chase Meridian

2342
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:27,440
adverts in the newspaper and the Chicago Sun Times.

2343
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:32,320
Hey, but not hearing sexy sex.

2344
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:35,640
No sex. It's a pure love.

2345
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:38,800
It's not a silence of pure respectful.

2346
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:41,800
Yes. Yeah. Nothing untoward.

2347
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:44,240
Guys, you survived podcast.

2348
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:46,800
The ride. We've been talking about vitamins for 45.

2349
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:51,760
A lot of it was vital, maybe enough where we have to change the name of the episode.

2350
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:54,600
We'll discuss that down the road.

2351
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:58,520
But in the meantime, you can find us on all the socials at podcast.

2352
01:51:58,520 --> 01:52:02,400
The ride merch is available in our tea public store for three bonus episodes every month.

2353
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:05,840
Check out podcast, the ride, the second gate at Patreon dot com slash podcast, the ride.

2354
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,520
And guess what? There's a new we have a new new.

2355
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:11,200
It's not immunity support.

2356
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:15,800
No, it's as exciting as a change of a color on a box

2357
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:19,640
because we have a new patron to your club three, where you get one more bonus episode

2358
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:22,920
every month, plus our main feed episodes ad free.

2359
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:26,120
And again, that's all available at Patreon dot com slash podcast.

2360
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:30,360
As well as podcast, the rides, unlicensed

2361
01:52:31,120 --> 01:52:35,320
supplements with unlicensed female characters who we write.

2362
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:38,240
Yes, that's true. There'll be a lot of fun stuff there.

2363
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:41,040
Real quick, I wanted to add right before we got here today, I thought, you know,

2364
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:44,200
I want people to imagine, like, you know, any of these episodes, there's

2365
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:47,400
infinite, you know, there's an infinite amount of universes.

2366
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:49,640
There's an infinite amount of ways things can go.

2367
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:52,800
And I just want people now to imagine if you're if you've a longtime listener

2368
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:56,320
of the podcast, imagine if this episode, like it was a fourth character

2369
01:52:56,320 --> 01:53:00,200
and it was like the great bug zoo who was here with us.

2370
01:53:00,240 --> 01:53:02,680
Oh, and I just thought of it before coming here.

2371
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:04,080
So we didn't even.

2372
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:07,080
So I'm not saying it has to happen in the future, but there is a universe

2373
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:09,480
where it did happen. Yeah.

2374
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:11,360
Well, he should the great bug zoo

2375
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:14,520
should probably pop up in a non Flintstones episode.

2376
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:16,280
Sure. Yeah, it's possible.

2377
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:17,960
Surprise them.

2378
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:21,040
Yeah, like just imagine if that had happened during this whole episode.

2379
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:22,160
Yeah. What would have happened?

2380
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:25,120
Then we can call it a square for all the new Club Three members

2381
01:53:25,120 --> 01:53:27,360
who were like, you guys should watch Escape from Tomorrow.

2382
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:31,840
Whose serial did I shit in that I got that curse?

2383
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:35,440
Well, they want it. They want it.

2384
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:37,680
You know, we aim to please. Yeah.

2385
01:53:37,680 --> 01:53:40,080
Yeah. All right. So great bugs.

2386
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:44,640
So we should have thought of a 9-11 release dissolve from the

2387
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:47,480
them. Yeah.

2388
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:55,800
