1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
Forever, dog.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,400
Warning, the following podcast contains artificially dyed seafood,

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,600
space faucet water pressure, personalized Jedi secrets,

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,800
and a little play that somehow feels more real than real life.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,200
All this plus, Andrew Barth Feldman joins us to participate

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,200
in the immersive experience that is today's podcast, The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a podcast about tax write-offs.

8
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,440
I'm Scott Gertner, and I'm Jason Sheridan.

9
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,720
That's a lot of entertainment these days,

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,320
or technically tax write-offs.

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,320
It's all what we're striving to do.

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,320
Should we be so lucky as to give one of our favorite companies

13
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,320
a big way to save money or rearrange money or scam money,

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,680
whatever it is.

15
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,840
Mike Carlson.

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,840
Yes, I'm here and I'm excited to write things off.

17
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,320
It's one of the most exciting parts of 2023,

18
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,440
and we're gonna do it.

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,920
You know, you can do it at home,

20
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,960
you can do it in a big corporation, you can do it anywhere.

21
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,840
And it's its own themed experience, if you're doing it right.

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,280
Yeah, I think so.

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,240
And you know, you sometimes think of it more

24
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,920
with movies and shows lately,

25
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,000
but today we're proving that tax write-offs

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,040
can happen out in the world.

27
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,640
Highly experimental, ambitious tax write-offs

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,000
that are physical experiences can happen.

29
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,600
And that's what we're handling here today,

30
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,560
is Star Wars Galactic Star Cruiser.

31
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,720
And we are still, you know, we had to take a little time,

32
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,200
I think, to process, to deal with the news,

33
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,520
the upsetting news that Star Cruiser is,

34
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,200
if I'm gonna use their terminology,

35
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,000
that they are sun setting it.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,760
They are going to sunset this experience,

37
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,200
I believe is what Josh Tomorrow said.

38
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,280
Really makes it sound like the Star Cruiser

39
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,680
is cruising to a farm upstate, you know?

40
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,360
Because it's close to the term sundowning,

41
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,080
which sometimes you feel like is used

42
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,440
when somebody is like,

43
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,360
maybe slipping away mentally or something.

44
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,280
Sure.

45
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,960
So the phrase is meant, I think, to be gentle,

46
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,640
but it feels not gentle to me.

47
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,880
It feels aggressive.

48
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,440
Well, and then at the same time,

49
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,280
sun setting is weird because a sunset,

50
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,480
then there's a sun up not long after the next day.

51
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,320
Oh, right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

52
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,800
So this actually, it actually is not applicable

53
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,120
because it will not rise again,

54
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,360
at least as of later in the year.

55
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,280
Are there any stars that are destroyed?

56
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,200
Are any stars destroyed in Star Wars?

57
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,520
I know many planets are destroyed,

58
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,360
but it's literally, the ship is called Star Destroyer,

59
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,560
but I'm trying to remember, is a star itself.

60
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,400
I don't believe so.

61
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,560
You don't consider the Death Star a star?

62
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,400
No.

63
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,240
No?

64
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,060
It's just a name.

65
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,900
It's a space station.

66
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,720
It's a station, okay.

67
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,760
There's no, stars are destroyed in Star Trek.

68
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,600
Okay.

69
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,440
A couple times.

70
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,640
Hence maybe your preference,

71
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,120
because that sounds more exciting.

72
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,120
Well, of course, if stars, yeah, it's a bigger thing.

73
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,400
It's a big ball of gas.

74
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,960
It's exciting when it blows up.

75
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,280
Dr. Sauron, of course, in Star Trek Generations,

76
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,600
blows up a sun to move the Nexus ribbon

77
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,700
so it goes in the way of the one planet

78
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,840
so we can get taken.

79
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,800
Yeah. Of course, we know.

80
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,640
Yeah.

81
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,460
Oh, yeah.

82
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,300
We know the ribbon.

83
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,140
We were filling it.

84
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,840
We were auto-filling the rest of that sentence

85
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,800
as you were going.

86
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,280
So I'm just trying, I was trying to figure out

87
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,200
a Star Wars parallel for like a sun,

88
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,680
some sun setting, but never rising.

89
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,520
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

90
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,520
But Star Wars never had anything as exciting

91
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,520
as what you just described.

92
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,360
No, not with Dr. Sauron.

93
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,180
Not as exciting as Dr. Sauron.

94
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,020
No, Sauron.

95
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,800
No, they never had a Sauron.

96
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,200
And I guess this thing didn't reach the heights of Sauron

97
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,360
in the eyes of the Disney corporation.

98
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,820
And thus they are writing this thing off

99
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,520
for $300 million.

100
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,360
At the end of the year, they will no longer be doing this,

101
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,880
what is of course has been a immersive,

102
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,480
ambitious, experimental Star Wars themed hotel,

103
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,800
a two-night experience that's part hotel

104
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,920
and part immersive performance.

105
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,960
I mean, a crazy thing that they tried

106
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,000
and they're kind of like with buzzwords,

107
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,160
admitting failure, they're ending the thing.

108
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,280
It is flying its final mission.

109
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,760
But that leaves us in a weird place

110
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,840
because I think this thing is like selling out

111
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,680
now that there's no more room left.

112
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,400
So we're not gonna be able to get there.

113
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,320
We're not gonna be able to do it.

114
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,240
We're not gonna be able to do an episode about it

115
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,120
with any experience, right?

116
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,960
Probably not.

117
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,760
Now, do I have confidence

118
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,000
that I could somehow find us reservations?

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,640
Yes, I could check my way.

120
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,160
I check our way into the hotel somehow.

121
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,080
But will we do it?

122
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,720
Will we have time?

123
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,120
We have so much on our plates.

124
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,800
There's a lot of other, yeah, yeah.

125
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,240
There's plates spinning in the air.

126
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,480
How are we gonna juggle them all?

127
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,280
Probably malls and stores to talk about instead.

128
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,120
Correct, yeah.

129
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,040
So there's really only one option,

130
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,400
only one way that we could properly cover

131
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,360
Galactic Star Cruiser before it's closing.

132
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,280
We needed a hero to rise.

133
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,680
We needed a Halcyon veteran

134
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,160
to stand up bravely and to talk about their experience

135
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,600
and what they saw.

136
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,600
And luckily, that hero has risen and is with us today.

137
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,840
And that hero, that Halcyon hero,

138
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,280
also happens to be a star of stage and screen.

139
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,240
You may have seen him as Evan Hansen on Broadway.

140
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,840
And now you can see him starring in the new movie,

141
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,120
No Hard Feelings with Jennifer Lawrence,

142
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,480
which, Jennifer Lawrence, that was very graceful of me.

143
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,320
Star Wars name.

144
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,600
Correct me if I said that wrong.

145
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,320
But as you're hearing this,

146
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,720
that No Hard Feelings is in theaters today.

147
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,160
Here are now the star of that movie,

148
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,360
Andrew Barth Feldman, hello.

149
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,200
Wow.

150
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,360
I feel like my first credit is a Halcyon hero.

151
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,040
I do feel like before the other things,

152
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,320
that's really who I am at my core.

153
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,120
We drove to the heart of it.

154
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,600
I'm happy to give you that verbal badge there.

155
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,880
Yeah, that's what I really appreciate.

156
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,760
I have my actual badge.

157
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,360
This wasn't on purpose.

158
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,360
Obviously, there's a podcast, you can't see it.

159
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,240
This wasn't on purpose that I had this ready.

160
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,920
This just sits on my window sill, so I don't forget.

161
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,000
They give you that or did you buy that?

162
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,400
Is that an extra thing?

163
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,680
I think they give it to you.

164
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,360
It's in your room.

165
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,520
I think they give you one.

166
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,080
And then everyone else in our room went to the front desk

167
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,360
and was like, can we have more medals, please?

168
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,840
And then they shake out them.

169
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,680
Wow.

170
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,520
What is the legal limit?

171
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,320
How can it, technically, if you ask,

172
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,720
how many medals do they have to give you a dozen a night?

173
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,600
That's such a good question, actually.

174
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,320
Is there a limit to the amount of medals

175
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,160
that they can give you?

176
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,960
I mean, there's gotta be kind of like,

177
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,200
maybe it's made out of carbonite

178
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
and that feels probably a limitless resource.

179
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,520
The house seems very luxurious,

180
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,920
so I think it's probably fine.

181
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,800
I'm sorry that you're not gonna get

182
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,000
even a drop of cynicism from me about this.

183
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,240
Not even a little bit.

184
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,920
It's not gonna, I wish I could maybe provide it for you.

185
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,360
I'm incapable of doing it with most things,

186
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,040
but with the Halcyon and the Galactic Star Cruiser,

187
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,600
specifically, you're never gonna hear it from me.

188
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,000
It's just not gonna happen.

189
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,840
Wow.

190
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,080
Well, then this, I think this will be a little like,

191
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,480
dark side, light side battle,

192
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,360
because we'll probably have these things where we're like,

193
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,000
we saw a video and that didn't look very good.

194
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And then you can use your lightsaber of optimism.

195
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,920
We are first order.

196
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,840
Today we are first order.

197
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,680
And you are resistance to use the newer terms.

198
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,600
Well, again, A, I have experience with this

199
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,880
from the Halcyon and B,

200
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,200
I feel like the dramatic question of this podcast

201
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,400
and that was, can I convince you

202
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
to take a voyage on the Halcyon?

203
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,600
I think that, and that's not, I'm not saying it's my goal.

204
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,840
I'm just wondering if it's at all possible.

205
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,200
And it doesn't have to be,

206
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,840
if that's not gonna disappoint me,

207
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,120
if it disappoints the listeners,

208
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,880
there's nothing I can do about that.

209
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,600
But this is big.

210
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,440
Wow, this is.

211
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,840
And I have to say to be the representative,

212
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,680
I said this in my email to you,

213
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,840
but to be the representative of the Galactic Star Cruiser

214
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,760
here on podcast, The Ride in Perpetuity

215
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,280
is very meaningful to me.

216
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,360
So thank you for having me.

217
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,600
Oh, no way.

218
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,680
So happy to give you that honor.

219
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,800
And I think it's good too.

220
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,600
I think it's like, this'll be a different perspective

221
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,800
than we might add.

222
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,520
There's a way this could have gone like grouchier,

223
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,640
unless I'm wrong and unless like,

224
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,040
I don't know, like maybe this, was this just great?

225
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,160
And does everybody who actually did it think it was great?

226
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,840
Is all the cynicism, people who were judging it from afar,

227
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,480
and if you went on it, it was just awesome.

228
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,680
I don't think it's that all of the cynicism

229
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,920
is people judging it from afar.

230
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,680
I think there's probably two things that are happening.

231
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,320
And I could be wrong about this

232
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,200
because of my sort of bias experience.

233
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,840
But one I think is that it was a lot of people

234
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,360
who went really early and it just wasn't ready yet.

235
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,560
This is a crazy thing.

236
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,760
This is like, nobody's ever done anything like this.

237
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,240
Like by theater terms,

238
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,040
this needed a really long preview period.

239
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,000
And it is a theater show.

240
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,680
So like it did, it needed a long preview period.

241
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,680
It took time to get its C or otherwise space legs.

242
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,120
And by the time that I'd gotten there,

243
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,680
I mean, it was really, really great.

244
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,960
In terms of the actors and the actual running of the thing,

245
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,240
it was so solid.

246
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,240
And then secondarily, I think if you're expecting

247
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,280
relaxing in any way vacation,

248
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,880
A, I don't know why you would go to Walt Disney World

249
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,240
in the first place,

250
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,240
but B, you definitely did not have a good time on that scene.

251
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,760
There's no relaxing to be done.

252
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,680
It's not like an actual,

253
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,640
there's so much of it that is reminiscent

254
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,120
of an actual cruise except for ever being relaxed

255
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,160
for like a single moment in time.

256
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,320
And so if you go and you're not prepared

257
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,680
to just keep saying yes to everything,

258
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,320
like an improv comedian,

259
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,000
but also somebody who's like wanting the immersion,

260
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,040
then don't do the immersive experience

261
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,600
if you don't want to be immersed.

262
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,080
And I think that people were not prepared

263
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,280
for just how much immersion there was going to be.

264
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,120
Gotcha.

265
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,920
Could I take your temperature,

266
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,400
your Star Wars fandom before going onto this thing?

267
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,240
What is it?

268
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,440
What are your movies?

269
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,520
Who are your guys as far as your characters?

270
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,600
Just in general.

271
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,800
It's pretty significant.

272
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,680
I'll say that when I was in eighth grade,

273
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,880
I wrote with my very good friend at the time,

274
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,400
a Star Wars, A New Hope parody musical.

275
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,600
It was an all of a new hope.

276
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,760
It was a full musical.

277
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,520
We staged it then.

278
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,280
It did not go very well.

279
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,280
And so then years later,

280
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,320
we didn't change a word of it

281
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,200
and we handed it to professional Broadway actors

282
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,400
and we did it at 54 Below

283
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,240
because I just wanted to do my Star Wars.

284
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,080
Wow.

285
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,400
So this is like, it is a very significant thing for me.

286
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,640
It's not as significant as most.

287
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,880
I should clarify before I'm tested,

288
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,800
I'm not like Clone Wars.

289
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,080
The Clone Wars I have attempted

290
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,840
to dip my toe in too many times.

291
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,440
And I bet if I had,

292
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,360
then I'd have a lot more background for this experience,

293
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,600
even not that I didn't have enough.

294
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,440
And in fact,

295
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,720
like you don't really need that much Star Wars background,

296
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,760
but it's more definitely more so like the central films

297
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,680
and like the day I've watched most of the Disney plus shows

298
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,800
since, but the cartoons,

299
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,120
I never really was able to get into myself, but yeah,

300
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,200
it was really huge for me growing up,

301
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,400
continues to be really huge for me.

302
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,960
It always made me feel like I was sort of a part

303
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,600
of something larger than myself.

304
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,920
And in terms of what are my movies,

305
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,720
my favorites have always sort of like pivoted

306
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,800
between five and six,

307
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,000
but I'll watch any of the prequels any day.

308
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,840
I really will.

309
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,680
Yeah.

310
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,920
Do you have a favorite non-Anakin pod racer?

311
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,720
Is that too aggressive of a question?

312
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,120
Is it Sebulba?

313
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,400
I mean, I like to think about Sebulba as an idea.

314
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,240
Okay.

315
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,800
Cause I'm like, wow, so many people had to approve Sebulba.

316
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,920
You know, like a lot of people had to be okay

317
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,440
with Sebulba being on screen.

318
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,280
That's true.

319
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,200
I'm pretty fascinated with him as a concept

320
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,040
more than a character.

321
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,640
I think Watto resonates with me.

322
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,480
Of course.

323
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,560
Definitely. He's not a pod racer, of course,

324
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,880
but from that sort of a taste of Star Wars.

325
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,720
That era, yeah.

326
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,560
Watto's big.

327
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,520
Yeah. Sure.

328
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,560
Can I ask a question?

329
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,080
Cause you mentioned 54 Below.

330
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,560
You did a show there called Park Map.

331
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,040
Could you talk about that and your parks experience?

332
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,920
Yeah, absolutely.

333
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,160
And I'm thankful that you asked

334
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,680
because I do have to speak for my own credits here.

335
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,400
I have this show called Park Map

336
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,480
that I did two summers in a row.

337
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,120
And I do plan on doing it again,

338
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,720
which is basically my one man Disney adult musical manifesto.

339
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,840
It's like a defense of Disney adults,

340
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,760
but also an examination of said Disney adults.

341
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,600
And I sing some Disney songs, I sing some original songs,

342
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,600
and I talk about just sort of my relationship to the parks,

343
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,800
the idea of being and becoming a Disney adult

344
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,800
and the sort of desire for permanence

345
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,440
and clinging to nostalgia that that comes with.

346
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,200
But also, yes, I have like,

347
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,920
maybe not the most encyclopedic

348
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,480
that you've had on this podcast,

349
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,720
but like near encyclopedic knowledge of the parks.

350
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,000
One of the things I do in that show is

351
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,520
people, when they're walking in,

352
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,440
they write down names of attractions on their little,

353
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,720
on like little piece of paper,

354
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,120
and they put them in a Boba Fett Stein.

355
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,960
And at three points in the show,

356
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,640
I pull one out and I have 45 seconds

357
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,960
to tell you the history of it.

358
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,680
And I've done so almost entirely without fail.

359
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,760
I'm very proud of that.

360
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,600
That's one of my,

361
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,520
it's probably my biggest accomplishment.

362
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,920
Would you, could we put you on the spot real quick?

363
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,760
Would that be crazy?

364
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,880
You could try, it's really scary.

365
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,880
It's terrifying, but yeah, you could.

366
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,400
I'm scared of specifically what you'll ask me.

367
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,200
I don't know that we, I don't have to go hard.

368
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,240
I don't, I'm just interested in.

369
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,880
Do you have any walls to put up or like,

370
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,120
just generally Walt Disney World itself or?

371
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,440
Not necessarily.

372
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,840
No, I mean, I definitely am probably like,

373
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,600
not as thoroughly versed in the international parks,

374
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,320
but I'm still pretty well versed.

375
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,160
Wow, okay.

376
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,520
I mean, I don't want, yeah, I'm not trying to stump you.

377
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,360
I'm just interested.

378
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,200
You can, I mean, I'm in.

379
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,560
If I said Horizons.

380
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,880
Horizons is one of the toughest ones actually for me.

381
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,720
Oh my God.

382
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,800
Because I missed the boat so much.

383
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,720
So that was like, nobody's ever put in Horizons

384
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,560
and I'm thankful for that.

385
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,400
But I can talk about the pavilion as a whole,

386
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,240
how it's become. Sure.

387
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,440
The Pavilion and now the Play Pavilion,

388
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,080
if I'm not mistaken about this,

389
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,800
then it wasn't something else.

390
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,960
But I think that this is right.

391
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,320
Horizons I missed the boat on.

392
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,040
But I would, if I was given that one,

393
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,400
I would talk more about Epcot as a whole and how like.

394
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,400
Right, sure.

395
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,240
It went from Walt Disney wanting it

396
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,600
to be a community of tomorrow

397
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,840
and turn like an actual like urban community.

398
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,720
And you want to be an urban planner

399
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,000
and turn it to like an edutainment central.

400
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,480
And now people are mad that it isn't edutainment anymore

401
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,640
and that it's actually fun.

402
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,400
And this is always the battle.

403
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,920
Yes, on every new announce.

404
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,200
Well, it seems like a good read, but is it Epcot?

405
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,480
Yeah, Epcot was never Epcot.

406
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,680
Like people don't live there.

407
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,400
So it's not Epcot, it doesn't count.

408
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,640
That's true, yeah, yeah.

409
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,160
But anyway, I guess if it's one I don't know,

410
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,960
I can bullshit my way out of it exactly as I just did.

411
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,800
That makes sense.

412
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,240
Look, that's improv suggestion.

413
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,200
Like you don't have to have to say about the word.

414
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,440
You can turn it into another.

415
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,640
Wait, I'm trying to think though, what is it?

416
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,040
Here, wait, I'm going to give you an easy one

417
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,600
because this was said in an email already,

418
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,400
an email exchange between us, Disney Quest.

419
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,240
That's right.

420
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,120
I was really hoping, that was my first sort of inclination

421
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,680
was to come on here and talk about Disney Quest

422
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,000
because I am one of the very few,

423
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,640
I think perhaps ever in history,

424
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,320
that like every year when my family would go to the parks,

425
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,200
we would do like a full Disney Quest day.

426
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,040
Wow.

427
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,760
Like, I loved Disney Quest.

428
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,440
I have like mountains of cyberspace, mountain VHSs

429
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,840
and toy and like radio Disney song maker things.

430
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,640
So in terms of the history, they wanted it to be like,

431
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,840
one of their Chuck E. Cheese's,

432
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,040
they wanted it to be everywhere,

433
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,160
but now we have virtual reality in our houses.

434
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,800
Like the technology was instantly dated

435
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,280
and there was no reason to be there anymore.

436
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,160
I mean, they barely ever touched it.

437
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,280
And RIP to the NBA experience, of course.

438
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,120
Yeah, that too.

439
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,800
Oh my God, cursed spot potentially.

440
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,440
Now, wait a minute, you want to stump me with one.

441
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,640
What is the, like, okay, cyberspace mountain,

442
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,400
I assume that that means they give you a VHS

443
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,680
of you writing the thing and or.

444
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,520
That you would create.

445
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,440
Yeah, yeah.

446
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,840
Yeah, yeah.

447
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,160
But then what's the, what is the radio Disney?

448
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,360
The radio Disney song maker was this.

449
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,960
So this was all, both of those rides

450
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,880
are in the create section of Disney Quest,

451
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,800
which is where you like make things

452
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,720
and get to take them home.

453
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,480
And that's cyberspace mountain, Sid's Toy Maker.

454
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,920
There's like a painting thing.

455
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,120
I think there's an animation academy

456
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,320
and then radio Disney song maker,

457
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,520
which is you pick a sort of like template of a song,

458
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,480
like what genre you want it to be

459
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,760
and who, what kind of person you want to sing.

460
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,640
You want to sing it.

461
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,000
And then it gives you like 10 options for every line.

462
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,680
And like some of them are very sincere,

463
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,960
like love song lyrics.

464
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,800
And then some of them are like,

465
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,560
hot dogs, we're in a two two or something like that.

466
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,080
And then, and like you get to voice certain lines and stuff.

467
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,920
And then it plays the song for you.

468
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,400
And then it like shits out a CD that you get to take home.

469
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,120
And I have so many of them.

470
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,400
Wow.

471
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,800
That's a, I don't know that we covered that aspect.

472
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,320
When we did, yeah, we did an episode.

473
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,280
I never did it personally.

474
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,920
I mean, I only went there really once.

475
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,280
So yeah, Jason, you know about that?

476
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,520
No, not really.

477
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,000
I knew about Sid's Toy Make.

478
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,520
I think Matt Cardona sent us, he was there very early on

479
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,160
where you could make a physical toy, like a Frankenstein.

480
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,120
Right, right.

481
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,960
That's right.

482
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,800
A toy.

483
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,400
And that didn't last forever for sure.

484
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,640
I think basically what they did was like you design it

485
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,760
and then it like prints out like a receipt

486
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,480
of all the parts and like a little picture.

487
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,720
And then you bring it to somebody

488
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,480
and they actually make the actual toy.

489
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,400
I'm pretty sure it's how.

490
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,000
Oh, a little trick.

491
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,000
They'd be like, come back in an hour

492
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,240
and they'd like go into a room and put all the stuff together.

493
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,680
Right, it was not a 3D printer 25 years ago

494
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,520
or whenever it opened.

495
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,120
Sure, instantaneously.

496
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,960
Yeah.

497
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,520
Okay, so this whole thing was, it's interactivity

498
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,320
and make it your own, but with some rules.

499
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,160
Yeah.

500
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,560
Yeah, there's some real constraints on it, for sure.

501
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:56,560
Yeah, there is some 1996 restraints on it, for sure.

502
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,680
Which is a good creative thought exercise.

503
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,520
Make it interactive, but for 1996.

504
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,920
If you had performed one of those radio Disney songs

505
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,480
in the show, that would have really like

506
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,360
tied it all together.

507
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,400
Wow, that's a real, I mean, hey, now you're giving me ideas

508
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
for the next time we do it.

509
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,360
That very well may happen.

510
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,800
Because they have like little lyric sheets on the inside.

511
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,640
Oh wow.

512
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,800
And you're like, this is absolutely nonsense.

513
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,520
God, I gotta hear one of these.

514
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,080
That's so bizarre.

515
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,000
Well, that's maybe an interesting place

516
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,560
to compare contrast that, all right, so there's,

517
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,640
you were totally down for that.

518
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,640
That was you early on doing non-Parks stuff in Disney World

519
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,640
and like we need a whole day for this.

520
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,000
I have to do all this interactive, off the beaten path,

521
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,040
immersive stuff.

522
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:49,040
So then cut to Galactic Star Cruiser premieres last year.

523
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,440
I don't know when you went, but you must have like,

524
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,280
you must have been so excited about this,

525
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,520
just the notion of it when it was announced.

526
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,160
So there was a moment where my camera test

527
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,920
for no hard feelings was going to intersect

528
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,040
with our scheduled trip.

529
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,520
And I was like, you have to move the camera.

530
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,520
Like I cannot come to the camera test.

531
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,800
I will be in space.

532
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,600
I cannot be there.

533
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,680
Yeah, this was like, this was everything.

534
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,480
So I just, and another example of just how excited

535
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,600
I was about this is like, obviously, yes,

536
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,000
it is a pretty large chunk of change that one's got to spend

537
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,200
on the Galactic Star Cruiser.

538
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,520
And when the sort of prices were announced

539
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,120
and the rooms and like a lot of details were announced,

540
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,000
I was making this show that just came out called Foul Play,

541
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,240
which is this like immersive sort of interactive,

542
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,040
improvised murder mystery show.

543
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,720
And the cast was going to get their COVID test.

544
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,720
And this was a show that I created with a lot of them

545
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
and prices came out and one of them was like,

546
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,240
oh man, I just, I wanna go,

547
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,920
but like, who's really gonna stomach this?

548
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,920
Like who's gonna be able to pay for this?

549
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,360
And one of them was like,

550
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,880
we're giving him the money to do it right now.

551
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,360
Like that's what we're here doing is in doing the show

552
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,200
that he created, we are giving Andrew Barth Feldman

553
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,160
the money to go to the Galactic Star Cruiser

554
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,880
and that's what he's gonna use it for.

555
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,840
This is generating that capital real time.

556
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,680
Wow.

557
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,520
Geez, this is great to know that it just like,

558
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,720
and projects you do go straight into that

559
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,000
and that it would potentially conflict it

560
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,760
with you getting this great role.

561
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,480
I'm so glad you could reschedule.

562
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,320
It wasn't, you didn't have to choose.

563
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,320
It was like, I can't tell you how much I like thanked

564
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,680
everyone and told them exactly what I was doing.

565
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,760
Like there was a day on set where I was talking

566
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,800
to Gene Stabinski, our incredible director

567
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
and John Phillips who wrote it with him,

568
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,080
No Hard Feelings saying like,

569
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,840
just I started talking about it and I couldn't stop.

570
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,440
And then we had to go film and they watched me,

571
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,480
walk away from this conversation because we were filming

572
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,840
and turn to my co-star of this scene and be like,

573
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,400
have you heard of the Galactic Star Cruiser?

574
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,320
Like to start a new conversation about it

575
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,200
as we were getting ready to film

576
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,400
because I wasn't ready to stop talking about it.

577
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,640
Like this is like, and this was months later too.

578
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,160
This is all I think about.

579
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,160
He seems a little distant.

580
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,880
I don't know, he seems a little not in the moment.

581
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,560
He's talking about this, some spaceship all the time.

582
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,080
Is there any alien on the Star Cruiser that if you needed

583
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,240
them to like just run some lines with you

584
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,440
and put yourself on tape that it would have been possible

585
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,440
or is that not probably in their book?

586
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,320
They don't let them do that probably.

587
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm sure they don't let them do that,

588
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,400
but honestly like 100% that would happen.

589
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,320
So I've since this voyage, like these actors,

590
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,640
they really are like, we're standing there

591
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,280
and I was there with my friend Alex Boniello

592
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,040
who was in Dear Evan Hansen with me

593
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,200
and we're doing this thing and we're in these intimate

594
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,680
moments with these actors and we're like,

595
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,400
I think these are the greatest actors in the world.

596
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,120
I think these are my new favorite actors.

597
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,280
And so I've since, I've messaged a couple of them

598
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,360
on Instagram and we have like little text exchanges now

599
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,560
because they're so really brilliant.

600
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,080
Geez, you've made Star Cruiser friends.

601
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,920
That's incredible.

602
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,240
It's not an easy acting job to be in character

603
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,080
for 12 hours a day, eight hours, whatever it is.

604
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,920
Oh my God.

605
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,120
Not to mention like remembering everybody's names.

606
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,560
All right, yeah.

607
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,160
Three quarters of which are real

608
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,080
and one quarter of which are made up.

609
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,560
I could go and be like, I'm Batman

610
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,800
and they'd be like, well Batman, welcome to the house.

611
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
They have to do it.

612
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,640
It's crazy.

613
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,760
That's wow, that's almost like a school teacher skill

614
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,440
or a substitute teacher who has to come in

615
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,000
and remember everyone's names.

616
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,840
Yeah, 100%.

617
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,920
Like they're only gonna spend a day with,

618
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,760
they're two days.

619
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,600
Yeah.

620
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,520
Oh geez.

621
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,520
Okay, so friend group is on board, which seems essential.

622
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,360
It seems like you gotta go with people, I think,

623
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,840
to make this work.

624
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,240
So, but then how do you, like, everybody is down.

625
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,720
Is it tough to schedule?

626
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,200
Like, or are you going with like gung ho,

627
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,120
cannot wait to do this any day, any time?

628
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,000
That's right, yeah.

629
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,320
You gotta go with the people who are gonna say yes.

630
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,640
It's the same thing.

631
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,120
And these were people who were like,

632
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,920
it was Alex who's a big Star Wars fan,

633
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,520
a big fan of this sort of thing.

634
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,360
My brother, Matt, who's like on the same level with me

635
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,080
of the parks we've been going together our entire lives.

636
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,520
And my friend Julia, who's a huge, specifically,

637
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,520
Star Wars fan, but a little less eager to like engage.

638
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,120
And so to watch her open up and like accept the thing,

639
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,680
she kind of became the star of the journey

640
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,880
because she followed the first order.

641
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,640
I'm sure we'll get into all of this.

642
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,800
She like became fully a bad guy.

643
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,080
So yeah, no, you have to go with people who are like,

644
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:40,080
yes, I'm carving out three days of my life

645
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,720
to be in space with you, 100%.

646
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,800
You, on your YouTube channel,

647
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,600
I'm assuming it's your channel.

648
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,440
It is, yeah.

649
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,680
You guys kind of made like a little video diary

650
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,360
of your experience.

651
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,760
And all of you seemed pretty all in on it.

652
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,600
Yeah.

653
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,680
Although going about it in very different ways.

654
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,760
I like that you picked fictional names,

655
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,520
that you gave yourself character names

656
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,000
and pretty much stuck with it.

657
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,920
Yeah, yeah.

658
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,160
I mean, yeah, 100%.

659
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,600
I think that's the move.

660
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,840
You come up with a character name,

661
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,120
you come up with a backstory,

662
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,600
but you don't have to go all the way into like,

663
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,120
like I was still myself,

664
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,360
but my desires were gone dream weavers.

665
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,200
Sure.

666
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,880
That was the idea.

667
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,000
I had, if you see at the beginning of the vlog,

668
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,240
I had like a mustache and I was doing this voice

669
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,360
and I thought this was the guy

670
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,680
I was gonna be the whole time.

671
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,160
But it was way too like engrossing for me

672
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,720
to sacrifice my own like genuine enjoyment of the thing

673
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,200
to put something on.

674
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,160
Oh, it wouldn't allow you to just like laugh with glee.

675
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,480
Yeah, exactly.

676
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,680
Exactly, exactly.

677
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,720
I had to still be myself,

678
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,800
but within the truth and the stakes

679
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,640
of the Galactic Star Cruiser.

680
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,040
And so, sorry, okay.

681
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,880
Gorn Dreamweaver.

682
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,760
Gorn Dreamweaver.

683
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,680
He's a Gorgmonger from the planet Glorandor,

684
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:12,080
which is a carpet planet, which doesn't exist.

685
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,360
Whoa, whoa, wait.

686
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,160
So the consistency, like everywhere you step is just the-

687
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,000
That's great.

688
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,520
Feels physically like carpet.

689
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,360
Oh my God.

690
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,880
This is one of my biggest complaints about those sequels

691
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,400
is that most of them are on a sand planet.

692
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,960
This is the kind of creativity I was looking for

693
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,400
in those movies.

694
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,240
That's perfect.

695
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,680
Yeah, I mean, and hey, you get to bring it

696
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,480
to the Galactic Star Cruiser yourself.

697
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,600
It's your chance to rewrite history to make it right.

698
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,800
Now, can I ask, do they own your intellectual property

699
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,240
that you created because you set it to people

700
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,880
on Disney grounds?

701
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,960
Oh, that's a great, I would be okay with that.

702
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,080
Like if I open a Star Wars dictionary next year

703
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,000
and I see Gorn Dreamweaver,

704
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,520
I would die right then and there.

705
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,480
I'd be beside myself.

706
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,320
So yeah, I sell it.

707
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,760
I'd give it to them for free, absolutely.

708
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,720
Okay, great.

709
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,560
Wow, wow.

710
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,520
Okay, so I mean, let's just walk through the experience.

711
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,520
I saw that.

712
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,000
Okay, so you get to Disney World,

713
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
you pull into this weird, it's a backstage area kind of

714
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,320
and this odd, it's a building that looks like the,

715
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,680
it's sort of the port that's gonna take you

716
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,520
Yeah.

717
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,080
up to the Star Cruiser.

718
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,760
I found it in just an odd detail

719
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,280
that it's only valet parking.

720
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,200
So you have to, I mean, it's covered.

721
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,360
That's part of that, you're getting things

722
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,040
with that big price tag.

723
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,760
But I include, the parking is free,

724
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,640
but they do say bring a couple of bucks

725
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,120
if you wanna tip on the way out.

726
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,360
Make sure you retain your Earth money.

727
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,800
Credits, yeah.

728
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,040
Don't convert them to credits and then,

729
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,880
just remember to convert them back.

730
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,480
And then not be able to tip the valet on Earth.

731
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,320
Yeah, yeah.

732
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,160
Yeah, yeah.

733
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,400
I probably would not appreciate credits.

734
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,240
Okay, that's true.

735
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,400
And the exchange rate these days, just awful.

736
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,600
Yeah.

737
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,440
Yeah.

738
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,080
So, but you get, like, what is what,

739
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,680
and I know that there's some like transport,

740
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,040
elevator kind of thing, but is there anything

741
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,520
you wanna tell us about just like the easing

742
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,000
into the process?

743
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,040
Yeah, absolutely.

744
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,880
I mean, one of the biggest immediate surprises

745
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,120
was that there's like a line of cast members

746
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,360
standing in front of the space station,

747
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,880
like waving at you.

748
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,120
Like they're like waving and they're like,

749
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,720
you walk up to one of them to check in

750
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,880
on like an iPad and they like have all your information.

751
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,840
They give you a special magic band and all this stuff.

752
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,640
And they give you like water and stuff.

753
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,160
So right away, it's like, we're here on this weird thing

754
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,520
and we're not pretending that it's not a weird thing.

755
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,680
So that was like a big shock.

756
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,640
But then, yeah, you walk in, you watch a little video

757
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,120
that's like, this is a fake alarm and this is a real alarm.

758
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,200
That was kind of the big thing

759
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,080
because there's some fake alarms that go off

760
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,480
during the voyage.

761
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,440
And they're like, this is what the real alarm

762
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,640
is gonna sound like.

763
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,160
Which is like a voice that's going like,

764
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,760
this is a real alarm.

765
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,520
Like it's very clear.

766
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,000
It's not C-3PO saying it though to be more confusing.

767
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,800
Yeah, no, it's like, it sounds like very decidedly

768
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,920
not Star Wars.

769
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,200
And I will say, and this is not in the vlog,

770
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,920
it did happen during our journey.

771
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,480
Somebody I think did pull the fire alarm.

772
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,040
It was depressing.

773
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,680
Like obviously it was nobody's fault,

774
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,120
but like to be in the middle of it

775
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,800
and like really be buying in and then be like touching grass

776
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,120
was devastating.

777
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,960
Oh man.

778
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,760
Oh you like to go outside, oh my God.

779
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,760
Oh yeah, that's like getting yanked out of the matrix.

780
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,840
For real, that's exactly what it was.

781
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,000
We were so sad.

782
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,640
We were like, what if we have to go home right now?

783
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,880
Like what if there's a real thing that happened?

784
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,440
Then we all went in and they were like right away,

785
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,040
and this is all, I'm jumping around a lot,

786
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,840
but right away the sort of like Lenka Mock,

787
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,520
who was the character, the assistant captain of the ship,

788
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:50,360
was like, what a weird detour to Coruscant.

789
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,840
Like they were like right back in.

790
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,480
Well, I like that, yeah.

791
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:54,880
That was great.

792
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,040
I literally like, we almost applauded at that.

793
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,400
Like yes.

794
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,440
Coruscant looks a lot like Orlando.

795
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,760
Yeah, yeah.

796
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,600
Similar humidity.

797
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,160
Anyway, then you go to, yeah, then you watch that video,

798
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,480
you go into an elevator which has screens,

799
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,280
much like Disney Quest actually,

800
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,520
of like, you know, like you're like a little pod

801
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,520
that's like floating up to the Halcyon,

802
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,080
and then the elevator doors open,

803
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,240
and you have the view of the main lobby

804
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,160
and there is a real like, oh my God,

805
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,280
I'm in space right now.

806
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,880
Like there is a real bodily moment of where am I?

807
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,960
What is going on?

808
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,800
There are cast members there who like are like

809
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,440
already in character and they're like,

810
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,400
let me show you around the,

811
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,240
like they'll bring different groups around

812
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,000
to show them around the ship and all the different rooms.

813
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,200
And so right away we saw everything,

814
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,360
we were taken to our room,

815
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,640
and this is like, yeah,

816
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,760
a broad strokes overview of all of these things.

817
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,000
I mean, I think one of the big things to talk about

818
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,080
is the climate simulator, which is just outside,

819
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,920
but they're like, because our excursion is on Batu,

820
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,840
this is what the weather,

821
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,960
this is a room that will show you

822
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,320
what the weather is like on Batu,

823
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,920
which is just like a very well themed way of saying,

824
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,520
you can go outside, this is where you can go outside.

825
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,680
Little outdoor cove.

826
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,800
If you freak out, if you get claustrophobic

827
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,400
and have a meltdown.

828
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,040
Go to the climate simulator.

829
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,680
And like sometimes the Saja, which are like Jedi light,

830
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,640
because they can't have Jedi,

831
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,640
because this is like a post Jedi world or whatever.

832
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,840
They'll like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

833
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,280
Well, we're squarely, much like Galaxy's Edge,

834
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,280
in between episodes eight and nine.

835
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,080
Everybody's favorite part of Star Wars.

836
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,880
There's nine people left on the Alliance,

837
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,400
or the good guys, basically.

838
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,240
Yeah, that's right.

839
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,200
It's very, very sparse.

840
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,000
Yeah, but the thing I don't know is whether,

841
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,400
I don't know where in that timeline we are

842
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,600
in terms of have the dead spoken or not.

843
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,440
They have not spoken yet.

844
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,000
Well, hold on, hold on.

845
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,120
Or have they?

846
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,320
It seems like before.

847
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,160
I think the dead have not spoken.

848
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,000
I think it's before, yeah.

849
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,520
It's before, yeah.

850
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,360
I think that's right.

851
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,440
It doesn't really come up all that much.

852
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,280
It's not important to this story.

853
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,120
Palpatine is not involved.

854
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,560
Very important to the story of nine,

855
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,680
but not important here.

856
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,880
Right.

857
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,920
And the other big thing I have to mention

858
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,040
from this moment in time is that when you go to the room,

859
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,320
which everybody's seen the room,

860
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,680
it really does, you're like, I am in space.

861
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,920
This is space.

862
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,280
There's like a little screen.

863
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,720
I don't see people talking about this

864
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,800
as much as they should.

865
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:24,800
That is like basically Alexa, but it's not at all.

866
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,520
It's a droid that is like, I'm your droid

867
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,840
that is here to serve you.

868
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,520
What do you want to do on your journey?

869
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,160
And you're like, go on adventures.

870
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,680
And they're like, I love adventurous passengers.

871
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,680
And you're like, what the fuck?

872
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,760
And then like, you have all these interactions

873
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,920
with the droid and the droid gives you little missions

874
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,560
and then Julia Hoop, who is character was named

875
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,280
Esperanza Mitsubishi.

876
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,360
Oh wow.

877
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,160
She who turned to the first order killed our room droid.

878
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,000
What?

879
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,280
You can do that?

880
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,960
Yeah, you can like use your credentials or whatever

881
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,440
to like hack into the room droid thing

882
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,960
and like send the stormtroopers there and like take her away.

883
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,440
And then at the end it was revealed

884
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,040
that she defeated the stormtroopers,

885
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,440
which was pretty exciting, but we like couldn't access her

886
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,760
for like a couple hours.

887
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,600
Whoa.

888
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,560
And then it was like, she's been powered down.

889
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,360
Like it was, it's crazy.

890
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,200
Wow.

891
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,560
And could she like send the, can you be like,

892
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,920
we need more towels?

893
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,760
Could she do that?

894
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,040
I don't think she, I don't think she served

895
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,800
any actual practical purpose.

896
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,520
Okay. She's just part of the story.

897
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,760
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

898
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,720
And also again, like there are not that many cabins here.

899
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,000
Everybody's pretty close to the lobby where this stuff is.

900
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,760
So I wonder if she could, I don't think so.

901
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,880
I'm pretty sure that's not right.

902
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,000
I think you still have to like call or whatever.

903
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,080
Maybe not, maybe I'm wrong.

904
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,400
Maybe we just didn't use her for that.

905
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,600
It's like we were never in the room besides the talk.

906
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,040
Didn't need towels, never came up.

907
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,320
Yeah.

908
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,400
This, that gives me, the proximity to the lobby

909
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,120
just reminds me of just a question I had.

910
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,160
And I don't know if you know the answer,

911
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,080
cause maybe you didn't do this.

912
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,520
I've just been curious, what happens if you go out

913
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,240
into the main, into the lobby at three in the morning?

914
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,280
What's going on if you're just in the middle of the night

915
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,520
when probably not a lot of story is happening?

916
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,440
Do you have any idea?

917
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,680
You're in space still.

918
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,600
Like there's like, there's screens in the lobby

919
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,160
that are like, this is space.

920
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,040
The lights are dim.

921
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,480
We did, we did do this like after stuff was happening.

922
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,800
I think the bar's open pretty late.

923
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,440
I feel like there was one night it was open

924
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,000
till like 2 a.m. or something.

925
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,160
Wow, pretty good.

926
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,160
And so you could go there, you could place a box.

927
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,680
You could order some drinks and get some,

928
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,800
get some bar snacks.

929
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,640
And there's also like a-

930
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,600
Kind of like a desolate late night spaceship.

931
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

932
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,120
I might play it late.

933
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,880
Scott is gonna sleep during the day

934
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,520
and wake up around 10 p.m.

935
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,600
Skip admissions.

936
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,440
And then I just sit solo in the climate simulator.

937
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,640
Just have a moment to myself.

938
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,200
I think the climate simulator is also open pretty late.

939
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,440
Like if you need to get some air late at night,

940
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,560
you can, I'm pretty sure one of my friends

941
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,960
like went out to the climate simulator,

942
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,760
took a call and said it was extremely peaceful.

943
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,720
And there's also like a water, like you can go,

944
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,920
there's like a big water pump, I guess,

945
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,480
that you can go and get like water in the main lobby.

946
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,720
That's the main reason to go to the lobby.

947
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,000
Okay, okay.

948
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,200
So refreshments.

949
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,040
Yeah, that's good.

950
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,960
A game, something to do.

951
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,440
Okay, interesting, interesting.

952
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,360
These rooms, I'm so curious about

953
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,840
because I think a lot was made out of,

954
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,360
I feel like it seemed to me like photos

955
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,480
make you think these are claustrophobic rooms,

956
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,360
but then people who did it seem to say it's not so bad.

957
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,360
Where did you land on these rooms?

958
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,200
I agree.

959
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,560
I mean, it was pretty comfortable.

960
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,240
For four of us, it was like two of us in one bed

961
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,680
and then each of us had a bunk bed.

962
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,200
And like, that's not like the number one,

963
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,880
most ideal sleeping situation.

964
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,000
But again, like everything was comfortable.

965
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,280
It's fun to be in space and you're not here to relax.

966
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,200
Like by the time you get to bed,

967
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,920
you are so tired from interacting with these people

968
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,800
that like it is comfortable and it is like,

969
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,880
it still feels like you're part of the story.

970
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,800
I think night one, we like turned off the space viewfinder

971
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,960
in our room and night two, we left it on.

972
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,000
We were like, we can't, we have to cling to,

973
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,840
we have to cling to our final.

974
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,000
That's like kids like sleeping in the tent with like,

975
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,840
Oh yeah.

976
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,920
With some mobile like flashing lights or so.

977
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,120
Wow, you kept the space on all night.

978
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,280
Did you do the bunk? Yeah, that's right.

979
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,400
Were you in the bunk or in the bed?

980
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,360
I was in the bed.

981
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,920
Alex and Julia claimed the bunks pretty early on

982
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,400
and my brother Matt and I shared a bed.

983
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,240
Gotcha.

984
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,560
And that was fine for all of us.

985
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,720
Could a man that's six, three fit in one of the bunks?

986
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,440
I mean, listen, I'm not the authority here,

987
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,560
but I would imagine so.

988
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,360
They're pretty long, they're comfortable.

989
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,360
Like everyone was really excited to sleep in the bunk beds.

990
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,480
Actually, like again, if you're exactly right,

991
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,160
it feels like camp and like that is kind of part of the charm

992
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,280
of it, I think.

993
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,920
You're being told and like being part of

994
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,200
a really wonderful story at every second of the day.

995
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,920
Like they slip notes under your door and they're like,

996
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,440
we're sorry for the first order interference

997
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,600
that's happening on the ship.

998
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,000
Like you get like notes in your room, like it's crazy.

999
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,520
Yeah, I think I would try the bunk,

1000
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,960
cause look, when my daughter was born,

1001
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,000
I slept in one of the worst chairs

1002
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,400
for like two nights in a row and I'm fine, I'm fine.

1003
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,800
And I'm sure one of these bunks are much more comfortable.

1004
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,440
So I think I would go bunk.

1005
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,280
The bunks are great.

1006
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,720
I would, if I get to do it again, I'm going bunk for sure.

1007
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,560
Jason's bunk.

1008
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,480
Jason, I think you, cause you want your small spaces.

1009
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,040
I like, yeah, I like a cozy space.

1010
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1011
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,600
I don't know, I'm oddly was eyeing those bunks like,

1012
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,760
yeah, these rooms look a little small,

1013
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,840
but I think they're bunk.

1014
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,160
Yeah, maybe we're everything, this isn't all bunk.

1015
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,480
Or you would be next time.

1016
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,680
Andrew, I think you hit the nail on the head

1017
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,280
by calling it camp.

1018
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,440
Like I feel like a lot of the marketing

1019
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,360
or early views of it referred to like,

1020
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,120
oh, it's like a cruise ship on land.

1021
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,960
Yeah.

1022
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,160
But the thing about that is, you know,

1023
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,400
there's a Star Wars bar on the newest cruise ship,

1024
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,960
Disney cruise ship. Right, totally.

1025
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,480
And it seems like it's got a little bit,

1026
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,320
if you just want a little Star Wars,

1027
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,960
it's like the bar, you know, has big screens,

1028
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,680
it jumps to light speed, there's a lot of dry ice drinks.

1029
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,960
And then you can leave and then just be on a cruise.

1030
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,240
You can just go do whatever you want.

1031
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,080
Yeah, that's right.

1032
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,400
As opposed to this experience where it's like,

1033
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,360
it is all encompassing.

1034
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,600
It is a two, three day immersive theater experience.

1035
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,040
So I think camp, where it's just like, you know,

1036
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,080
when you're at camp, you're at camp, you know.

1037
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,600
That's 100% right.

1038
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,360
Yeah, I think that's a great way to put it.

1039
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,240
And might've helped them in the marketing

1040
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,200
because I know some of the marketing material

1041
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,600
started to get a little confused.

1042
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,840
Yeah, it's like Star Wars camp.

1043
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,800
Like you're at Star Wars camp for a few days.

1044
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,760
Star Wars fantasy camp.

1045
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,800
It's not rock and roll fantasy camp,

1046
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,120
which I keep getting ads for,

1047
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,960
where you can play bass with Tom Hamilton from Aerosmith

1048
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,680
or Pete Best, the original drummer of The Beatles.

1049
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,960
Are you going, Mike?

1050
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,640
This is your galactic star cruiser.

1051
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,160
It's either this rock and roll fantasy camp

1052
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,400
or galactic star cruiser.

1053
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,520
And I think they're probably similar prices.

1054
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,360
No slight to Pete Best.

1055
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,560
I did not know he was still with us.

1056
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,400
Absolutely he is.

1057
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,600
You didn't know either?

1058
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,440
I don't think I knew that either.

1059
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,280
Yeah, yeah.

1060
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,080
I didn't know Pete Best was still alive.

1061
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,080
Guys, he's still rocking.

1062
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,200
No shade, no shade to Pete Best.

1063
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,840
So their ads should be rock and roll fantasy camp,

1064
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,880
the best way to discover that Pete Best is still alive.

1065
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,000
Yes.

1066
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,600
He's one of the, I think he's the top guy, Billed.

1067
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,440
Pete Best is.

1068
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,320
I mean, honestly, I'm like, yeah,

1069
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,200
I kind of want to go to rock and roll fantasy camp

1070
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,040
with Pete Best.

1071
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,960
That sounds awesome.

1072
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,120
Yeah.

1073
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,520
Yes, it's like camp emotionally

1074
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,320
and how engrossing it is it's camp

1075
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,920
in terms of like your brain really does kind of think of it

1076
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,320
as a cruise.

1077
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,360
Like when we did the excursion to Batuu,

1078
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,600
we kept saying in total earnest

1079
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,080
and without thinking about it,

1080
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,000
we should probably get back to the ship soon.

1081
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,720
And like all of the big story moments

1082
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,880
are kind of veiled in like cruise activities.

1083
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,360
Like they'll be like, let's play this,

1084
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,040
like we're going to teach you this game on the bridge.

1085
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,680
Everybody come to the bridge, learn this game.

1086
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,600
And then like Chewbacca shows up and it's like,

1087
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,320
oh my God, that's a huge story moment.

1088
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,680
So that's the way that they get you

1089
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,920
to all these different places.

1090
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,440
But of course not everybody goes to all of those things.

1091
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,560
So different people get different points of the story

1092
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:23,000
and like it's a pretty smart way to like engineer people

1093
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,360
toward being in the right place at the right time.

1094
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,200
Right. Wow.

1095
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,120
And had you done Galaxy's Edge prior to this?

1096
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,520
I had, and that's another thing that I think about a lot

1097
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,520
is how incredible it would be if it was my first time there

1098
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,120
as part of the Star Cruiser,

1099
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:44,200
because they really do a like deeply impressive job

1100
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,520
justifying both of the rides

1101
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,120
within the story of the Galactic Star Cruiser.

1102
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,800
Like it is your mission to do the things

1103
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,760
that those rides are asking you to do.

1104
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,960
And we were talking about it.

1105
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,080
Like we had all done rides of the resistance

1106
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,800
a number of times, but the thought of that being like

1107
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,040
the first time in your story as a passenger

1108
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,080
on the Galactic Star Cruiser that you see Kylo Ren

1109
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,800
or that like you like this crazy thing is happening to you

1110
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,680
and you were just on the house yet.

1111
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,120
Like, and they really do make a whole thing out of it

1112
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,320
when you get back that like, oh, there were like,

1113
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,280
it's part of the story.

1114
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,360
Hondo is part of the story with Smoke and Resurrect.

1115
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,960
You have to get that coaxium.

1116
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,800
That coaxium comes back later.

1117
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,640
It's wild.

1118
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,080
It almost seems like you have to do the Star Cruiser

1119
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,800
to complete the story of Galaxy's Edge.

1120
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,400
I, going back to Galaxy's Edge since the Star Cruiser

1121
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,200
which I've done a number of times, it's,

1122
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,360
I love Galaxy's Edge.

1123
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,640
I've always loved Galaxy's Edge,

1124
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,880
but in relation to how it feels in Star Cruiser,

1125
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,840
it feels empty.

1126
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:46,040
Like it really does not feel, it feels like I'm,

1127
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,160
I am on this like weird planet.

1128
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,160
We went to Ogas Cantina and we had like,

1129
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,360
we like set a password to the bartender

1130
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,440
and he gave us coasters that had QR codes

1131
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,600
that we had to scan in our app that like gave us a new thing.

1132
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,200
Like it's, if you really do feel like you're in a Star War.

1133
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,040
Yeah.

1134
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,680
Special Star Cruiser stuff at the Cantina.

1135
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,240
That's, I don't think I knew that.

1136
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,240
Yeah, everywhere.

1137
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,920
Every, and you can book it through, like you can,

1138
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,320
like when you're booking your Star Cruiser vacation

1139
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,160
or whatever, you can be like,

1140
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,640
hey, we also want to do the lightsaber.

1141
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,600
We want to do the lightsaber workshop.

1142
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,080
And because you're like, you wear a thing

1143
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,440
when you go to Batuu that like is like a Halcyon pin.

1144
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,200
And so all of the cast members know to like greet you

1145
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,360
knowing that you're part of the Halcyon

1146
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,320
to like give you the Halcyon stuff in different places

1147
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,480
that's going to help you later in your story.

1148
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,520
Like it really is a crazy,

1149
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,560
it was always meant to be these two things together,

1150
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,560
which is why it's so sort of sad.

1151
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,960
And it feels like that's the,

1152
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,120
the Star Cruiser is the place they didn't,

1153
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,640
from what we understand, we're not insiders really,

1154
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,040
but that was Star Cruiser is the only place

1155
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,120
they didn't cut like the budget

1156
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,320
on having everything be crazy immersive.

1157
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,240
I feel like Matt might be part of it or yeah,

1158
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,720
like you're describing this incredible experience.

1159
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,440
And a lot of that stuff was not,

1160
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,960
it was kind of taken out of the actual land itself.

1161
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,960
So that's the difference when you're,

1162
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,880
the difference you're feeling being there.

1163
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,920
Yeah. And I've got to say, like, I mean, I mean,

1164
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,160
cause this is such a big thing,

1165
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,640
like in talking about the price, like worth it, quote unquote

1166
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,120
is obviously such a relative thing

1167
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,720
from person to person and what you want to spend your money

1168
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,720
on what kind of money you've got.

1169
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,240
But that is how much that thing costs.

1170
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,680
Like that's just how much it costs to do the thing

1171
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,680
that the Galactic Star Cruiser is for what you're getting.

1172
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,120
If you pay that money, it is an entirely reasonable price.

1173
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:32,960
Yeah. There's a lot.

1174
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,760
I mean, there's so many performers just in general.

1175
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,680
Yeah. Like once in a lifetime,

1176
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,160
like all the, every experience on it is only happening

1177
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,840
then essentially like the way you're doing it

1178
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,640
is only happening right there to you.

1179
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,680
It's personalized.

1180
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:51,360
So that seems worth, I liked the way I was reading

1181
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,200
the touring plans, Lynn Testa's breakdown of,

1182
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,200
is it worth it?

1183
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,280
And he does a really specific breakdown of

1184
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,720
these are parts of the country and world

1185
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,800
I think that you should see before doing Galactic Star Cruiser.

1186
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,680
Like if I'm being honest, you know, make sure like Alaska

1187
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,360
is really remarkable and Hawaii, you know,

1188
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,360
maybe do this route, but, and then

1189
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,880
just assuming all of that is important to you then, then.

1190
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,720
That's good.

1191
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1192
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,840
That's reasonable.

1193
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:23,840
It is excess, you know, it's like, what do you,

1194
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,600
what do you value like emotionally and creatively?

1195
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,960
And for me, it's, I have dreams about the Galactic Star Cruiser.

1196
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,960
Let me ask you this question.

1197
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,400
And now you're talking to an older man who feels like

1198
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,560
there's a little bit of a lack of some of his friends

1199
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,120
on the ship.

1200
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,560
A hypothetical older man, this could be any older man.

1201
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,000
Not necessarily you.

1202
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,200
And a cooler older guy, like a guy who you wouldn't

1203
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,520
really know he's an older guy.

1204
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,920
Oh, I just assumed cool as soon as you mentioned this.

1205
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1206
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,960
Sorry, I sounded cool before you.

1207
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,960
And a guy who you'd hear his voice, you're like,

1208
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,800
ah, gotta be mid twenties or so.

1209
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,280
But when he sees videos of some of it and he's like,

1210
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,120
I am missing visually some of my friends.

1211
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,200
I don't want the sequel characters to go away or anything.

1212
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,560
I just, where are my people?

1213
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,600
Like, and you're saying you're like five or six.

1214
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,400
He's really well just now that he doesn't want

1215
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,240
the sequel characters.

1216
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,080
Well, I've been very consistent.

1217
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,000
The cool guy has been consistent.

1218
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,920
He doesn't want the sequel characters to go away

1219
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,840
from Galaxy's Edge.

1220
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,440
He just wants some of his friends.

1221
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,640
That's all he wants.

1222
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,000
He's a cool guy.

1223
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,840
What would you?

1224
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,200
Yeah, I hear you.

1225
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,200
And I have to say that I really do think this is one

1226
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,840
of the brilliant things about the Star Cruiser

1227
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,760
because it's not about Rey and it's not about Kylo Ren.

1228
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,560
It's not about those guys.

1229
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,800
Like they make a big appearance

1230
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,760
and they're a big sort of payoff,

1231
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,920
but it's more about the like WWE phenomenon

1232
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,560
of seeing them do the thing that they do

1233
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,920
as opposed to like seeing those characters in the flesh.

1234
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:01,040
And in fact, the fact that there may be less sought

1235
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,720
after characters, I think lends to more urgency

1236
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,000
and more access.

1237
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,080
The characters that are like the sort of new made up

1238
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:14,280
characters on the Star Cruiser are so exciting

1239
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,200
because if you had a guy there dressed up as Luke Skywalker,

1240
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,720
I could look at him and I could know

1241
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,120
that that's not Luke Skywalker.

1242
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,760
But this gentleman standing in front of me

1243
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,720
and giving me one of the best pep talks of my life

1244
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,840
is Rafe Cole as far as I'm concerned.

1245
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,680
Wow.

1246
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,320
I am Gorn Dreep.

1247
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,920
Like I know that I'm Gorn Dreep.

1248
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,800
Like, you know what I mean?

1249
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,120
Like this is a story that I don't know

1250
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,000
and thus it has a place for me in it

1251
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,560
and it has a place for these spectacular actors.

1252
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,440
So I think if the thing you love about Star Wars

1253
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:50,000
is sort of like just the characters,

1254
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,360
then no, it's probably not for you.

1255
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,440
But if it's the world and the feeling,

1256
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,160
I think this is one of the,

1257
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,840
for me and what I appreciate about Star Wars,

1258
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,440
this is like my favorite Star Wars story

1259
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,760
is that of the Galactic Star Cruiser.

1260
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,160
Is it still like, would you say,

1261
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,960
because like I honestly, I mean,

1262
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,680
from everyone I've talked to who's done it,

1263
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,520
they all like it.

1264
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,280
So like, I assume I would have a good time doing it.

1265
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,560
I'm all kidding aside.

1266
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,960
Is it almost something where like,

1267
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,960
if it wasn't even branded Star Wars,

1268
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,680
it would be just as cool?

1269
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,040
Like, is it almost just like the performers are so good

1270
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,880
and it's just the activities are so much fun.

1271
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,280
You're just like, ah, it's a cool space thing

1272
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,200
that reminds me of Star Wars.

1273
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,160
It's almost not even the point in some ways.

1274
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,280
Absolutely, 100%.

1275
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,880
I think Star Wars helps to give it that boost

1276
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,520
that of recognition.

1277
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,960
But like, if you don't know Star Wars

1278
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,920
and this is all gibberish to you,

1279
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,480
that is totally, totally okay.

1280
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,800
And in fact, I know Star Wars

1281
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,440
and I don't know a lot of the stuff

1282
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,480
that they're talking about.

1283
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,000
And that is okay because it's about this sort

1284
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,400
of isolated story.

1285
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,800
And I think that it being Star Wars

1286
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,480
probably puts a lot of pressure on it

1287
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,760
to perform like a very certain and specific way,

1288
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,200
just as everything Star Wars always has.

1289
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:04,960
There's always this precedent

1290
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,240
that people expect Star Wars to meet

1291
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,480
that it could not ever and has never met.

1292
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,320
Everything's so hyper judged,

1293
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,640
which you see with this too.

1294
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,080
If they had invented from whole cloth

1295
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:22,080
a big immersive experience that you stay in and sleep in,

1296
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,560
but that you weren't viewing under this judgmental lens.

1297
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,760
Like the Space Mountain Hotel

1298
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,080
full of original Space Mountain characters.

1299
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,200
It doesn't have nearly as much pressure

1300
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,680
as Star Wars does because all your friends

1301
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,600
don't have to be there or the version of it

1302
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,920
that you like doesn't have to be represented.

1303
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:40,760
Just one friend.

1304
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,800
Like the countdown guy, 10, nine.

1305
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,960
There's only one friend in Space Mountain.

1306
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,600
And then like somebody playing like Dick Dale

1307
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,000
playing guitar on the stage or something.

1308
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,960
You need to know where that,

1309
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,400
in the world where that sound is coming from.

1310
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,960
Yeah.

1311
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,240
I was just in London

1312
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,040
and they have a bunch of stuff like this.

1313
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,040
Like not as sort of long form as the Star Cruiser,

1314
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,280
but like things that are multiple hours long

1315
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,080
that are these immersive storytelling experiences.

1316
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,720
This thing called Phantom Peak that I didn't get to do

1317
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,760
that I'm really hoping to soon.

1318
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,480
But they know how to invest in those kinds of things.

1319
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,440
And I think it is true that this is where

1320
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,400
the future is headed.

1321
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,600
And something we were talking about during it was like,

1322
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,440
could this work with Marvel?

1323
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,760
And the answer is no, because what would I do?

1324
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,160
Would I become a superhero?

1325
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,960
I know I'm not a Marvel superhero.

1326
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,040
Like with Marvel, it is about the characters.

1327
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:30,880
And so this doesn't work.

1328
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,040
I think the reason it works for Star Wars

1329
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,680
is because as great as the characters are,

1330
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,120
it's about the world and the feeling

1331
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:41,360
and the sort of like thing that happens when Star Wars works.

1332
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:45,160
And Star Wars really works on the Star Cruiser.

1333
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,000
That makes sense.

1334
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,600
I mean, I will say this.

1335
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,000
If there was an X-Men's mansion,

1336
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,480
I could just like sleep in Wolverine's room for two nights.

1337
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,560
I would absolutely do it and love it.

1338
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,880
If I could just hang out, that'd be fine with me.

1339
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:56,720
You don't want your own room?

1340
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,400
You're playing me sleeping in Wolverine's room.

1341
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,480
I am Mike Carlson, cool older guy.

1342
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,160
And I'm sleeping in Wolverine's bed

1343
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,600
because he's away for a while.

1344
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,720
And I can just roam around, go down to the danger room,

1345
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,480
see what they're doing and go, ah, cool.

1346
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,240
And then I can go upstairs and like have a drink

1347
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,880
in Professor X's study.

1348
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,120
To be clear. I mean, that does sound pretty great.

1349
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,720
Could you, but you wouldn't want that you have your own bed

1350
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:25,240
that's only your bed and full access to Wolverine's room.

1351
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,440
You need to know that it's his bed

1352
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,760
and that he slept there, let's say within the week.

1353
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,480
Yeah, I would like to know that he was there.

1354
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,320
I mean, you could all pick.

1355
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,080
But also that he's not going to be there.

1356
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:38,320
Like you also don't, like this is a whole,

1357
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,120
an immersive Marvel X-Men experience

1358
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,640
where you're sleeping in Wolverine's bed,

1359
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,440
meaning he will not be appearing.

1360
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,400
The mansion's mostly empty.

1361
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,080
They're like fighting apocalypse overseas or something.

1362
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,400
Because if he finds an intruder in his room,

1363
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,000
you're getting those claws to your throat.

1364
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:53,840
Like, it has not.

1365
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,840
You're gonna fucking kill you.

1366
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:55,680
You won't ask any questions.

1367
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,320
Not a kill move, but at least a threat.

1368
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,160
Like who are you?

1369
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,840
Yeah, it's an empty X-Mansion.

1370
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,080
There's no interactive elements

1371
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,120
other than you can just roam through the halls

1372
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,120
and see what's going on.

1373
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,840
And you've chosen a school setting

1374
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:11,840
where there's often any number of students

1375
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,080
that they could easily go like you're a new student.

1376
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,880
Like, no, no, you're a guy.

1377
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,800
I don't want that pressure.

1378
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,720
Crashing.

1379
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,960
Yeah.

1380
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,800
I'm just an older guy.

1381
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:20,920
And there's also no alcohol.

1382
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,840
Like it's a school.

1383
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,240
You're just sleeping at the school.

1384
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,440
I mean, hey, I'm on board.

1385
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,920
We're just brainstorming here.

1386
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,040
You have to have snuck it in.

1387
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,200
It's gotta be in a flask.

1388
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,200
I snuck alcohol into this school.

1389
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,800
If you start opening drawers and secret cabinets

1390
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,400
in Wolverine's room, you're gonna find some alcohol.

1391
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,120
Yeah, that's one of the missions.

1392
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,960
Professor X has some brandies.

1393
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,800
Sure.

1394
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,720
Brandies.

1395
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,800
Oh, that's the room to go to.

1396
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,880
Hank McCoy, this beast drink, do we know?

1397
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,720
I don't know.

1398
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:53,560
Andrew, full disclosure, on that excursion day

1399
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,960
when you went to Batuu, did any of your party,

1400
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,360
did anyone cut out to go to Pizza Rizzo

1401
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:03,280
or do a quick Tower of Terror laugh, you know?

1402
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,920
Not one of us.

1403
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,720
And people on our cruise did,

1404
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,680
especially ones with little kids.

1405
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:13,200
I personally advise against it, for sure.

1406
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,040
Yeah, sure.

1407
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,560
Like I was on Batuu for the first time.

1408
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,680
I really was like, this is, I, you know,

1409
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,880
you get on the bus that feels like a transport shuttle.

1410
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,920
Like, it's a crazy thing.

1411
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,560
So no, we did not go to Pizza Rizzo.

1412
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,080
We did not go to Woody's Roundup Barbecue.

1413
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,960
We stayed in Galaxy's Edge.

1414
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,560
And it was also like a really hot day.

1415
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,680
So we were like, let's go and do our missions and then.

1416
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,520
Yeah.

1417
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,360
And get back inside.

1418
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1419
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,640
It's a simulator of a toy-themed barbecue.

1420
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,200
It's just, it's the kind of thing they would do.

1421
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,040
It's not real.

1422
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,360
Trying to in character explain like, look,

1423
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,400
this was really stupid.

1424
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,520
I know the shuttle leaves at a certain time,

1425
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:59,160
but I made a reservation for Woody's Roundup Barbecue

1426
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,040
because I knew it would launch.

1427
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:02,920
You know what you could have done?

1428
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,560
You could have gone to, we just talked about this,

1429
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,200
the 50s Primetime Cafe.

1430
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,360
You could say, well, this is where Dexter Jettster

1431
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,760
has his famous diner.

1432
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,720
I feel like that one at least could have worked

1433
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,720
as far as explanation.

1434
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,880
I guess this is the criteria is if you're gonna do

1435
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,680
anything else in Hollywood Studios,

1436
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,360
you've got to justify it in world.

1437
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,600
If you're gonna go watch Muppet Vision 3D,

1438
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,600
you've gotta be like, these are the Ewoks

1439
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,480
and Yoda's cousins and stuff.

1440
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,760
Yeah, that's good, that works.

1441
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,200
You can tell from the voice.

1442
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,360
This is somebody Yoda's related to.

1443
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,200
Right.

1444
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,040
Yeah.

1445
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,560
Star Tours is like when you go on a cruise

1446
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,800
and then you need to take another shuttle

1447
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,680
to the hiking through the woods.

1448
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:47,520
Yeah.

1449
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,040
And then you have to get back to the cruise ship.

1450
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,360
Sure, sure, sure, right.

1451
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,720
That's right, that's right.

1452
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,520
What has happened story-wise before,

1453
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,680
excuse me, it's a second day thing that you go to Batuu.

1454
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,080
Just so that we get into some of the story of it,

1455
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:08,200
like what's happened thus far at that point?

1456
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,520
What's the initial stuff that you tackle?

1457
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,440
Yeah, I mean, obviously here we go, spoilers ahead.

1458
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:19,320
The First Order has come upon the ship

1459
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:24,320
because they fear resistance sympathizers on the ship

1460
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,680
and that there may be many of them

1461
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,600
and so they're here investigating.

1462
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,520
The crew is trying to be welcoming,

1463
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,720
but there are, and also Chewbacca,

1464
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,320
I believe has arrived at this point.

1465
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,960
Chewbacca has in fact docked onto the ship.

1466
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,080
So those are kind of the big things,

1467
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:44,200
but that's like major main storyline.

1468
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:48,480
Maybe the First Order has already, this is a big spoiler,

1469
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,600
taken the central droid out of commission.

1470
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:56,320
This is a droid we're made to have great sympathy for,

1471
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:59,560
SK-620 maybe, something like that.

1472
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:04,000
And they think the droid is having secrets

1473
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,280
so they like kill the droid basically.

1474
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,920
And that's a big moment where we're meant to turn

1475
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,400
upon the First Order or not, as Julia discovered.

1476
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,560
But yeah, first day is really more tutorial

1477
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:16,400
than anything else.

1478
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,880
Like those are the big moments, but we were like,

1479
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,280
wow, this first day was amazing.

1480
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,000
How could it become any more immersive than this?

1481
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,040
And then everyone was like,

1482
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,320
so today was basically your tutorial,

1483
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,200
now you have to decide which path you're gonna take

1484
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,200
and it gets real tomorrow.

1485
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,760
And it did, it was crazy.

1486
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,000
So that's everything that's happened.

1487
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,840
I have to speak to my story particularly.

1488
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:36,680
I didn't decide going in like which,

1489
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,880
sorry, you hear the cars.

1490
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,840
I didn't decide going in like which path I was gonna take.

1491
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:46,360
You can be Resistance First Order, like Jedi basically,

1492
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,400
or like Smuggler Scoundrel.

1493
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,000
Following Gorn Dreamweaver's heart,

1494
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,040
I fell in with the scoundrels,

1495
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,960
who is this character Wraith Cole,

1496
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,840
who is Gaia, the performer on the ship.

1497
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:03,040
He's her manager.

1498
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:03,880
And he is trying to-

1499
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,680
I love that there's a space manager, right?

1500
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,520
That's great.

1501
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,760
Space pop star manager, incredible.

1502
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,160
We were pretty obsessed with the concept

1503
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,960
of somebody in Star Wars having like a manager,

1504
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,600
but it felt very like, you know,

1505
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,640
like grief Karga in the Mandalorian.

1506
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,320
Like he's like a bounty hunter manager,

1507
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,880
except for Talon and for Gaia specifically.

1508
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,320
And they're trying to make some kind of drop-off,

1509
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,160
they're trying to do this whole thing.

1510
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,720
But basically the big thing is they're trying to steal

1511
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,520
this stone from the heart of the ship.

1512
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,800
The Hyanna-Neya stone.

1513
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:39,600
And this stone is made to feel like,

1514
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,440
oh, they're scoundrels,

1515
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,440
so they're trying to steal it for money.

1516
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,600
When you get to know them,

1517
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,280
you discover that this stone was wrongfully taken

1518
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,640
from Gaia's planet.

1519
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,040
She's a Twi'lek.

1520
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,560
And it was her planet.

1521
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,280
Oh God, I can't remember what planet it's called now.

1522
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,480
But like the Hyanna-Neya stone was taken from her planet

1523
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:01,480
by like basically colonizers and used for like on the ship,

1524
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,400
on display, like maybe provide some fuel or something.

1525
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,480
And Wraith on Gaia's behalf

1526
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,080
is trying to steal the stone back.

1527
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,160
I found this cause very noble,

1528
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,160
especially since Gorn Dreamweaver's home

1529
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,560
was also perhaps under attack from the First Order.

1530
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,040
He was really worried about that.

1531
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,520
People trying to get free carpet, yeah.

1532
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,360
Exactly, yes.

1533
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,680
Spilling stuff everywhere.

1534
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,200
Mining for carpet on the,

1535
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,480
I mean, you look at the Death Star

1536
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,520
and the sort of Star Destroyers,

1537
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,520
and they're just, they need some rugs.

1538
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,920
And there's one place to get them,

1539
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,000
and it's the carpet mowers of Glorandor, of course.

1540
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,440
And they're dampening some of that sound.

1541
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,280
It's all, it's very echoey and severe in there.

1542
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,880
Yeah, yeah, they need, they could use a lot of rugs.

1543
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,560
Yeah, yeah, soften the landing when Kylo Ren's,

1544
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,560
you know, throwing people all over the place.

1545
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,120
So this has happened by this point.

1546
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,600
Now I want to skip ahead because I,

1547
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,400
this is a story that I feel is,

1548
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,560
it's urgent that it's told.

1549
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,640
This is sort of the big takeaway for me, I think.

1550
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,200
So we get to talking to Wraith Cole in person.

1551
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,600
Now there is an app component to all of this.

1552
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,240
We're not using quote unquote Wraith Cole on the app,

1553
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,560
but it's like preset responses to our preset texts

1554
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,240
that are like, I want to hang out with you,

1555
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,800
or like, no, I don't want to hang out with you.

1556
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,200
And like getting a sense.

1557
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,240
So we go up to Wraith Cole in the real world,

1558
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,400
the actor, whose picture is on the app, by the way,

1559
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,720
so we can like know who he is.

1560
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,880
And we go up to him and we're like,

1561
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,920
Wraith, we've been messaging with you.

1562
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,720
We're here for whatever you need.

1563
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,120
And it's notable that my brother Matt,

1564
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,720
his whole thing was like, I love Gaia.

1565
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,840
Going into the ship, the one thing he knew was that he,

1566
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,640
he knew that Gaia was a character,

1567
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,640
and he decided he was a big Gaia fan.

1568
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,600
So he goes up to Wraith and he's like, I love Gaia.

1569
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,280
I'm a big Gaia fan and I'll do anything for Gaia.

1570
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,680
And Wraith is like, anything?

1571
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,200
And we're like, yeah, yeah, we'll do anything.

1572
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,720
And he's like, well, then I've got an extra secret mission

1573
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,840
that's like not on your app.

1574
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,360
Like, this is like a separate thing.

1575
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,680
So they, so this is just immediately one of the instances

1576
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:55,160
of like the ship itself rewarding you

1577
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,320
for being like into it, you know what I mean?

1578
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,600
Saying yes to things.

1579
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,720
He gives us this like QR code for us to scan on our app

1580
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,240
and tells us about this stone and all this stuff.

1581
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,920
Next day we run into him again and he's like,

1582
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,360
the heist is happening tonight at 3 p.m. in the cargo bay.

1583
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,680
Don't let anybody follow you.

1584
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,120
It's gonna be a small, a small group of people.

1585
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,360
Like this was, and like we were one of the few people

1586
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,200
who was invited.

1587
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,440
A lot of other people ended up being like,

1588
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:19,640
what's going on in here?

1589
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,720
And like came in and kind of screwed everything up.

1590
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:24,960
But then he's like, we're gonna steal the stone back.

1591
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,560
We go up to the deck.

1592
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,560
So this is, this is pretty deep day two.

1593
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,160
The first thing he says, he's like, we need a distraction.

1594
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,560
And he turns to me because we've now had a few conversations.

1595
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,400
He's gotten to know me personally.

1596
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,160
And he says, this is where you come in.

1597
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:42,360
And he said, we need something lovey-dovey,

1598
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,640
maybe some vows or an engagement.

1599
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,400
And I said something that is true,

1600
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,240
which is that I am an ordained minister.

1601
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,920
I am an ordained minister in the real world,

1602
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,760
just kind of for fun.

1603
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,680
It's never been required of me.

1604
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,600
And so as a distraction to get the stone,

1605
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:00,600
I performed the renewals of vows

1606
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:04,080
of two real married couples on the ship.

1607
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:04,920
Wow.

1608
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,360
What?

1609
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,920
This is in the vlog and I stand up there

1610
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,200
and I'm like yelling like,

1611
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,160
can I have everyone's attention please?

1612
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,040
My name is Gondre Weaver

1613
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,400
from the carpet Moors of Glorandor.

1614
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:21,680
And I am here to celebrate the marriage of Jerrick and Z

1615
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,120
and Liz and Matt,

1616
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,440
because one of the couples was really into it

1617
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,280
and the other one was not.

1618
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,560
Those are regular names.

1619
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,480
And from there, all these other people

1620
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,320
and all these other kids had all these roles.

1621
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,560
And in the vlog,

1622
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,880
I think it was my brother and Alec were both recording

1623
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,000
and you could see the way that like the stone passes hands

1624
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,600
and all these different people are intercepting

1625
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:41,640
different actual characters,

1626
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,000
because like the captain couldn't see about this.

1627
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,640
So like we had to like alert Wraith

1628
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:46,600
that the captain was coming.

1629
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:50,200
Like it was like a whole involved thing

1630
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,920
that a hugely important device in it was that I was very,

1631
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,520
very loudly proclaiming the renewal of vows

1632
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,320
of these two real life couples.

1633
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,200
Wow.

1634
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,360
Which well, okay.

1635
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,480
Like a renewal, I guess it's not so important

1636
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,560
if it's binding.

1637
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,640
Like that renewal didn't count.

1638
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,360
And yet the actual ordain,

1639
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:11,000
like it feels like it had some significance.

1640
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,760
It's crazy you had that up your sleeve.

1641
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,960
Yeah, it worked out.

1642
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,400
And I think it was my brother who reminded all of us

1643
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,480
that I was ordained.

1644
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,720
And then it, yeah,

1645
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:22,600
that's the only time that's ever been useful actually.

1646
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,680
Wow, you didn't do it to get friends married.

1647
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,520
You just did it to do it.

1648
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,720
To hopefully one day get friends married.

1649
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,400
You know, like that one day I'd be asked to do that.

1650
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,280
Wow, now that's crazy.

1651
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:35,440
I wonder what like,

1652
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,640
they probably have some like prompts,

1653
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:40,640
like regular like ideas that they would give

1654
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,440
for a distraction in a normal scenario.

1655
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,880
But then they're also like,

1656
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,360
oh, if we got something on the fly here,

1657
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,360
let's just go with that.

1658
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:49,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1659
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,760
I think it's like a sort of bare bones idea

1660
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,960
for what they're gonna do.

1661
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,160
And then like let the guest kind of guide you.

1662
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,160
And a lot of things they'll do is also kind of trick you

1663
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,720
into thinking that you guided them.

1664
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,560
Like the actor who played Sammy at one point,

1665
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,960
he comes up to us and he's like,

1666
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:07,440
we need a way to get the storm troopers away

1667
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:08,280
from this thing.

1668
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:11,040
And I was like, oh, maybe, you know,

1669
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,920
like if they've got to get to the brig or something.

1670
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,760
And he was like, wait, you want to put them in the brig?

1671
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:16,600
What?

1672
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,680
And it's like, oh, that's what you need to do.

1673
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,440
And you just kind of put those words in my mouth.

1674
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,640
So like sometimes they like really need to find a way in,

1675
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:26,560
but other times there's a lot of room for like play.

1676
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:30,280
And later that day, there was another need for distraction.

1677
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,800
Like we had broken into the bridge

1678
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,000
to like get the coaxium or whatever.

1679
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,640
And we were there with Wraith Cole,

1680
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,280
because this was like this council track.

1681
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,080
And he was like, well, if we need another distraction

1682
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,120
and can't think of anything,

1683
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,480
I mean, I know my guy Gorin has got it.

1684
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:47,840
And I was like, I'm healing father issues right now

1685
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:48,680
in real time.

1686
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,920
Like this is like really happening right now.

1687
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:51,760
Wow.

1688
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:52,600
Thank you Wraith.

1689
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,440
You would be really great to hear

1690
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,440
from some of the performers,

1691
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:00,560
because I imagine you did a hell of a job performing,

1692
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,640
distracting, you knew exactly what you're doing.

1693
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,200
You're a performer.

1694
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,000
I would imagine there's some versions where they're like,

1695
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,800
and then you're going to be the one with the distractions.

1696
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,400
And someone was like walked in the corners like,

1697
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,080
hey, you motherfuckers over here.

1698
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,480
Everyone look over here.

1699
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:15,240
They're like, no, no, no, no.

1700
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,080
Not like that.

1701
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:16,900
No, no, no.

1702
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:17,840
No, he's pulling his penis out.

1703
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:18,680
God.

1704
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:19,520
You know what I mean?

1705
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,480
No, he's peeing in the corner.

1706
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:22,920
It's like somebody stop me.

1707
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,720
Put the pretzels down.

1708
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,200
Put the bowl of pretzels down.

1709
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,560
We need you.

1710
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:28,400
You know what?

1711
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,220
We got someone else.

1712
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:30,060
We're going to get someone else.

1713
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:32,080
Somebody has to have done a shitty job like that.

1714
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:32,920
Yeah.

1715
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:33,760
Yeah.

1716
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,080
This particular actor sort of later confided

1717
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:40,480
through Star Wars terminology, may I add.

1718
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:44,520
He like, we at the very end of the experience

1719
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,240
went to thank him and the actors like very much in earnest

1720
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:48,400
and we kind of said like,

1721
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,320
we know you can't break character right now

1722
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,200
and we accept that and understand,

1723
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,480
but we need you to know how much this has meant to us.

1724
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,600
And this actor in particular,

1725
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:00,640
like thanked us in return because he was like,

1726
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:04,240
it's good to know somebody who I can like really hand

1727
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,440
the reins to.

1728
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,580
Like not even like, and that was for our whole group.

1729
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:08,920
Like it was like this guy,

1730
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,400
this poor guy who is working so hard

1731
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,260
and you never see him sweat.

1732
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:16,440
He needs to, in order to us not see him sweat,

1733
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:20,120
find ways to pass the baton for even like two minutes

1734
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:24,840
and like give like holding court responsibility

1735
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:25,680
to somebody else.

1736
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:26,720
Yeah. Right.

1737
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:30,320
So that he can continue to be like full battery,

1738
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,240
you know, rating poll.

1739
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,600
And also the actress playing Lankham Mock,

1740
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,100
who I think was like, yeah, cruise director.

1741
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:38,280
Last day we did the same thing

1742
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,680
and we like thank her very earnestly.

1743
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:43,840
And she's like, just so you know, and I mean this,

1744
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:46,640
if you ever want to come work here on the Halcyon,

1745
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:47,600
there's always a place for you.

1746
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,440
Oh wow. Whoa.

1747
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:50,800
That's the ultimate compliment.

1748
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,680
That's something I carry with me every day.

1749
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,560
I'm like, I could always just go do that.

1750
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:55,840
You know, I could. You could.

1751
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:56,680
So it is possible.

1752
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:59,400
This was something we talked about on our Patreon,

1753
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:02,840
but we discussed the notion that if Jason was weird

1754
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:05,840
and rude enough at the 50s prime time cafe,

1755
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:08,760
maybe he'd get invited to play a permanent grandpa character.

1756
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,160
Invited.

1757
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,960
So I don't know if the same rules apply there,

1758
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:17,000
but at least somewhere in that Dollywood Studios area,

1759
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,080
that kind of recruitment magic is possible.

1760
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:19,920
There's a headhunter.

1761
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,880
Some of the actors are also headhunters.

1762
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:22,720
No.

1763
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:27,560
Ironically, you renewing the vows,

1764
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,800
I was at a wedding recently,

1765
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,480
and only after the fact did I learn the officiant

1766
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:36,160
was in the original cast of Galactic Stark,

1767
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,480
was one of the lieutenant crois,

1768
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,800
was one of the imperial officers.

1769
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:42,640
Was it a croi?

1770
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,680
I wonder which one, because our lieutenant croi,

1771
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:49,400
he's one of the few that I don't know his real life name,

1772
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:53,560
is like one of my top three favorite actors of all time.

1773
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:54,880
I think he's out of the game now.

1774
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,240
I think he's retired from theme park acting now.

1775
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:01,920
I think that's right, which is pretty sad for me personally.

1776
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,080
All right, so you're on this scoundrel track, correct?

1777
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:06,920
Yeah.

1778
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,120
Your friends are on others, what's going on?

1779
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:12,200
What's happening in the other, the stuff you're not seeing?

1780
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,160
That's right, we all kind of fell into our own thing.

1781
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:18,840
So Matt, my brother, was sort of on the scoundrel track

1782
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,280
with me that ended up falling into a lot of resistance stuff.

1783
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,200
And so he was really close to the main story

1784
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,760
and would be asked to like,

1785
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:28,920
you're gonna have to pass this suitcase of coaxium

1786
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,920
around to somebody else around the ship.

1787
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,360
He was part of bigger main story stuff

1788
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,240
that we weren't invited to.

1789
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,680
Because by the time day two rolls around,

1790
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,680
this computers through the app

1791
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,120
and through the different relationships

1792
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,800
have kind of figured out who's the most into it

1793
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,560
and what track you're taking.

1794
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,280
So you get invited to specific things

1795
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:50,080
and they have a list of who specifically

1796
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,040
is allowed into this room.

1797
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,120
And they won't let you in unless you're on that list

1798
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:56,560
because of you following a specific track.

1799
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:59,360
And so Matt was invited to this resistance stuff.

1800
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,960
Alex went the Jedi path.

1801
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:05,400
And he met Ray before the rest of us.

1802
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,440
Like he was in a room for like some kind of like

1803
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,280
forced training or something that was kind of a guide

1804
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,120
that it was under.

1805
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:16,720
They discovered that Luke Skywalker's holo cube,

1806
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,680
like a holo cube that was Luke Skywalker's

1807
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:21,240
was found on Batuu.

1808
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:22,080
Yes, this was a mission of his.

1809
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,800
He had to go on Batuu, find this holo cube through the app

1810
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,880
and like scan different crates and stuff.

1811
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,320
And then he's in this room and Ray comes in,

1812
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,480
they open the holo cube and apparently,

1813
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,360
and I have not seen this with my own eyes,

1814
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:37,360
actual hologram of Yoda appears and like gives advice.

1815
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:41,000
And this is something that only Alex got to see

1816
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,160
and like 10 other people that were on the voyage.

1817
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,680
Wow, that's cool.

1818
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,400
Is there a, interesting, was there a,

1819
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,040
do the other paths have anything comparable

1820
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,560
to meet a legacy character such as Yoda?

1821
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:54,400
One of your friends?

1822
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,240
Any of my friends?

1823
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,180
Yeah, no, nobody else really gets to meet

1824
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:58,400
one of your friends.

1825
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,320
Interesting.

1826
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,080
That is true.

1827
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:04,080
And in fact, Julia, who took the first order path

1828
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,400
was hoping she'd get to have a relationship with Kylo Ren,

1829
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,560
which she did not unfortunately,

1830
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:12,000
but she did have a very tight knit relationship

1831
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,440
with Lieutenant Kroy.

1832
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,560
Yeah, she was invited to like similar stuff

1833
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:18,440
is like Matt in the resistance side of things,

1834
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,720
but for the first order.

1835
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:22,480
So like Matt's team would go to the engineering room

1836
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,400
to like fix stuff and Julia's team would go

1837
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,560
to the engineering room to break stuff basically.

1838
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,040
Wow, that's fun.

1839
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,520
But she really was, there is this striking moment

1840
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,560
that I will never forget.

1841
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,160
Julia, who is the biggest Star Wars fan,

1842
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,760
but like maybe the least into this kind

1843
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:39,880
of immersive storytelling going into it.

1844
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,200
It's the very big finale.

1845
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,440
And a lot of the Galactic Star Cruiser

1846
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,840
is long and gorgeous monologues,

1847
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,920
like characters delivering these huge monologues

1848
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,880
about like their ideas about the world

1849
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,560
and like frankly race and things like that.

1850
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:58,520
Race is discussed very much on the Galactic Star Cruiser.

1851
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:01,760
And in this moment, Lieutenant Kroy is responding

1852
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,600
to a speech of the captains, which is saying like,

1853
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,000
this is a ship of good people

1854
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,340
and these people will not let evil triumph.

1855
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:10,220
And Lieutenant Kroy responds and says,

1856
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:12,940
you'll be surprised with just how many

1857
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,780
first order sympathizers there are.

1858
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:17,580
And he starts to list them by name

1859
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:19,980
and like point to all the people in the crowd

1860
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:21,100
who are first order sympathizers,

1861
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:22,700
you realize just how many of them there are.

1862
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,140
And like the third or fourth one, he says, he goes,

1863
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:29,300
Mitsubishi, who is our Julia's name.

1864
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:30,860
And we were like, she won.

1865
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:32,900
Like she won the Galactic Star Cruiser

1866
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:36,620
by having her fake name said in the big finale

1867
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:38,700
of the Galactic Star Cruiser, it was amazing.

1868
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:41,900
And earlier too, the actor playing Sammy,

1869
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:46,260
who's like one of the good guys found out

1870
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:47,540
that she was hanging out with us.

1871
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:49,180
And we were like, she's a first order sympathizer,

1872
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:50,380
she's gotta go.

1873
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:51,820
And he was like, get out of here.

1874
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:53,900
And he looks at us and he's like, was that Mitsubishi?

1875
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:55,700
The captain warned me about her.

1876
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:59,140
Like stuff like that, it really is a nuts out thing

1877
01:09:59,140 --> 01:09:59,980
that they do.

1878
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:00,820
That's great.

1879
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:02,460
Do the first order sympathizers get punished

1880
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:04,460
at the end of the experience at all or?

1881
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:07,620
No, I think there is a sense of like,

1882
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:11,060
obviously the bad guys lose.

1883
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:15,300
But there is then a sense of like, look around,

1884
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,580
these people have shared this experience.

1885
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:20,500
And then you go, it is very much like we all love each other

1886
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:21,340
and it's okay.

1887
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:25,700
And then we go to the, you all go to the bridge

1888
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:28,900
and where the screen of space was is like a video

1889
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:30,380
of fireworks basically.

1890
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:31,860
Like it's obviously it's not real fireworks,

1891
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:34,660
it's like a video of fireworks that we had bought into it

1892
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:37,340
so much by this point that we all four of us cried

1893
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:41,100
at this like video that was playing of fireworks.

1894
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:43,100
It fully worked on us.

1895
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:43,940
I could see that.

1896
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:46,660
I mean, that's such a like, you have to be,

1897
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:48,620
there's so much effort, emotional effort,

1898
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:50,980
I feel like for a few days where you're like,

1899
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:53,620
almost just like the blowing off of that

1900
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:57,100
has to have some sort of like emotional reaction point.

1901
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:57,940
Yeah.

1902
01:10:57,940 --> 01:10:59,180
Oh, absolutely.

1903
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:03,660
Okay, there's discussion of race and these big ideas

1904
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:05,940
in the experience.

1905
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:08,700
Do you feel like somewhere in the text

1906
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:10,660
and the narrative of Galactic Star Cruiser

1907
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:14,980
is the solution of how to make everything better

1908
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:16,900
in this country and world of ours?

1909
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:21,980
This was a very kind of curious thing.

1910
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:26,700
Like we're like sitting in like the big dining room

1911
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,820
on the second night and kind of the big event

1912
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:31,100
that's happening is the captain and the lieutenant

1913
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:33,540
are kind of having these dueling monologues.

1914
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,900
And you kind of see where both of them are coming from,

1915
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:37,220
the good guys and the bad guys.

1916
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:39,140
Like, and that is sort of, I think one of the big ideas

1917
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:40,580
of the Star Cruiser is it's like,

1918
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:44,300
once you boil the first order down to an ideology

1919
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,380
and not like the people who are working at the highest level,

1920
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:48,980
it's like, ah, there's something there.

1921
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:50,980
Like there are people who believe this ideology

1922
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:53,300
and would follow the first order in the real world.

1923
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:56,140
But the captain's like, says something at some point

1924
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:59,260
that's like, you know full well that I can't work

1925
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:02,460
on any other Star Cruiser because look at me.

1926
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:04,100
And we're like, oh, cause she's blue.

1927
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:06,580
Like it's cause she's blue.

1928
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:08,020
Like that's what she's talking.

1929
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:11,180
And like, they never talk about that in Star Wars.

1930
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:15,580
And so like, I think it is an effective,

1931
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:18,460
an emotional tool for empathy.

1932
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:20,460
I don't think it's like, you know,

1933
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:25,460
the end all be all of sort of like racial analysis.

1934
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:29,260
So we couldn't put some of the like worst people

1935
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:33,060
in our country or world into Galactic Star Cruiser

1936
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:36,460
then have them like learn a lesson, cry at the fireworks.

1937
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:38,540
Then they come out and they fix everything.

1938
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:41,540
They're like, we have to, we have to give, you know,

1939
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:44,260
the stone back to the people, like the proverbial stone

1940
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:46,340
back to the proverbial Twi'lex.

1941
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:48,580
Like Carlson and Ben Shapiro,

1942
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:53,580
their ways are healed after two days in the LCA.

1943
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:56,380
I like the Lieutenant Croy and now I'm different.

1944
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:57,220
I've changed.

1945
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:58,060
I'm nice now.

1946
01:12:58,060 --> 01:12:59,500
That's what they have to do with DeSantis.

1947
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,300
That's how they have to fix the DeSantis problem.

1948
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,660
Just put them on the Star Cruiser.

1949
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:05,100
The lawsuits kind of go away.

1950
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:06,220
It's going to be fine.

1951
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:07,060
Yeah.

1952
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:08,380
They have blue shrimp.

1953
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:10,380
I've never seen such a thing.

1954
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:15,020
That you knew what the human spirit was capable of.

1955
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:20,660
What have we?

1956
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:23,380
Well, let's just do basic stuff like food, drink.

1957
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:25,460
Like how was it?

1958
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:27,900
So great.

1959
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:29,540
Like genuinely good.

1960
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:33,860
And not to mention all inclusive, you know,

1961
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:37,860
like you don't pay like blue milk is so good when it's free.

1962
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:42,860
Blue milk is so, so, so good when there's a fountain

1963
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:44,060
of blue milk.

1964
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:45,900
And it's unlimited blue milk.

1965
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:47,380
Yeah, unlimited.

1966
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:51,260
They literally have like a like found blue milk fountain.

1967
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,100
Do you know that Jason?

1968
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:52,940
I did know that.

1969
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:55,100
I think that's available 24 hours.

1970
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:55,940
Is it?

1971
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:56,780
I'm pretty sure.

1972
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:57,620
Water.

1973
01:13:57,620 --> 01:13:58,460
4 a.m.

1974
01:13:58,460 --> 01:14:00,460
You could have a glass an hour.

1975
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:01,460
Yeah.

1976
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:03,580
You could make money on the whole thing.

1977
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:04,580
In terms of blue milk.

1978
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:05,620
Where are the refreshers?

1979
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:07,500
Where are the refreshers?

1980
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,980
Jason has a full body like suit

1981
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:12,140
that is actually just like a big,

1982
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:13,820
some sort of big receptacle.

1983
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:14,660
Oh yeah.

1984
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:16,260
To get as much blue milk smuggled out of there as possible.

1985
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:18,780
What's Star Wars language for doggy bag?

1986
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:21,020
I wonder actually.

1987
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:21,860
I don't know.

1988
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:26,340
I do know that all like meat is bantha.

1989
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:27,940
Right, yeah, yeah.

1990
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:29,460
They always call it bantha meat.

1991
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:32,020
And like on night one, they came around.

1992
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:34,300
And again, we were just so caught in by this point

1993
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:35,340
and we didn't even think about it.

1994
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:36,700
We were so excited to be there.

1995
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:37,540
And the waiter comes around and they're like,

1996
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:38,620
would you like more bantha?

1997
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:40,260
And we all look at each other like, oh, more bantha?

1998
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:41,900
Yeah, we'll take more bantha.

1999
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:45,700
Like no, no like facetiousness about it.

2000
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:50,220
The second night, the dining experience is a tour

2001
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:53,220
through different planets and cultures.

2002
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:57,620
So the actual chef of the actual Galactic Star Cruiser

2003
01:14:57,620 --> 01:15:01,100
comes out and is like, this next dish is from Coruscant

2004
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:03,220
and like, or like a Mustafar.

2005
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:05,580
And like the whole room turns like red

2006
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:07,500
and they like light it lava colors and play

2007
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,340
like Mustafarian music.

2008
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:11,820
And then he explains the dish and like how it was used

2009
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:13,340
with like fire and stuff like that.

2010
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:14,780
And we were like, wow, this is from,

2011
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:16,540
this all the way from Mustafar, crazy.

2012
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:20,940
And then it's, I'm just guessing it,

2013
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:25,020
is night one a Gaia performance and night two

2014
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:27,820
is more like a story happens like you were describing

2015
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:28,940
kind of a back and forth?

2016
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:30,100
That's right, that's right.

2017
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:33,180
Night one is a big Gaia performance

2018
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:35,580
and a lot of story happens in the Gaia performance as well.

2019
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:37,340
Like that is another like just great reason

2020
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:38,300
for everybody to get in one room.

2021
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,420
Like Chewbacca appears and like they're chasing Chewbacca

2022
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:42,420
around and Lieutenant Croix trying to get Chewbacca

2023
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:44,740
while Gaia's performing, partly as a distraction

2024
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:46,780
and partly just like that's what's happening.

2025
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:48,860
And she's amazing, the songs are really great.

2026
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:50,820
You can listen to the album.

2027
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:53,620
And, but yeah, then second night is more story driven.

2028
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:55,140
I think that maybe there was like,

2029
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:57,020
it's part of a story that Gaia is supposed

2030
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:59,740
to have a performance, but then it's canceled.

2031
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:00,900
It can't go on for some reason,

2032
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:03,660
maybe because of first order interference.

2033
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:07,100
And so then she does like an unplugged show

2034
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:10,180
that feels like a big protest, like on the deck.

2035
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:11,020
That's cool.

2036
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:12,860
Like she's like there and like one of the characters

2037
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:14,820
plays guitar and she's singing all the songs

2038
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,100
and everybody's singing along from the songs

2039
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:18,660
they learned the night before at the big concert.

2040
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:21,180
Oh, you know them by then.

2041
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:25,220
So you get the Gaia songs are second nature.

2042
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:27,300
We are like part of the protest.

2043
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:28,500
We're standing there like going,

2044
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:31,900
hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi,

2045
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:34,820
like we're like, so we're really, really there.

2046
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:38,060
And there's like a lot of call and response on this thing.

2047
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:42,060
Cause like, I think one of the resistance like terms

2048
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:45,460
is ignite the spark, light the flame or something.

2049
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:48,100
And they really get this stuff in your head.

2050
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:49,940
They really teach it to you that by day two,

2051
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:51,900
you're saying a bunch of like,

2052
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:52,940
somebody will say, ignite the spark

2053
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:55,420
and the whole ship will go, light the flame.

2054
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:58,540
Like they like teach you all these Star Wars words.

2055
01:16:58,540 --> 01:16:59,380
It's crazy.

2056
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:01,820
You don't even, you're not thinking about it 48 hours in.

2057
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:03,420
Even watching a video of just here,

2058
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:05,220
we're getting on the elevator.

2059
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:08,180
I just watched somebody's POV of doing this

2060
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:11,060
and hearing a bright suns on the way,

2061
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:14,060
which is like the greeting in galaxy's edge.

2062
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:16,220
And it really made me like, oh yeah, remember that?

2063
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:17,580
Remember bright suns?

2064
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:20,860
That was sure something they did for the first 10 days

2065
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:21,940
and never again.

2066
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:25,300
But the bright, if you like the bright suns thing,

2067
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,980
it's the, there's so many more of it.

2068
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:29,980
You're living in the bright suns mentality.

2069
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:31,820
I said, when we did the Batuu trip,

2070
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:34,900
I said bright suns to every single cast member I've had.

2071
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,060
I was so excited to say bright suns.

2072
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:38,700
And I had the little Halcyon medal.

2073
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:40,580
So they were all like, bright suns.

2074
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:43,940
VIP on galaxy's edge.

2075
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:46,500
I have a couple of quick, more practical questions.

2076
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:49,620
Did you see anyone trying to get hammered?

2077
01:17:50,620 --> 01:17:53,300
Like as far as like, is it open bar there?

2078
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:54,140
I don't think it is, right?

2079
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:54,980
Don't you have to pay for those?

2080
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:55,980
I don't think it's open bar.

2081
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:57,220
You have to pay for the alcohol.

2082
01:17:57,220 --> 01:18:01,300
That's to prevent people from getting hammered.

2083
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:04,220
There were, there definitely were people

2084
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:06,220
who were substantially drinking.

2085
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:08,220
And that was the thing that they decided to do.

2086
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:09,660
And you could, like you totally,

2087
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:12,140
that is a Star Wars story of your own, you know?

2088
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:12,980
I have to speak to-

2089
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:14,300
I had to live a Star Wars story.

2090
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:16,540
That's the Star Wars story I would live.

2091
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:18,780
This is reminding me of something pretty important

2092
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:20,060
that happened actually.

2093
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:23,980
There was a gentleman who was Obi-Wan Kenobi.

2094
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:27,220
And he didn't work there.

2095
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:29,500
And we were very confused,

2096
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,220
but he looked like old Obi-Wan,

2097
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:32,740
like old, like he had like white hair and a white beard.

2098
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:34,100
Old Ben Kenobi, yeah.

2099
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:37,700
And he would sit and he was there definitely by himself.

2100
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:39,100
And he didn't talk to anybody.

2101
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:40,340
And he would just sit in rooms

2102
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:43,260
and kind of like look wistfully at the room.

2103
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:46,940
And like, he was just, he was,

2104
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:49,060
we called him phoby-wan Kenobi eventually.

2105
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:51,100
Like, and we were like that story wise,

2106
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:52,420
how do we justify this for ourselves?

2107
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:54,820
That's the force ghost of Ben Kenobi.

2108
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:59,580
And then later learned that he doesn't,

2109
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:01,660
didn't work for the hotel, was there as a guest,

2110
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:04,620
but does work for the Disney parks as a photographer,

2111
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:05,460
as a real guy.

2112
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:09,780
And used to be a Walt Disney World ambassador.

2113
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:10,620
Wow.

2114
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:13,580
And this guy that we just saw as Obi-Wan Kenobi

2115
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:16,540
constantly walking around, like walk,

2116
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:18,660
being Obi-Wan Kenobi was one of the craziest things

2117
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:19,500
I've ever seen.

2118
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:22,300
Anyway, all that to say, yeah, you could get drunk.

2119
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:23,580
That's it.

2120
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:24,420
Hell yeah.

2121
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:27,420
Did you drink, how were drinks?

2122
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:29,060
I was 20 at the time.

2123
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:29,900
You were 20 then?

2124
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:30,740
Oh man.

2125
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:32,620
Oh, wow, wow, oh, and really?

2126
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:35,340
I just turned 21 this past month.

2127
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:37,020
Oh wow, wow.

2128
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:38,780
And you didn't arrange it to go back

2129
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:42,540
so that your first legal drink could be some bubble and blue.

2130
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:46,940
You have no idea how much I thought about doing that.

2131
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:48,420
You have no clue.

2132
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:51,820
Like I said it to like the Disney influencer people.

2133
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:54,060
I was like, I want to turn 21 in the Galactic Star Cruiser.

2134
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:55,020
And they were like, it's too late.

2135
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:56,980
Last minute, we can't get you on the Galactic Star Cruiser.

2136
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:59,300
You actually try, oh my God, wow.

2137
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:01,380
I fully was like, that's how I, that's what I have to do.

2138
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:03,820
I have to turn 21 in the Galactic Star Cruiser.

2139
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:06,180
I feel like that's a big thing I have to be,

2140
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:08,220
is 21 on the Galactic Star Cruiser.

2141
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:12,980
But I was told that the drinks were stellar

2142
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:15,940
and that there's like a lot of fun, really fun drinks.

2143
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:17,980
And like those are also like from different planets

2144
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:19,420
and they have them in fun glasses

2145
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:21,500
and presentations and things like that.

2146
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:25,140
So yeah, no, the drinks were given really positive reviews.

2147
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:27,260
Here on earth, did you get anywhere close

2148
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:31,660
to a dumb Star Wars drink as the first legal drink?

2149
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:32,500
You know what?

2150
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:35,660
Yeah, there's a bar not far from where I live

2151
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:38,100
that has, it's like a Tiki bar.

2152
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:42,380
And they have this drink that's in like a big whale

2153
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:44,900
and it's like a straw in the whale's mouth.

2154
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:47,180
That was my first drink.

2155
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:48,020
That's great.

2156
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:49,700
I'm happy to hear that.

2157
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:53,300
Water pressure in the shower, how was it?

2158
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:55,020
Very practical.

2159
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:55,940
Yeah, it was good.

2160
01:20:55,940 --> 01:20:57,780
No, the showers and stuff were good.

2161
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:59,540
And you do feel like you need to shower

2162
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:01,500
the Star Wars off of you a little bit.

2163
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:05,180
So no, the showers were positive experiences for us all.

2164
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:07,660
Yeah, the bathrooms, solid for sure.

2165
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:11,740
Okay, did you use a thermal blower

2166
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:16,740
or what we on earth may know better as hair dryers?

2167
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:18,820
I don't think any of us did, no.

2168
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:19,660
Okay.

2169
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:22,260
Do people talk about the thermal blowers at all?

2170
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:25,340
I saw a photo and I think it comes in a little bag

2171
01:21:25,340 --> 01:21:27,860
and the bag is labeled thermal blower.

2172
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:30,020
So if you were not- Fucking awesome, man.

2173
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:30,860
Yeah, yeah.

2174
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:33,420
I mean, I think other things are just shampoo

2175
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:35,740
and conditioner, they don't go out of their way

2176
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:38,620
to invent new terminology there.

2177
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:39,620
But thermal blowers.

2178
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:41,340
Is there any prequel behind the scenes

2179
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:43,660
where George is explaining how Anakin gets his hair

2180
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:45,580
a certain way, oh, there's a thermal blower

2181
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:49,140
and he just puts the thermal blower up to his head.

2182
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:50,740
You know what's wild actually?

2183
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:53,060
One of the things they give you when you're there

2184
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:55,700
is these Star Wars comic books

2185
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:57,620
that take place on the house even.

2186
01:21:57,620 --> 01:21:59,500
Oh, wow. That allege that Han

2187
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:01,580
and Leia had their honeymoon on the Halcyon.

2188
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:03,300
Yes, yes. Oh, I forgot this detail.

2189
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:06,300
They conceived Kylo Ren, right, on the Halcyon?

2190
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:10,060
Or is it Anakin in Padme?

2191
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:10,900
Is it that Luna Leia?

2192
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:12,860
No, I think it was Han- I think it's Han and Leia.

2193
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:14,540
Oh, okay. I think it's Han and Leia.

2194
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:16,580
Yeah, it's Han and Leia. I think they conceived

2195
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:18,220
Kylo on the Halcyon. Wow.

2196
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:19,260
Wow. You're right.

2197
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:20,860
Is there a way to know which room

2198
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:22,380
and to ask for that room?

2199
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:24,540
I mean, depending on the performer.

2200
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:26,980
There's a weird energy at that room.

2201
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:28,940
Yeah, yeah.

2202
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:29,780
A bad energy.

2203
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:32,460
I wonder if there's any way to tell in the comic book.

2204
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:34,180
I didn't read it. I just came through and I was like,

2205
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:36,780
wait, are you alleging to me

2206
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:39,020
that they had their honeymoon here

2207
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:40,580
on this place you made up last year?

2208
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:43,020
Oh, Leia, where's the thermal blower?

2209
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:46,620
I can't find the thermal blower.

2210
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:49,980
My poofy 70s do is really-

2211
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:53,020
I need to dry off my balls.

2212
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:54,020
Yeah.

2213
01:22:55,940 --> 01:22:57,180
The thermal blower.

2214
01:22:57,220 --> 01:22:58,180
Here's a question.

2215
01:22:58,180 --> 01:22:59,500
At the end of the night,

2216
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:02,100
you guys are back at the room, you're winding down.

2217
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:07,100
Did anyone flip on that hotel room TBS or food network?

2218
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:09,140
Oh yeah, you're watching Shark Tank.

2219
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:10,500
Watching cable?

2220
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:13,420
I don't think so.

2221
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:16,420
No, I think we were all pretty committed to the bit.

2222
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:18,700
We were like, we're gonna do this.

2223
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:21,060
You can, they do show you,

2224
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:22,140
oh, and you turn on the TV, it's like,

2225
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:24,060
you can airplay to the TV.

2226
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:26,420
They show you how to screen-play.

2227
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:29,300
And the specific example that they give you

2228
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:34,300
is it's like you see like a screen cap from episode seven

2229
01:23:34,340 --> 01:23:36,340
and it's like you should screen mirror Star Wars

2230
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:37,580
onto the Star Wars TV.

2231
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:39,860
Sure, they're trying to suggest,

2232
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:42,780
watch some tales from the universe.

2233
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:45,260
Yeah, it's like I don't wanna watch Star Wars

2234
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:48,660
when I'm in one, like that's so not what I wanna do

2235
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:50,380
is know that it's a movie right now.

2236
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:54,260
It's like watching a Ken Burns documentary on some war.

2237
01:23:54,260 --> 01:23:56,340
You know, it's like in the universe, who cares?

2238
01:23:57,260 --> 01:23:59,420
It would have to be a documentary

2239
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:01,940
about when the Empire struck back.

2240
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:03,820
You couldn't watch the Empire Strikes Back.

2241
01:24:03,820 --> 01:24:05,380
That's too weird.

2242
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:06,220
Yeah, Bert, like.

2243
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:09,180
Wow, that's fun actually watching it as documentaries

2244
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:14,180
is a really fun idea or otherwise like dramatized versions

2245
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:15,740
of what really happened.

2246
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:19,340
Oh look, some actors have taken it upon themselves.

2247
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:21,700
Some fellow named Irwin Kirchner, I guess,

2248
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:25,140
has reenacted the events that we know from.

2249
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:28,180
Yeah, oh, that would be fun though.

2250
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:33,260
Just in the, sort of winding it down,

2251
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:36,940
I just wanna make sure we get to big moments in the story.

2252
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:38,580
I guess on that last, how does it,

2253
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:42,300
like where's night two, like okay, our last night,

2254
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:46,180
we're going to bed, what are you left to think about?

2255
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:48,740
Is it hard to sleep because the story

2256
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:51,700
is weighing on you at that point?

2257
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:53,660
Yeah, honestly, yeah.

2258
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:56,620
He was really, we had like,

2259
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:58,580
and this is skipping your question

2260
01:24:58,580 --> 01:24:59,420
and I won't go back to it,

2261
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:01,780
but like we woke up for three days after

2262
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:03,980
and Texas and our group chat like plugged me back in.

2263
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:04,820
Like I can't.

2264
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:10,060
I remember falling asleep on the plane

2265
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:13,460
and waking up from like my nap on the plane home

2266
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:15,180
and somebody was walking by to go to the bathroom

2267
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:17,460
and I thought it was a stormtrooper that I had to like,

2268
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:19,100
genuinely my brain was like, you have to talk to them

2269
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:21,100
to get like your mission completed.

2270
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:23,780
Like I was still really in it.

2271
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:26,820
But yeah, the last night, this is the kind of amazing thing.

2272
01:25:26,820 --> 01:25:29,020
And I had, this year was my first year

2273
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:32,340
watching WrestleMania after this Halcyon experience.

2274
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:33,860
And I was told that I would like it

2275
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:36,860
because of my reaction to the Halcyon experience

2276
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:39,380
because the last thing that happens is you're at this dinner

2277
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:42,060
and then the fake alarm, not the real alarm goes off

2278
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:43,740
and they're like everybody onto the deck.

2279
01:25:43,740 --> 01:25:45,620
And that's where this big sort of fight

2280
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:50,620
between the captain and the lieutenant is happening.

2281
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:53,780
And this really, really incredible thing happens

2282
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:58,780
where they manage to in this one big moment,

2283
01:25:58,860 --> 01:26:01,740
tie up every single storyline

2284
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:03,940
that you could have possibly followed

2285
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:05,820
over the course of your time there.

2286
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:08,340
Like there were characters that we had barely ever seen

2287
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:10,660
that had like endings to their stories

2288
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:12,740
that still seemed meaningful enough to us.

2289
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:15,300
Like they really do it all and they tie it all together

2290
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:18,020
and emotionally and fulfillingly.

2291
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:20,500
And I could get into all that,

2292
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:23,260
but I think the big thing to note is this fight

2293
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:25,820
between Kylo Ren and Rey that happens,

2294
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:28,500
which is really fun to say that like,

2295
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:31,860
oh, so we're just deciding that between episodes eight

2296
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:34,540
and nine, Kylo Ren and Rey were in the same room

2297
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:37,260
and had this like huge lightsaber fight.

2298
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:39,140
But this is where the like big lightsaber

2299
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:41,820
with the slap bracelet thing happens and all that stuff.

2300
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:43,860
But one of the things that is not touched upon,

2301
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:46,780
I feel enough in people talking about the star cruiser

2302
01:26:46,940 --> 01:26:51,460
is the different ways in which Kylo Ren or Rey

2303
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:53,940
interchangeably will use the force

2304
01:26:53,940 --> 01:26:57,020
to slam the other's head into a railing.

2305
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:58,420
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

2306
01:26:58,420 --> 01:27:00,220
I did notice this in a video.

2307
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:03,380
Yeah, that's a little more brutal than the typical.

2308
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:05,340
It was amazing.

2309
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:07,020
We were like standing there being like,

2310
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:08,740
oh, they're gonna fight and then that happens.

2311
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:13,740
You're like, oh my God, this is brutal.

2312
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:15,980
But that was really amazing.

2313
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:17,300
Every story is tied up.

2314
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:19,380
There's like all these surprises that happen.

2315
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:23,500
I think the big payoff has to go to the character of Sammy.

2316
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:25,980
I kind of, I even don't wanna say like how and why,

2317
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:28,620
but he really gets all of us.

2318
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:30,900
Again, day one, we're like, wow, this silly Star Wars thing.

2319
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:33,620
Like we're really excited, but come on, this is silly.

2320
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:35,980
All of a sudden we're standing here in the deck,

2321
01:27:35,980 --> 01:27:38,820
on the deck, every single person on the ship going,

2322
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:41,940
Sammy, Sammy, Sammy.

2323
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:43,180
Impromptu of nothing.

2324
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:45,380
Like no cast member was making us do this.

2325
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:49,180
And the actor playing Sammy is taking this in so interesting.

2326
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:50,260
Wow, I did it.

2327
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:52,700
And like integrating it into the story

2328
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:54,820
and then Lieutenant Crowley's gotta yell over it.

2329
01:27:54,820 --> 01:27:56,620
Like it's so amazing.

2330
01:27:56,620 --> 01:27:58,980
That's the other amazing thing about these big moments

2331
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:01,700
with everybody is that a kid could make it go haywire

2332
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:03,140
at any second.

2333
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:05,260
A kid could walk up to Lieutenant Crowley

2334
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:06,940
and this did happen.

2335
01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:09,340
During a big moment, like a kid walked up to Lieutenant Crowley

2336
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:11,740
and was like, I think you're a bad guy.

2337
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:13,620
And the captain was like, all right, sit down.

2338
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:14,660
We're having a real discussion.

2339
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:17,980
He's like, no, I won't let him talk to you like that.

2340
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:19,780
Like this whole thing.

2341
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:23,260
And then Lieutenant Crowley ended the scene early basically,

2342
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:26,100
but said, come child, we have much work to do.

2343
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:28,060
And like gave him a special little experience

2344
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:28,900
in another room.

2345
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:32,300
Like they have to give full respect to everybody

2346
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:33,340
who wants to talk to them

2347
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:34,740
because what is the point of this thing?

2348
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:37,180
Otherwise they can't like ignore a kid.

2349
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:39,860
So it's pretty amazing seeing these actors navigate

2350
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:41,940
that so masterfully.

2351
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:42,780
Yeah.

2352
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:45,380
It's interesting you say wrestling compared to wrestling

2353
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:48,380
because we went with a certain friend of ours,

2354
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:50,860
Buzz Buzz once to a wrestling event,

2355
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:54,820
but he put wrestling in probably the correct perspective.

2356
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:58,420
He said, it's like we're all in a little play.

2357
01:28:58,420 --> 01:28:59,900
And he is right.

2358
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:02,180
And it's what you're saying is, yeah.

2359
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:04,180
What you're saying is we're all in a little play,

2360
01:29:04,180 --> 01:29:05,180
but that's the fun of it.

2361
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:08,060
That's why we're doing it is that we're all playing along.

2362
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:09,620
And it's more fun when we're playing along.

2363
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:10,940
It is, if you like wrestling,

2364
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:13,020
if you like the Galactic Star Cruiser.

2365
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:13,860
Wow, wow.

2366
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:18,740
And then like, I mean, cause I watched a video

2367
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:22,460
of the finale or maybe like a preview they did

2368
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:25,380
of the finale for vloggers or whatever.

2369
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:29,100
And you could certainly see how it ends on this high note

2370
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:32,740
and the emotion you're all feeling.

2371
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:35,620
Like I get all that, but then how does it transition into,

2372
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:37,820
okay, get your bags?

2373
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:39,540
Like what is, how do you,

2374
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,540
it seems like such a big come down.

2375
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:44,820
Yeah, I think there is a moment to maybe like,

2376
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:47,100
like a cruise, like I think you can put your bags out

2377
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:50,460
in the hall and like tag them and they'll have them ready

2378
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:52,940
for you outside the next day or something.

2379
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:55,020
It is a really big come down.

2380
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:59,340
It's not left to be like out of universe or anything.

2381
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:01,500
Like I feel like the characters will be like,

2382
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:04,140
cause again, they're running a cruise.

2383
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:05,340
So like the characters will be like,

2384
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:07,140
and you can like leave your bags outside

2385
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:09,860
and our amazing crew members will come get them.

2386
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:11,340
Like it doesn't feel out of place

2387
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:13,380
for something like that to happen,

2388
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:17,420
but it is for real depressing.

2389
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:22,420
Like the come down after was very, very visceral.

2390
01:30:22,780 --> 01:30:25,380
And we still text in our group chat about it once a week

2391
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:27,420
because now we keep tabs on the actors

2392
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:28,260
on their social media.

2393
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:30,100
So we're like send their posts and be like,

2394
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:32,300
oh my God, they're dating or stuff like that.

2395
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:34,260
Wow.

2396
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:35,660
You've kept it going.

2397
01:30:35,660 --> 01:30:38,860
Did you then transition into more Disney world

2398
01:30:38,860 --> 01:30:41,020
or did you go home?

2399
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:43,060
We transitioned into a bit more Disney world,

2400
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:44,900
which I would argue wasn't a mistake.

2401
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:46,780
I just wouldn't advise it.

2402
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:49,540
Like you feel like you're like, I can't,

2403
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:51,700
like you still feel like you're back on earth.

2404
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:55,060
You know, like we had like an extra day at like,

2405
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:58,820
I think Epcot and I would suggest that if you're gonna do

2406
01:30:58,820 --> 01:30:59,980
the Galactic Star Cruiser,

2407
01:30:59,980 --> 01:31:01,740
just go and do the Galactic Star Cruiser.

2408
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:05,780
Don't like make, don't pair it with a longer Disney trip,

2409
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:09,380
I would say, cause it really is like such a different,

2410
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:11,020
yeah, it really is its own thing.

2411
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:13,060
And going to Hollywood studios during it,

2412
01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:15,020
like you get some rides in there.

2413
01:31:15,020 --> 01:31:17,180
I get like, if you don't go to Disney,

2414
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:18,500
I go to Disney so often.

2415
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:20,500
Like if you don't go as often as one does

2416
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:21,540
and this is like your big trip

2417
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:24,540
and you want it to be part of it, I get it and do it.

2418
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:28,260
But I would advise the ideal Star Cruiser experience

2419
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:30,580
is just doing that.

2420
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:34,100
And like, then it's just kind of,

2421
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:36,780
you're pretty drained going back into the parks.

2422
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:38,180
Like if you've done it right,

2423
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:40,380
you've given your all to the stars.

2424
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:43,060
So at least do it at the end maybe of a trip.

2425
01:31:43,060 --> 01:31:43,900
You gotta make it the finale.

2426
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:45,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2427
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:46,220
At the list you're gonna do it all.

2428
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:47,180
I think that's right.

2429
01:31:47,180 --> 01:31:48,020
Wow.

2430
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:50,100
Yeah, go to the Magic Kingdom and do some rides.

2431
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:51,220
It just, it really feels like you're like,

2432
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:53,020
oh, all these people who are just here for today,

2433
01:31:53,020 --> 01:31:55,660
they don't know, you know, like I think that's part of it.

2434
01:31:55,660 --> 01:31:57,500
They don't know what you've been through.

2435
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:59,220
You know, you've been through something

2436
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:02,620
with these hundred somewhat specific people.

2437
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:05,780
It's strange to then be in like, you know.

2438
01:32:05,780 --> 01:32:06,700
A line.

2439
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:09,500
Community, world community or whatever it's called.

2440
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:10,340
Right.

2441
01:32:10,340 --> 01:32:11,300
Wow, wow.

2442
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:16,980
So then, so what's your reaction a few weeks ago

2443
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:19,700
or whenever it was that they're shutting it down?

2444
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:21,860
Now I'm like afraid to ask how you felt

2445
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:25,500
and how the group chat felt when this news broke.

2446
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:28,580
Yeah, I mean, I got texts from multiple people

2447
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:32,700
who I have not talked to in a while asking if I was okay.

2448
01:32:33,740 --> 01:32:36,420
One of them and one of them who I was talking to,

2449
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:39,420
but like out of our Gene Stupnitsky,

2450
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:42,060
our director of No Hard Feelings texted me

2451
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:44,980
and was like, like, I'm so sorry.

2452
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:47,860
You know, this is like, they really,

2453
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:52,380
it really was like a real point of sadness.

2454
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:54,420
Like I think obviously, you know,

2455
01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:56,460
the writing on the wall was pretty clear

2456
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:58,980
like of the direction it was taking,

2457
01:32:58,980 --> 01:33:00,540
it was becoming emptier.

2458
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:03,740
It just wasn't selling the way they'd hoped.

2459
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:08,740
And like, as an artistic risk,

2460
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:11,060
you know, my heart really does go out to it.

2461
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:12,900
Obviously, like I'm not gonna sit here

2462
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:16,660
weeping that this big corporation's big money thing

2463
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:17,940
didn't play out.

2464
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:22,940
But like, as this really, really incredible theatrical

2465
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:27,420
thing not succeeding in the way that it had hoped,

2466
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:30,260
that is always gonna be at least a little sad to me.

2467
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:33,420
And I will always be very thankful that I went,

2468
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:35,340
like, I don't think I'd be able to,

2469
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:37,420
I don't know how, I would regret it forever

2470
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:39,220
if I didn't get to do it.

2471
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:41,740
Geez, that's a, well, I think some listeners,

2472
01:33:41,740 --> 01:33:44,460
maybe some hosts are going through this right now.

2473
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:46,380
Maybe forever regret, because if we can't,

2474
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:48,540
I think we're boxed out, right?

2475
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:49,940
Unless Mike works some magic,

2476
01:33:49,940 --> 01:33:52,060
unless you like do some hacking.

2477
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:54,460
If we chat about it, there's no way I couldn't do it.

2478
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:55,300
Okay.

2479
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:56,500
Well, I think you could do it

2480
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:58,220
and I really want you to do it.

2481
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:00,940
Maybe you gotta prioritize now.

2482
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:02,700
We gotta talk about it.

2483
01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:04,860
You just got it like, and really,

2484
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:06,340
this is the number one piece of advice

2485
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:08,900
to everybody who's going, you just have to say yes

2486
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:10,140
to the whole thing.

2487
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:12,660
Like, obviously it's campy, obviously it's silly.

2488
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:14,180
You have to set your kind of ego

2489
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:15,740
and cynicism aside a little bit.

2490
01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:18,700
But like, you have to say yes to everything

2491
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:21,300
and like seek out more immersion.

2492
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:23,900
Because I will say like, you can't,

2493
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:25,580
it's not that you can't escape the immersion,

2494
01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:27,060
it's that there isn't anything else.

2495
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:29,220
So like on day two, this like,

2496
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:30,740
my brother and I were running around

2497
01:34:30,740 --> 01:34:31,700
and doing all this stuff.

2498
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:34,780
And this dad and his like poor younger son came up to me,

2499
01:34:34,780 --> 01:34:35,900
came up to me and my brother.

2500
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:37,940
And they were like, the dad was like,

2501
01:34:37,940 --> 01:34:41,940
excuse me, do you know about any secret stuff happening?

2502
01:34:41,940 --> 01:34:44,300
We can't seem to find the secret stuff.

2503
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:46,780
It's like, oh buddy, you had to earn the secret stuff

2504
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:47,940
yesterday, my friend.

2505
01:34:47,940 --> 01:34:49,260
I don't know what else to tell you.

2506
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:50,340
Too late.

2507
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:51,180
Too late.

2508
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:52,020
Oh man.

2509
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,940
Oh, what a sad tale.

2510
01:34:53,940 --> 01:34:57,380
I have one more question that this is,

2511
01:34:57,380 --> 01:34:59,780
I don't know if we're gonna find the answer.

2512
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:01,620
And there's just one thing everybody's wondering

2513
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:05,060
at this point, which is what happens to the building?

2514
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:08,380
They made a weird spaceship hotel

2515
01:35:08,380 --> 01:35:10,900
that is in the backstage of the park.

2516
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:13,300
I mean, you know, in theory, you could re-theme this

2517
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:14,540
or do something else with it,

2518
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:17,500
except that it requires an odd little bus ride

2519
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:19,220
that's not right next to the park.

2520
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:21,700
The rumors are that they've thought about other things to do

2521
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:22,860
or make it a day trip or something,

2522
01:35:22,860 --> 01:35:24,460
but it's just, they're not gonna do anything.

2523
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:26,620
Supposedly it's over.

2524
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:29,180
Like there were, apparently they were trying to figure out

2525
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:32,700
other things to do, Mandalorian overlays or something.

2526
01:35:32,700 --> 01:35:35,140
And then day trips to it.

2527
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:38,180
And it feels like, no, it's just that building's gonna rot

2528
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:40,180
until they need the land.

2529
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:43,340
Yeah, I mean, us there, we were like, oh man,

2530
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:46,580
in three years, God willing, this thing stays open,

2531
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:48,140
which obviously it has not.

2532
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:49,900
And they like make a sequel story

2533
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:51,140
for people who have been before.

2534
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:52,900
Because honestly, the biggest audience

2535
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:54,980
for people going on the Star Cruiser

2536
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:57,340
is people who have already gone on the Star Cruiser.

2537
01:35:57,340 --> 01:35:59,740
Like they kind of, I feel like the people

2538
01:35:59,740 --> 01:36:01,900
who were gonna do it did it at the beginning.

2539
01:36:01,900 --> 01:36:04,980
And so to do like a follow-up story and it's like,

2540
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:06,500
oh, you can have the same cast, which obviously you can't

2541
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:07,740
have, because a lot of them don't work there anymore.

2542
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:10,740
Like it's like, it was this sort of wonderful dream,

2543
01:36:10,740 --> 01:36:12,140
which the Star Cruiser always was.

2544
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:14,340
Like it's this wonderful, wonderful idea

2545
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:15,980
that I think was executed very well.

2546
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:19,900
But in the time we're living in this society,

2547
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:21,380
we're living in the place that it was,

2548
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:22,740
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

2549
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:24,180
It just didn't hit.

2550
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:25,540
I think, sorry.

2551
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:27,260
That sucks, no, that's it.

2552
01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:29,820
I was just gonna say, I think that the issue with it

2553
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:34,820
is that nothing visually or video wise can convey

2554
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:39,460
what you just did for like an hour and whatever, 45 minutes.

2555
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:40,300
Yeah, I feel it after this.

2556
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:44,500
It's like the video doesn't show me the experience.

2557
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:45,940
You have to feel the experience,

2558
01:36:45,940 --> 01:36:49,700
which is very hard to convey, even when in a written review

2559
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:52,220
or even seeing things, because obviously video makes things

2560
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:53,900
look less cool in general,

2561
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:55,500
unless it's a very high quality video.

2562
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:58,900
But like, you just did a better advertisement

2563
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:02,020
than any of the social media posts we've seen

2564
01:37:02,020 --> 01:37:03,300
for this thing in a year.

2565
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:04,500
Yeah, yes.

2566
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:06,980
Yeah, I mean, that was something we were really feeling too,

2567
01:37:06,980 --> 01:37:09,180
because like you watch those videos and you're like,

2568
01:37:09,180 --> 01:37:13,420
oh, I'm paying $6,000 to do this lightsaber training

2569
01:37:13,420 --> 01:37:14,300
where I'm holding this stick.

2570
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:17,380
And it's like, no, of course not.

2571
01:37:17,380 --> 01:37:19,860
Like that's not the thing you're paying for.

2572
01:37:19,860 --> 01:37:21,980
You're paying for like what that means

2573
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:23,220
to the thing as a whole.

2574
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:25,300
And it is a really, really hard, difficult thing

2575
01:37:25,300 --> 01:37:26,860
to convey, like this is the first time

2576
01:37:26,860 --> 01:37:28,700
I'm even bringing up the lightsaber training,

2577
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:31,660
which was really, really fun and amazing.

2578
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:33,260
And like led Alex to be like,

2579
01:37:33,260 --> 01:37:35,340
I wanna follow this Jedi journey.

2580
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:36,500
Like that's what it's about.

2581
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:37,580
It's about the story as a whole,

2582
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:40,980
not how cool is this very one lightsaber thing.

2583
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:44,060
If they just had that as like its own thing,

2584
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:46,140
it would be lame, but it's because it's part

2585
01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:48,820
of this whole story that you're being told

2586
01:37:48,820 --> 01:37:51,220
and you're part of unfolding it in real time.

2587
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:52,060
And that was the thing missing.

2588
01:37:52,060 --> 01:37:53,500
Fractions are never gonna tell you the story.

2589
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:55,940
And some piece of video is never gonna do it.

2590
01:37:55,940 --> 01:38:00,780
Or some weird promo video starring a Goldberg's cast member

2591
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:02,740
that is yanked within 48 hours.

2592
01:38:02,740 --> 01:38:04,580
Oh man, that was so tough.

2593
01:38:04,580 --> 01:38:06,860
Because it makes the sets look less than good.

2594
01:38:06,860 --> 01:38:08,100
That was so tough.

2595
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:10,940
That was so, so tough seeing all that stuff play out

2596
01:38:10,940 --> 01:38:11,780
the way that it did.

2597
01:38:11,780 --> 01:38:13,660
And listen, I understand.

2598
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:15,860
We just did this doing,

2599
01:38:15,860 --> 01:38:18,500
trying to convey these immersive experiences.

2600
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:21,100
You just can't because that's the very nature of it.

2601
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:23,260
It's supposed to be very ephemeral

2602
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:24,380
and only exists in the moment.

2603
01:38:24,380 --> 01:38:27,340
So it's impossible to,

2604
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:29,260
I think as soon as it's figured out

2605
01:38:29,260 --> 01:38:31,340
how you can market something like this,

2606
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:34,300
it will open the flood gates

2607
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:35,940
for so many more experiences like this.

2608
01:38:35,940 --> 01:38:37,580
I think literally the biggest problem

2609
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:39,620
with doing an immersive risk like this

2610
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:42,500
is that nobody has yet figured out on the planet

2611
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:44,100
how to market it.

2612
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:48,300
Yeah, I remember when Sleep No More opened in New York

2613
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:52,300
and all of the marketing for that was very vague.

2614
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:55,180
It was like, it was building a mystery.

2615
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:58,900
And hearing people who went and they tell you bits

2616
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:01,180
of it's like, oh, it's kinda,

2617
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:04,540
there's little Shakespeare bits and it's jazz age.

2618
01:39:04,540 --> 01:39:06,460
And you don't really get,

2619
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:09,300
you don't get it hearing about it

2620
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:10,820
as opposed to the people who saw it.

2621
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:11,860
And they were like,

2622
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:14,740
yeah, if you go on a really good night, it's amazing.

2623
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:16,460
Yeah, and I think Sleep No More,

2624
01:39:16,460 --> 01:39:19,940
which this could absolutely be very easily compared to,

2625
01:39:19,940 --> 01:39:22,260
it just has the luxury of being sexy.

2626
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:25,060
Sleep No More is amazing, but you're like,

2627
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:27,620
oh, I think something about it being this sort of secret,

2628
01:39:27,620 --> 01:39:30,620
speak easy kind of thing, as opposed to this thing

2629
01:39:30,620 --> 01:39:35,620
that from the outside seems so corporate and false

2630
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:37,260
as opposed to Sleep No More,

2631
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:39,700
which seems very dirty and intimate.

2632
01:39:39,860 --> 01:39:41,980
This is not, obviously the Star Cruiser is not dirty,

2633
01:39:41,980 --> 01:39:44,060
but it is very intimate.

2634
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:46,540
Anytime that we would kind of like wanna play,

2635
01:39:46,540 --> 01:39:49,100
we'd go up to one of the actors and be like,

2636
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:51,900
hey, you did a great work back there when you

2637
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:55,500
got the coaxium or whatever.

2638
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:58,700
And they would see us trying to play,

2639
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:00,420
but keeping a distance.

2640
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:03,100
And they literally, I remember Justin,

2641
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:05,300
the actor was playing right on our voyage,

2642
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:08,260
grabbed me and leaned over and whispered in my ear like,

2643
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:10,020
hey, thanks for having my back back there.

2644
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:12,660
I really appreciate you and I see what you're doing.

2645
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:15,580
And you mean so much to me, thank you.

2646
01:40:15,580 --> 01:40:17,260
And he walked away and I was like,

2647
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:19,700
a tear, a single tear rolled down my face.

2648
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:25,260
If you are willing to be pulled in by it,

2649
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:28,060
they are so desperate to pull you in.

2650
01:40:28,060 --> 01:40:31,380
It's like the end of the Transformers ride

2651
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:34,060
over and over and over again for a couple times

2652
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:36,380
a day or a couple times in a week.

2653
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:37,220
Yeah.

2654
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:41,460
Mike thrives on being told by Optimus Prime

2655
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:43,140
saying that he's proud of him.

2656
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:46,020
Yeah, when they pull into the station at the Mummy

2657
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:48,660
and they're clapping, that's what it is.

2658
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:50,180
Oh my God, I did.

2659
01:40:50,180 --> 01:40:52,860
But it really is just for you.

2660
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:54,460
But it's a human reaction.

2661
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:56,420
Yeah, it's a human being saying it to you.

2662
01:40:56,420 --> 01:40:59,620
It's an actual connection that I had with an actual person,

2663
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:02,860
even though he was Wraith Cole and I was Gorn Dreamweaver.

2664
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:04,700
Right. Yes.

2665
01:41:04,740 --> 01:41:08,100
But it's so much more than names at that point.

2666
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:08,940
Exactly. It's a feeling.

2667
01:41:08,940 --> 01:41:11,820
It's about living a moment. 100%.

2668
01:41:11,820 --> 01:41:15,460
You have taken us on a journey of optimism

2669
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:19,820
and a journey of hope, one that I will not forget

2670
01:41:19,820 --> 01:41:23,300
anytime soon, much as you will not forget

2671
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:25,460
your star cruiser journey.

2672
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:29,100
And I feel like I should be respectful to the mythology

2673
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:33,180
and say, Gorn Dreamweaver, you survived podcast The Ride.

2674
01:41:34,700 --> 01:41:38,140
I it's this has been such a pleasure, really.

2675
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:41,580
Fantastic. We're proud of you.

2676
01:41:41,580 --> 01:41:42,940
We're proud of you.

2677
01:41:44,460 --> 01:41:45,780
I take it in.

2678
01:41:45,780 --> 01:41:47,580
It's a single tier.

2679
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:49,820
For the listeners, we're watching.

2680
01:41:49,820 --> 01:41:52,340
I think a bunch of single tiers are streaming down.

2681
01:41:53,140 --> 01:41:53,980
Yeah, no.

2682
01:41:53,980 --> 01:41:57,940
For those of you who can't see my face, I'm really crying a lot right now.

2683
01:41:59,940 --> 01:42:01,940
Thank you so much for having me.

2684
01:42:01,940 --> 01:42:02,380
Oh my God.

2685
01:42:02,380 --> 01:42:05,380
I hope to never use my platform to talk about any good causes

2686
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:07,900
and only talk about the galactic.

2687
01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:10,340
The best cause.

2688
01:42:10,340 --> 01:42:15,060
Well, I insist that you use it briefly to talk about your current

2689
01:42:15,340 --> 01:42:19,660
the cause of the day, which let me say, let's exit through the gift shop.

2690
01:42:19,660 --> 01:42:21,820
And is there anything that you would like to plug?

2691
01:42:21,820 --> 01:42:25,740
I don't know anything that anyone can go see in a movie theater right now.

2692
01:42:25,740 --> 01:42:26,700
Is there hearing this?

2693
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:28,100
I don't know what you're talking about.

2694
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:29,740
I can't remember.

2695
01:42:29,740 --> 01:42:32,140
Yeah. No. Hey, listen, there's this little movie

2696
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:34,820
that just came out, I guess, by the time this has been released

2697
01:42:35,100 --> 01:42:36,820
called called No Hard Feelings.

2698
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:38,780
It's very, very fun.

2699
01:42:38,780 --> 01:42:40,900
And I had a really great time filming it.

2700
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:42,180
It's me and Jennifer Lawrence.

2701
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:44,220
She's trying to sleep with me. How silly.

2702
01:42:45,380 --> 01:42:46,780
It's please.

2703
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:48,540
It's a very, very special movie.

2704
01:42:48,540 --> 01:42:51,220
And I really think I really think that you're going to like it.

2705
01:42:51,220 --> 01:42:52,220
Please check it out.

2706
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:52,900
Oh, my God.

2707
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:56,660
I know so many people who are who are really rooting for it.

2708
01:42:56,660 --> 01:43:00,580
And that, you know, that a big, crazy R rated comedy

2709
01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:03,940
with a big movie star and a burgeoning movie star.

2710
01:43:04,620 --> 01:43:06,300
Everybody wants to do well.

2711
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:09,300
And we're also excited to check it out, especially knowing that you are a

2712
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:13,500
now knowing you are a theme park fan and a halcyon hero.

2713
01:43:14,060 --> 01:43:14,980
You'll be able to tell.

2714
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:17,340
You know, it did impact my performance for sure.

2715
01:43:17,540 --> 01:43:19,220
Yeah. Well, you did it. Yeah, you were.

2716
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:23,580
But you you came from that you've you undoubtedly you brought something

2717
01:43:24,020 --> 01:43:26,900
from space back to this your performance in this film.

2718
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:28,340
Yeah, that's right.

2719
01:43:28,340 --> 01:43:29,860
That's that's exactly correct.

2720
01:43:29,860 --> 01:43:31,740
I did. I was like.

2721
01:43:31,740 --> 01:43:34,180
I now that I've been going, I can be personally

2722
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:39,060
what I felt I had to be like that was my hero's journey

2723
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:40,900
to be able to film that movie.

2724
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:42,500
Geez, that's that's amazing.

2725
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:44,780
How do you think Percy would have fared

2726
01:43:44,780 --> 01:43:47,420
at any choices he would have made

2727
01:43:48,980 --> 01:43:51,100
if you had to guess his experience?

2728
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:55,100
I mean, honestly, like, it's so funny, like where we find Percy

2729
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:58,420
at the beginning of the movie, like as you can tell from the trailer, sort of

2730
01:43:58,580 --> 01:44:01,620
the reason that he goes on the journey that he does in the movie

2731
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:04,580
and why Jen's character, Maddie, is trying to seduce him is because

2732
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:07,500
his parents are really concerned that he hasn't been brought out of his shell

2733
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:10,020
and that he's about to go to college and he's very antisocial.

2734
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:13,100
And I genuinely think instead of the whole plot of No Hard feelings,

2735
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:15,620
he could have just gone to the Galactic Star Cruiser and like

2736
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:19,980
shell there and then been ready to go to Princeton.

2737
01:44:19,980 --> 01:44:24,460
Like then then he'd be after being, you know, I feel like he'd probably.

2738
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:27,740
I think, oh, God, I don't know, actually.

2739
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:29,620
He might have been first order.

2740
01:44:29,620 --> 01:44:31,780
Like, I think he kind of needed to get something out.

2741
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:35,100
I don't know. I really don't.

2742
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:37,540
I bet he would have had a really good time, though.

2743
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:39,220
Yeah. He would have surprised himself.

2744
01:44:39,220 --> 01:44:44,260
The exciting world of the Halcyon would prepare him for the wilds of North Jersey.

2745
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:46,100
You know, that's it.

2746
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:48,580
I mean, I honestly, yeah, 100 percent.

2747
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:50,700
Like, I mean, it's true.

2748
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:54,860
I in total earnest, like so much of No Hard feelings is about needing to kind of

2749
01:44:55,260 --> 01:45:00,500
break out of one's bubble before, you know, and grow up and kind of

2750
01:45:01,020 --> 01:45:05,020
evolve into a different version of themselves and the different steps that one takes to do that.

2751
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:07,700
And I think in a very microcosm way,

2752
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:12,540
the Star Cruiser, much as any sort of immersive experiences,

2753
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:15,860
much as any theme park is, but more so is

2754
01:45:17,260 --> 01:45:21,980
is that opportunity to like escape yourself for a second and come back,

2755
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:26,780
having like learned something about yourself in any small or large way.

2756
01:45:27,660 --> 01:45:32,900
And I obviously like as somebody who performs and I wasn't so surprising

2757
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:36,940
that I behaved the way I did on the Star Cruiser that I like really took the reins.

2758
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:41,540
But I think for somebody to go and do that for themselves and having not done it before,

2759
01:45:41,540 --> 01:45:45,820
I think it can be a pretty addictive experience and like something that really does

2760
01:45:45,860 --> 01:45:50,060
does change them. And there were people there who were on their third or second

2761
01:45:50,060 --> 01:45:54,660
voyages, like who would like this was something they did because this was their opportunity to do exactly that.

2762
01:45:54,940 --> 01:45:57,260
So I do think it's a special thing.

2763
01:45:57,260 --> 01:46:03,540
And as sad as it is, as it's leaving, I really hope it's not a sign that things like this can't succeed.

2764
01:46:03,620 --> 01:46:05,900
Yeah, yeah. You got to creatively.

2765
01:46:05,980 --> 01:46:08,260
You got to root for this for sure.

2766
01:46:08,260 --> 01:46:12,420
Disney, whatever. Yeah, they need to they need to work out their books differently.

2767
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:15,820
Yeah. Hopefully the spirit of this move moves into.

2768
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:18,860
Yeah. So we can one day sleep in Wolverine's bed.

2769
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:23,300
We're praying for this opportunity.

2770
01:46:23,980 --> 01:46:25,580
Well, thank you for joining.

2771
01:46:25,580 --> 01:46:26,660
Please come back anytime.

2772
01:46:26,660 --> 01:46:30,340
This has been such a blast, Andrew and written for this movie.

2773
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:31,740
Kyle Mooney's in there, too, right?

2774
01:46:31,740 --> 01:46:34,060
He said, did you have scenes with Kyle or is that a different thing?

2775
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:35,700
I did. I did have scenes with Kyle.

2776
01:46:35,700 --> 01:46:36,780
Wow. Is it me? Yes.

2777
01:46:36,780 --> 01:46:39,020
And oh, my God, of course, I meant to bring that up.

2778
01:46:39,020 --> 01:46:43,100
He like told like we we were in a so we filmed together in Montauk,

2779
01:46:43,100 --> 01:46:46,180
which we shot most of the movie on Long Island, like just outside of Manhattan.

2780
01:46:46,180 --> 01:46:49,820
But we filmed for a week in Montauk and Kyle's scenes with me were in Montauk.

2781
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:53,700
And we shared a van to Montauk together. Wow.

2782
01:46:54,020 --> 01:46:56,500
And I don't know how it came up, but it always comes up to me.

2783
01:46:56,500 --> 01:47:00,340
I was like, do you like rides like, you know, like, like, hey, think about it.

2784
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:03,700
And he was like, I was just on with my friends on podcast, the ride.

2785
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:05,020
And he talked about you guys.

2786
01:47:05,020 --> 01:47:07,060
Wow. Oh, no kidding. Wow.

2787
01:47:07,060 --> 01:47:08,820
Yeah, for real. Oh, geez.

2788
01:47:08,820 --> 01:47:10,660
Love connecting these these dots.

2789
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:12,940
Oh, it's a movie with both of you guys.

2790
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:18,820
Big theme park fan credibility in the cast of this film rooting for it so much.

2791
01:47:19,380 --> 01:47:20,940
You're going to like him in this movie a lot.

2792
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:23,140
It's very, very silly what he does.

2793
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:25,740
Oh, great. Oh, excited.
