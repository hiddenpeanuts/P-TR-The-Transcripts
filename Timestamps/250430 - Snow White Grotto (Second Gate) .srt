00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,480
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the second gate, where the episode you're hearing today is

2
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:34,000
actually a re-recording of this episode that it was initially recorded years ago. I'm Jason

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,560
Sherrod and joined as always by Mike Carlson. Yes, I'm here and this is a re-recording. If

4
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:47,480
you're lost already, wait a second. It's a little tease. No, I know. I'm just saying. Scott Gehringer

5
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:54,400
also here. Yeah, well I was just excited because you offered to do the joke and you said, got it,

6
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,800
I'm going to improvise it based on one of the six facts about what we're talking about. Sorry,

7
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,760
just do the behind the scenes of it. It got me excited. It got me amped up and then we got

8
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,600
there and it was that. Yeah, you did skillfully repurpose one of the things that there is to talk

9
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,040
about. There's less facts about this potentially than there are characters in it. That's true,

10
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:24,200
yeah. Potentially, but also there was more than I thought there would be. There was a lot

11
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:33,680
and this is how waterfalls work. Did you learn how waterfalls work? Well, technically. Gravity?

12
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,120
Kind of. Force perspective business. Did you learn about the history of wishing wells like I did? I

13
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,480
looked up wishing wells. Oh no, but I'm thrilled to learn about this. Were we supposed to go that far?

14
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,800
Oh shoot, I should have gone further. I should have learned about the history of wishing. Well,

15
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,560
that would have been good. That would be one step deeper, I guess. Who was the first to wish?

16
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,120
It was Walt Disney. Walt Disney was the first to wish. He owns the trademark on it. That's why

17
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,880
he got everything that he got. That's how it all came together. It was the power of wishes. Exactly.

18
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,640
And he taught us all and ultimately for Disney 100, the story of wish reminded us that Disney

19
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:18,320
is synonymous with wish and it reminded us how powerful a wish can be. What are the names of

20
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,120
wish? It was like, cause there was that, remember when we were all in Disney world and the wish

21
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,440
characters were starting to pop up and there was one, I feel like Griffin especially was like,

22
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:33,440
look, it's like Kroll from, it's not that. It wasn't Kroll, but you know what I mean? It was

23
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,480
some sound. Yeah. What was the character? What kind of a character was it? Trow. Look,

24
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,240
it's Trow. That's not the star. I don't know. I don't know. My mom bought my daughter a wish,

25
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,720
a little kid's wish table. She goes, I don't know what this is, but the table was on sale.

26
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,160
So now my daughter sits at a little wish table and a little chair. Okay. Am I thinking of Asha?

27
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,480
Look, I cannot tell you who you were thinking. There is not a character named Trow. I cannot

28
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,840
help you. There's no Kroll. Asha, I think it's the main character. Are you thinking of Krod

29
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:11,940
Mandoon? Mandoon, what is his name? Well, I typically am the fellow member of the Comedy

30
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:18,580
Central family. Yeah, Krod Mandoon. Krod Mandoon. I believe is a fantasy barbarian similar to Conan.

31
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:24,960
We've never, I don't think we've ever vocalized that Chris Pine plays King Magnifico. We've never

32
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:31,020
said the words Chris Pine is King Magnifico. That's true. That sentence has never been uttered. Yeah.

33
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,420
Sorry so late on that. Everybody was wondering. King Magnifico. I like that name. I kind of,

34
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,060
yeah, there's other, well, I think we would, if we found out King Magnifico was original

35
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,620
IP and epic universe, we would be all about King Magnifico. Well, that's true. That's a good point.

36
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:52,100
Same name. You just put it there. It's a character you can only meet. Yes. In this park. Right. For

37
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:57,860
like 10 months or so until they reevaluate. Are we doing the characters? My contract's only nine

38
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:05,780
months, so I'm a quick King Magnifico. Quick in and out. Are you doing it? Did they get you? We're

39
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,540
still negotiating. Fingers crossed. It's nearly a done deal. They gotta see that thing. Hey,

40
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:18,980
just to give an update, Go.com is still encouraging you to check out Wish and 2023's Haunted Mansion.

41
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:26,740
Really? Yeah. That's on the main page? Yeah, on basic HTML, in basic HTML on the main page.

42
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,620
Oh, that's right. When we looked up Go.com, yeah, they were locked in time. It's just a big text

43
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:39,060
page about the new things that Disney has, like Toy Story land. Wow, yeah, that's exciting. Also,

44
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:45,140
what's Dashing Through the Snow on Disney Plus? Eddie Garrick and his daughter are taken on a

45
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:51,940
magical adventure after meeting a mysterious man in a red suit named Nick. No, Nick. Nick in a red

46
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:57,220
suit. Say no more. That might just restore his faith in Christmas. This is not Tim El. There's

47
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:04,980
no Tim Allen in this. No, this has, who am I looking at? Ludacris. Whoa. This is a Disney

48
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:10,980
even better. Plus original film starring Ludacris that none of us have heard of until right now.

49
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:16,340
Wow. I like that. I mean, I like that. Ludacris is Eddie Garrick. Oh, he is. He's turned his back

50
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:25,860
on Christmas. Come on. Boy. Who's Santa? Do we know? Lil Rel. Oh, wow, okay. I like Lil Rel.

51
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,380
I mean, I can't tell if he's Santa or just in a Santa suit. Wait, no, is Lil Ray?

52
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,900
Lil Rel. Lil Rel. Are you thinking of some old time singer, Lil Ray?

53
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,660
I'm thinking of another pop that we didn't get. Lil Ray in the flash tones.

54
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:49,300
Also, they didn't put it up yet on Go.com, but I saw online this morning that Tim Allen did confirm

55
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:58,100
that his character in Shifting Gears is conservative on taxes. While I was setting up,

56
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:04,340
I texted that to Anthony Geo that Tim Allen's character on Shifting Gears believes that too

57
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:09,780
many taxes hurt small businesses and they're just trying to survive. Who just want to take care of

58
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,820
their employees, of course. But that was in a Hollywood Reporter article. We need to get to

59
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:20,900
the topic, but there's so much Shifting Gears lately. What is it with you guys? Oh, the two of

60
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:26,100
us? There's so much network television being discussed arbitrarily every week. That's true.

61
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,420
Jason knows. Where does Shifting Gears come from? We're back. We're so back. We're locked in.

62
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:37,700
On what? We've not fallen off network television. Oh, bad. Oh. We're locked in. I've just heard a

63
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:44,260
lot of behind the scenes leading up to the debut of Shifting Gears, and I feel invested in it in

64
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:49,780
some way. I've never seen the show other than clips and following the social media. Spoiler

65
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:57,380
alert, Tim's character, Matt, I think is having a romance with Jenna Elfman. So I'm following the

66
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:04,180
show on Instagram. All right. You know what? I had my doubts, but after that, I can't help but say,

67
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:11,940
we are so back. We are so back. Tim plus Dharma? Yeah. The Dharma Initiative? Sixth Come Royalty

68
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:18,740
together. Go.com is not telling us Checkout Shifting Gears. I'm wondering if whoever was

69
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:25,700
updating it was caught in one of the mini rounds of Disney layoffs. Well, maybe, perhaps. I don't

70
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:31,060
know if we'll be able to tell. And on his way, he was being dragged out the door by security and

71
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:38,340
yelling, but if you fire me, what will happen to the page updates on Go.com? People heard that

72
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:44,580
thought for a sec. I think we're fine on that one. There'll be hopefully seven to nine seasons of

73
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,380
Shifting Gears to dig into eventually on this show. So we'll have time, I think. As many as there are

74
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:55,780
dwarfs. Good. I did it. Now we're back. There you go. Hey, we're back. I'm going to be fending off

75
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:02,980
Shifting Gears tangents, I feel like, every 10 minutes, every episode until you guys work this

76
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:07,700
out of your system. You'll have a little summer break. As if that's going to stop it. But there'll

77
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,820
not be as much Shifting Gears information for me to consume during the summer, I think, unless they

78
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,620
announce a new cast. I mean, I'll say that if I could go out for Shifting Gears next fall to join

79
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,180
this show, then that's a whole... I could beg for Shifting Gears. Now that you're saying it, I was

80
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,300
ready to take the talk off the table, but now maybe I should campaign to be on Shifting Gears all

81
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:33,780
summer. Maybe if I make a big show of it. I think they're going to send something fishy in your

82
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:38,500
voice. They're like, this guy's up to something. Please. I don't know that he likes this show in a

83
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:47,060
pure of heart way. I do. I'm conservative on Tim Allen on TV. You could play Kat Denning's hinge

84
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:53,620
date one episode. Sure, I'll do the hinge date. She explains to Tim Allen the apps and he's like,

85
00:08:53,620 --> 00:09:00,340
hinge, bumble, what is this, a bumblebee stuck in a screen door? And we're going to be pitching

86
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,900
for Jason to be a writer on next season. That's what we're going to do all summer. So thank you,

87
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:10,260
Scott, for giving us an agenda. We're doing it. We have our mission. We got to get Jason on Dr.

88
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:18,660
Odyssey and a writer on Shifting Gears. So without further ado. Fun fact about Shifting Gears,

89
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:24,900
all of the actors are the same size, so they got to stagger them for the camera. And we're back

90
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:32,500
again, Scott. With a great non-tortured joke, the cleanest. Again, you've proven your capacity

91
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:38,580
for writing for Shifting Gears. Shifting Gears. The tidiness of a good force perspective tie-in.

92
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,540
Opening jokes of the show. Pokéball. What about Pokéball? Tim's probably going to raise his

93
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:49,220
eyebrow at a Pokéball, don't you think? Hey, this fish isn't cooked. Yep. What is that voice?

94
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:55,220
What did you do that again? This fish isn't cooked. What is, what voice is that? That's Tim Allen

95
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:01,460
being cranky. That's Tim Allen? I don't know what. This fish isn't cooked. What? That's not it.

96
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,620
He was a little bit of a goon from a vague Eastern European country. Yeah, I thought it was a little

97
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:10,820
Eastern European. Wait, you do an impression of what Jason said. This fish isn't cooked. Yeah,

98
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,700
it's like an old guy. It had a weird like mumble to it. So you saw it more as like an old Manchester

99
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:21,220
by the Sea kind of guy. I read a little euro into it. Well, Scott, that's called giving up

100
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:26,980
before you finish saying the joke. You know. That's called abandoning it because you're like,

101
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:33,060
oh no, this is really, this is not really good. He should have said aroo. That's what he should

102
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:39,300
have said when he saw Pokéball. Look, in the room, we know we got a few hard rules about writing for

103
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:45,460
Shifting Gears and it's like, we don't do the aroo unless Tim pitches it. You know, he doesn't want

104
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:50,260
to get bogged down. He's allowed, we're not allowed. Hannah, that is not a joke, I'm sure.

105
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:59,380
That has to be real. Yeah. All right. The more I say, the more in four months, there's a

106
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:04,500
Frank and Jason get to do the Shifting Gears thing they've wanted to do. Club 3 punishment.

107
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,380
I know how these things go. A legend is born. But for now, let's talk about an actual theme park.

108
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:18,180
Yes. Snow White Grotto. Yes. I don't like that tone either. Why? Yes. Snow White Grotto. Yeah.

109
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:24,100
I will say sincerely, I love this area. I think it's one of the most chill places at Disneyland

110
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:31,220
and it's very charming. Well, it's a very stop and smell the roses kind of place. That's an indicator

111
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,300
of a non-rushed, chill, looking at details kind of day. If you stop and take a minute

112
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:45,780
over in Snow White Grotto. Basics, basics here. You're looking at the castle. You're about to

113
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:51,540
walk through the castle into Fantasyland and you say, no, maybe not. Because something catches your

114
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:57,460
eye over off to the right. There's a little lush area with some greenery and a waterfall

115
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:04,180
and some statues. And you go off that way into a little alcove sort of near the castle where

116
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:09,300
there is this very pleasant little display of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves and some animals

117
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,780
all rendered via, I mean, initially marble, but I think that changed at some point. But it's just

118
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:22,420
this nice little relaxing courtyard that pays homage to Snow White outside of Sleeping Beauty

119
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,860
Castle. So if you can get your head around the properties being mashed up, if that doesn't bother

120
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,660
you, then you can have yourself a moment of peace. Look at some nice old statues. It doesn't bother

121
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:40,580
me. I'll say that. That's fine. Does it bother you, the mashup? No, because I often have to do

122
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:48,340
Sleeping Beauty Castle, Cinderella Castle, Snow White Wishing. I forget who is- Who owns which

123
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:53,220
castle? Who owns which item. This is something we didn't talk about and we sort of recently did

124
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,140
an episode about Sleeping Beauty Castle on the main feed. That was something I wanted to bring

125
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:02,420
up in Sleeping Beauty Castle is, do you guys have trouble remembering which princess belongs

126
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:08,980
to which castle, which it seems like maybe you do? Or alternatively, do you get mad if others

127
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:15,060
get them confused? No and yes. You do. You don't get them confused and you do get mad when there's

128
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:21,220
confusion? Yes. So I'm mad at you. Because I'm sure, and I'm sure listen. I was going to say yes and

129
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,340
no. More normal options. We've got to get you guys back to shifting gears so you can be getting along

130
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:31,860
again. We're not on the same page anymore. We were and now we're not. Because even

131
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,940
we were prepping for Sleeping Beauty Castle and I brought up to Erin that we were doing that and

132
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,900
Erin said, which one's that? And she's pretty versed. She goes to the push. She's a parks person.

133
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:48,340
She listens to us blab on most of these episodes, unless it's about puppets, which I affirm she was

134
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:53,940
not listening to. Was that the one where you asked if you wanted to go to Backstreet Boys though?

135
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:58,180
Yes. So she didn't hear it. Oh, wow. Yes. She would not have heard.

136
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:04,260
She went more of like an in-person lecture. Like we can pop over while we're all in Burbank now.

137
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,540
We could bring a puppet over. Is that what you're saying? Yeah. I think that would help her get her

138
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,900
head around. Yeah. Yeah. No. If she looks in the keyhole of the house at some point and there's

139
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:20,740
just, there's a big puppet of Alf staring down, I think she'll welcome that into the house.

140
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,660
Mike has all the scary pictures. I got him for Christmas and his birthday.

141
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:31,060
What scary pictures? The Paul Winchell picture. He got me a Choco the Clown picture. These are on

142
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:37,060
episodes you were not on. He gifted me things at the end of the episode. So this is a real test.

143
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,700
He wasn't trying to test you, but he did both of these at the end of episodes. So I was gifted a

144
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:47,460
Paul Winchell picture with his two dummy friends on the photo. And then I was given a Choco the

145
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:54,340
Clown picture as well, including a book about a Choco the Clown that was not the Choco the Clown

146
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:00,740
we talk about. A different Ringling Brothers Choco the Clown. It seems like I really missed out.

147
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,740
Yeah. So, but Jason ordered it before he looked into what the book was.

148
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,140
Believe it or not, that name's not so unique. I just got too excited when I saw the book.

149
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:14,260
But I do feel like everybody messes up the princess. I don't think that's, I think that's

150
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:19,940
a common, very common. Yes. Yeah. But I feel like if you scoured the archives of the show,

151
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:25,380
I bet you would hear a moment of one or all of us that somebody is talking about just this,

152
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,540
the magic of being at Disneyland and looking at Cinderella Castle and then, then all our,

153
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:34,980
most of us go, it's like Beauty Castle. It's something we can't help ourselves from, but do.

154
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,700
It's a positive, it's a very positive facet of us, I think. Yeah. No, it's.

155
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,020
Who doesn't like being quickly corrected under their breath.

156
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,660
Right. About something that doesn't matter. About a pretty arbitrary.

157
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,060
Yeah. But whatever, it doesn't matter really.

158
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,620
It's a struggle doing the show sometimes. Some of the confusion I think comes from the fact

159
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:59,940
that does either castle really feel like either princess? You know what I mean?

160
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,180
Because if you watch the movie Sleeping Beauty, it's not really her castle.

161
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,260
It's a much bigger castle in the movie. It's a much bigger castle.

162
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:06,820
Yeah. Yeah.

163
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,540
And then, you know, Cinderella Castle, that's not her castle till the end.

164
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,860
Right. You know, that's not what it's called when the events of the film start.

165
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:22,980
You have to go be inside to see that there's dioramas of these and murals of Cinderella.

166
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:28,500
Right. Yes. So I, yes, it's not like she's always waving to you or something. It's not like it's,

167
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,980
it doesn't, there's not a big sign outside both castles that say which princess belongs to which

168
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,780
one. Yeah. Yeah.

169
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,980
But I get that. Have we like talked much on the show about,

170
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,620
I'm sure we have, because we've talked about Christmas parades over the years,

171
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,100
but when you talk about Cinderella waving, just what I immediately fleshed to is the,

172
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,140
there was a runner on all of the Regis hosted parades where there'd be a shot of her waving

173
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:54,100
from her coach. And then Regis would say, there's Cinderella. Where's my kiss? Cinderella,

174
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:59,620
give me my kiss. I want it. Give me the kiss. There we go. There's the, and he wasn't in it.

175
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:05,300
So there was not some forced like physical contact that was not asked for or desired from

176
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,460
Cindy. You know, it was just a blow of a kiss. But he never said like, Joy said it was okay.

177
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:16,900
I asked Joy. Get a hall pass. That's a phrase I Regis invented. Who's allowed to kiss you outside

178
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:22,340
your marriage? Yeah. I don't, I think that was just, that was sort of thought of as cute.

179
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:27,940
Oh yeah. I thought, no, I, I looked for it when those were happening real time every year,

180
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,900
that was like one of the moments that I would look forward to was Regis demanding his Cinderella

181
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:37,460
kiss. And then at some point, whenever they replaced the hosts, they like tried to like

182
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,660
hippify it or something by going with like younger TJF stars. And I'm like, you mean I

183
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:47,940
don't get to see Regis asked for a Cinderella kiss this year? Maybe I turned this program off.

184
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:55,540
I mean, they could have made up a little skit with Regis. Does he ever, did he ever get a kiss from

185
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:01,060
Cinderella? I mean, I don't know about physically. He got, he wanted, he wanted a, like a blown kiss.

186
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,980
He wanted a what kiss? He wanted a blown kiss. Like yes. Yeah. Yeah. Like through the, through

187
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,940
the camera, through the magic television, he had to be in the booth. I guess that's okay.

188
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,700
It's completely okay. Well, that's, that's a question. How do we all feel? Do we feel like

189
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:20,820
being blown a kiss is allowed? By a princess though? What if it's a princess? I don't know.

190
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:26,820
Well, I think you have to ask the question blanket. Is it cheating if someone blows a kiss at a married

191
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,380
man? Okay. Hold on. Hold on though. And all what, if all of our wives might be listening,

192
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,860
this is a real test. They're there. They need to hear the right answer or all the marriages are

193
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:41,620
over. I think if you request the kiss loudly on television, it's, it's, it gets in that territory

194
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:48,020
of cheating. Well, I think a couple of things. I think it's cheating if you grab the kiss.

195
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:55,780
Oh, and put it on your mouth? Yeah. You grab it. A kiss is blown and then you pantomime, taking it,

196
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,660
rubbing it all over your mouth. Yeah. That's pretty aggressive. That's definitely upsetting.

197
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,060
You've never seen someone like grab a kiss? I don't think I have seen a grabbed kiss before.

198
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:11,700
It's a cute little like, and then you just kind of. Wish we were on video for that. That makes me think,

199
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,660
you know what would be really upsetting is somebody being blown a kiss and then somebody

200
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:19,300
else gets in the way and grabs it for themselves, runs away with it, puts it in their pocket for later.

201
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:25,620
Oh yeah. A stolen air kiss. Yeah. I mean, that's, that, that's a prisonable offense, I believe.

202
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,700
You could reaffirm your commitment to your wife by grabbing it out of the air and throwing it on

203
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,660
the ground and stomping it. Oh yes. That's what you should do. Putting it physically in a trash can.

204
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:40,260
That works too, yeah. Or pantomiming like a shredder and. Right, yes. Or that might be tough

205
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:45,620
to sell. You have to say out loud, this is a paper shredder. Make the noise, shred that kiss up.

206
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,740
Like a Michael Winslow. I don't want it. Even just an aggressive like dodge, like a spin move.

207
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:58,580
If you got a hood, you put the hood up and blah, like no. No. That's the honorable thing to do.

208
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:05,540
I am married. You are a home wrecker, Cinderella. No kiss for me. Yeah. So I think that's, I think

209
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:10,900
we settled that. Great. All right. So any of our wives who are listening, just know we will never

210
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:16,900
accept that air kiss from anyone. No. That is how committed we are to you, our princesses.

211
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:22,100
Unless on my instance, it's from Joy Philbin. Your hall pass. My hall pass.

212
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:30,980
Joy's with us still, right? I believe. Is she? I think so. Joy Philbin is alive. I believe Joy

213
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:37,220
is still alive, yeah. Regis has passed away a few years ago. Joy's still alive, yeah. Well,

214
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:42,740
so it could happen. What is the place we can get you? Well, this will be a test of the marriage,

215
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,660
I guess, if you were somewhere where Joy Philbin was. If she was even the grand marshal of a

216
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:51,220
parade, which seems like the kind of thing Joy Philbin might do. I think so. I think so. Well,

217
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,980
be on the lookout. Is there a joyphilbin.com announcing her upcoming personal appearances?

218
00:20:54,980 --> 00:21:00,340
No, I don't know. Jason, look into that. If she had an Instagram account, you would be following

219
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:04,020
it. That is true. If she had an Instagram account, you would have already tried to squeeze an episode

220
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,900
out of it. That's true, but you would have been following it because you would have probably

221
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,580
posted Regis stuff, classic Regis stuff. I don't know if it's enough. I don't think I need

222
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:17,300
day-to-day Regis in my feed. Really? Not really, no. Is there a day-to-day Regis Instagram that

223
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,780
I can follow? This is going to be the first episode where we don't come back to the topic.

224
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:27,220
It's possible. I think we said what we had to say. There's other interesting stuff. Jason hasn't

225
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:33,780
gotten it. We need to turn to Jason to tell us how waterfalls work. Why don't you explain how

226
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:40,180
waterfalls work while Mike and I completely check out and just look up, are there Regis fan accounts

227
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:46,980
on Instagram? Regis fan cam? You guys do that. Okay, so there's some conflicting stuff about

228
00:21:47,060 --> 00:22:00,340
the creation of this grotto. There are some websites who say their eight boxes just showed

229
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:08,980
up at the Disney lot one day anonymously, and they had these statues inside. Yes, they arrived

230
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:14,740
in wooden crates from Italy with no return address and no indication of who might have made and sent

231
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:21,540
them. This is per John Hench, Imagineer, so that's a trustworthy source. I ask this though

232
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:26,340
right away, if there was no return address, how do you know it's Italy? Good point. Did it smell

233
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:36,340
of pizza pie? That must be what it was. Sauce. I read a couple places, but then there's a D23

234
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:44,660
article about it, and they credit an Italian sculpture named Leonida Parma. Sculptor.

235
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:50,580
Sculptor. Yeah. Yeah. And he... There's that little correction. Yeah. Well, I got confused

236
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:55,700
because I thought he was influenced by a sculpture. You thought a sculpture made them. Yeah. Yeah,

237
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:01,460
a living sculpture was the artist of sculptures. So they're saying that it was commissioned,

238
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:08,100
but the thing, the anecdote that keeps getting repeated is the problem was the dwarves in Snow

239
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:16,020
White were the same size, and maybe the Italian sculptor never saw it, but he had a gift box of

240
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:23,300
soaps where they were all the same size. Yes, I saw this anecdote as well, that he... And in very

241
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:28,420
much Mike and Jason fashion with the TV shows you're obsessed with, that the Italian sculptor had

242
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:34,820
not ever seen the movie Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Go ahead, yeah. So he was going based not

243
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,340
on the film, but on soaps that he had. He was tributing, I saw these little soaps. I love the

244
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:46,180
little soaps. I say I make you big soaps, but the big soaps would melt in the mail. So I made them

245
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:54,340
out of marble, but I made them as white as soap. Right. I mean, that's cool. Soap white, I call her.

246
00:23:54,340 --> 00:24:00,340
This is a very strange story. A man was a fan of soap, so he made eight statues and sent them to

247
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:11,380
Disney. Yeah. What is this tale? I guess it's so specific, maybe I believe it. Yeah, I don't know

248
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:17,540
what's real and what's story, like what's K-Fame, what's Disney myth-making. But it's not even that

249
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:23,060
fun to be completely made up. Right. It's stranger than you would be like, if it was just like,

250
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:27,460
oh my gosh, these immaculate dwarves showed up. We never knew where they came from or whatever.

251
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:35,380
And seven squirrels dragged them in little tiny boxes adorned with, it's like just a guy like-

252
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,300
And some deer with their mouths took the crate apart. That's really Snow White.

253
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:46,580
That's nail by nail. They acted as- Right. But I guess it's true. I mean, I guess-

254
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,860
They unscrewed the screws with their little deer teeth.

255
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:56,020
Right. I guess it's true. I mean, I guess. I guess it's so strange. It must be true.

256
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:59,380
Well, here's what I'm finding now is that something that you can buy

257
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:09,620
for $180 on eBay is a soap set for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs from 1938. This is a-

258
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,820
Look at the miscoloration of this old-ass soap. Wow.

259
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:22,420
Yeah, like very yellow and red. This is very strange. I guess in very Snow White fashion,

260
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:26,580
like what happens to her in the movie, they're all in little coffins.

261
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,860
Oh my gosh. They're all in little,

262
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:32,740
it's like coffins of stuffing. Anyway, this is, yeah, this is old soap that you can buy,

263
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:39,620
modeled in castile soap, painted with harmless vegetable color. And it's signed by Lightfoot

264
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:47,700
Schultzko, so makers of fine soaps for over 27 years. So this is a weird old product that

265
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:53,540
you can buy. Anybody who wants this, you can buy some old soaps that look like $180.

266
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:58,740
Jason, would you wash with that soap if I got it for you?

267
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,100
Soap from 1938. I'm assuming it's mostly

268
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,900
arsenic, so I don't know. No, they said harmless vegetable oil.

269
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,860
They said it's fine. They said, I believe these guys.

270
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,780
I think that company turned into Old Spice. That's what I'm looking here.

271
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,220
Is that true? I think.

272
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,220
Oh, interesting. I was going to joke,

273
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:22,500
like what was the original company name, Scott? Lightfoot Schultz.

274
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:27,860
Lightfoot Schultz episode comments. William Lightfoot Schultz was the

275
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,940
early American Old Spice. Now it sounds interesting

276
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,060
if it evolved into Old Spice. Yes, and we're going to, you're going to

277
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:37,780
wash with each seven dwarf in the bath, each soap, and you're going to see how.

278
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,180
And then we smell him every time. That's right.

279
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:44,340
He shows up for a record and we try to guess which one, I'm like,

280
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,060
feels like Sneezy to me. That's right.

281
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,900
We'll guess. We'll see if we're right.

282
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,180
And then also just determine which smells the best.

283
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,100
So, you know, seven dwarfs in Snow White, so that's eight.

284
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,940
So it's eight whiffs adjacent that we, that each of us take,

285
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,540
and then we determine which was the most effective snow dwarf.

286
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,740
It's going to be a very exciting summer between that and the shifting gear stuff.

287
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,780
That's all I know. Well, because he mints,

288
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,220
an episode you catch the repeat. Yeah.

289
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,620
I know it's on Hulu, but it's not as fun because you don't see the brands and the ads.

290
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,820
They might've changed the ads, the brands. They probably changed the brands.

291
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,180
Podcast The Ride is coming to life for summer 2025.

292
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:32,580
We're talking soaps from the thirties. We're talking current sitcoms that anyone could

293
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,180
just watch now. That's right.

294
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,700
We're talking about the new tide with Oxy.

295
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,580
How many people are sending weird like soaps to Disney these days?

296
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:49,860
I bet they're, I bet they get weird stuff. I bet people send Disney.

297
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,940
I don't know if anyone's sending them the soaps.

298
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,580
I'm not these. So I'm just saying new soaps.

299
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,420
There must be a soap maker somewhere in the world who's a fan of Disney and is like,

300
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,980
I'm going to make soaps for Disney and I'm going to send them to them.

301
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:07,780
But that's not what happened here. This was a licensed Disney product that was soaps.

302
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,100
They weren't sent the soaps, but I guess the question remains,

303
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:16,500
is anyone out there such a big Disney fan that they're sending Disney character soaps?

304
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,940
It's such a big company. They have to get one big weird thing a day in the mail.

305
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:27,380
One of them has to be soap. That's just a guess. Maybe I'm wrong.

306
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:32,500
But in the last year, did Disney get a novelty soap in their general mail box?

307
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,740
They probably get, and I don't know how often, because again,

308
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:44,100
they're a massive company. I bet they get stuff from kids. I bet they get people sending things

309
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:52,660
to characters. Imagine all the mail that's meant for Santa Claus, but imagine that with

310
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:58,340
1,000 characters who kids want to write to. Like Captain Magnifico or whatever his name was.

311
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:02,980
So many people are writing to Captain Magnifico. Was it King Magnifico? I forgot already.

312
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:06,020
I'd prefer to not know. I'd prefer for this to be a game of telephone,

313
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,580
and that we decide now that he's Captain Magnifico.

314
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,980
Right. How often are you going to hang out at Disneyland by this well?

315
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,540
This is probably a once every five years kind of situation.

316
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,980
Every five years. I think it's more frequent for me, but not frequently.

317
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,980
I feel like it's one of the places I'll go chill out in the same way I'll go by

318
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:35,860
the Grizzly River Rapids area. So many different little trails and paths there.

319
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,860
This is obviously the wishing well. The grotto isn't as big, but it's in the same way where

320
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:44,820
you're like, it's usually a low traffic area. It is. It's interesting that there is something

321
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:52,820
that's so easy to miss potentially next to one of the most famous landmarks in the world.

322
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:58,580
Right, yes. I don't know what it is about it. Interestingly landscaped or set up,

323
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:06,900
that somehow it can feel tucked away despite being feet away. People are taking the most pictures

324
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:15,380
ever. It's unclear if you can get from those little side entrances to Fantasyland too.

325
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:19,220
Everything is a little bit mysterious back there. I think I forgot that you could

326
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:24,340
enter that way. You can enter Fantasyland. It is a side entrance.

327
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:29,060
Right. All that is a little obscure. Again, this is good. This is the magic.

328
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,900
That would be my argument. This is the magic. If you go to the left side of the castle,

329
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:40,580
you'll end up in Frontierland. You'll end up in a Mexican restaurant in Frontierland.

330
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,700
Well, if you go by Fantasy Fair. Yeah, Fantasy Fair.

331
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,580
Though there is a left entrance to Fantasyland too.

332
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,220
Yes, yes. There's two little

333
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:55,620
entrances to places that aren't so advertised. This one, it's all mentioned. The Snow White

334
00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:00,260
Grotto is not really on maps. It's just a stumble upon.

335
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,540
You've got to know where to go. You've got to know where to go.

336
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:11,220
You can see it from a distance and it is interesting, but it is pleasant landscaping

337
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:17,940
and a wishing well in the waterfall. All of that was said. This is the environment

338
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:26,580
for these statues. Whatever the story actually is, whether it was just a soap enthusiast who

339
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:31,940
took it to the next level or whether Disney did actually commission these or if they were just

340
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:40,340
sent mysteriously, a further step of the John Hench situation was that Walt said,

341
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:45,940
these are great. We should put them in the park. And John Hench said, I'm worried about these

342
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:55,460
because if you look at them, they're very nice, but they're also all white. If you aren't careful

343
00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:00,420
with how you present them, quote John Hench, it could look like a graveyard. It could look

344
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:06,500
like the place where we buried the dwarves. It's something that John Hench said to Walt Disney,

345
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:11,780
who apparently said to him, that's not my problem. Get that out of your head, John.

346
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:16,340
You need to think of a nice way to put these in the park. So there was a little fight.

347
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:20,740
These showed up. It was a bunch of junk. Not John, I guess they're beautiful.

348
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,220
They were marble originally.

349
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,500
Yes. Yeah. All right. I shouldn't say that eight marble statues were junk,

350
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:32,580
but it was Walt going, you figure this out. John said, I don't know. Don't these look like

351
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:39,380
headstones to you? No, you grim asshole. Figure out something nice. And thus they figured out

352
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:44,340
a waterfall and carving out a little extra nature. And then yes, as you referred to,

353
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:49,940
this issue of Snow White was built to be the same size as the dwarves.

354
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:56,100
So it's forced perspective techniques. The dwarves are at the bottom of the waterfall.

355
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:01,540
Snow White is at the top of the waterfall and she's got a small deer next to her.

356
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:09,300
So they look further away. The thing about the waterfall is that waterfalls usually in nature

357
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:15,700
are wider at the top. And then they, like a funnel kind of, you know, get narrower at the bottom.

358
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:21,460
They did the reverse where it's narrower at the top and then it gets wider at the bottom.

359
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:26,260
So your eye is seeing. Like all the forced perspective architecture that we end up talking

360
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:31,140
about where they start building roof tiles smaller and it like creates kind of a slant.

361
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:40,180
Yeah. Interesting. And the other Walt story was he's like, John, I really like this, but you know

362
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:47,700
with this waterfall, with this pond, like people are going to be throwing change in there. You know

363
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:53,060
people are going to do that. And then they settled on like, well, let's put a wishing well next to

364
00:33:53,060 --> 00:34:02,260
it where people can throw change. And the change to direct people's like, oh, I don't want to throw

365
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:06,500
it in this thing. I'll throw it in this thing. And you get a wish then. And you get a wish.

366
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:11,700
You get a wish out of it. An official Disney wish. Thoughts on wishing wells, pro or pros or cons.

367
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:19,940
I haven't made a wish in a well in a long time, but I did when I was little.

368
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:25,540
Isn't that what happens? You have kids start forgetting to put wishes into wells.

369
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,260
Yeah. So I haven't done it in a long time.

370
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:34,420
I must have the most childlike wonder because if I see a wishing well, I am making a beeline for it.

371
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,300
To make a wish.

372
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:40,020
Yeah. And I'm looking for change. If I don't have change, I'm like, it's people I'm with.

373
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,020
You throw a credit card in there.

374
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,940
Yeah. I'll just throw up. Chase freedom's got too confusing.

375
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,180
Yeah. You can get a replacement pretty quickly.

376
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:54,500
And if you don't have one of those nearby, then you reach inside, scoops up some of the change

377
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:58,420
that's already in there and throw that back in. Or maybe pocket it for yourself.

378
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:04,100
That's okay. Well, there is a grate. So supposedly the grate is in the wishing well

379
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:09,540
to prevent mischievous children from hopping in and scooping change.

380
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:15,300
Could also be a safety thing or just a drainage thing.

381
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,700
When is the last time you made a wish in a well?

382
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,700
I don't really know.

383
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,420
Last five years?

384
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,780
If I see a fountain, I'm throwing a five.

385
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,380
Oh, you're making a wish in a fountain too.

386
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,500
I don't know. It kind of depends on the vibe of the fountain.

387
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:35,780
I might just like throwing the change in and watching this splash and seeing it settle and

388
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,660
seeing the other.

389
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,620
You'll put change in a fountain, but not necessarily wish.

390
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,700
Yeah, I would say so.

391
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:48,020
And can I ask what size wishes are we talking? I hope I have a nice dinner tonight. Are they

392
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,540
some sort of bigger thing? You don't have to reveal the wish. You can if you want, but...

393
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,060
Oh, I need to hear them. I want the wishes listed.

394
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,060
No, they don't come true if you tell them.

395
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,020
Yeah, but they're from the past.

396
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,100
I'm trying to work them into it.

397
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,580
I'm trying to trick them into it. Okay.

398
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,140
I'm trying to trick them.

399
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,660
I know my wish is to hear his wishes.

400
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,980
Yeah, I know what you want. I want it too.

401
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:10,980
I think it depends. I think it's like have a really nice rest of the day,

402
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,500
or it could be like a larger...

403
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,660
Okay. Then you go back and forth.

404
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,100
Yeah, love sort of thing. Now I got love locked down.

405
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:22,420
I got this little ring here. I'm all set. I'm good.

406
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:26,820
You didn't always, and maybe you have wishing wells to thank for that.

407
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:31,940
Love locked down. Whoever does that song, I don't know. I don't remember.

408
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,860
Not worth trying to recall.

409
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,100
Yeah, let's not dwell on that.

410
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,340
Leonida Parma, I think was the name of that artist.

411
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,300
That's right. I think that's good.

412
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:47,380
I wish for a little ring to have a little love in my life, and then that's how it all happened.

413
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:51,300
Leonida, what does the Parma estate have to say about this?

414
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,820
The what estate?

415
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,540
The Leonida Parma estate.

416
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,580
I'm assuming he's passed by this point.

417
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:02,820
Well, that's the thing. I don't know that you end up with an estate just because you've passed away.

418
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,420
I think everyone has an estate. That's technically what it's called.

419
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:06,980
Okay, I see.

420
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,940
Yeah, legally.

421
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,580
Estate sounds grand, but I think that's the term.

422
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:14,500
It just implies that there's people working over there, the estate.

423
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,220
It seems very big. It seems big in scope.

424
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,420
So we all get estates?

425
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:18,980
I believe so.

426
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,780
We all have estates.

427
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,460
Oh, well, there's a little wish that came true.

428
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:27,380
Even if it's just on paper. Yeah, I'm looking a lot about estates recently.

429
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,020
Oh, right, right, right. That's our subject.

430
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:38,500
No, no, not at all. No, but it is both a grand word and then also like, oh, this is illegal.

431
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,380
This is just what forms say.

432
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,260
I see, I see.

433
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,900
Just what notarized forms refer to.

434
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:49,140
I think it's because then you could say palatial estate also means

435
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,180
a bunch of land.

436
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:55,860
I think my only confusion is I think of it as the Michael Jackson estate.

437
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:01,380
I think of it as an entity that has enough people working for it to make a press release,

438
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,580
but I guess that's not true.

439
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,700
There is a Leonida Parma estate.

440
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,420
Yeah, of course.

441
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:06,920
Okay.

442
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:14,260
I'm going back to an old thing that I was really obsessed with for a while and still don't quite

443
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:21,460
understand. The statues that are there now are simulacrum, simulacra.

444
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,300
They are not the original statues.

445
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:32,260
The original statues were made of marble, but they started to discolor just from natural aging.

446
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,620
Like this old soap, yeah.

447
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,300
Yeah, like the old soap.

448
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:39,140
So then they replaced them with fiberglass replicas.

449
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:44,500
So the original statues were simulations of 2D animation.

450
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,260
The current statues are simulations of simulations.

451
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,140
You mean like 3D models is what you're saying?

452
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,780
No, no, like the original statues were the copies.

453
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:03,940
They were based on one thing, but then right now what you have is fiberglass copies of copies.

454
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,820
Okay, so you mean like recreations?

455
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,020
Is that what I'm getting confused by?

456
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,300
They're recreations.

457
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:15,300
I believe might have gotten, maybe they've been replaced multiple times, but

458
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:22,500
some of this was beefed up during the 1983 Fantasyland redo.

459
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,020
So it's what I'm looking-

460
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,420
Another frequent Jason wish is getting beefed up

461
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,940
by which you just have a nice big beef dinner.

462
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,440
Well, sure.

463
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:35,660
Sure.

464
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,280
Yeah, I mean, I was going to say like they don't, I'm trying to remember, because we have,

465
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:45,800
when I say we, I mean my daughter now, but my sister and I had Seven Dwarfs action figures,

466
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:50,760
but they were kind of hollow-y figures because I've said this anecdote on the show, I'm sure before,

467
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,400
I was obsessed with the Seven Dwarfs as a kid, and there were no figures.

468
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,920
They did not make figures when I was four years old or whatever.

469
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,400
And then they re-released Snow White, and I think maybe

470
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,800
then they started getting some merchandise back out there.

471
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,920
But my father, I was sick.

472
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,840
My father said, I'm going to go to the store.

473
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,480
What do you want?

474
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,360
I can get you anything.

475
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,920
And I said, I want Seven Dwarfs action figures.

476
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,520
And he said, all right, I'm getting them for you.

477
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,680
And my mom was like, they don't make those.

478
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,960
Why did you agree?

479
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:22,920
So we found like seven little rubber ninjas at like Walgreens.

480
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,160
And he goes, hey, these are the Seven Ninja Dwarfs.

481
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:25,660
Here you go.

482
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,600
And you bought it?

483
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,160
Yeah, I bought it.

484
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:29,660
Yeah.

485
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,160
Okay.

486
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,320
I was like, all right, whatever.

487
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,040
Ninjas were hugely popular at the time.

488
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,080
Sure, yeah.

489
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,560
But then we did get, finally, a year or two later,

490
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,840
like these fairly nice looking Seven Dwarfs.

491
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,480
And I do feel like the things I'm looking at here

492
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,520
look more like those.

493
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,480
And those looked more cleaned up than the original animation to me.

494
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,280
Those more look more like how they would draw the Seven Dwarfs

495
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,840
in newer materials or whatever, like in a newer poster

496
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,840
versus in the classic animation.

497
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,720
Now, maybe that's wrong.

498
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,000
Maybe these aren't newer designs, but they look like these to me

499
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,600
from just the naked eye.

500
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:08,920
The existence of the Dwarfs being one of the oldest properties

501
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,560
in the first animated film means that I think there was ample time

502
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:19,240
for them to be created in a lot of odd and upsetting forms, I feel like.

503
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:19,880
Sure, yeah.

504
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,960
By the time you're getting those action figures,

505
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,160
they're kind of rounded off in the way we do nice toy designs.

506
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,360
But I'm sure at some point we talked about the premiere

507
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,160
at the real Carthay Circle in the 30s

508
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,200
and how there were these costumes that were just beyond terrifying,

509
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:39,480
like burlap sacks with just gigantic, huge dilated pupil eyes.

510
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,720
And I saw, I was looking at photos of the Snow White Grotto.

511
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,400
And this is technically the reverse.

512
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,040
Imagine, just for a second, that you're leaving.

513
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,320
You're taking it in and like, oh, it's nice to have kind of a calm day

514
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,960
to just look at the grotto and reflect a little bit.

515
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,400
Well, I'm sure glad I stopped by.

516
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,840
And then you turn around and you see this.

517
00:41:59,320 --> 00:41:59,820
Blah.

518
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,120
An old dwarf costume.

519
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,840
This is happy, I believe.

520
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,560
Yeah, it sure is.

521
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:10,360
One of those scary, this is a very 70s style we're looking at.

522
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,320
And maybe it's not, I think it's just, it's something about the position

523
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,720
that he's like, he kind of looks like he's about to charge at you, I think.

524
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,360
And the kind of head, like the old Winnie the Pooh was like this too,

525
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,840
where the head is like half the body, the head goes all the way down to the waist.

526
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,480
Yeah.

527
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,760
There's definitely, this is not quite how they do them anymore.

528
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,160
And yeah, I don't know.

529
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:31,800
It's a little upsetting.

530
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,160
There's a lot of scary dwarfs out there.

531
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:37,560
It kind of looks like, and I'm not just saying this because I passed,

532
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,200
well, I am just saying this because I passed couple today,

533
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:46,120
but it looks very similar to the billboards for the woman in the yard.

534
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,560
Oh, I see, I see.

535
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,120
I have seen this.

536
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:48,680
I have seen this.

537
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,180
Yeah.

538
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:56,680
Just in terms of like greenery in the background and then like a sinister figure in the foreground.

539
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,520
It's not about a big dwarf though.

540
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,680
It's about a woman with like kind of a scarf.

541
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,120
It's a woman in the yard.

542
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:08,760
She's a spooky lady in a yard and she very quietly says today's the day.

543
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,720
Oh, I like that.

544
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,360
That's good.

545
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,480
Are you going to watch it?

546
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,200
Are you going to do it?

547
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,120
Because maybe that could be part of our summer extravaganza is that voice.

548
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,720
Well, it should hit Peacock, I'm assuming by the time.

549
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,200
Perfect.

550
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,120
And you don't have to go to the theater.

551
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,160
Summer is popping off for PTR 2025.

552
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,640
Reviews of horror films from three months ago.

553
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,040
Oh, well, you know, with that little dialogue, the thing,

554
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:39,720
the other thing I've been thinking about was just the Britney Murphy horror movie

555
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,480
where she goes, I'll never tell.

556
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,480
Yeah, what's that called?

557
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,000
I don't remember and I'm reasonably certain it's her though.

558
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,440
That's not, it wasn't like that though.

559
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,480
It was like sing-songy.

560
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,800
It was, I'll never tell.

561
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,300
Yeah.

562
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,080
The woman in the yard is kind of sing-songy.

563
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,760
I'm probably not doing it justice.

564
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,960
Summer's popping off.

565
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,560
Misremembered quotes from horror films from 21 years ago.

566
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,280
I can't remember.

567
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,120
Even the trailers spook me, they give me the creepies.

568
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:09,720
That's why.

569
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,320
Are you going to make it?

570
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,360
I was too scared.

571
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:16,040
Last October, you were making the big horror movie push and you got to one movie.

572
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,000
Yeah, I got the one and it was very strange.

573
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,880
And which is Halloween three, which is a favorite.

574
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,480
It's a fan favorite.

575
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:28,600
It's very interesting and odd, but it is.

576
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,360
You seem to, again, this is always, I'm always interested when you see a movie

577
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,680
and you have that reaction because generally you go, it was good.

578
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,400
I liked it.

579
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:40,120
So when you have this, when you like it, but it is, it has really unsettling.

580
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,640
It's got a weird vibe.

581
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:41,880
Yeah.

582
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,880
And on purpose, like I see why it's become a fan favorite.

583
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,280
So there's a horse in a horror movie.

584
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,400
Have a weird vibe.

585
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:49,880
I think so.

586
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,440
Yeah, no, I did like this movie.

587
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,960
It just, but I can see it in your body when you talk about it.

588
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,760
That you're like, yeah.

589
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,000
And it was so strange in ways I wasn't expecting.

590
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,680
It seemed like an old like BBC movie.

591
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,040
Can I get you to watch the two hellraisers this Halloween?

592
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,640
Yeah, I do want to watch.

593
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,120
Okay.

594
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,120
I know they have a lot of things to show me.

595
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,840
That's I've heard about that.

596
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,760
They sure do.

597
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,560
There's a lot of things beyond pleasure and pain.

598
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,280
I know those lines.

599
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:20,920
That's true.

600
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,520
You're going to love it actually.

601
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:23,320
Yeah.

602
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,200
An erotic thing.

603
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:25,640
Yeah.

604
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,160
I'm winking at him in case you didn't know.

605
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,080
Jason's going to get horrified.

606
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,840
Jason's going to get turned on by Hellraiser?

607
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,520
Yeah, that's what the movie's about.

608
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,520
It's about, it's like, it's a horny movie.

609
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:34,760
Yeah.

610
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,240
Were you turned on by Hellraiser?

611
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,280
No, not at all.

612
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,160
But Jason will be.

613
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,040
Yeah, but he's a freak.

614
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,000
You've heard him on this show.

615
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,200
Well, it's been established in the lore, I suppose.

616
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,040
Right, that's the podcast to ride lore.

617
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:48,520
Anyway.

618
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,720
Because I'm a square and he's a freak.

619
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,200
Specific thing about the Snow White, Wishing Well.

620
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,000
Really, that's-

621
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,840
That transition back from Hellraiser.

622
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,040
No, there's a reason.

623
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:00,920
No, go ahead.

624
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,760
That song, the, I'm wishing, I'm wishing.

625
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,200
Keep going.

626
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,040
Kind of gives me the creep.

627
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,520
I'm wishing.

628
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,680
That is what it's saying, does Sam.

629
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,640
I'm wishing.

630
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,040
Just the song in general.

631
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:22,120
Like, I love the Ones Upon a Dream song.

632
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:26,280
Yeah, from Sleeping Beauty, right?

633
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,360
I Knew You Once Upon a Dream, yes.

634
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,920
Yeah, with the bird, with Bird Prince.

635
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:32,440
Right, right.

636
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:38,200
That song is like light years ahead of the like, I'm wishing.

637
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,280
I'm wishing isn't a big fan favorite these days.

638
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,120
I feel like it hasn't held up as well as-

639
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,400
Well, it got replaced.

640
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,000
It's not in the new movie.

641
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,440
Right, oh, is that right?

642
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:54,920
Yeah, they replaced it with more of a Disney Princess want song.

643
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,800
So maybe that felt like some current desire to revamp it

644
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,280
and use more with that space narratively.

645
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,280
But me, I'm disgusted by all this I'm wishing slander

646
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,680
because I'm a big fan of the song.

647
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:09,480
Really?

648
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,720
Yes, because it has one of my favorite moments

649
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,240
in Disney animation ever.

650
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,760
You're down at the bottom of the well.

651
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,720
You're looking up at her.

652
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,840
She's singing in the well.

653
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:21,240
It's doing a duet with her own echo, basically.

654
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:28,600
But so you end with, to find me, to find me, today, today.

655
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,560
This is-

656
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,800
I love the prince today.

657
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,520
Yeah, that is the bellow.

658
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,360
That's one of my favorite things ever.

659
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,840
The today is very funny.

660
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:40,760
We got a message in a mailbag when Jason was gone,

661
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,600
which was like, Scott, who are some of your favorite bellowers?

662
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,880
And I didn't really want to repeat.

663
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,200
I didn't want to just do Thrill Raven's Cloth

664
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,200
to open the fence to the castle.

665
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,240
So I was vexed.

666
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,640
I was like, I need a new bellower to bring in.

667
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,600
And I'm sure it's not new.

668
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,640
I must have mentioned this before.

669
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,480
But I love to do that.

670
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,680
Because for just a few things here, ladies,

671
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,080
imagine that you're having yourself

672
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,200
a nice little moment in nature.

673
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:13,000
Maybe in your own backyard, just kind of singing to yourself

674
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,840
and just kind of having a moment of peace.

675
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,480
I mean, if it's just not that song,

676
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,320
if you're just humming whatever to yourself,

677
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,360
which is la da da, la da da da da.

678
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:27,400
And then out of nowhere, a foot away from you, da da da!

679
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,600
You turn.

680
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,880
Who the fuck was that?

681
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,520
A strange tall man is telling you.

682
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:37,720
It's a man in a flouncy shirt and a flouncy hat

683
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,000
with a big feather.

684
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,320
I do like today.

685
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,680
Jane will do the I'm wishing, I'm wishing.

686
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:45,640
I don't know why she's doing it.

687
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,480
She's got to let you do it.

688
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,320
Jason's the master of I'm wishing.

689
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,680
But then she will also do today.

690
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,280
I love it so much.

691
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,840
If you watch it in the scene, she does get scared.

692
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,840
And she does run away.

693
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,840
And he says, no, don't run away.

694
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,680
And then by the time she gets up to the balcony,

695
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,440
I guess she's had a little bit of a change.

696
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,080
She just needs some distance, understandably.

697
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,280
When a man shows up and screams into your ear,

698
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,760
you need a little, you need to back off a bit.

699
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,680
And then, oh, and speaking of like kiss blowing,

700
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,880
then that's kind of what happens.

701
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,720
Then he starts kind of a second part of the song.

702
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,560
And it's the other thing that I love

703
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,480
of music from this era from the 30s,

704
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,280
that A, that's what men sounded like back then.

705
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,560
And B, then when he kind of does his star part,

706
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,840
he bellows so loud that he distorts the microphone.

707
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:45,400
And it is an absolutely, like we all, we remember I'm wishing,

708
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:50,360
but his part is just like, oh, what heavenly blues.

709
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,080
And it's like, it's all cutting.

710
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,360
It's like, it's so distorted.

711
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,680
The 30s microphones can't handle it.

712
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,320
And you're watching it like, this is in one of the most

713
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:04,760
like crucial movies of all time, this guy.

714
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,680
And then he'll turn, like he'll watch like a,

715
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,120
I think she sends a bird down.

716
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,080
Oh, that's what it is.

717
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,400
It's all so strange if you actually watch it,

718
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,400
that a bird comes up and she kisses the bird on the mouth.

719
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:21,320
And then the bird flies down to him and then pecks his mouth.

720
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,480
So it's kisses exchanged through birds.

721
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,640
Now that's totally different.

722
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,560
That our wives should allow.

723
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,840
Blown kisses, no.

724
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,760
Kisses exchanged via bird.

725
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,120
I'm sorry, I'm a man.

726
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,880
I have needs, okay?

727
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:39,000
If a sexy lady kisses a bird and then the bird kisses me,

728
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,520
I'm accepting it, all right?

729
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,080
Yeah.

730
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,640
Yeah, Mike and I both had dogs, you have cats.

731
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,480
They're always giving you little kisses.

732
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,120
Oh yeah.

733
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:46,680
But they're not transferring.

734
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,160
I am constantly kissing my cat at home.

735
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,600
But if a woman comes in and kisses Scott's cat,

736
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,920
and then the cat kisses Scott is what he's saying.

737
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,400
Yeah.

738
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,640
He's saying there's a transfer of this.

739
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,520
That's a little way.

740
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,720
Some of that spit is cat, but some of it

741
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,920
is a sexy lady.

742
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,040
That's a hack.

743
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,080
That's a kissing hack.

744
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:07,720
Here's a way.

745
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,440
I want to exchange spit within the confines of marriage.

746
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,800
Use a cat.

747
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,760
It's so funny to me.

748
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:17,320
The whole thing.

749
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,120
And then when he turns his head and watches the bird fly away,

750
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,560
his face gets so weird and bulbous and distorted.

751
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:29,080
Because he was the first animated realistic man,

752
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,080
at least in Disney animation.

753
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,360
Because everything before that was cartoon proportions.

754
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,120
And I guess you could say the same for Snow White.

755
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,320
But even she's a little bit.

756
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,720
I mean, they did the thing where they watched a dancer

757
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,440
and studied her movements and drew over her.

758
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:46,360
But I think this was very hard to do.

759
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,320
And it shows.

760
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,280
It's really strange.

761
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,600
There's a little bit of Polar Express creepiness in it.

762
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,880
So much so that it limits the prince to where he

763
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,360
doesn't show up again until the end.

764
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,440
It's very strange, the whole movie,

765
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,400
that he appears then once,

766
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,360
plants himself in her dreams via bird kisses.

767
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,280
There's no introduction.

768
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,640
There's no my name.

769
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:13,160
He's only known as the prince through the whole movie.

770
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,960
And then he shows up when she has died.

771
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,040
That's a thing you also forget about Snow White,

772
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,120
is that it's not even like Sleeping Beauty.

773
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,920
She's under a spell, basically.

774
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,120
She might not wake up.

775
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,840
If you watch the title cards, Snow White is dead.

776
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,320
And they explain that the dwarves are keeping Vigil

777
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,000
and that they built her a coffin.

778
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,640
And they built a coffin for her.

779
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,920
And they go and they take Vigil there each day.

780
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,600
So you're watching like an umpteenth.

781
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,880
I don't know how many days it's been,

782
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,440
but all these old men take their hats off.

783
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,800
Every one of them bald.

784
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,560
That's also a fascinating thing.

785
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:45,880
Every dwarf is bald.

786
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,480
Are they related?

787
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,600
That's a good question.

788
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,480
Are the dwarves brothers?

789
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,600
We've also discussed this before.

790
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,400
Yeah, are they brothers?

791
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,800
Are they not supposed to be magical?

792
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,080
I don't know.

793
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,200
I don't feel like maybe the original grim fairy tale

794
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,200
has more insight into this.

795
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,000
No, not really.

796
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:01,240
No.

797
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,520
Some of them are foolish.

798
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,360
Well, how many are foolish?

799
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,120
One for sure.

800
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,240
I guess groupie for sure.

801
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:08,040
Yeah.

802
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,240
They're all a little foolish.

803
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,360
They're a little silly.

804
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,360
Doc is pretty in control.

805
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,160
It's going to keep me up at night.

806
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,280
Do you need to?

807
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,080
Well, it's tough because there's not one called foolish.

808
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:23,880
Sometimes happiness can make you be a fool, much like love.

809
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:28,680
But anyway, it's a really strange situation that they're all sad

810
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,600
and their animal friends are all sad.

811
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,000
And then the prince shows up on a horse,

812
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,520
doesn't introduce himself to her actual friends,

813
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,280
walks up, gives her a kiss.

814
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,760
She wakes up, immediately gets on the horse with him and leaves,

815
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,360
leaving her actual friend.

816
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,880
She spent so much more time with these dwarves than the prince.

817
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,800
She barely met the prince.

818
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,320
I didn't care about the prince at all.

819
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,560
No, he's the most forgettable.

820
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,040
Yeah.

821
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,920
Disney progressive, in a way, in the 30s,

822
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:01,560
have such an absolutely forgettable, unnamed character who is male.

823
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,640
Kind of a reverse of the trend.

824
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,160
Well, I felt that way about the prince in Sleeping Beauty.

825
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,840
Even though he's more, he does a lot more.

826
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:09,960
He fights Maleficent.

827
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:10,440
Yeah, yeah.

828
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:10,760
No, with that.

829
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,280
But I still didn't care about them that much.

830
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,160
No, not really.

831
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:17,000
But yeah, it steps way forward.

832
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:17,960
Wait, and he has a name.

833
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,640
So he's, I was going to say Prince Charming,

834
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,080
but Prince Charming and Cinderella.

835
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:21,880
Prince Valiant?

836
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,560
I think it's Prince Valiant.

837
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,720
But not, but that's a different Prince Valiant.

838
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,440
No, it's not your.

839
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,560
It's a Sunday comic.

840
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,040
Not your Sunday funnies, Prince Valiant.

841
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,000
Is it Prince Valiant?

842
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:33,480
Maybe it's not.

843
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,360
Oh, no, Prince Philip.

844
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:35,720
Shit.

845
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,280
Wrong.

846
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,080
Damn.

847
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:37,640
Embarrassing.

848
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,560
Again, we don't know the movies.

849
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,240
We know the parks.

850
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:45,800
And even then, there's still big lapses in knowledge and awareness.

851
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,880
I'll tell you what movie I do know,

852
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,360
and I don't mean to contradict myself.

853
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:56,840
But while I'm wishing the song gives me the willies a little,

854
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,920
you were talking about songs from the 30s.

855
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:03,880
I love from 42nd Street, We're in the Money.

856
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:10,120
And that kind of has a similar tinny, the original ones.

857
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:14,200
Like, we're in the money, the skies are sunny.

858
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,800
Do they sing it high like that?

859
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,200
We got a lot of what it takes to get along.

860
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,200
It's pretty high.

861
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:24,760
And usually, in productions, I believe when we saw,

862
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:29,000
and when I saw on a cruise ship at 12, and then in the movie,

863
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:35,080
they're often wearing giant coins, costumes.

864
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:35,880
Really?

865
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,440
Yeah.

866
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,600
Big coins dance and sing that song?

867
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,640
Big coins dancing, yeah.

868
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,640
And you could use those to wish.

869
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,080
Well, fuck.

870
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,200
Only in a giant well.

871
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,000
In a giant well.

872
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,240
Turn them in a wave pool.

873
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:48,860
Yeah.

874
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:53,900
I just also was like, if we're going to meditate on today for a second,

875
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:54,860
I want to know who it is.

876
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:56,380
I want to know more about the guy.

877
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,380
The guy's name is Harry Stockwell.

878
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,060
Harry Stockwell does that today.

879
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,860
He had a recording career outside of it.

880
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:07,500
The thing I found the most fascinating is that when he sang this, he was 35.

881
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,000
Wow.

882
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:11,980
This is the way 35-year-olds sang in the 30s.

883
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:12,480
Yeah.

884
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:17,500
This is a young, fashionable, hip way of singing.

885
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:23,260
And I got curious about the rest of the recording career of Harry Stockwell.

886
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:24,780
So please enjoy.

887
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,740
And I guess Jason, I especially want to get your ears on this song,

888
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:29,660
because it'd be up your alley if anyone.

889
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,820
This song is called You're Devastating.

890
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:35,820
With a crackle.

891
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:42,060
You're devastating and so far above me.

892
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:48,060
To think of mating, I never could dare.

893
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:48,860
I forgot that.

894
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:54,940
To think of mating, I couldn't dare.

895
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:55,440
Wow.

896
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:05,020
Who would dream of filling up your womb, passing my seed into your bountiful.

897
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:05,520
Wow.

898
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:08,220
Blood by the birthplace.

899
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:09,740
I don't know.

900
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:10,300
What do you think?

901
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,260
I think you should sing that on the old ones.

902
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:20,620
I think, yeah, I'm going to have to go home and serenade my new wife.

903
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:23,500
That's going to be in your Spotify rap this year.

904
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:28,220
It'll mark it.

905
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:28,860
It'll happen.

906
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:35,660
You can find it on a playlist called The Crackliest Songs of the 30s.

907
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:36,940
40s.

908
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:37,420
It's that.

909
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:43,820
It's one of the songs from the Forgotten Lady Gaga Harley Quinn album,

910
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:46,220
where she sings a lot of standards.

911
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:46,700
Oh, yes.

912
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:46,940
Yeah.

913
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:48,060
The wonderful music.

914
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:48,540
Right.

915
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:49,340
Well, yeah, I agree.

916
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:54,140
Hey, Jane, the marriage is still fresh to me.

917
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,700
Maybe this is corny, but I just got something to say.

918
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:02,300
You're devastating to me.

919
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,540
Your beauty astounds me.

920
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:10,220
Oh, two mates would be a debate within my heart.

921
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:12,060
This was the language.

922
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:14,380
She shuts door, car drives away.

923
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,260
Music of love.

924
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:16,060
Never seen again.

925
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:17,660
Music of love.

926
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,380
You would have, if you sang that to a woman, they would marry you on the spot.

927
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:21,500
She would swoon.

928
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:26,460
You're so devastating Lady Gaga's rendition of Owen the Saint's.

929
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:28,060
That's in the mood.

930
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:28,700
Okay.

931
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:31,100
No, that's not, I think, just the album.

932
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:32,380
That's just an album cut.

933
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:33,580
Yeah, it's the album cut.

934
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:37,180
It's a deeper album cut where you can hear kind of Harley Quinn sing

935
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,020
when the saints go marching in.

936
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:39,500
What happened?

937
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,660
I thought this movie had a $200 million budget

938
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,420
and then all the songs are public domain.

939
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:44,940
I guess that saves some money.

940
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,860
I'm surprised this isn't Jason's favorite movie.

941
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:49,020
I haven't watched it yet.

942
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:49,660
I could see that.

943
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:50,940
I think this might be her-

944
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:54,540
Joker, falled, apologist, Jason Sheridan.

945
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:55,020
Yeah.

946
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,540
Her tie-in record.

947
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:58,220
He's going to like it.

948
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:00,460
Was kind of unattached.

949
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:01,100
Yeah, I don't know.

950
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:04,380
Does she do That's Entertainment?

951
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,660
Yeah, she does That's Entertainment.

952
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:06,140
Oh, God.

953
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,060
This is going to be your favorite movie you've ever seen.

954
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,580
But I don't know if it's in the movie.

955
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:12,380
These might be the album-specific cuts.

956
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:13,020
Okay.

957
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:16,300
They do an amended We're in the Money called We're on the Staircase,

958
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:18,860
the famous staircase.

959
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:21,740
We're not dancing to Gary Glitter anymore.

960
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:25,580
Taking real big steps as we walk those stairs.

961
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:28,940
We're doing splashing, big old splashing.

962
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:32,060
Batman is not here, please stop asking.

963
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:34,700
Who?

964
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:38,620
Wait, the thing you said about they re-recorded the voice.

965
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:41,020
Yeah, the original voice actress came back.

966
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:43,580
When they redid it in the 80s.

967
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,500
When they redid it in the 80s.

968
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:45,900
Well, yes.

969
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:50,220
And she, a story apparently is that she's been,

970
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,300
much of this is 50 years later.

971
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:56,380
And I think she believes she could still hit the high notes.

972
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:58,300
Like actually, Jason, could you give us a sample

973
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:00,620
of the high notes that she was trying to hit?

974
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:02,060
I'm wishing.

975
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:02,940
That's pretty good.

976
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,860
That's the note, I think.

977
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:05,180
Yeah.

978
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:10,060
Well, this is what Adriana, whatever, could not necessarily hit.

979
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:12,140
And knowing that she would have to be replaced,

980
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:14,700
she asked if she could go ahead and ask someone for help,

981
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,780
even though she was alone in the studio.

982
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,380
The engineer and producer said,

983
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:20,300
okay, but you are alone in the studio.

984
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,060
I don't know who you're going to ask for help.

985
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:24,620
And she said, just wait.

986
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:26,300
And then she turned away from the microphone,

987
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:30,380
looked up and whispered, Mr. Disney, if you are up there,

988
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:33,020
please help me find Snow White's voice.

989
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:35,180
She returned and asked for one last take,

990
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:37,180
during which she nailed every note.

991
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,740
Yeah, up there.

992
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:42,060
Maybe, I don't know about that direction.

993
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:43,580
Yes, I am up here.

994
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:46,940
I was actually reviewing your SAG sign-in sheet,

995
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:48,380
and we overpaid you.

996
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:49,340
You owe me money.

997
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:50,620
As soon as you make it up here,

998
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:53,340
you're cutting me an $80 check, missy.

999
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:55,500
That inspired her.

1000
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,860
Oh, Roy's up here.

1001
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:57,900
I'm down here.

1002
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:02,460
Wrong direction.

1003
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:03,660
Wrong direction.

1004
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:05,180
Anything else?

1005
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:06,380
Do we get to everything?

1006
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:06,940
It's nice.

1007
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:07,420
Check it out.

1008
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:11,740
They've reproduced it for Hong Kong Disneyland

1009
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:14,300
and Tokyo Disneyland.

1010
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:15,500
Yeah, I didn't realize that.

1011
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:16,860
They redid the little grotto.

1012
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:20,860
But there's a Cinderella wishing well in Florida.

1013
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:21,340
Yes.

1014
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:21,740
Oh.

1015
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:22,940
It's a different thing.

1016
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:23,980
And no statues?

1017
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:28,300
I don't believe so, but that's obviously tied in

1018
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,620
thematically to the castle.

1019
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:31,740
That's more of a piece.

1020
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:35,660
So eventually we'll determine if we think that's better

1021
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:38,540
or if we like it, that it's two different properties.

1022
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:43,020
It made a big mess when that naughty Stitch teepied

1023
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:46,940
the castle and some blew in the wishing well

1024
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:48,220
and then it got all wet.

1025
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:52,220
What would it sound like if Stitch sang, I'm wishing?

1026
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:57,820
Hooray.

1027
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:59,740
I hope he toilet papers the castle again

1028
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:00,940
for the live action one.

1029
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:01,660
Let's do it.

1030
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:02,220
Come on.

1031
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:03,740
And make it a cake too.

1032
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:04,860
Yeah, make it a cake.

1033
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:07,740
Oh yeah, that icing's getting all in that toilet paper.

1034
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:10,940
Well, I think we did it.

1035
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:13,340
I think you survived podcast the ride the second gate,

1036
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:15,500
which thanks for subscribing to the second gate.

1041
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:29,020
in club three, I know it sounds funny for these guys

1042
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:32,140
to just talk about shifting gears while I grimace for a while.

1043
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,460
Will it be?

1044
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,020
Will it be?

1045
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:38,140
Am I causing it by saying this?

1046
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:38,940
Probably.

1047
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:42,540
But just take a hard look in the mirror or in a reflection,

1048
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:45,500
like in a wishing well, as Snow White does, and think,

1049
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,460
do I want to hear these guys talk about this Tim Allen

1050
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:49,820
sitcom for two hours?

1051
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:51,980
That they haven't seen.
