1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,080
Hello and welcome to a very special podcast,

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,000
The Ride the Second Gate, where when the cat's away,

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,600
the mice will rock.

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,200
I'm Scott Gardner joined by Mike Carlson.

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,720
Yeah, just Mike Carlson, not Jason Sheridan.

7
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,680
That's the end of the introduction.

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,520
Jason Sheridan is not here.

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,760
Dad is not home.

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,800
Yeah, yeah, so we can make a real mess of it.

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,880
I should also say great grandfather is not home,

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,600
not just dad, because that would put him in the category

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,960
of someone who likes a rock and roll from the 60s and 70s.

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,560
Which he kind of does, but.

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,400
Yeah, I think he does.

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,440
That's the thing, he's not anti-me.

18
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,480
I just feel like he, you know, Jason's more into like,

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,600
you know, turkey in the straw.

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,040
He loves camp, his favorite song is Camp Town Races.

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,960
Yeah, he loves the classics more.

22
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,320
It works out because all of Jason's favorite songs

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,520
are now in the public domain, so he's free to perform them

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,920
in any published media.

25
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,720
So he will release a single of Polly Wolly Doodle

26
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,200
all day very soon.

27
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,160
Just a photo of him smiling with a 40s radio mic.

28
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,440
There's a, and I'm sure we'll do a Patreon on this,

29
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,360
there's an album that I really like called

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,840
Bill Frawley Sings the Old Ones.

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,920
And that's William Frawley from I Love Lucy, Fred Mertz.

32
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,880
He sings like,

33
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,520
Pretty baby, pretty baby.

34
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,960
And it's a full album of it.

35
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,720
And he's got like a straw hat on the cover, I think,

36
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,480
and like an old timey, like colorful striped suit.

37
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,760
So I assume, Jay, I should show it to you if I haven't.

38
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,880
Sure.

39
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,040
This sounds familiar because I had a book growing up.

40
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,280
Did you ever come across a book called Hollywood Hi-Fi?

41
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,160
I don't think so.

42
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,800
You would really like Hollywood Hi-Fi to this day.

43
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,280
I was a weird 10, 11 year old where I got a bunch of books

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,000
about like kitschy, bad bullshit.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,800
I had a really good book about bad TV,

46
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,600
I had a really good book about the worst movies ever made,

47
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,080
and I had a book called Hollywood Hi-Fi about actors

48
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,120
and movie and TV stars trying to start music careers

49
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,880
in sort of a usually ill-fated manner.

50
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,000
But that opened me, I do recall William Frawley

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,160
being in there, it's why I am still a devotee

52
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,440
to the Crispin Glover album.

53
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,280
Right.

54
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,320
The big problem does not equal the solution,

55
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,840
the solution equals let it be.

56
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,280
And there's, do you know about the Burt Ward album

57
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,280
with Frank Zappa?

58
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,440
We talked about that before.

59
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,280
We haven't talked about it, but I do know about it.

60
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,360
I've heard a little of it.

61
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,480
That a pre, his career blowing up Frank Zappa

62
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,480
was for some reason hired as the like studio hired gun to.

63
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,040
Try to get Burt Ward's career.

64
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,200
Which man, he was like still rebelling within it

65
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,920
and putting in all these weird, you know,

66
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,840
like banging on a bicycle wheel and all this shit.

67
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,000
He was still innovative, yeah,

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,560
trying to be subversive in the music,

69
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,440
instrumentation I suppose you'd say.

70
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,280
Yeah, yeah.

71
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,440
Here's the cover.

72
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,480
In a straw hat, yes, that's exactly Jason's album cover.

73
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,320
Yeah, we'll post this.

74
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,200
Yeah, he's in a straw hat and a stripe.

75
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,880
It's sort of a dapper Dan's.

76
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,840
Very much so, yeah.

77
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, with the barber shop.

78
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,120
But maybe even more colors.

79
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,440
Oh my God, a full album of Jason

80
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,280
just singing public domain.

81
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,640
What else is on there?

82
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,880
What does Bill Fronley sing?

83
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,400
Let me see here.

84
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,960
This is a low rise image.

85
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,760
What the fuck am I singing today?

86
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,680
I think.

87
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,440
You get two takes and I'm out.

88
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,880
He was, I think a big pain in the ass

89
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,680
from what I've ever read about him.

90
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,640
But the kids on My Three Sons really liked him

91
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,120
because he was really drunk all day

92
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,080
and he was like happy.

93
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,720
And then they would have to go like get him, I think.

94
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,880
They would have to like, the producer would be like,

95
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,160
go get Bill from lunch and he'd just be like wandering.

96
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,440
And obviously he didn't want to go back to work

97
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,320
because he didn't care.

98
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,600
But they would have, this is all on some YouTube video

99
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,440
I watched 10 times.

100
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,040
They enjoyed, the My Three Sons enjoyed waking

101
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,600
Bill Fronley out of a drunken stupor.

102
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,840
Now that I'm thinking about it,

103
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,920
I think they were actually speaking in comparison to,

104
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,640
I forget the gentleman's name who replaced William Fronley.

105
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,200
So William Fronley was in ill health

106
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,360
and they replaced him with like a different relative,

107
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,960
another cranky old man.

108
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,800
Oh, okay.

109
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,240
And they did not like him.

110
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,080
Okay.

111
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,120
And I think he was not drunk all the time.

112
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,320
But they really liked Bill.

113
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,680
They would just have to sometimes go like bring him over.

114
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,720
But I believe Vivian Vance on I Love Lucy hated him.

115
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,000
They hated each other.

116
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,840
That's funny.

117
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,280
Well, they used it.

118
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,120
Yeah.

119
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,200
And I feel like, I think Desi Arnaz

120
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,480
gave him a talking to about like,

121
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,360
I know you're a drunk,

122
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,280
but if you ever show up drunk to set your fire.

123
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,360
Even though he was probably a drunk as well,

124
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,360
he just could not show up.

125
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,760
He could just wait till three o'clock.

126
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,280
What I mean, coherently drunk.

127
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,120
Yeah.

128
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,920
Pretty Baby, Moonlight Bay, Swanee River,

129
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,840
for me and my gal, dear old girl,

130
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,240
meet me tonight in dreamland, June night.

131
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,440
These are all Bill Fronley songs.

132
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,040
Carolina in the morning.

133
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,120
If you were only the girl in,

134
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,960
I'm clicking,

135
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,840
in the world,

136
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,680
if you were the only girl in the world, excuse me,

137
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,480
shine on Harvest Moon by the light of the silvery moon.

138
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,600
Ha ha ha ha, movemently.

139
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
I wonder who's kissing her now.

140
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,160
You wouldn't do blue moon though.

141
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,000
That's too rockin'.

142
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,240
No, too modern, yeah.

143
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,080
Yeah.

144
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,080
And that trash outta my ears.

145
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,280
My melancholy baby.

146
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,520
And cuddle up a little closer.

147
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,240
Bill Fronley sings the old ones.

148
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,640
I think it's just, well, these are all covers,

149
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,440
but I think Jason Sheridan sings.

150
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,280
Origins.

151
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,200
Bill Fronley sings,

152
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,800
wait, sorry, what?

153
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,640
Bill Fronley.

154
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,480
Sings the old ones.

155
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,320
Sings the old ones, okay, yeah.

156
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,160
So Jason Sheridan sings,

157
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,680
Bill Fronley sings the old ones.

158
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,800
Okay, great.

159
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,240
One take each too.

160
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,640
I'd like to think that,

161
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,560
if Jason listens to this after the fact,

162
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,440
that he already has like said out loud to himself,

163
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,640
oh, yeah, Swanee River slaps.

164
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,800
Seems possible.

165
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,840
Sicko mode, he would say, like Travis Scott.

166
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,360
Yes, he described our show as sicko mode.

167
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,760
Hopefully he doesn't listen to this

168
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,800
and then we can just have, if you're a listener,

169
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,680
just tweet at him that you would like him to do this.

170
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,520
So he just thinks it's- Yeah, yeah,

171
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,360
find that album cover.

172
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,320
William Fronley sings the old ones.

173
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,920
And just, yeah, send it to him just with a question mark

174
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,760
or like when, when.

175
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,080
When are you doing this?

176
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,920
Make it seem like a groundswell of need for this.

177
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,760
There's like the everyone on Patreon needs him.

178
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,280
Make it seem like, you know,

179
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,920
trying to bring a canceled show back to Netflix or whatever.

180
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,280
Yeah, yeah, we need to.

181
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,920
Cause I'm sure I can find like just the basic karaoke tracks

182
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,600
for all, for most of these.

183
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,840
And I'll just put it in his headphones and he has a one try.

184
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,560
We recorded this live.

185
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,520
Just do it live.

186
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,880
If he fucks up, that's it.

187
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,240
That's the track.

188
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,600
That's how these old albums are probably recorded.

189
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,920
100%. We got here for an hour.

190
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,480
So let's record for an hour and whatever it is,

191
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,480
that's the record.

192
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,280
We'll put the lyrics in front of him.

193
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,240
He'll probably nail it.

194
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,880
Yeah, it'll be perfect, honestly.

195
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,600
He knows them all by heart.

196
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,520
All right, so that's not rocking.

197
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,840
That's a future, that's a future Jason related music endeavor.

198
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,800
But here's what we're doing here today.

199
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,600
He's out of town, but we wanted to keep

200
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,120
the content ball rolling.

201
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,200
We have to keep the content ball rolling.

202
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,160
So here we are.

203
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,920
And we thought, you know, when I was in Japan,

204
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,240
you guys did an episode without me,

205
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,680
an area that is of less interest to me

206
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,600
with your Marvel mania, flushing out the,

207
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,960
not that I'm not interested in the theme menu.

208
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,680
I just don't have the Marvel depths of knowledge

209
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,560
that you guys do.

210
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,680
And so we were like, what can we do

211
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,600
that Jason wouldn't care about missing?

212
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,720
And we have sort of caught that he doesn't care much

213
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,200
about rock music, or at least not,

214
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,280
and that's not entirely true.

215
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,840
I guess he likes, he's named check bands

216
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,920
that he likes for sure.

217
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,160
He likes the new pornographers and that's about it,

218
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,000
I think.

219
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,840
Oh really?

220
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,680
Well, I mean, he likes more.

221
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,520
It's a good choice if it's gonna be your one.

222
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,160
I think he likes the strokes.

223
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,000
He does like the strokes.

224
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,240
He likes music in that era.

225
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,440
I mean, that's when I liked music the most too,

226
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,560
sort of like high school, early college.

227
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,120
That's the time to like music.

228
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,240
Yeah, he liked it then.

229
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,120
And I think he didn't like it maybe before or after.

230
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,160
But I think really what he doesn't like

231
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,840
is he doesn't like ad nauseum talk about it.

232
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,680
I think he doesn't like it.

233
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,520
There's a cap.

234
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,440
I can see him glazing over at two minutes or so.

235
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,400
As soon as you say Denny Lane, he gets like,

236
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,280
he glazes over and then he gets disinterested.

237
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,280
Denny Lane of course, the guitarist from Wings.

238
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,120
Denny Lane who I saw solo at the Ohio State Fair,

239
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,440
opening for the Zombies who I've seen a number of times

240
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,360
who were fantastic.

241
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,000
But is that theme park related?

242
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,560
It was a fair, I went on rides that day.

243
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,400
It is, yeah.

244
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,560
And I saw Denny Lane, which we've talked about this,

245
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,040
that I saw Denny Lane and he was like okay.

246
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,720
You know, all right, so Wings is Paul and Linda McCartney

247
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,480
and then the third most famous wing

248
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,440
like way in the back of that horse race is Denny Lane.

249
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,000
And he, like he was fine, it was okay.

250
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,120
But he kept dedicating songs to like, this one's for George.

251
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,520
I was like, this is some unfair emotion

252
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,920
to try to get us more.

253
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,520
It's like guilting us into being emotionally invested

254
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,880
at this like mediocre half hour fair set.

255
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,280
Paul McCartney, which we saw at Dodgers,

256
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,600
did an unfair thing to get us invested.

257
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,880
Is that he was about to play his song, Fuh You.

258
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,720
Oh yes.

259
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,440
Which I will of course.

260
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,720
Author some songs.

261
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,400
Yeah, which I will of course say I do kind of like now,

262
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,520
but that's beside the point.

263
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,280
I was looking forward to him playing that.

264
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,800
But he was like, you know, we play a song

265
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,800
that's an old song and all the phones come out

266
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,120
and everyone cheers.

267
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,920
And then we play one of the new songs

268
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,760
and then all the phones go down.

269
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,600
Yeah, yes.

270
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,440
And everyone goes together.

271
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,080
We're gonna play a new one anyway.

272
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,800
But then he guilted everyone

273
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,560
into putting all the phones and lights out,

274
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,880
which honestly really made it.

275
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,280
It was really fun cause everyone had their phone out.

276
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,560
To like. You wanna prove him wrong.

277
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,760
You don't wanna make,

278
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,640
you don't wanna feel like Paul's got my number.

279
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,320
Yeah, so I mean, we were like,

280
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,040
we can't make this old bag of bones unhappy.

281
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,320
We gotta, come on Paul, we like Fuh You.

282
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,080
One thing he didn't do,

283
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,120
I can't imagine he referred to in this concert in any way,

284
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,840
is the thing that we saw together.

285
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,280
We went to it with, we like pre-bought tickets

286
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,320
to see in the theater in the arc.

287
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,640
Like the film Bruce Mcmouse.

288
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,480
Yes.

289
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,880
Paul McCartney made a,

290
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,440
this was a total surprise to us.

291
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,240
Like a month before you said,

292
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
before we went to it,

293
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,960
you sent me a message about that,

294
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,080
Paul McCartney made an animated film.

295
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,920
Yes.

296
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,760
Bruce Mcmouse, like Mickey, called Bruce Mcmouse.

297
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,680
And we were like, that sounds like such an oddity.

298
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,560
We gotta go and boy, what a pile of shit.

299
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,000
Not really worth the trip, but it sounded,

300
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,960
I mean, it had a picture,

301
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,200
there was like a groovy seventies disco-y mouse

302
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,640
in the trailer.

303
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,760
And I was like, well, this is, maybe this is interesting.

304
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,640
Yeah.

305
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,480
And it was like.

306
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,760
It was interesting to go to.

307
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,600
Yeah.

308
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
It's a really strange thing to see in a packed theater.

309
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,440
Yeah.

310
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,920
Songs from Wildlife, which is not my favorite Wings album.

311
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,760
No.

312
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,720
Doesn't have really the hits.

313
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,560
I think I left the theater and said to you guys,

314
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,120
now I get why people didn't like Wings.

315
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,440
That, yes, that Wildlife may have set the tone for Wings

316
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,800
for a lot of people.

317
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,760
If you were really into The Beatles and they're like,

318
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,040
what's Paul gonna do next?

319
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,960
And there was all these murky jams

320
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,120
and he had yet to do the ones that we like,

321
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,860
the band on the run and the jam and such.

322
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,760
Yeah.

323
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,160
And maybe see that, yes.

324
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,480
It was like a lot of just like the detergid jams

325
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,840
mixed with this pretty unrelated mouse footage.

326
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,440
There's a bunch of like old British mice.

327
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,280
It looks like.

328
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,840
Who live under the stage where he's playing a concert

329
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,840
and they interact for like 50 seconds total.

330
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,960
They get in like Paul's hand for a second.

331
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,080
I don't remember even the plot of it.

332
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,720
And then really hesitant where like today

333
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,440
you have animated characters interacting

334
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,400
with live humans all the time.

335
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,060
But this, they were so scared clearly of like,

336
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,900
what if this doesn't work?

337
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,800
So they cut to the stillest hand you've ever seen.

338
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,760
Just the stiffest still photo.

339
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,680
Yes.

340
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,360
This is not exactly Roger Rabbit,

341
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,560
but it's the early 70s.

342
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,700
They're still figuring it out.

343
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,200
Yeah, I mean, Paul would go on to make

344
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,920
a Rupert and the Frog song,

345
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,360
which is a different, which is I think a better cartoon.

346
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,640
My mom showed it to me, of course,

347
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,520
cause I was indoctrinated with all of anything Paul ever did.

348
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,840
Wow, that's a good way to,

349
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,320
that's a good way to be raised.

350
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,960
Yeah, that's a child's, that was sort of fun at least.

351
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,200
And then I know Paul has a book now out called,

352
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,840
Hey Grand Dude.

353
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,280
This is news to me.

354
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,880
This is a real thing.

355
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,820
I don't know a ton about it.

356
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,000
Is just that Paul has created some characters.

357
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,400
It's a fiction book?

358
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,920
Well, like they may be based on like his grandchildren.

359
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,520
But he, I think Paul, honestly,

360
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,120
it seems to me like it's coming from a place

361
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,360
where Paul didn't like being called a grandpa

362
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,360
cause he felt a little old.

363
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,640
So he's like, Hey, don't call me grandpa for you.

364
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,440
Here's the, here's the characters.

365
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,160
I don't know a ton about the Grand Dude characters.

366
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,680
Okay. They're pretty standard children.

367
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,040
This is like very current 2019 children's book.

368
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,400
Yeah. Sort of not.

369
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,120
I'm not going to say these are charming characters.

370
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,520
I might go on record, but saying,

371
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,320
I'm not a fan of the animated work of Paul McCartney.

372
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,400
I like his music.

373
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,200
I like his rock tunes, but,

374
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,640
but I have to read Hey Grand Dude for myself to know.

375
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,280
Well, we'll review it on the Patreon

376
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,760
when Jason's out of town next.

377
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,600
Yeah.

378
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,120
Cause I'm going to start looking forward to these absences.

379
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,120
It's a theme park about guests

380
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,680
except when Jason leaves and it's about Paul McCartney.

381
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,520
But you know what?

382
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,080
Here, I should say soon and later,

383
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,600
we're not just talking about rock music.

384
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,000
We're not abandoning the theme park topic.

385
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,840
What we're trying to do is,

386
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,480
we've talked about, to go back to the Beatles,

387
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,280
we've talked before about some of the odd interactions

388
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,560
between the Beatles and Disney World specifically.

389
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,400
Recently, my friend Tyler actually made me aware

390
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,560
of the story involving Bruce Springsteen in Disneyland.

391
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,400
And it made us just start to wonder,

392
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,040
have, it's very important I think for us to know,

393
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,240
have all of our favorite musicians been to Disneyland

394
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,240
or Disney World or not?

395
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,920
If we don't keep track of this,

396
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,400
I don't think I'll be able to sleep

397
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,760
beyond the recording of this.

398
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,560
I need to know. Yeah.

399
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,720
And within that, I think something that we could accomplish

400
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,040
in this episode and minus Jason is determining,

401
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,240
what is the rockinest moment in the history

402
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,600
of the Disney parks?

403
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,560
Or really any park because maybe another theme park

404
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,680
has the jump on rockin' moments.

405
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,080
Now I don't know what exactly qualifies as a rockin' moment.

406
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,880
That's I guess what we're gonna figure out here.

407
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,920
Yeah, I think that it's a wide reaching way.

408
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,560
I also think it's interesting because in general,

409
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,320
theme parks might not be the coolest places maybe

410
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,960
if your definition of cool

411
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,680
is the traditional definition of cool.

412
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,720
Well, one thing it isn't, I don't think,

413
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,280
I think now everything's a little more merged.

414
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,960
I think a currently pop, I think a current like,

415
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,160
18 year old pop star or something

416
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,040
would happily be at Disneyland.

417
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,120
Like a cool person could be at Disneyland

418
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,280
and be Instagrammed there and it wouldn't be a,

419
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,760
hey Travis Scott as we talked about,

420
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,840
his album is themed after Astroworld.

421
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,520
I think now it's less weird.

422
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,600
What we're talking about, classic rockers,

423
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,480
I feel like in general would not be caught dead.

424
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,120
It's interesting because I think you're right

425
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,040
but I wonder how true that is

426
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,040
because I found a picture, I don't know,

427
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,160
maybe you found this as well,

428
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,160
a picture of the Ramones at Disneyland.

429
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,320
I did too.

430
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,160
Which I'm sure it's the same one.

431
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,000
I found no further information.

432
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,480
Yeah, exactly, there's nothing else.

433
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,600
But there's a picture of the Ramones

434
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,040
all sort of in Ramone garb

435
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,120
and they're holding up letters

436
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,840
that spell Ramones in front of the castle.

437
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,040
Yeah, oh wait, oh wait, maybe I found a different picture.

438
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,760
Well yeah, there's one of them

439
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,320
kind of in front of the train station.

440
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,200
That's the one I found.

441
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,160
But there was a caption from

442
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,600
Joey Ramones official Facebook that I found as well.

443
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,440
Oh.

444
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,200
So he lists me, Mickey, Arturo Vega,

445
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,160
Johnny, Tommy, Dee Dee, and fellow roadie Big Al.

446
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,240
Oh, what?

447
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,080
Yeah.

448
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,900
No kidding.

449
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,200
Ramone roadie Big Al.

450
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,240
Oh, they must've gotten a real kick out of the old jamboree

451
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,520
if they went up there.

452
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,720
On a family outing to Disneyland 77,

453
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,000
my brother wanted to come,

454
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,280
but the day before this was taken,

455
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,980
he'd gotten so sunburned and swollen,

456
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,480
we had to cut his pants off of his legs.

457
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,840
Huh?

458
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,680
And that's all it says.

459
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,520
That's a rare problem,

460
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,760
you gotta be in real skinny jeans, I think, for that.

461
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,120
And they were.

462
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,800
And there they are in front of the train station.

463
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,120
Wow, wow.

464
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,320
So those were the most snotty,

465
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,200
some of the most snotty punk guys,

466
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,040
and there they are.

467
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,040
Super New York.

468
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,880
Yeah.

469
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,320
They want the real,

470
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,360
they don't want some castle bullshit.

471
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,400
Yeah, so they're there.

472
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,000
But they went, here, look at this.

473
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,200
Here's this photo of them,

474
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,880
they're all spelling out Ramones

475
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,480
in front of Cinderella Castle.

476
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,600
And that's Disney World.

477
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,360
That's Disney, wait, the other one was Disneyland?

478
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,200
Let me look.

479
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,560
Yep, this is Disneyland.

480
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,600
Wow.

481
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,440
So they went to both.

482
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,260
So the Ramones have been,

483
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,560
this is very interesting right away,

484
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,120
the Ramones all in mass went to both Disneyland

485
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,960
and Disney World.

486
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,800
Yes.

487
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,720
So how uncool, that's what I'm saying,

488
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,500
cool, but like, how uncool was it?

489
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,760
Maybe it wasn't terribly so.

490
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,520
Because as I've said many times before,

491
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,520
you had like Louis Armstrong playing on the Mark Twain,

492
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,960
that's cool as shit.

493
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,080
Yes, and he was cool.

494
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,920
He was very cool.

495
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,520
In that time, in the 50s.

496
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,360
Yeah.

497
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,840
I think he's cool.

498
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,840
Well, if you look at like who Disneyland had out to perform

499
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,820
or Disney World.

500
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,720
I feel like they were a little more,

501
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,700
in the 50s, they were a little more up to speed

502
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,400
with what popular music was at the time.

503
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,640
I don't think they had Rock Axe in 1955.

504
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,120
But having a Louis Armstrong,

505
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,360
or it seemed like in the early days,

506
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,960
there were a lot of performances by like Pete Fountain.

507
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,200
I think Pete Fountain was cool in the 50s and 60s,

508
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,640
I believe.

509
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,000
But so, I just went to Disneyland with my mom

510
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,080
and she was pointing out how,

511
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,080
I don't think I realized this in the pre-admission era,

512
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,720
when it was just, when it was the e-ticket,

513
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,480
you bought tickets for individual rides,

514
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,000
you could go to Disneyland for free

515
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,120
and see concerts and stuff.

516
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,760
So it actually was a thing for high schoolers

517
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,280
and college students was, you know,

518
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,040
go see some hoppin' jazz bands and the like.

519
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,560
Right.

520
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,800
Pretty cool, that's a totally different Disneyland

521
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,720
than what we have now.

522
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,040
You could walk around for free and see concerts

523
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,080
and it's a genuine date spot, kinda cool.

524
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,000
I haven't looked into it, but like,

525
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,760
how often did Louis Armstrong play?

526
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,880
Like once or twice, or was it often?

527
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,720
Can't tell.

528
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,480
Yeah, it's hard to tell.

529
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,520
But like, you could just go down and see him for free?

530
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,480
For free?

531
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,160
That would be, that's wild.

532
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,120
Yeah, every day, maybe we'll look into it

533
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,720
and he was like, he was like the country bears.

534
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,360
Maybe. Show every 10 minutes.

535
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,560
Maybe. That's what gave him the idea

536
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,200
to do animatronics, was like, boy,

537
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,960
we are just losing barrels of money to this guy.

538
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,040
Yeah, sure.

539
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,600
It's $10,000 a pop.

540
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,560
30 shows a day with a robot.

541
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,560
Yeah, and he gets tired, so yeah,

542
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,960
the only solution's robots.

543
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,720
But I was looking at, you know, who,

544
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,440
okay, so there's a site called WDW Magic

545
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,240
that just came into play on the Mini Moo episode

546
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,680
that we did because I was looking into Harry Carrey's visit

547
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,360
to Disney World in which he interacted with Mini Moo,

548
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,400
the cow with the Mickey shape on its side.

549
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,400
And this site lists who, famous visitors

550
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,160
to Disney World year after year

551
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,280
and also performers there,

552
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,480
who performed at the Grad Nights or different events.

553
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,840
And to me, it has a very similar trajectory

554
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:47,840
to the Grammys or to the Super Bowl halftime show

555
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,400
where they don't embrace rock until way later.

556
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,560
It is still, it is like even just who comes to the park,

557
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,400
unless rock stars were going in there

558
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,800
and not making a show of it,

559
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,440
because I didn't see the Ramones in this list

560
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,960
and they probably should have been in this list.

561
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,800
Sure.

562
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,360
So you're seeing like who's visiting or who's performing?

563
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,360
It's John Denver, it's Glen Campbell,

564
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,880
Donny Osmond, Burl Ives.

565
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
Hell yes.

566
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,680
I love Burl Ives.

567
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,520
I shouldn't throw Burl Ives under the bus.

568
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,360
Yeah, he's cool as shit.

569
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,200
Check that.

570
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,480
Hey, the opening of Epcot Center was played

571
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,560
by Count Basie and Pete Fountain.

572
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,400
Wow.

573
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,200
So in 82, they're still in that sort of jazz forever.

574
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,720
They're still playing to the old fogies.

575
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,680
And late 70s, early 80s, you start to see it turning around.

576
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:36,320
I think the real hallmark and the lynch,

577
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,400
where it goes over the edge is that in 1977,

578
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,360
that Grad Night, the band Starbuck performed.

579
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,440
You familiar with Starbuck?

580
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,280
No.

581
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,520
They have a song called Moonlight Feels Right.

582
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,880
Moonlight Feels Right.

583
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,000
And it was a band, they had like a vibraphone player.

584
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,320
So it was a weird, they're like otherwise

585
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,120
a kind of normal soft rock band, but then like.

586
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,120
Big complicated vibraphone solo.

587
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,760
So Starbuck really, Jackie Robinson of rock music,

588
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,080
I feel at Disneyland.

589
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,360
But then you start seeing this turn where

590
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,120
they do have a lot of great, they had an event.

591
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,240
I love this name and I wish, boy,

592
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,560
I wish I could have gone to some of these

593
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,440
in the late 70s, early 80s.

594
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,640
Disney World had an event called

595
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,640
the World Series of Entertainment.

596
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,400
Wow.

597
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,880
The acts of this are fantastic.

598
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,120
Peaches and Herb, Evelyn Champagne King,

599
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,120
The Silvers, Rupert Holmes.

600
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,960
Really?

601
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,800
Yeah, yeah.

602
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,640
Pina Colada song, man.

603
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,900
Mr. Pina Colada song.

604
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,240
In 81, Just Mike Love, Not the Ruts of the Beach Boys.

605
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,760
Clearly promoting his album, Looking Back with Love.

606
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,200
That was a full band though, he didn't do like a solo thing.

607
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,480
I don't think he just like, yeah,

608
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,360
he didn't just sing a cappella.

609
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,760
Cause he doesn't play the guitar, right?

610
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,600
He doesn't play anything.

611
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,440
Okay.

612
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,360
He figured out for a song called Shut Down,

613
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,480
figured out how to play a two note saxophone solo.

614
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,320
Whoa.

615
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,360
Wah, wah, wah, wah.

616
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,400
And you can tell he struggled.

617
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,800
It is a sweaty solo when you watch him do it.

618
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,240
Mike Love will factor into some further information.

619
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,320
But you know the Commodores and the Daz Band,

620
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,320
Billy Idol, Tavares, lots of bands I like.

621
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,760
Midnight Star, Shalimar.

622
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,920
And then you get into it, then they had an event also

623
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,520
for a couple of years called Valentine Heartbeat,

624
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,560
which had super great Billy Ocean, New Edition,

625
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,160
Daz Band, Houdini.

626
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,520
Can I stop you real quick?

627
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,360
Yeah, yeah.

628
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,360
I have the lineup for Epcot when we're there.

629
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,200
Oh, when we're?

630
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,440
Oh, do tell.

631
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,760
Oh, there's concerts in?

632
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,440
There's concerts every three,

633
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,280
Oh boy.

634
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,120
There's a new act every three days.

635
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,040
That's really the way that music is alive

636
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,800
in the biggest way in the parks right now.

637
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,760
You know, rock music like Christopher Cross

638
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,360
and Starship featuring Mickey Thomas.

639
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,040
I will just say some of the acts that will be in September.

640
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,320
So we want to be able to see these people.

641
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,400
Tiffany, September 13th through 15th.

642
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Smash Mouth, 16th through 17th.

643
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,240
And 17th.

644
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,000
Everclear, 18th, 19th.

645
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,880
Smash Mouth's Sugar Ray really went straight

646
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,680
into that pocket of like cheese ball.

647
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,960
A lot of these old lists I'm looking at are half like,

648
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,600
they always have Paul Revere in the Raiders.

649
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,320
Paul Revere is always there.

650
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,600
Whatever it is will be there.

651
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,480
Maybe they'll get-

652
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,440
That is Sugar Ray in Smash Mouth today.

653
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,000
Yes, maybe they'll get Paul Revere in the Raiders

654
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,800
will get bumped up though from their inclusion

655
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,120
in Tarantino movie.

656
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,600
Which one's theirs in that?

657
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,600
They're just like mentioned.

658
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,360
There are three, like three songs of theirs

659
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,200
are in the movie.

660
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,020
Three of them are in the movie?

661
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,860
I believe on the soundtrack.

662
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

663
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,540
That might notch up the cool cred.

664
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,480
Yeah.

665
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,320
Starship, 20th, 21st, 22nd,

666
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,840
which we saw them in Epcot two years ago.

667
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,680
Oh, that's right.

668
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,520
How was it?

669
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,320
It's a little weird.

670
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,080
It's right in front of the American pavilion on the water

671
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,800
and the audience isn't so jacked up.

672
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,640
They're kind of quiet.

673
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,760
They're like, as if they're watching like Muppets 3D.

674
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,600
Okay.

675
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,040
They're just sort of politely sitting there

676
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,880
and then like you can tell-

677
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,080
As opposed to a non-theme park audience

678
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,920
that is just fucking-

679
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,000
Are just going fucking crazy.

680
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,840
Yeah.

681
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,660
You know what, I'll say this.

682
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,960
I saw Blondie and Elvis Costello in Irvine last week

683
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,560
and the crowd was pretty rowdy for a bunch of old folks.

684
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,400
Okay.

685
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,200
And I was, I mean, and like not in a bad way either.

686
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,920
Oh good.

687
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,760
Costello was rowdy once

688
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,280
before he was like this musicologist.

689
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,120
Yes.

690
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,800
He's a professor today.

691
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,640
He is.

692
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,120
I'm glad he played music and didn't do a lecture.

693
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,680
He has a lot of lines that are clearly written

694
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,320
way ahead of the show.

695
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,160
Okay.

696
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,800
Where he does a lot of like jokes and like setups

697
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,440
and like he's a cool guy just telling some jokes.

698
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,440
I don't have any examples, but I will for a future episode.

699
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,520
Paul has his three that he does.

700
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,640
He just cycles through.

701
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,480
Yes.

702
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,520
So here's the, here are the, oh,

703
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,880
we're going to miss Kenny G by two weeks.

704
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,160
Damn, damn.

705
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,200
Life days.

706
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,040
You got to do it.

707
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,880
We're going to miss 38 Special by days.

708
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,840
That's too bad.

709
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,560
I kind of like 38 Special.

710
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,840
I believe we're going to come into Orlando

711
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,720
the last day of the Baja Men playing,

712
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,000
which is so exciting to me.

713
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,600
Then the next three days, Billy Ocean.

714
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,440
Really?

715
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,280
Yes.

716
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,000
Now that I might have to take advantage of.

717
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,640
And the next three days, Sheila E.

718
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,480
What?

719
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,320
Yes.

720
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,160
We're in?

721
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,760
Sheila E in Orlando.

722
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,680
23, 24, 25th.

723
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,800
Wow.

724
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,200
So I don't know if we're going to see it

725
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,040
because we may end up doing horror nights at 23rd

726
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,320
because that might be the only day to do it.

727
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,160
Okay.

728
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,400
But you, if you go Friday, you could go Friday night.

729
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,160
Cause our show's the 24th in Orlando.

730
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,000
Okay.

731
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,200
So nobody sees Sheila E.

732
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,920
Let's shut out Sheila E.

733
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,840
I want one person at the Sheila E show

734
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,880
when we're doing our show.

735
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,560
But.

736
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,760
Though they play like five times starting at 5pm.

737
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,600
So I guess you could hypothetically.

738
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,440
I know it works.

739
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,280
They just do little sets.

740
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,400
Yes. It's like weird 25 minute sets.

741
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,600
Wow.

742
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,680
I don't know if it's five times,

743
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,120
but it's something like that.

744
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,560
So Billy Ocean, Sheila E and the Baja Men

745
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,160
will be in Orlando when we are in Orlando.

746
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,360
This is pretty up.

747
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,680
Are we doxing ourselves by saying we might be at Sheila E?

748
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,720
I think people would have put a two and two together.

749
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,560
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

750
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,840
If they're vaguely aware.

751
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,880
Well, that's amazing.

752
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,960
Yes. And you know what?

753
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,800
So it's possible that the rockinist moment

754
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,400
in Disney world history is yet to come.

755
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,240
Yeah. Baja Men.

756
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,560
It could be Baja Men.

757
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,200
Baja Men could easily take the title.

758
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,120
Us front row at Baja Men.

759
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,240
It's up to us to give them the energy they need.

760
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,080
Yeah.

761
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,680
To let all of the dogs out, not just some.

762
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,280
And let's make the most rockinist moment.

763
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,920
It's always in our hands.

764
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,000
It's up to us.

765
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,240
Maybe it doesn't even have to involve rock music, the rockinist.

766
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,960
If you just go on a ride and play a little air guitar

767
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,280
because you had a rockin' good time.

768
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,120
Yeah, sure.

769
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,840
But so that list that I was saying,

770
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,440
I think like, okay, so early 80s,

771
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,320
they start warming up to like R&B a little more.

772
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,200
You know, Whitney Houston played the Disney world

773
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,800
around Halloween 85.

774
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,640
Wow.

775
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,880
They had good concerts, for sure.

776
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,760
You got the Jets around, Miami Sound Machine.

777
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,640
But rock, not so much.

778
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,560
It's almost, it's hard to find like almost any embrace

779
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,320
in the 70s and 80s of just pure rock music.

780
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,160
Right.

781
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,120
Because they're a little scared of it.

782
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,200
Yeah, yeah.

783
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,280
Except for, and I found this very strange.

784
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,480
So there's, all right, so there's always the,

785
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,680
there's always various concerts going on

786
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,240
at the parks, especially in Tomorrowland.

787
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,040
And, you know, usually it's just, it's some cover band

788
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,000
or it's like something, somebody a little past their prime.

789
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,280
I was surprised to learn that in 1979,

790
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,320
in the Tomorrowland Terrace in Disney World,

791
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,720
there was a performance from the police.

792
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,560
Wow.

793
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,000
In their height.

794
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,920
They were in Florida because they filmed

795
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,400
the video for Walking on the Moon the day before

796
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,640
at Cape Canaveral.

797
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,480
Really?

798
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,000
And they went and performed at Disney World.

799
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,840
What year is that?

800
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,160
79.

801
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,720
Wow.

802
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,760
Very surprising, and I know that from Andy Summers' book,

803
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,000
which I found snippets of.

804
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,440
And he, I think, exemplifies why rock music

805
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,960
and Disney did not get along necessarily

806
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,600
because he was really snotty about it.

807
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,840
He keeps saying in the book, it was just for the money.

808
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,400
He keeps calling them, he keeps calling

809
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,760
all the Disney people automatons.

810
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,000
He even says the amount of money.

811
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:39,200
He's very, clearly this is not a good situation for them.

812
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,360
They're led to a small concrete bunker

813
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,440
where they're told to sit and wait for further instructions.

814
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,640
Someone makes a remark about Eva Braun

815
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,760
and Andy Summers' cackles with a plastic Donald Duck cup

816
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,520
up to his mouth.

817
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,760
And then he, so I guess they also had

818
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,800
the rising and sinking stage.

819
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,760
Oh, like Tomorrowland over here?

820
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

821
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,680
So they're loaded up, they're put on stage, here you go.

822
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,640
Somebody says, but it's underground, no one will see us.

823
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,880
And they say, it goes up.

824
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,600
Like the concept of the rising stage

825
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,520
was not explained to the police until they were right there.

826
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,680
Play When I Tell You, and then a red light comes on

827
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,880
and they play Roxanne.

828
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,720
But like, isn't it weird, like,

829
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,520
on the rise, really good police played,

830
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,040
like rose up from the ground in Tomorrowland?

831
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,360
And then they say, they claim that like everybody

832
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,360
just took off during it, this is too hip for,

833
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,880
and leaving just like the punks who happened to be there

834
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
who knew them.

835
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,960
And then they just sank, like during,

836
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,080
they just went right back down mid set.

837
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,080
And I don't know, yeah, very odd mesh of things.

838
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,280
It's interesting, because it's like such a big band.

839
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,280
I mean, they were a huge band.

840
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,840
I mean, I guess I don't know if this is getting

841
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,920
too ahead of ourselves, but the Eagles played

842
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,520
backing Linda Ronstadt.

843
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,520
Yes, that's actually a potentially pretty big history.

844
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,120
That Linda Ronstadt did not have a band

845
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,560
when she was booked to do a week at Disneyland.

846
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,680
So she hired four guys she knew from the troubadour

847
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,720
who knew each other, but had not played together before.

848
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,280
And the sets went so great, so imbued.

849
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,120
The Eagles were poor.

850
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,960
Disney magic, were they?

851
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,480
But that was the birth of the Eagles.

852
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,320
Wild.

853
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,800
So was born a band that I don't think

854
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,960
either of us like very much.

855
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,960
I like some of the Glenn Fry stuff.

856
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,400
Sure, and you mean like Heat is on?

857
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,680
Well, Take It Easy I like.

858
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,520
Oh sure.

859
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,800
Yeah, a couple other ones.

860
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:50,040
Do you know that there's a town in Arizona,

861
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,340
whatever is name checked in Taking It Easy,

862
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,440
like it's like the point of the town now that.

863
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,480
No, I don't know that.

864
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,360
Forget, I don't have the lyrics.

865
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,520
It sounds like Tucson, Arizona, it's not Tucson.

866
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,640
There's a city that like it has a statue of Glenn Fry.

867
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,480
Wow, I didn't know that.

868
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,560
It's the main thing with them tourism wise now.

869
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,000
Come see the town that Taking It Easy was based on.

870
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,840
Wow.

871
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,680
Yeah.

872
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,520
Weird, what is it?

873
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,360
Can I see that?

874
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,160
Is it like the Walt statue with Glenn Fry?

875
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,960
Uh-huh, pretty much, yeah, yeah.

876
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,680
Huh.

877
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,760
Yeah, Josh Fadum was just passing through there.

878
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,180
Take It Easy statue.

879
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,000
Standing on the corner park, Winslow, Arizona.

880
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,200
Winslow, Arizona.

881
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,320
Na na na na na na na na na na na.

882
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,920
Yeah, Winslow, Arizona, he name checks that in there.

883
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,200
So they quite literally put Winslow, Arizona on the map.

884
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,880
Well, that's good for them.

885
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,360
Yeah, I honestly, I'm not so steeped in the Eagles lore.

886
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,520
I do know that one of the members is a horrible man,

887
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,480
but you can look that up for yourself to see.

888
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,280
Or just determined from interviews

889
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,400
who has the vibe of being a horrible man.

890
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,240
Yeah, but I think.

891
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,280
Which is maybe all of them.

892
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,240
It also is possibly all of them,

893
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,360
but one guy, as far as I know,

894
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,160
takes it to a whole new level,

895
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,680
and it's not funny at all.

896
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,520
It takes it to the limit, you're saying?

897
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,040
Yeah, oh, I would say that.

898
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,360
So Google that, or just DM me and I'll send you the link.

899
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,120
I'm a better set.

900
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,160
You know who I got no beef with is Timothy B. Schmidt.

901
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,400
He does the song I Can't Tell You Why,

902
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,400
which is one of the only Eagles songs that I dig.

903
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,360
And I just discovered that Chromio did a cover of it.

904
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,200
Wow, really?

905
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,040
Yeah, and it's good.

906
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,800
So if that lends any legitimacy.

907
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,920
I like Chromio too.

908
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,680
Do they ever play at Disney Park?

909
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,520
I don't know.

910
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,360
Probably not.

911
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,200
I feel like they could.

912
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,240
They're family friendly enough.

913
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,440
They're like a goofy band.

914
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,360
They got a little dirty, like a little slight dirtiness.

915
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,200
I guess so, yeah, yeah.

916
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,400
But they could not have to do those.

917
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,760
Well, I don't know that you're getting,

918
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,240
like cool bands at Disneyland.

919
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,760
They really, ain't really happening so much.

920
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,600
Yeah.

921
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,000
But if your scale includes Billy Ocean is cool, then sure.

922
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,800
I guess what I'm saying is there should be

923
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,360
a Glenn Frey statue in Disneyland as well.

924
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,280
Yeah, I agree.

925
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,920
Because the reason, we might not even know who he is

926
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,360
if not for that week of Linda Ronson shows.

927
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,200
That is wild.

928
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,120
That is really wild.

929
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,680
That's- History.

930
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,520
Yeah, so-

931
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,880
So next time you're at Disneyland,

932
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,680
just like stop and say a prayer.

933
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,520
And thank this precious place for giving us the Eagles.

934
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,360
That's true.

935
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,000
I was, so like Beach Boys played Disneyland.

936
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,360
A friend of mine's father was head of the band

937
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,760
in the 70s called Bo Donaldson and the Haywoods.

938
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,520
They played Disneyland all the time.

939
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,360
Oh, okay.

940
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,760
I went to that Elvis Costello concert

941
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
with him and his father.

942
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,560
And they were just talking a little bit about it.

943
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,480
We may want to interview him, honestly.

944
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,400
Really, really?

945
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,240
Maybe.

946
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,640
What do you, well, I don't want to give away his info, but-

947
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,640
It was nothing too crazy,

948
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,480
but I just got it since there was more stuff.

949
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,320
I don't know.

950
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,280
Maybe we'll talk about it off mic.

951
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,320
We got to find out what's in the underground

952
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,560
where you rise up to Marlon and Therese.

953
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,240
So I wonder if there's stuff that's been lost.

954
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,760
I wonder, obviously like big bands have been documented,

955
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,880
but it does seem like there's not a good archive

956
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,160
of all of this stuff.

957
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,040
No, not really.

958
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,040
That's what I'm wondering too.

959
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,320
Is there, if there's stuff that fell through the cracks

960
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,680
or like people that were in big bands that played

961
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,160
and that just wasn't documented, who knows?

962
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,360
Even the Grad Night info, it's tough to find.

963
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,200
You got to look at an old flyer.

964
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,040
Yeah.

965
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,640
You got to look at people's message board,

966
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,760
like look at message board posts of what they're grad.

967
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,360
But Grad Night, I did a Grad Night,

968
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,800
there was nothing going on.

969
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,480
There was just, they were just playing pre-recorded songs.

970
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,760
They were playing Usher's Yeah all night, many times over,

971
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,600
but Usher wasn't there himself.

972
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,440
Right.

973
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,600
I'm amazed at the level of bands they would have

974
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,440
at these things.

975
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,240
Like, didn't no doubt play in 95.

976
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,080
Really?

977
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,720
I have a video of them in 95 at Disney

978
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,360
and I think it's a Grad Night, but it's a little bit,

979
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,520
let me see if it was in the YouTube.

980
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,080
Obviously they have an album called Tragic Kingdom,

981
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,240
which somebody, there's a blog I was reading,

982
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,840
and I don't know if you found this,

983
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,640
that really thinks that Tragic Kingdom

984
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,800
and the song specifically is about Michael Eisner.

985
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,720
Have we talked about this?

986
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,880
No.

987
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,080
Because the song starts with, do you know the song at all?

988
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,320
I don't remember the song super well.

989
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,400
It starts.

990
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,040
Cornfields of Popcorn Have Yet to Spring Open.

991
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,040
Right, but it starts with like audio from the park too.

992
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,320
Like it starts with.

993
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,360
Is it like Monorail?

994
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,720
Turnstiles.

995
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,480
Remain seated please.

996
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,320
Oh no.

997
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,640
Permanecer sentados por favor.

998
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,480
Whoa.

999
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,840
And there's a blog, oh there's a little bit of song.

1000
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,840
So like there's a blog that surmises that this is about

1001
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,920
the degradation of the park under Eisner.

1002
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,400
Was this blog written by Kevin Berger?

1003
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,720
I have to double check,

1004
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,720
it might have been his pre-Defunct Land pseudonym.

1005
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,200
But there's a whole lyrical,

1006
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,040
I don't know if you've seen it,

1007
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,320
but it's a blog that's written by Kevin Berger.

1008
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,160
I have to double check,

1009
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,320
it might have been his pre-Defunct Land pseudonym.

1010
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,520
But there's a whole lyrical dissection of like

1011
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,480
how the park had kind of gone downhill.

1012
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,080
Although I don't know if that lines up in 94

1013
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,920
or whatever way you would have written this.

1014
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,760
Yeah, things were great in 94.

1015
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,600
Yeah.

1016
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,520
If you got complaints in 94,

1017
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,040
you're just a negative Nelly.

1018
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,520
Yeah, so I don't really know if that's right or not.

1019
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,200
But there is obviously something,

1020
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,800
there's something to it.

1021
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,440
I'm just wondering what the actual meaning of it was.

1022
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,280
Hmm.

1023
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,760
Actually, then we find out surprisingly,

1024
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,840
Don't Speak is about Michael Eisner.

1025
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,680
Yeah.

1026
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,280
After the seeing his intros.

1027
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,560
Gwen Stefani famously a torrid affair with Michael Eisner.

1028
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,880
Oh my God.

1029
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,120
Can you imagine?

1030
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,920
I can.

1031
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,880
And what's the end of Carly Simon's songs about him too?

1032
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,840
All the mystery songs you ought to know.

1033
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,520
Oh yeah.

1034
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,400
Not Dave Coulier is about Michael Eisner.

1035
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,000
Dave Coulier is a straw man.

1036
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,360
It's clearly about Eisner.

1037
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,080
God, I wish.

1038
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,400
Young Casanova who dated every single

1039
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,480
young starlet singer from the 70s through the 90s.

1040
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,120
Playboy Michael Eisner.

1041
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,200
Yeah, so no doubt I believe play, that's what it says.

1042
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,600
So this says, played Grad nights.

1043
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,240
No doubt one of the more affiliated with Disney fans.

1044
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,400
So Cal and Knots and

1045
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,360
Sure, sure.

1046
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,520
Everything down in Anaheim.

1047
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,040
Should we explain this Springsteen thing?

1048
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,880
Oh yeah, sure.

1049
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,520
That's really what got me thinking

1050
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,600
because this one's actually a pretty just coherent,

1051
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,440
Yeah, and I heard.

1052
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,280
Pretty funny interaction with a legendary rock star

1053
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,240
and the Parks.

1054
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,920
Yeah, and I saw this,

1055
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,280
I happen to have seen the Springsteen concert

1056
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,600
with Justin and his father again

1057
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,120
and like five or six years ago in Anaheim.

1058
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,160
And Bruce told the story at the show.

1059
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,880
Okay, while you pull it, say your version of it.

1060
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,720
I'll fill in any details.

1061
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,480
Basically, I believe the version is that

1062
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,360
little Steven really wanted to,

1063
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,800
little Steven Van Zandt of the street band

1064
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,360
and of the Sopranos permanently wearing a bandana

1065
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,760
unless he's on the Sopranos when he has a giant toupee.

1066
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,720
Now I think you know who I'm talking about.

1067
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,000
I love him.

1068
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,480
Anyway, he really wanted to go to Disneyland

1069
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,800
and he was like hyped up about it

1070
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,320
and the way Bruce was telling the story was like

1071
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,920
he was so excited to go to Disneyland.

1072
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,760
And they like.

1073
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,600
Day three by the way.

1074
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,280
Yeah, and they wanted, then they tried, whatever,

1075
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,360
they drove down, he was so excited, so excited

1076
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,560
and then they, was it their clothes or their beards

1077
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,360
or was it both from that accounting?

1078
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,280
I'm seeing it as bandanas.

1079
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,520
There was specifically the bandanas?

1080
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,360
Yes.

1081
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,200
Oh, interesting.

1082
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,040
Yeah, they would.

1083
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,960
So I guess.

1084
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,440
Disney security was worried Springsteen and Van Zandt

1085
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,520
would be misidentified as gang members

1086
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,800
if they didn't remove their bandanas.

1087
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,120
Steven Van Zandt dresses like,

1088
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,000
and like I'm trying to think of a way

1089
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,080
not to offensively say this because I've realized

1090
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,440
that that was one word I was about to use

1091
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,320
is now not appropriate.

1092
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,360
So like.

1093
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,440
A stunt show pirate.

1094
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,120
A stunt show pirate is actually a much better way to say it

1095
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,200
than what I was gonna say.

1096
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,600
But he's been dressing like, yeah,

1097
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,600
a lot of silks and scarves and bandanas.

1098
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,000
It's a little bit like Steven Tyler.

1099
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,840
But yeah, more like a pirate.

1100
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,760
Possibly also than like, kinda like blouses too.

1101
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,840
Yes, yes, you're right.

1102
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,200
That honestly stunt show pirate really makes sense.

1103
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,200
Like Esmeralda from Hunchback of Notre Dame.

1104
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,920
That's the best way to say it.

1105
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,720
Cause in case you didn't know what I was gonna say.

1106
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,880
When now, so by 97, they wouldn't have allowed Stevie in

1107
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,640
because he would have been mistaken for a performer

1108
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,240
in the Festival of Fools.

1109
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,440
Yes.

1110
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,600
Get up there, you're late.

1111
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,880
But they would have allowed him on the great movie ride

1112
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,240
after he was in Lillehammer

1113
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,680
because he's a gangster from Norway.

1114
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,520
They should have let him do.

1115
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,920
Gangster from New York going to Norway.

1116
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,440
They really should have let him do a spin.

1117
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,280
Yeah. Yeah.

1118
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,000
Should have let him take that tram over.

1119
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,800
So yeah, so they were not allowed in Disney.

1120
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,800
And it was Bruce or Steven that said,

1121
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,840
we're going to Knott's Berry Farm.

1122
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,040
I see, I'm seeing Bruce.

1123
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,520
We're out of here.

1124
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,880
Cause Bruce. We're going to Knott's.

1125
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,400
My memory of it is Bruce saying it on stage in the story.

1126
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,240
So that's good.

1127
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,960
Cause we're going to Knott's Berry Farm.

1128
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,960
That's like how you would have screamed it.

1129
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,320
And then.

1130
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,840
Oh yeah. And then what happens after?

1131
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,560
They went to Knott's and the same thing happened.

1132
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,560
Right, right, right.

1133
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,680
But they don't remove the bandanas.

1134
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,920
They can't, they won't do it.

1135
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,760
They're too cool.

1136
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,920
That's who they are.

1137
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,280
That is a cool moment though.

1138
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,160
That is cool.

1139
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,560
I will say them not being allowed in.

1140
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,400
Yeah.

1141
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,320
It's stupid.

1142
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,680
I mean, does, now do we say,

1143
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,440
do we think that qualifies as the rockinest moment?

1144
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,920
Because it involves like theme park stiffness

1145
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,400
and authority going up against

1146
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,920
the rebellious rock and roll spirit?

1147
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,360
It's in the running.

1148
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,640
I think it's in the running.

1149
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,760
I don't think music needs to be played

1150
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,360
for it to be the rockinest moment.

1151
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,360
Yeah. I also, I give it credit.

1152
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,320
Well, I don't know.

1153
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,320
I will say like the E Street band,

1154
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:33,240
who I love, are not the coolest of rock stars.

1155
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,400
They're cool because they're the E Street band.

1156
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,240
They're the coolest.

1157
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,280
You're saying Max Weinberg is not cool?

1158
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,400
That's where I'm getting at.

1159
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,240
If you watch some of the,

1160
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,280
especially the old Bruce performances,

1161
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,000
which are very, very cool,

1162
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,280
you can tell he's just this crazy dork.

1163
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,400
He's just like, he's dancing like a crazy man.

1164
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,000
They're just goofing around.

1165
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,560
Like you can, they're very silly and he's still silly.

1166
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,160
I mean, he's still, the shows will be a little silly,

1167
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,960
but like, yes, Max is not the coolest man in the world.

1168
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,760
Bruce is actually not the coolest man.

1169
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,280
I would say Clarence and Steven might be cooler

1170
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,040
in the traditional sense.

1171
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,280
Like I would always say like-

1172
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,320
The pirates.

1173
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,880
Like the Rolling Stones are-

1174
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,720
It's the 100th sense.

1175
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,080
Yeah, the Rolling Stones I think are what

1176
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,360
like the traditional thought cool,

1177
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,280
like people think cool is.

1178
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,200
The way they are is what the old definition of cool is.

1179
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,040
Yeah, sure.

1180
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,000
We could probably say, is that real?

1181
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,400
No, but that is, I think the idea that's still,

1182
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,160
the Keith Richards idea is still,

1183
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,280
you're seeing it on commercials of like rockstar guy.

1184
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,120
Sure, sure.

1185
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,280
It's still the aesthetic for it.

1186
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,800
Yeah, we were talking last night about Chris Angel.

1187
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,640
Yes.

1188
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,460
Now Chris Angel is still,

1189
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,120
it's not quite Keith Rich, but a little.

1190
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,360
It is, yeah.

1191
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,880
You get, the older you get, the more eye shadow,

1192
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,480
the more scarves, the more-

1193
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,320
Yeah, you get to-

1194
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,680
Weird dyed hair and spikes.

1195
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,920
You can draw the line from Keith Richards

1196
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,840
to Motley Crue, I think.

1197
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,680
Sure.

1198
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,200
Because Motley Crue is the gaudier Halloween costume

1199
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,560
version of what Keith Richards looks like.

1200
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,040
And then draw that line right to Chris Angel.

1201
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,080
And then it's the end of the line.

1202
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,360
And hopefully it's the end of the line.

1203
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:14,720
There might still be more half-lifes for that to come,

1204
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,720
but for right now, maybe it's the end of the line.

1205
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,960
Unless we freak out and start dressing like that at 50.

1206
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,800
What do we?

1207
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,240
I can't handle aging, oh God, scarves.

1208
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,320
Like, well, like Rodney Bingenheimer

1209
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:31,720
still has this weird hair that's not totally different than,

1210
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,160
you know what I'm talking about, that weird poo.

1211
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,800
I can't tell if it's a toupee or not.

1212
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,000
By the way, Rodney Bingenheimer, DJ.

1213
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,360
DJ legend who broke a lot of bands

1214
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,840
in the 70s and 80s on K-Rock.

1215
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,080
Yeah.

1216
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,400
This quick story at the Elvis Costello.

1217
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:50,400
We had a backstage pass and we walked backstage mid-show,

1218
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,000
didn't see any of the performers,

1219
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,880
walked into an empty catering room.

1220
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,120
Then we're like, oh, I guess we'll talk to them later.

1221
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,280
We saw the Elvis Costello show then,

1222
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,560
cause Blondie opened, came back to go backstage again.

1223
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,480
We're denied because we were there on the Blondie pass

1224
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,480
because that's who Justin's father knew.

1225
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,640
He didn't know anyone.

1226
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,160
We saw Pete Thomas, the drummer from Elvis Costello,

1227
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,520
come out and hug a couple people.

1228
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,520
And then finally he brought almost everyone back

1229
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,920
except us and another group of people.

1230
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,720
And all of those people got to go backstage

1231
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,480
and hang out with the imposters and Elvis,

1232
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,520
including Derek Wibbley of Sum 41

1233
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,840
who was standing right there.

1234
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,680
What?

1235
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,040
But they're real quick.

1236
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:34,240
So Rodney was on K-Rock for years, nightly I believe,

1237
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,160
a nightly show and he would break like Blondie

1238
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,800
and break quote unquote, like would play them

1239
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,560
and they would maybe gain some more fame.

1240
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,520
And he had cool taste in music

1241
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,040
and now they stuck him on like midnight.

1242
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,240
He has one show a week.

1243
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,840
Yeah, yeah, even later I think.

1244
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,760
And we saw somebody else that also got denied

1245
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,640
because they knew Blondie and Justin's dad went

1246
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,520
and she was like, oh, how do you know Blondie?

1247
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,520
Because they were leaving too.

1248
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,600
And it was, oh, we know through Rodney.

1249
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,600
And it was like a younger, probably 30 something girl

1250
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,800
but like in cool, like leather pants in the rock and roll.

1251
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,880
I feel like aesthetic of maybe the eighties or like whatever.

1252
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,840
And she's like, yeah, Rodney, oh, Rodney played,

1253
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,320
oh, Rodney played our band tonight.

1254
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,040
Oh, she like slipped it in.

1255
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:19,880
Oh boy.

1256
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,640
And it was, and he was like, oh yeah,

1257
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,480
what's the name of the band?

1258
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,520
And it was like, she's like, kill my coquette.

1259
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,960
And then I had to look later and the song is

1260
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,840
put me in your movie, Quentin Tarantino.

1261
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,680
Oh no.

1262
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:40,320
And it is exactly what you think it sounds like.

1263
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:44,760
Like it wishes it was, I'm trying to think of that band

1264
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,000
that was two people in the, oh shoot.

1265
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Like it's like trying to be a 50, like a Phil Spector-y,

1266
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,520
cool Lou Reed-ish thing.

1267
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,720
And it sounds like it was produced in Garage Band.

1268
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,800
Oh man, oh man.

1269
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,840
Anyway.

1270
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,120
I wonder if it'll work.

1271
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:04,960
I don't know.

1272
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,780
Could still work.

1273
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,620
Could work.

1274
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:09,080
Tarantino's listening to the radio at the right time.

1275
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,760
Yeah. He might be, cause that movie,

1276
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,960
the new movie is all about driving around

1277
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,080
and listening to the radio.

1278
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:14,920
Yes it is.

1279
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,960
It's like 30% radio, this film.

1280
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,480
So anyway, I started with that on Rodney's haircut,

1281
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,680
which I feel like is still trying to kind of be

1282
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,720
Keith Richards' haircut from the 60s or 70s,

1283
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,040
which is this like, I don't want to even know

1284
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,280
what you'd describe it as.

1285
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,160
It's a little mop top-y.

1286
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,040
Little mop top.

1287
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,580
Anyway, look up Rodney's look right now.

1288
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,320
It's 30 years ago.

1289
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,960
I realize there's more to that.

1290
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,320
Little Steven wrote a letter apparently.

1291
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,160
Oh yeah, yeah.

1292
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,720
To where and what?

1293
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,720
I'm not sure.

1294
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,000
Little Steven wrote in a letter to the president.

1295
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,960
Dear Mr. Reagan.

1296
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,480
Little Steven very politically active.

1297
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,320
Okay, sure.

1298
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,360
And like helped to end apartheid.

1299
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,200
Oh.

1300
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,440
And made the song, excuse me, Sun City,

1301
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,800
but the artist's not going to play Sun City.

1302
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,960
Okay, yes.

1303
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,120
And got all these people involved.

1304
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,760
And then like he hates Paul Simon

1305
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,600
cause Paul Simon wouldn't get on board.

1306
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,520
Oh.

1307
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,280
Honestly, very fascinating all of that stuff from the 80s.

1308
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,680
So look that up.

1309
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,840
Well, he got involved in the most important cause,

1310
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,960
being able to wear bandana at Disneyland.

1311
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,080
At Disneyland, enforcing this ridiculous law

1312
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,280
is also an attack on rock and music

1313
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,160
and all the people who believe in it.

1314
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,000
They're telling me nobody rocks in the Magic Kingdom.

1315
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,040
Nobody expresses their individuality in the Magic Kingdom

1316
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,380
except maybe that guy in the rodent suit.

1317
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,080
It is time to boycott Disneyland

1318
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,440
until the vague and unfair dress code they enforce

1319
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,800
is abolished once and for all.

1320
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,640
I like that.

1321
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,460
That's good.

1322
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,300
I like that.

1323
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,140
We're still having dress code problems.

1324
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:52,600
People buy these Star Wars costumes

1325
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,800
and they can't wear them around.

1326
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,640
Yeah.

1327
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:59,200
You can only do your costumes one day of the year.

1328
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,640
Or only on Halloween.

1329
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,880
They don't let you walk around

1330
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,600
in a full beast regalia or whatever you.

1331
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,320
Yeah, hey.

1332
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:14,200
He was pointing out problems with them,

1333
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,560
not like in counterculture,

1334
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,760
before they ran into all the issues with LGBT

1335
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,320
and at Videopolis.

1336
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,760
Steve was way ahead of it.

1337
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,080
Yeah, so I mean, Bruce did not explain that letter on stage.

1338
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,600
I don't even know if you remembered that or knew of it.

1339
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,280
If his story had peaked, we're going to nuts.

1340
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,920
And then like, then little Steven wrote a letter.

1341
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,000
Bruce puts glasses on, reads the.

1342
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,360
This letter should have factored in the Broadway show.

1343
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,200
Let me read the letter for you.

1344
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,360
Think you're gonna get a kick out of this.

1345
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,800
We're gonna need some quiet.

1346
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,760
The thing he often says when they're doing a quiet song.

1347
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,000
Somebody yells Thunder Road and he's like, no.

1348
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Not now.

1349
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,040
The letter first.

1350
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:55,860
Shut up.

1351
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,240
Give me a moment here.

1352
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,000
So I think that's a qualifier.

1353
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,400
Yeah, I love that.

1354
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,600
That's a big, that's a big fun rock and roll clash.

1355
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,240
The Beatles thing.

1356
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,320
We've talked about this a little bit,

1357
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,760
but the strangest thing is that for all these,

1358
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,120
all these various acts who we can find no evidence

1359
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:18,520
of them interacting with the Disney parks, strangely,

1360
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,000
the Disney world is the place where the Beatles

1361
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,480
officially ended in 1974.

1362
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,400
Yeah, that is so, when I learned that,

1363
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,040
that was so wild to me.

1364
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,560
Somebody, let's see, allears.net, there's an article.

1365
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,080
Did you find this?

1366
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,920
I'm not sure which one I saw.

1367
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:35,760
You don't know if you saw it.

1368
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,560
It was on WDW Magic all day.

1369
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,400
Ears.

1370
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,920
Well, it does feel like we pull a new real ears,

1371
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,640
mice related website out every time we do an episode.

1372
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,160
Yeah, tell tales.

1373
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:54,720
The way this guy illustrated it is so crazy.

1374
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,160
I guess, let me see if I can read all of this,

1375
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,420
if this is too boring.

1376
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,840
So I guess John was not with them when they were gonna

1377
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,320
sign the papers finally dissolving the Beatles.

1378
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,520
Or is in New York.

1379
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,440
Yeah.

1380
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,880
He was on his last weekend.

1381
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,000
With May Pang.

1382
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,680
Which was a year long event.

1383
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,640
I think 18 months.

1384
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,920
18 month affair.

1385
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,440
During which he made the weird drunken,

1386
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,680
have you heard that album, quote unquote,

1387
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,720
when he jammed with Paul for the first time

1388
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,480
since the Beatles and Stevie Wonder.

1389
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,960
It's John and Paul the first time since the Beatles

1390
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:29,160
and Stevie Wonder and Nilsson maybe and other people.

1391
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,800
And you're like, wow, that must be amazing.

1392
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,520
And it is not, it sucks.

1393
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,640
It's like if you and I picked up instruments right now.

1394
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,120
Yeah, well, I honestly, I think I could be sounding better

1395
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,240
cause I'm all competent.

1396
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,200
I mean, they're all competent too.

1397
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,120
It just seems like they were high out of their mind.

1398
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,760
You could, I'm not so sure.

1399
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,560
I might, yeah, yeah.

1400
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,720
I just think we can cobble.

1401
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,640
I honestly think we can cobble something together

1402
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,120
that's more listenable is what I'm saying.

1403
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,640
Can I play keyboard as well as John Lennon

1404
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:55,000
about to pass out and like spit blood out of his mouth.

1405
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:55,840
I think you can.

1406
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,660
Maybe.

1407
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,800
All right, let me just read all of it.

1408
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,640
Why not?

1409
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,440
It's Patreon, no one cares.

1410
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,840
Julian was with us for the Christmas holiday

1411
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,240
and all was calm, all was bright.

1412
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,360
Gathered around a huge table where George is a lawyer

1413
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,560
and business manager, the McCartney's with Paul's in-laws

1414
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,120
and lawyers, Ringo's lawyers and business manager,

1415
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,640
Neil Aspinall of Apple with two sets of company lawyers

1416
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,720
and John's lawyer, Harold Sater and his team.

1417
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,560
And now I'm of course, missing my spot here.

1418
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,840
I'm really glad I know about Harold Sater now.

1419
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,880
Okay, he's with somebody.

1420
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,720
He says, take your camera out, John joked.

1421
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,400
He looked wistfully out the window.

1422
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,960
You could almost see him replaying the entire Beatles

1423
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:32,980
experience in his mind.

1424
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,260
So John is in Florida.

1425
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:37,220
He finally picked up his pen and in the unlikely backdrop

1426
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,980
of the Polynesian Village Hotel at Disney World,

1427
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:42,700
ended the greatest rock and roll band in history

1428
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:46,340
by simply scrolling John Lennon at the bottom of the page.

1429
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,940
Yes, John Lennon had booked a room

1430
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,700
at the Polynesian Village Resort at Walt Disney World

1431
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,020
and gazed out at the Seven Seas Lagoon

1432
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:56,340
before he signed the document that broke up the Beatles.

1433
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,100
I mean, that's great.

1434
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:02,980
Thinking about his past all the way from Liverpool

1435
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:06,260
to the Cavern Club, to the rooftop.

1436
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:07,300
To Liberty Square.

1437
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,660
And imagining what the future would hold.

1438
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,620
Perhaps that the lagoon would be the home

1439
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:16,300
of some kind of stunt boat-based syndicated show

1440
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,300
with a wrestler.

1441
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,000
It's very famous.

1442
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,900
Perhaps imagining his friends in the Beach Boys

1443
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:26,380
would one day film a music video, but 20 feet away.

1444
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,580
It's very famous for very many reasons.

1445
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:30,820
Yeah. It's crazy.

1446
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,740
It's crazy. Seven Seas Lagoon.

1447
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:33,580
Seven Seas Lagoon.

1448
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,100
He's looking at Cinderella's castle

1449
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,540
and he signs the document.

1450
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,700
Did he go into the parks?

1451
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,700
I watched pictures of him in the parks, I think.

1452
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,660
I saw a picture of it.

1453
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:45,020
He apparently befriended a Monorail driver

1454
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:47,220
and the Monorail driver got a really good photo of him

1455
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,900
with the contemporary in the background.

1456
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:49,780
Oh, that's fun.

1457
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:50,620
Yeah.

1458
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,380
Yeah.

1459
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,500
Yeah, he was with his kid.

1460
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,140
He was with Julian.

1461
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:57,940
At least Julian got some nice things.

1462
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:01,140
It feels like Julian gets the short end of the stick a lot.

1463
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:01,980
Yeah.

1464
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:08,580
Yeah, they even changed his name in the song about him.

1465
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:09,660
You get that?

1466
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,340
Couldn't even get the, hey, Julian.

1467
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:12,380
No, hey, Jules.

1468
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,540
So did he let go, did he see the country bears?

1469
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:19,620
When did the country bears go in?

1470
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:20,940
Oh yeah, that's a good question.

1471
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,740
Isn't it right around?

1472
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:26,820
When in Florida, country bears, Wiki.

1473
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:29,300
No, the ride, not the movie.

1474
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:32,140
Because now I'm imagining a scenario where he,

1475
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:33,580
people like pointed out that he was there

1476
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:34,940
and he went up and jammed with him.

1477
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,140
Oh my God, can you imagine?

1478
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,180
Yeah, they were open in 71.

1479
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,060
He yanked a jug out of one of their hands.

1480
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:41,900
They were open in 71.

1481
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:42,900
Killer jug solo.

1482
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,740
October of 71.

1483
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,100
So what did I say the year was?

1484
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,020
74.

1485
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:49,460
So yeah.

1486
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,300
So it's possible that John Lennon sat

1487
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,780
and watched the Country Bear Channel.

1488
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:54,780
100%.

1489
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:56,860
It would probably be his favorite thing there.

1490
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:00,100
And if he knew about it being gone in Disneyland,

1491
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,620
he would have been upset.

1492
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:04,780
If we uncovered, if some were found,

1493
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:07,620
they found the lost John Lennon tapes

1494
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:12,620
and that in 1974 he flirted with a new genre of hoop nanny.

1495
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:14,580
Oh my God.

1496
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:16,620
Inspired by these bears.

1497
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:18,340
That sucked.

1498
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:20,740
That's as bad of a place as it could be.

1499
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:22,340
So, liver lips, McGrawl.

1500
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:25,380
Why John isn't that?

1501
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:26,780
John's the hardest one, maybe?

1502
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:28,460
Yeah.

1503
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,940
I mean, there's so many impressions.

1504
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:31,780
Yeah.

1505
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:32,900
It's not the...

1506
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:33,740
George is hard too.

1507
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:37,140
I do Paul okay and then Ringo a little better than okay.

1508
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:40,020
Well, you know, because it's just, you know,

1509
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,700
it's very matter of fact.

1510
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:42,540
The earlier one,

1511
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:43,860
I feel like I didn't do a good job.

1512
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:45,020
Yeah, earlier one, he just,

1513
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:48,140
this is this guy and he's like, I don't know.

1514
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:52,260
And then Ringo peace and love, peace and love.

1515
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,740
And it's all in the nose.

1516
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:55,900
Here we go again.

1517
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,620
One more time playing this song.

1518
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,300
Here we go.

1519
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,420
You've heard it before and here it is again.

1520
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,700
No more letters.

1521
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,220
No more letters.

1522
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:08,540
I'm warning you with peace and love.

1523
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,260
Let me see if my streak can continue

1524
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,260
of upsetting animals with...

1525
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:14,260
You don't love me anymore.

1526
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,540
Hey.

1527
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,380
He's pretty calm.

1528
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,220
Yeah, Edwin doesn't care.

1529
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,060
You know what had happened?

1530
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:23,980
I did it to my new cats and they ran away too.

1531
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,820
Oh wow.

1532
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,660
Yep.

1533
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:27,060
Yeah, this is quite a streak of upsetting animals.

1534
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,220
Let me just Google John Lennon country bears

1535
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,180
just for the hell of it.

1536
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,860
Just in case.

1537
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,940
It would be a shame if we...

1538
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:37,820
Oh my God, he's on stage in this picture.

1539
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:38,660
I knew it.

1540
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,980
He left me, oh, yeah, well, this is weird.

1541
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:45,300
He left me paying for six months to hang out with Trixie.

1542
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,980
Trixie and John.

1543
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:49,900
He just got up on the swing and...

1544
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:50,740
Yeah, they went away.

1545
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,940
Swing and teddy bear.

1546
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,220
Oh yeah, yeah, Trixie is the...

1547
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:56,460
Got the skirt and...

1548
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:57,780
Okay.

1549
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:00,460
So he just, when the curtain went down, he dove in there.

1550
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:01,300
Yep.

1551
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,340
And then sconded with the robot.

1552
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:05,380
Took her to an island.

1553
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,220
Yep.

1554
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:08,500
It's a, yeah, one of his islands.

1555
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,820
Yeah, so that, I mean, that is,

1556
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:14,420
it's a sad rock and roll moment,

1557
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:17,060
but it is a pretty crazy rock and roll moment.

1558
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:18,980
I think it's the most historic thing.

1559
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:19,820
For sure.

1560
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:22,820
Within 71, the Eagles are formed at Disneyland.

1561
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:25,620
74, the Beatles are ended at Disney World.

1562
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:26,460
This wild.

1563
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:27,300
Pretty crazy.

1564
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,820
So that has to be in the running for moments.

1565
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,700
Yeah, that's up there.

1566
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:33,540
Yeah.

1567
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:40,020
Now, while the Beatles could not work it out together,

1568
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:44,860
their song of reconciliation, We Can Work It Out,

1569
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:49,860
was performed by another group of charismatic young lads.

1570
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,740
I'm talking about NSYNC,

1571
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:54,860
who did a showcase at Pleasure Island.

1572
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,020
I forget if I talked about this

1573
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:57,820
on the Pleasure Island episode.

1574
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:59,740
I think vague, I have vague memory of this.

1575
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:00,580
I may have.

1576
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,940
I think I might have to play a little snippet of this.

1577
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:05,540
Yeah, I think I have heard this.

1578
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,860
Lou Pearlman, the great Lou Pearlman,

1579
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:10,860
the great Lou Pearlman,

1580
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:14,900
RIP put together a showcase of NSYNC

1581
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:19,260
to try to get record label people interested.

1582
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:20,700
And they took over the,

1583
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,540
I think it's called the Rock and Roll Beach Club

1584
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:24,660
at Pleasure Island.

1585
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:28,900
And so maybe the first proper NSYNC performance ever

1586
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:32,060
was on Disney World, probably was at Pleasure Island.

1587
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:32,900
Wow.

1588
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:36,860
And they perform the funkiest damn version

1589
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:38,580
of We Can Work It Out.

1590
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:40,260
Have you ever heard?

1591
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:41,700
Let me do the intro,

1592
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,620
and then I'll skip ahead.

1593
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:46,700
This boy, what a start.

1594
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,360
Life is very short.

1595
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,660
Big time, big time.

1596
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:54,380
Life is very short.

1597
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:56,860
And then JC takes over.

1598
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,660
What you're saying.

1599
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:05,140
Give it voice till you think that it's all right.

1600
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:06,380
It's all right.

1601
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,620
It's all right.

1602
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:11,940
We can work it out and give it strength and say goodnight.

1603
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:12,780
Oh no.

1604
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,220
We can work it out.

1605
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:16,220
We can work it out.

1606
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,580
Life is very short.

1607
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:19,580
And there's no time.

1608
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:21,580
And there's no time.

1609
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:27,580
We can work it out.

1610
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,580
And there's no time.

1611
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:30,580
But everybody's not ready.

1612
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:31,420
That's the thing.

1613
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:32,260
Wow.

1614
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:33,100
The aesthetic of the video,

1615
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:34,660
for those of you not watching it,

1616
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:37,420
it's extremely, it's the grind

1617
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,180
is basically what we're looking at.

1618
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:40,020
Yeah.

1619
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:42,780
I wonder, I guess Lou's theory probably was that

1620
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,500
mom and dad will see that

1621
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:45,940
and then it'll be something for them

1622
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:48,260
and then it'll be something for the kids.

1623
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:51,020
I would guess that was his thought process of that.

1624
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,860
What do you mean by doing it at Disney World?

1625
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,220
Well, doing that song.

1626
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:55,140
We can work it out.

1627
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:55,980
Mom and dad would go,

1628
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:58,420
oh, a new take on an old favorite.

1629
00:59:58,420 --> 00:59:59,700
They have respect for the classics.

1630
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:00,540
Right.

1631
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:02,460
And I sort of enjoy this new version of this.

1632
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,820
I don't mind having taken my 13 year old to this.

1633
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:05,660
Right.

1634
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:07,660
This is my garbage fully.

1635
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:09,180
I wish they hadn't done all that stuff.

1636
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:10,980
All that vocal stuff.

1637
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:13,300
And that's the opener.

1638
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,580
They kick right into that.

1639
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:15,420
Yeah.

1640
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:16,780
So right then he's got everyone on,

1641
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,940
everyone's on the side of NSYNC.

1642
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:20,620
Mom, dad, kids.

1643
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:21,780
And it worked.

1644
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:22,620
Yeah.

1645
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:27,140
The great Lou Pearlman figured out the formula.

1646
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:28,140
It is pretty funny.

1647
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:30,780
We know these bands, he did put them together

1648
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:32,900
and then did a lot of bad stuff.

1649
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,300
Look into that as well if you want to.

1650
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,140
You may be shocked to learn.

1651
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:38,980
Shocked, I'm sure.

1652
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:40,940
Lou Pearlman was a shitty guy.

1653
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:42,460
Yeah.

1654
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:47,380
Now, relatedly, let me jump around a little.

1655
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:50,020
Because doing this episode, I was just like,

1656
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:52,540
let me just Google all my favorite musicians

1657
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:54,060
and see if there's any results for them

1658
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:56,300
having been to Disney Night or Disney World.

1659
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,660
Prince, you and I, big Prince fans.

1660
01:00:58,660 --> 01:00:59,500
Yep.

1661
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,700
Maybe our favorite, both of us.

1662
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,820
And very confusing to Google Disneyland Prince.

1663
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:05,660
Oh yeah.

1664
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:07,540
Because the place is crawling with Princes.

1665
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:09,860
Like when I Googled Disneyland Ramones,

1666
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:14,300
I just got Ramones tire shop from Cars Land.

1667
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,460
These are the pitfalls of doing a show.

1668
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:17,540
It's so difficult.

1669
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:21,540
So pretty hard to find any,

1670
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:23,100
I don't believe there's any interaction

1671
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:24,220
with Prince and Disneyland.

1672
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:25,140
And then I was like,

1673
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,820
well maybe he just never made it down there.

1674
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:27,900
But you know what he was close to?

1675
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,140
It was the Mall of America.

1676
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:30,100
Oh.

1677
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,620
I didn't find anything for that either.

1678
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:33,580
They have exhibits of him now.

1679
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:34,940
But just like, please, come on.

1680
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:38,700
Prince with the slave tattoo on his face

1681
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:43,140
going down the log flume at Camp Snoopy, please.

1682
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:45,060
But there was nothing.

1683
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:47,140
But I searched a little further

1684
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:49,700
because I wasn't satisfied with that.

1685
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:54,700
And I discovered at least a Prince song

1686
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:58,420
that was performed on Disney World property.

1687
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:00,820
I'm gonna jump around this one a little bit too.

1688
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:02,660
Here you go.

1689
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:04,060
This is probably from 89 or 90.

1690
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:10,300
Oh wow.

1691
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:25,340
So what we have here, let me jump around a little.

1692
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:27,740
This is a Mickey Mouse Club

1693
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:28,740
or as the kids call it,

1694
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:33,180
MMC performance of Party Man from the Batman soundtrack.

1695
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,380
Three of the older kids come out

1696
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:42,380
and set up the Party Man who in the film is the Joker.

1697
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:45,900
But in this, the kind of the reveal

1698
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:49,700
is that it's the youngest littlest kid who is the Party Man.

1699
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:51,940
And then his verse, I gotta play really fast.

1700
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:52,780
Oh man.

1701
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:10,140
He's this little eager boy in a vest and a bow tie.

1702
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:10,980
Whoa.

1703
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:17,860
Wow.

1704
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:21,220
And then he does a tap dance on top of like a diner counter.

1705
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:22,100
That's good.

1706
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:22,940
Really good.

1707
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:23,780
Yeah.

1708
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:27,220
It made me wonder what the hell's going on with music rights

1709
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:32,220
where they can, this Disney show can do a Prince song

1710
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:35,540
from Warner Brothers records from a Warner Brothers film.

1711
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:36,380
Right.

1712
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:37,540
How is that allowed?

1713
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:39,060
I never see that today.

1714
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:41,460
No, yeah, I don't know what, I don't know.

1715
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,500
How was, yeah, how was that even possible?

1716
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,340
MMC was brazen.

1717
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:46,580
They did whatever they wanted.

1718
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:47,420
Yeah, they were.

1719
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:48,260
They covered any.

1720
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:50,020
So would you consider that in the running for?

1721
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:51,100
I definitely would.

1722
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:52,780
Okay.

1723
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:53,620
And I would also have to,

1724
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:54,460
I don't have the clip of this ready to go,

1725
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:57,820
but I'm biased because this is my personal favorite

1726
01:03:57,820 --> 01:03:59,020
MMC performance.

1727
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:01,940
I think if you were to really go through the MMC archives,

1728
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:05,980
it's very possible MMC could have the rockinest title.

1729
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:10,300
But my favorite one is a performance of

1730
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:12,980
King of Wishful Thinking by Go West

1731
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:16,060
that takes place at the Yacht and Beach Club.

1732
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,260
And in that, you know that thing on the tour

1733
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:20,700
where there was the little boat and you put on,

1734
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:24,260
somebody from the crowd put on like a yellow rain jacket

1735
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:25,740
and then like piloted a little

1736
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:27,540
and it cut between that and a little model.

1737
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:29,820
They used that because the song is about

1738
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:32,060
pretend my ship's not sinking.

1739
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:33,380
Right.

1740
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:38,300
And the kids, it's a great performance, really solid.

1741
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:41,420
And you get to see glistening new Yacht and Beach Club

1742
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:42,260
as well.

1743
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:44,060
Heaven.

1744
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:45,340
So my personal choice might be this

1745
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,780
King of Wishful Thinking performance.

1746
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:49,740
How rockin' is that song?

1747
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:50,580
I don't know.

1748
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:55,020
But you know, it's Slim Pickens a little bit.

1749
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:58,580
So it may be an MMC Go West cover is the rockinest moment.

1750
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:01,100
For a brief second, I thought you were gonna say

1751
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:02,860
Prince Song performed at Disney Property,

1752
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:07,020
which would be the Mad Tea Party performing Let's Go Crazy,

1753
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:09,500
which they did almost every night.

1754
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,340
Oh boy.

1755
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:14,500
Yeah, that was a regular thing in the set

1756
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:18,180
where the Mad Hatter, I think, and Alice would sing

1757
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:20,300
Let's Go Crazy.

1758
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:22,980
And did they?

1759
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:23,820
Did the audience?

1760
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:25,860
Oh my gosh, I did.

1761
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:28,820
Of one of the 15 times I saw them do it, yeah.

1762
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:29,740
It's not that many.

1763
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:30,900
You personally went crazy.

1764
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,420
I bet it's seven though.

1765
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:36,460
I bet I saw them play that song seven times.

1766
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:38,700
The show was around for like two years.

1767
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:39,700
It's pretty good.

1768
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,300
It put you in such good mental health.

1769
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:44,340
You need not see Dr. Everything'll Feel Alright.

1770
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,260
Yeah, no I didn't see him.

1771
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:47,940
Dr. Everything'll Be Alright.

1772
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:52,780
Yeah, electronic, you consider electronic

1773
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:55,460
a dance party, rock and roll.

1774
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,660
I'm not sure, it's electronic.

1775
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:00,740
But it is the spirit of rock, I think.

1776
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:02,340
Sure. It's born out of it.

1777
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:05,420
They've got that space, you've got that Bowie guy

1778
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:07,420
that Bowie rip off with the cane.

1779
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:08,260
Yes.

1780
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:11,100
They're up there.

1781
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,460
I mean, I've heard they're gonna do a descendants

1782
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:16,780
dance party for Halloween this year at California Adventure,

1783
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:18,060
but I don't know if, I don't think there's a band.

1784
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:19,060
I think it's just a DJ.

1785
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,500
Are you interested enough in this kind of thing

1786
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,380
that you will go to the descendants dance party?

1787
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:26,020
I think it's only for the Oogie Boogie's Halloween bash,

1788
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,180
which I actually am very interested in

1789
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:29,620
because they have a treat trail

1790
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:32,460
and I want Jason to go on the treat trail.

1791
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:33,300
And they've like-

1792
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:35,620
We say Disney is not a rockin' place.

1793
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:36,740
Yeah, there's a haunted-

1794
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:38,460
Oogie Boogie's treat trail.

1795
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:42,180
Haunted treat trail that I would really like to see Jason go.

1796
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:45,980
It's like $150 though, so I don't know if it's gonna happen.

1797
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:46,820
But it does seem like-

1798
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:51,020
To get treats that together cost $4.50.

1799
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:54,180
There was enough stuff that was listed on it.

1800
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:56,340
Let me see, and we'll see if I'm embarrassed

1801
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:58,340
when I read them all out loud.

1802
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:00,020
There was enough stuff that actually made me go,

1803
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:02,020
because sometimes these ticketed events,

1804
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:04,300
I go, ah, it doesn't seem like there's that much.

1805
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:08,380
Like the Haunted Mansion event was $300.

1806
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:09,220
Whoa.

1807
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:11,060
And it was like, you get to ride pirates

1808
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:13,620
in Haunted Mansion all you want.

1809
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:15,700
And it's cool, but it's like, we have an annual pass

1810
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,500
and they lit the mansion very cool,

1811
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,300
and there were like a couple live performers

1812
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,100
on the actual ride.

1813
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:21,940
Oh.

1814
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:24,180
They like had a night that moved a little bit

1815
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:25,780
and maybe, and something else.

1816
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,660
But it didn't seem like something insane.

1817
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:30,300
We didn't get to go off the vehicle

1818
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,940
and walk through or anything.

1819
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:34,560
I would've wanted some little kid to jump up on the table

1820
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:38,300
in the ballroom and sing Party Man, and the ghost saw.

1821
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:40,620
If that was the case, that's $300, I agree.

1822
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:41,700
Yeah, hell yeah.

1823
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:44,180
But there's like a different paint than night.

1824
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:47,180
There's a Redwood Creek challenge trail

1825
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:49,580
that turns into the immersive treat trail

1826
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:52,180
featuring Disney villains.

1827
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:53,020
The villains.

1828
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:54,020
You have to go to this.

1829
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:56,740
Join a pulsing dance party with the greatest dance crew

1830
01:07:56,740 --> 01:08:00,580
from the Isle of the Lost based on Disney's descendants.

1831
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:02,380
New World of Color show.

1832
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:04,780
Something else too.

1833
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:07,020
Anyway.

1834
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:07,860
Treat trail.

1835
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:10,980
Is there any further info about what kind of treats or?

1836
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:11,980
No.

1837
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:14,260
So I'm, yes, I wanna know what treats are

1838
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:18,100
on the immersive treat trail featuring the Disney villains.

1839
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:20,220
I might even say, I might go so far as to say,

1840
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:23,420
I would finance his trip along the treat trail.

1841
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:26,220
The way that you finance your friends

1842
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:28,380
doing the marathon for charity.

1843
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:29,700
This is an important cause.

1844
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:31,660
I will donate.

1845
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:36,660
I'll donate $10 per 10 feet of the treat trail.

1846
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:40,660
Finances starting costs.

1847
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:41,500
That's good.

1848
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:42,540
I think that'll help.

1849
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:44,860
I love the Redwood.

1850
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:47,300
We haven't done the challenge trail yet.

1851
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:50,700
I'm a big fan of that Redwood Creek challenge trail.

1852
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:51,540
I did, Ares.

1853
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:52,820
I had more fun than I thought.

1854
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:56,220
I, as a kid, I think loved walking on netting.

1855
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:57,980
So I still like walking on netting.

1856
01:08:57,980 --> 01:08:59,820
So now the idea that there'll be Disney villains

1857
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:02,300
along the trail in the dark and they'll be spooky

1858
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:04,260
and it'll be the best,

1859
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:05,100
it'll be not the best,

1860
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:06,940
but it'll be a version of a Disney maze.

1861
01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:10,300
My friend Kia's favorite place in the park anywhere

1862
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:13,940
is the petrified tree in the Redwood Creek.

1863
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:14,780
That's fun.

1864
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:17,020
Challenge trail, which I hope they just smear

1865
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:20,580
with chocolate syrup and let Jason lick it off.

1866
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:24,340
200 years worth of it.

1867
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:26,980
I was Googling.

1868
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:29,780
So I went, okay, we're gonna cover classic rock.

1869
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:32,380
Let's go with some of my 90s favorites and see.

1870
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:33,580
I didn't do a lot of 90s.

1871
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:37,300
So I immediately said, Bare Naked Ladies, Disney.

1872
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:39,300
And there was nothing except for,

1873
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,980
they were going to play a Disney tour in 2008,

1874
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:46,380
but Stephen Page was arrested for cocaine.

1875
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:49,020
And it was right after they released

1876
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:51,420
their children's album, Snack Time.

1877
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:54,580
And I also kind of-

1878
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:56,940
Another full Jason cover, please.

1879
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:57,980
Oh yeah.

1880
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:01,060
I also sort of think this is also what leads to Stephen Page

1881
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:03,060
like having a break from like,

1882
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:05,380
hoping the band would turn into Elvis Costello

1883
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:06,860
and then like the rest of the band

1884
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:08,380
forcing them to do Snack Time.

1885
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:12,580
And then he just goes nuts and gets divorced

1886
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:15,660
and does cocaine and gets arrested and gets in a big fight.

1887
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:16,940
And yeah.

1888
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:17,820
Oh no.

1889
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:20,220
So then they get kicked off the Disney thing.

1890
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:21,060
Bare Naked Ladies also have-

1891
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:22,980
What do you mean a Disney tour?

1892
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:26,060
I should go back and look exactly what this tour was.

1893
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:29,940
Bare Naked Ladies also do a cover of Grim Grinning Ghosts

1894
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:30,780
from years prior, which is a real fun-

1895
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:32,220
Well that's a rare, there's not a lot of covers

1896
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,740
of park songs.

1897
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:35,700
There are some though.

1898
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:37,620
And that's also in there and I'm trying to remember-

1899
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:38,620
Okay.

1900
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:39,460
Other ones.

1901
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:40,300
That's what I was thinking.

1902
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:42,300
I was like, I wish Showcase could have done.

1903
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:47,340
Grim Grinning Ghosts come out to socialize.

1904
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:48,420
Let's see here.

1905
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:51,660
That's what Bare Naked Ladies have been done

1906
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:54,420
from the lineup of this summer's Disney Music Block Party,

1907
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:56,380
which was to feature them playing alongside

1908
01:10:56,380 --> 01:11:01,380
such kiddie faves, which Dan Zanes, they might be giants,

1909
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:04,220
which I know they've done kid albums, I guess.

1910
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:06,740
Ralph's World and Raymond Simone.

1911
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:07,580
Wow.

1912
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:10,020
So they were gonna be on that tour.

1913
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:10,860
And Steven Page-

1914
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:12,380
If I were staring on the barrel of that,

1915
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:14,620
I might do a bunch of cocaine too.

1916
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:15,460
Yeah.

1917
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:18,140
I've recently done, I did an episode

1918
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:21,180
of a Bare Naked Ladies podcast, someone else's podcast

1919
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:23,820
and that'll come out at a certain point.

1920
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:27,660
But yeah, I have a lot of theories about everything.

1921
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:28,820
I see.

1922
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:31,420
Here's Bare Naked Ladies, Grim Grinning Ghosts.

1923
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:35,380
["Bare Naked Ladies"]

1924
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:43,860
Pretty fun.

1925
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:46,860
["Bare Naked Ladies"]

1926
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:49,620
Listen to that piano.

1927
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:53,380
Oh wait, it went away.

1928
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:56,340
I think it was for the movie.

1929
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:00,180
["Bare Naked Ladies"]

1930
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,900
Ed's doing the voice.

1931
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:13,940
He's really going for it.

1932
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:15,740
So I feel like I should agree that I like that,

1933
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:16,660
but I don't.

1934
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:17,500
Oh man.

1935
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,340
I'm a little bit of trouble.

1936
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:19,180
Really?

1937
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:20,020
It's got that Colin Rispitz,

1938
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:22,060
it's got that Brian Setzer thing going on.

1939
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:23,820
But isn't that so the song itself though?

1940
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:25,100
I guess, yeah, I suppose so.

1941
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:25,940
Yeah.

1942
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:27,180
Maybe you don't like the song.

1943
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:31,060
I'm a little bit, well, no, that's not true.

1944
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:31,900
I like the song.

1945
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:34,500
I think I like it maybe more instrumentally

1946
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:37,860
than I like all the lead up and the variations.

1947
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:42,220
So I Googled Weezer Disneyland.

1948
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:44,060
Oh, it's coming.

1949
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:46,380
They're gonna make four, god damn.

1950
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:47,940
They have, I think they have something,

1951
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:51,180
but on one of Rivers' demo collections,

1952
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:53,060
he has a song called Walt Disney.

1953
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:54,100
Okay.

1954
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:55,140
That's an okay song.

1955
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:56,500
It's not my favorite,

1956
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:59,140
but there doesn't seem to be much with them.

1957
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:00,220
Then I started going, all right.

1958
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:01,180
Just you wait.

1959
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:04,060
They will do a residency.

1960
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:05,740
They will play 30 times a day.

1961
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:07,380
Yes, for sure.

1962
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:09,260
Third Eye Blind, nothing.

1963
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:10,100
Matchbox 20.

1964
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:11,980
Wait, was one of your favorites Third Eye Blind?

1965
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:15,300
Well, no, I just was starting to associate.

1966
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:18,580
Matchbox 20, there's a picture of Rob Thomas

1967
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:19,500
and his wife in the park,

1968
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:23,980
but I think he did some Christmas special maybe performances.

1969
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:25,660
That's the kind of thing that doesn't interest me at all.

1970
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:28,580
I was like Stevie Wonder, done those things, but whatever.

1971
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:32,740
And I was like, oh, what about the Goo Goo Dolls?

1972
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:36,100
And then I totally forgot that not under

1973
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:38,900
the Goo Goo Dolls banner, Johnny Resnick,

1974
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:42,420
John Resnick did the song from Treasure Planet.

1975
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:45,020
I'm Still Here,

1976
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:49,540
which I totally forgot about.

1977
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:51,220
Do you remember that?

1978
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:52,060
I don't.

1979
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:55,500
I do not in the least, but I'm very curious.

1980
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:58,940
It's not, it's one of the lesser songs, I think,

1981
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:00,820
of their catalog.

1982
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:03,060
Of the Goo Goo Dolls catalog?

1983
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:04,380
Of the Goo Goo Dolls catalog.

1984
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:06,980
But I was like, oh my God, I totally forgot.

1985
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:10,740
The Treasure Planet song was written by Johnny Resnick.

1986
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:16,820
Got that sweet Goo Goo Dolls-like twang.

1987
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:20,340
And a question to the world,

1988
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:23,620
not an answer to the other.

1989
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:28,820
Oh, a moment, a time when the world's

1990
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:32,420
in what do you think you'd have said?

1991
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:34,620
That is making a face.

1992
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:36,980
Like he smelled some shit or something.

1993
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:38,860
It's really, it was a struggle.

1994
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:42,860
I'll never be what you want me to be.

1995
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:46,620
I mean, that's the gist of it.

1996
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:52,580
That's a song to make out with your middle school girlfriend,

1997
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:57,420
too, for 11 seconds before somebody's parent comes in

1998
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:59,340
and says, hey, what the hell?

1999
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:01,660
I hear Johnny Resnick's music playing in here.

2000
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:02,820
I know what's going on.

2001
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:06,300
People are getting amorous.

2002
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:09,100
The song is called I'm Still Here, Jim's Theme.

2003
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:11,580
So I guess Jim was the Treasure Planet boy.

2004
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:14,260
So then I was like, well, did he ever,

2005
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:16,700
I remember him performing this on a special.

2006
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:18,700
I remember watching that.

2007
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:23,060
But then I found a Goo Goo Dolls setlist from 2012

2008
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,540
from Disneyland and I went, what is this?

2009
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:27,940
And it's not, it was a little anticlimactic.

2010
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:30,500
It's just, they did a corporate Intel gig

2011
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:35,500
and played six songs and some video of it is on YouTube.

2012
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:38,140
So they did like some of, they just did the hits,

2013
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:40,540
six hits for the Intel people

2014
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:42,940
at a private Disneyland party.

2015
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:45,780
Probably not in the running for rockin'est moments.

2016
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:48,500
But they did play the park.

2017
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:53,900
Yeah, I hope to God we don't determine the rockin'est moment

2018
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:55,820
in theme park history is the Goo Goo Dolls

2019
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:57,700
playing an Intel corporate event.

2020
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:02,380
Yeah, but I was coming up short with a lot of stuff.

2021
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:05,660
There's not a ton of documentation on this.

2022
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:09,420
So yeah, so the Goo Goo Dolls there, they're in there.

2023
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:12,860
Is Jim's theme, there is a performance of Jim's theme,

2024
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:15,260
but I don't think it's in the running either.

2025
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:18,260
I'm saying Jim's theme.

2026
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:22,820
I think the live music next time we do a show,

2027
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:24,300
is Jim's theme in it.

2028
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:30,020
Well, well, did you, maybe you knew this already.

2029
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:30,860
Maybe we're gonna bring it up,

2030
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:33,020
but did you know, and maybe you're saving this for the end

2031
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:34,020
and I'm gonna blow it.

2032
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:38,380
1982, who played Disney Disneyland?

2033
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:39,220
I don't think I do.

2034
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:40,140
Sparks.

2035
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,260
Oh yeah, okay.

2036
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:46,260
Well, so, oh yeah, they played the Tomorrowland Terrace

2037
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:47,100
at some point, yeah.

2038
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:47,940
So that's cool.

2039
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:50,820
Hey, Sparks, one of my favorite bands ever

2040
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:52,820
and they have very delightful songs,

2041
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:55,780
one called Minnie Mouse and one called Mickey Mouse,

2042
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:57,660
which they explain in a concert

2043
01:16:57,660 --> 01:16:59,780
that they did the song Minnie,

2044
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:01,780
or boy, listen to both of these songs.

2045
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:02,620
I don't have them queued up,

2046
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:05,180
but Mickey Mouse is a delight

2047
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:07,780
and then Disney got mad

2048
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:10,220
and was threatening to sue or something

2049
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:14,020
and then, but then it started getting radio play

2050
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:15,900
and it was like, oh, maybe this is actually kind of good

2051
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:17,340
and instead Disney kind of said,

2052
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:21,020
hey, we're doing an album of like pseudo rock.

2053
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:22,860
Will you come up with a new one?

2054
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:23,820
You know, just whatever you,

2055
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:26,340
I think it may have been, maybe even Disney said,

2056
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:28,420
like, you know, just so whatever you think, you know,

2057
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:31,340
maybe do Minnie Mouse and they said, sure,

2058
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:34,020
and they just cranked out Minnie Mouse really fast.

2059
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:34,860
Sure.

2060
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:37,780
Oh, but Minnie Mouse is a delightful song.

2061
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:42,540
With the lyric, people say she's just a mouse,

2062
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:45,940
just a mouse, the Taj Mahal is just a house.

2063
01:17:45,940 --> 01:17:47,060
What a house.

2064
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:49,100
That's good, that's good.

2065
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:49,940
And they cut,

2066
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:51,060
Disney cut an official thing to this

2067
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:54,420
when they were doing these D, not D23, DTV.

2068
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:57,380
This is really, I think the 80s is where the levy breaks

2069
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:59,660
with Disney rock interaction

2070
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:03,020
because they want a piece of that MTV pie

2071
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:05,940
and their solution is to edit a bunch of old cartoons

2072
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:07,500
to rock music.

2073
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:09,340
But I watched a lot of those growing up.

2074
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:10,500
There were a lot of songs where I was like,

2075
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:14,140
oh, this wasn't made just for the DTV video.

2076
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:16,420
Specifically, I remember you're the one that I want.

2077
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:19,060
I was when I saw it finally in its Grease context.

2078
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:20,860
So I was like, what?

2079
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:24,900
This isn't just, this isn't a Mickey and Minnie duet?

2080
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,700
There is some, I mean, there's truly like,

2081
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:31,780
I feel like there's a hundred episodes

2082
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:36,540
on just the original music produced, the covers,

2083
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:37,820
all of that stuff you're talking about,

2084
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:40,540
the music video channel, all of it.

2085
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:42,140
We can review a lot of that stuff.

2086
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:43,620
Mickey, she's got a crush on you,

2087
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:45,580
could be a whole episode by itself.

2088
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:47,980
I think we maybe just got to do a splash dance,

2089
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:50,500
which is also what Minnie Mouse is from.

2090
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,140
It's just an episode, yeah.

2091
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:55,380
I think the best Disney, in my book,

2092
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:56,820
the best Disney album.

2093
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:57,660
Yeah, that's probably-

2094
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:58,900
It's got that happy birthday song.

2095
01:18:58,900 --> 01:18:59,740
Yeah.

2096
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:03,980
Happy birthday, happy, it's Mickey's birthday.

2097
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:05,700
And backwards we sing.

2098
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:09,060
Yeah, that is really great.

2099
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:11,540
Does that add, what's the Donald one?

2100
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:13,420
The weird Donald one with the infomer-

2101
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:14,380
Like-

2102
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:15,220
I don't remember.

2103
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:17,220
It's Mickey, it's very strange.

2104
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,780
It's about him like using technology.

2105
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:23,980
And it doesn't make any sense.

2106
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:24,820
Whoa.

2107
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:25,820
He's a- Digital Duck.

2108
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:26,740
Digital Duck.

2109
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:28,500
Yeah, that's right.

2110
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:29,980
Oh, Digital Duck is good, yes.

2111
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:33,340
It is good, but I'm just saying it doesn't make any sense.

2112
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:35,980
Obviously the best album of the Disney albums.

2113
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:37,260
I think probably, yeah.

2114
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:39,620
Sorry to diss Simply Mad About the Mouse.

2115
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:40,660
Got a great cover.

2116
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:41,660
Deconstructed.

2117
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:43,820
Mickey's butt while he's surfing.

2118
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:45,660
Yeah, I love, whatever style that is,

2119
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:48,620
that like airbrush kind of glossy,

2120
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:50,700
yeah, that's an amazing cover.

2121
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:51,740
Yeah, so anyway.

2122
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:52,580
Totally agree.

2123
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:54,020
And as your, the most emotional song

2124
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:55,460
you've ever heard on it.

2125
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:56,300
Gyro Gearless.

2126
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:57,140
Gyro Gearless.

2127
01:19:57,140 --> 01:20:00,900
Yes, very touching, beautiful song about Gyro Gearless.

2128
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:04,260
A character I don't know or care about in any other way.

2129
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:05,660
He's a mad inventor.

2130
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:10,180
Let me do some other quick hits.

2131
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:13,860
Do you know, can you affirm whether any of the Rolling Stones

2132
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:14,780
have been to Disneyland?

2133
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:15,820
Do you know of him?

2134
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:20,500
No, but I wanna say like Ron Wood has.

2135
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:22,380
He was on the list of visitors,

2136
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:24,500
but I couldn't find any further information.

2137
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:25,420
But let me show you this.

2138
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:28,020
You know what we're probably both forgetting about?

2139
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:29,620
Pirates premiere.

2140
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:31,820
There's Pete Richards. Oh shit, of course.

2141
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:33,300
In front of the Emporium.

2142
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:35,780
They had the premiere, I think a lot,

2143
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:38,420
like where they do Fantasmic and the red carpet

2144
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:39,620
was Main Street.

2145
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:43,900
So at least that we can firmly say Keith Richards.

2146
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:45,860
It really makes me happy to see Keith Richards

2147
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:48,780
in front of the Emporium, in front of Walt's apartment.

2148
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:50,860
And imagining Walt looking down,

2149
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:54,020
shaking his fist at that dirty rocker.

2150
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:55,260
So he'd be so upset.

2151
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:58,380
Sully'd my company by inspiring this, you know,

2152
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:02,180
lascivious, almost borderline gay performance

2153
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:04,100
from Johnny Depp and the.

2154
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:06,660
Oh yeah, cause Walt would have hated that, right?

2155
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:08,020
I would have to imagine, yes.

2156
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:10,620
I'm sure he would have hated it until the money rolled in.

2157
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:12,860
That's all I understand about Walt is that

2158
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:14,820
whatever blind spots he had,

2159
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:17,340
as soon as the money rolled in, he was fine.

2160
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:20,420
I think so, which is how I feel about the alcohol thing.

2161
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:21,820
He'd love it, like of course.

2162
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:23,420
Yeah, he'd go, oh, it's everywhere else.

2163
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:24,260
All right, great.

2164
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:27,580
Yeah, and also, Walt also might say,

2165
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:28,420
what's the year?

2166
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:29,860
It's 2019?

2167
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:31,340
Serve liquor in the parks.

2168
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:32,420
What the fuck are you doing?

2169
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:33,940
Very possible.

2170
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:35,300
I would think.

2171
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:37,460
Here, quick hits.

2172
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:40,260
I got a picture of Tom Petty on a Dumbo.

2173
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:41,100
Oh wow.

2174
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:43,540
Tom Petty has been to Disneyland.

2175
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:44,380
Great.

2176
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:47,540
I got a picture of Roger, wait, what are their names?

2177
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:48,660
Roger Taylor.

2178
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:49,500
From what?

2179
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:50,340
Queen, the other.

2180
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:51,660
Oh, not Brian May.

2181
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:53,180
Not Brian May, the other two.

2182
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:54,420
I never remember the other two.

2183
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:55,260
Yeah.

2184
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:56,580
Roger Taylor, I think.

2185
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:57,420
The other one.

2186
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:01,180
Tip producers of a terrible film from Queen.

2187
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:04,900
They're hanging out with Goofy, so they've been.

2188
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:07,420
Ramones you saw, Keith Richards you saw.

2189
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:10,780
Look at this, Ozzy and Black Sabbath

2190
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:12,660
in front of Cinderella Castle.

2191
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:14,580
Funny enough, that doesn't surprise me.

2192
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:15,820
Yeah, that kind of makes sense.

2193
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:19,260
Cause like all those horror guys like Disney.

2194
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:20,100
Yeah.

2195
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:21,220
There's a crossover there.

2196
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:23,620
Anyone who like kind of likes the haunting stuff

2197
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:24,940
likes Disney and Haunted Mansion.

2198
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,260
So that doesn't surprise me as much.

2199
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:27,780
Well, one of the first rock visitors

2200
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:30,100
I could see evidence of, Alice Cooper.

2201
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:30,940
Oh yeah, yeah.

2202
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:34,180
Like a silly theme parky, wrestlery cartoon of a man.

2203
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:35,740
So that makes sense.

2204
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:37,860
There's a pretty cool picture of George Clinton

2205
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:39,060
and Bootsy Collins.

2206
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:39,900
Oh wow.

2207
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:41,500
In Disney World I think, hanging out in front of

2208
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:44,780
big Tiki statues or something.

2209
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:45,940
That's cool.

2210
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:49,340
I'd like to float the possibility that maybe

2211
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:51,900
the rockinest moment ever was the,

2212
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:55,020
in front of Cinderella Castle performance,

2213
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:58,300
seemingly sold all the way down to, down Main Street.

2214
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:01,140
Mega crowd came out for Jesse and the Rippers.

2215
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:01,980
Oh yeah.

2216
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:05,700
In 1994, where they of course performed

2217
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:08,060
one of their biggest hits, Hippie Hippie Shake.

2218
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:12,220
And then sang When You Wish Upon a Star

2219
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:17,220
with Jesse on big white grand piano

2220
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:21,620
and a children's chorus and a string,

2221
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:24,420
not quite an orchestra, a string octet,

2222
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:27,500
maybe eight strings and the full band.

2223
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:29,300
How big were Jesse and the Rippers

2224
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:31,260
in the universe of Full House?

2225
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:32,580
Is it ever clear?

2226
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:35,100
You would have to, certainly there's numbers said.

2227
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:36,740
It's like this is number one.

2228
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:38,180
There's songs that are number one.

2229
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,980
The one with the candles and the bad, the-

2230
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:42,860
The Beach Boys cover forever.

2231
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:43,700
Yes, yes, yes.

2232
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:45,420
With the bizarre thing where they could have,

2233
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,020
he could have picked any Beach Boys song to cover,

2234
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:49,420
but he covered the most famous song

2235
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:51,820
by the only dead Beach Boy.

2236
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:54,260
But that is what I'm, it's like the weird like sexy one

2237
01:23:54,260 --> 01:23:55,100
where he's like-

2238
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:55,940
Yes.

2239
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:58,660
Filmed at, music video filmed at Universal Studios.

2240
01:23:58,660 --> 01:23:59,500
Oh wow.

2241
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,100
Filmed in like the Mexico area

2242
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:03,500
because it was going for like November rain.

2243
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:06,620
Music videos have to have like a weird desolate chapel.

2244
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:08,180
That was very important at the time.

2245
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:09,900
So yeah, all the candles.

2246
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:14,540
It's so sultry, but then him like still sultry

2247
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:16,140
holding his two babies.

2248
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:16,980
Oh yeah, is he shirtless?

2249
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:18,900
Who are not his babies in real life.

2250
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:19,740
Is he shirtless doing that?

2251
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:21,420
Yes, I think so, yeah.

2252
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:23,740
Weird fake family snuggling

2253
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:25,820
and then they're floating in a cloudscape

2254
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:28,860
like that Eddie Murphy, Michael Jackson music video.

2255
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:30,660
God, we gotta talk to him about that video.

2256
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:31,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2257
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:35,700
I'd love to, well, I mean, he also,

2258
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:38,620
not only part of that performance,

2259
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:41,140
but also the Kokomo video

2260
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:43,580
filmed at the Grand Floridian Hotel.

2261
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:46,020
They filmed the music video and then in the same setting

2262
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:48,620
filmed also a performance of Kokomo

2263
01:24:48,620 --> 01:24:50,260
for this 4th of July special

2264
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:53,500
and performed Wipeout with the Fat Boys.

2265
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,900
They now mostly forgotten attempts to get in

2266
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:58,380
on that Run DMC Aerosmith money.

2267
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:02,380
But Stamos part of all that, playing a lot of percussion.

2268
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:06,540
My dream is for him to play drums in a live show with us.

2269
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:08,900
To back us up.

2270
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:10,060
Yeah, and that's like the reveal.

2271
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:11,540
There'll be like a,

2272
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:13,340
if you're ever at a live show in the next 10 years

2273
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:15,860
and there's like a blanket over something

2274
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:17,940
in the back of the stage

2275
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:19,660
and you think maybe it's a drum set,

2276
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:23,020
Stamos is backstage and we've got a whole thing planned.

2277
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:26,780
This implies that we've like so befriended this man.

2278
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:29,020
Yeah, but before he's been on the show too.

2279
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:32,100
Yes, like this is a future where he's been on the show

2280
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:34,940
upwards of 10 times and then like, yeah, yeah,

2281
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:37,500
I'll bang the skins around a little bit.

2282
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:40,460
For you guys, you got it.

2283
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:41,900
And it would have to be too,

2284
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:43,620
cause like if one of us is like on it,

2285
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:46,020
gets cast on a TV show with John Stamos,

2286
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:47,940
then the probably listeners could put two and two together

2287
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:49,300
that maybe he would show up.

2288
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:51,300
But it would have to be such a surprise

2289
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:54,620
that we've befriended him behind the scenes for years.

2290
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:56,820
Oh, we can't have done it on the show?

2291
01:25:56,820 --> 01:26:00,220
We can, but it would be such a great surprise.

2292
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:03,220
You want his first appearance on the show to be drumming.

2293
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:04,060
Yes.

2294
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:08,540
With us, only one of whom is a musician in any regard.

2295
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:11,260
Yeah, I mean, I think that we can work that out though.

2296
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:12,260
I think you could play like,

2297
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:14,220
Mike Love learned those two notes on the sax.

2298
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:15,060
You can learn the-

2299
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:16,300
I could learn, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2300
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:17,140
Four notes.

2301
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:18,540
I could be at least as good of a musician as Mike Love.

2302
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:20,420
Jason certainly is a lost cause.

2303
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:22,420
There's no way he can learn a musical instrument,

2304
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:24,340
but he'll, he can do,

2305
01:26:24,340 --> 01:26:26,460
he can stand on the side of the stage and,

2306
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:28,460
like he will give him a tambourine.

2307
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:30,460
He doesn't need to play it though.

2308
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:32,100
He can just hold it, hold it,

2309
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:34,780
and I'll tape all of the little symbols down

2310
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:36,780
so they don't make any noise.

2311
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:37,740
He's a pantomime.

2312
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:39,980
So he can wave it or I'll just remove them.

2313
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:42,060
So he can wave it around and it looks like-

2314
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:44,700
Childproofing a tambourine.

2315
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:47,180
Yeah, I don't want him to ruin the show,

2316
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:49,620
but I want him to be part of it.

2317
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:51,620
Well, it's nice of you to include him

2318
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:53,540
even in an infantilized way.

2319
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:56,180
Yeah, I do think it is nice what I just did.

2320
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:02,260
I got one more throw and then maybe we need to determine.

2321
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:03,100
Sure.

2322
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:09,940
Okay, it's the big year, 1994,

2323
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:14,020
just, hey, same year that NSYNC brought the fucking house

2324
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:16,460
down where we can work it out.

2325
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:20,340
Further down the street in Pleasure Island,

2326
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:24,860
you got truly one of the rockinest bands ever to form.

2327
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:27,100
I'm talking Bruce Willis and the Accelerators.

2328
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:27,940
Oh yes.

2329
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:30,940
Bruce Willis, the opening of Planet Hollywood,

2330
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:34,980
Pleasure Island, Bruce Willis is wearing shorts,

2331
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:38,140
a sleeveless Planet Hollywood shirt,

2332
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:41,860
like kind of a tank top, and a Santa hat.

2333
01:27:41,860 --> 01:27:45,700
And Demi Moore comes out and joins him

2334
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:50,420
to like, it's the most like, fuck me eyes.

2335
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:51,260
Wow.

2336
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:53,340
She could be given, it's just, she's like hanging off of him,

2337
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:55,020
just the adoration is.

2338
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:55,860
Wow.

2339
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:59,020
So it's a very sexually charged performance with Bruce

2340
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:03,380
and Demi, and she's in sort of like a tube top and a blazer.

2341
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:04,580
Oh yeah, that was a look.

2342
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:08,900
It's, yeah, yeah, yeah, not so insane at the time,

2343
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:11,260
but here we go, Bruce Willis and the Accelerators.

2344
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:13,260
You're the mother of a trip,

2345
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:15,260
Check for the trade,

2346
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:18,980
Can't hold it on for a little while,

2347
01:28:20,980 --> 01:28:23,780
This is like only seven,

2348
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:25,980
Every time I'm on the line,

2349
01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:27,660
You're the mother of a trip,

2350
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:28,660
Check for the trade,

2351
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:30,660
Can't hold it on for a little while,

2352
01:28:30,660 --> 01:28:32,660
This life is only seven,

2353
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:34,660
Every time I'm on the line,

2354
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:36,660
You're the mother of a trip.

2355
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:39,660
I bet he's playing this still at like state fairs and stuff.

2356
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:40,860
He does, I don't know if he plays state fairs,

2357
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:44,260
We gotta do a full Bruno episode too,

2358
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:45,260
Because I'm obsessed with it.

2359
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:46,260
You better believe that was in that Hollywood Hi-Fi book,

2360
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:47,260
Return of Bruno.

2361
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:49,260
Yeah, because fun time,

2362
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:52,260
If you haven't listened to Fun Time by Bruce Willis,

2363
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:53,260
Please.

2364
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:54,260
There's a video of that, right?

2365
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:56,260
Oh yeah, it's in the concert.

2366
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:59,260
And then it's, Fun Time is unbelievable.

2367
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:01,260
It's truly unbelievable.

2368
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:04,260
I know people said like it was kind of a little bit of a goof,

2369
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:06,260
But I don't think it's a full goof.

2370
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:08,260
I know, I gotta look into more,

2371
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:10,660
But anyway, look up Fun Time, Bruce Willis.

2372
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:12,660
I think he believed in it.

2373
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:15,660
Yeah, but it was like he saw Billy Joel in Springsteen,

2374
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:16,660
And was like, I can do that.

2375
01:29:16,660 --> 01:29:17,660
Yeah.

2376
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:20,660
And like put in like maybe an hour rehearsal,

2377
01:29:20,660 --> 01:29:21,660
And that was it.

2378
01:29:21,660 --> 01:29:23,660
And he's just like, he's jumping around.

2379
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:24,660
It really does.

2380
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:26,660
Like if you watch early Springsteen,

2381
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:27,660
It does feel like he was like,

2382
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:28,660
Yeah, I can do this.

2383
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:30,660
I'm fucking Bruce Willis.

2384
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:32,660
I'm starved already.

2385
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:35,660
The songs are one fiftieth as good.

2386
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:39,060
There's one fiftieth of thought put into them.

2387
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:41,060
Like a rolling seven,

2388
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:44,060
Every time a rolling dies.

2389
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:47,060
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah.

2390
01:29:47,060 --> 01:29:48,060
Oh.

2391
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:49,060
Do you have any other big thing,

2392
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:51,060
Or should we go out on Fun Time?

2393
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:53,060
Well, maybe.

2394
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:55,060
I guess we have to declare what the...

2395
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:56,060
I guess we have to think about what it is.

2396
01:29:56,060 --> 01:29:57,060
Oh, I should say after that,

2397
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:59,060
That then part of that same performance,

2398
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:01,060
Steven Stills from Crosby, Stills and Nash,

2399
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:02,060
Who then performed,

2400
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:04,060
If You Can't Be With The One You Love,

2401
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:05,060
Love The One You're With,

2402
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:07,460
With Mickey and Minnie,

2403
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:08,460
In Planet Hollywood jackets,

2404
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:10,460
Backing them up.

2405
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:11,460
What a time.

2406
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:12,460
And you know,

2407
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:13,460
That song title,

2408
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:16,460
That's advice that I would give to Minnie,

2409
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:18,460
When it comes to you, Mike.

2410
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:19,460
I know you want,

2411
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:21,460
Minnie, I know you want to be with Mike,

2412
01:30:21,460 --> 01:30:22,460
But Mike is taken,

2413
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:24,460
And you are too, don't forget.

2414
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:26,460
Oh, yeah, that's true.

2415
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:30,460
You have as strong of a bond as Bruce and Demi in 1994.

2416
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:31,460
That's true.

2417
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:32,460
So, you know,

2418
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,460
Mike is flattered, but,

2419
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:35,860
Hands off, gloves off.

2420
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:36,860
Gloves off.

2421
01:30:38,860 --> 01:30:39,860
There was an Onion article about,

2422
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:42,860
Man realizes like,

2423
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:45,860
Being married to Minnie Mouse wouldn't be as good as it seems.

2424
01:30:46,860 --> 01:30:47,860
It just came out.

2425
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:48,860
Yeah.

2426
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:49,860
That's not that exact headline,

2427
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:50,860
But it's that suggested.

2428
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:51,860
Look at that kitchen though.

2429
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:53,860
You're making your big inflatable cakes.

2430
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:54,860
Cool kitchen.

2431
01:30:54,860 --> 01:30:55,860
Every day.

2432
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:57,860
One more quick thing.

2433
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:02,860
I was curious if Bob Dylan ever made it to Disneyland.

2434
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:06,260
And I found a story where he was touring with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.

2435
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:09,260
Bob was very upset about the lighting.

2436
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:10,260
Much like Billy Joel.

2437
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:12,260
Stop lighting the audience.

2438
01:31:12,260 --> 01:31:14,260
Ever seen that video?

2439
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:16,260
He's furious.

2440
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:17,260
He walks off.

2441
01:31:17,260 --> 01:31:18,260
He might be done with the concert.

2442
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:20,260
I'm not going to keep going.

2443
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:21,260
This is bullshit.

2444
01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:22,260
He's rambling to Tom in the wings.

2445
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:23,260
Fucking lights.

2446
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:24,260
I'm not going back out there.

2447
01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:26,260
It's like fucking Disneyland out there.

2448
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:28,260
And Tom Petty says to Bob,

2449
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:30,260
You've never been to Disneyland.

2450
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:31,260
Oh, that's great.

2451
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:33,660
And Bob started laughing.

2452
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:36,660
And then they walked back out together and kept the show rolling.

2453
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:41,660
So just thinking about Disneyland made Bob Dylan smile.

2454
01:31:41,660 --> 01:31:42,660
Yeah.

2455
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:45,660
Even a little glint of the spirit made him so happy.

2456
01:31:45,660 --> 01:31:47,660
And that's the magic of Disneyland.

2457
01:31:47,660 --> 01:31:50,660
And we knew, and you said, as you pointed out, Tom has been.

2458
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:52,660
And Tom's been.

2459
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:53,660
Yeah.

2460
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:54,660
He knew Bob had.

2461
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:56,660
They had a conversation about it.

2462
01:31:56,660 --> 01:31:58,660
You know, I just went to Disneyland.

2463
01:31:58,660 --> 01:32:00,660
You ever been to Disneyland?

2464
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:02,060
Tom seems like.

2465
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:03,060
I don't know.

2466
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:04,060
I've said it before.

2467
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:08,060
Tom seems like one of all these guys who was maybe OK.

2468
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:09,060
Like a reasonable person.

2469
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:10,060
I hope so.

2470
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:11,060
Seemingly.

2471
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:12,060
Mm-hmm.

2472
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:15,060
Like a lot of these people are crazy.

2473
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:16,060
Out of their minds.

2474
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:18,060
And he liked the Mad Hatter.

2475
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:19,060
He loved the Mad Hatter.

2476
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:20,060
He dressed up like a mad.

2477
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:21,060
He probably went on the Mad Tea Party.

2478
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:22,060
He loved comedy.

2479
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:23,060
He loved the Mad Hatter.

2480
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:26,060
He went to Disneyland at least once.

2481
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:29,060
He's probably talked to Bob like,

2482
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:31,460
this thing's crazy, man.

2483
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:33,460
Like you're in a big teacup.

2484
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:36,460
It's like you're the tea.

2485
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:38,460
I'm kind of splitting the difference.

2486
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:39,460
I was going to say, it's like it really is a mix.

2487
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:40,460
I'm doing a version of both.

2488
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:41,460
Yeah.

2489
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:43,460
He's a little yet steeper because you're doing it at the Dillon,

2490
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:45,460
which is more down here.

2491
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:48,460
Which is also close to Zippity-Doot.

2492
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:49,460
It is.

2493
01:32:49,460 --> 01:32:51,460
These are really thin slices.

2494
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:53,460
Did Tom Petty see the country bears?

2495
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:56,460
Maybe it inspired the traveling Wilburys.

2496
01:32:56,460 --> 01:32:58,460
Very possible.

2497
01:32:58,860 --> 01:33:01,860
Is there any reference on...

2498
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:03,860
And if all these different bears can come together

2499
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:06,860
and put on a fun Roots show, then...

2500
01:33:06,860 --> 01:33:07,860
There's...

2501
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:09,860
I'm trying to think if there's any...

2502
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:11,860
I don't think there's any reference to it.

2503
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:13,860
There's a Wilbury song called

2504
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:15,860
Tweeter and the Monkey Man,

2505
01:33:15,860 --> 01:33:17,860
which is a goof on Bruce Springsteen.

2506
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:18,860
Oh.

2507
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:20,860
And it's just full of like making fun of his old songs

2508
01:33:20,860 --> 01:33:22,860
with all these ridiculous names.

2509
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:24,860
So that's why they named Tweeter.

2510
01:33:24,860 --> 01:33:25,860
Oh, like a pretension sort of.

2511
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:26,860
Yeah, like...

2512
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:29,260
Because especially in the early ones,

2513
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:31,260
like in...

2514
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:33,260
Like 4U and

2515
01:33:33,260 --> 01:33:35,260
Rosalita, there's a lot of names

2516
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:37,260
and there's a lot of characters.

2517
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:39,260
So Tweeter and the Monkey Man.

2518
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:41,260
Wilburys.

2519
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:43,260
I don't think it's ever been confirmed,

2520
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:45,260
but it's pretty clear because it's like Jersey.

2521
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:47,260
Bob Dylan sings it.

2522
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:48,260
Okay.

2523
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:49,260
Anyway.

2524
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:50,260
But they didn't do it.

2525
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:52,260
I don't think there's a Big Al reference or a Liver Lips.

2526
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:54,260
They didn't do a song called Liver Lips

2527
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:56,260
in the piano playing Bear.

2528
01:33:56,260 --> 01:33:58,260
I would imagine that maybe Tom wouldn't have remembered

2529
01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:00,260
the names of the bears.

2530
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:02,260
Might have not.

2531
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:04,260
Senbainet Chio.

2532
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:06,260
Henry.

2533
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:08,260
I like that Henry cat.

2534
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:10,260
Who's that kid?

2535
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:12,260
That's a Jack also.

2536
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:14,260
That's a Nicholson.

2537
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:16,260
Yeah, who's that cat, man?

2538
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:18,260
Oh boy. Yeah.

2539
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:20,260
I gotta find the ways to put up hard walls

2540
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:22,260
between these voices.

2541
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:24,260
But you were talking about Party Man earlier,

2542
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:26,260
and then you were talking about the

2543
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:28,260
Jacky Man.

2544
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:30,260
Who's Party Man? Oh Jack is Party Man.

2545
01:34:30,260 --> 01:34:32,260
He's a joker.

2546
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:34,260
Good point.

2547
01:34:34,260 --> 01:34:36,260
Well, I don't know.

2548
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:38,260
What do we like?

2549
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:40,260
What's the rock in this moment?

2550
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:42,260
I think it's gotta be the Springsteen one.

2551
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:44,260
I mean, the Beatles one is really crazy.

2552
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:46,260
But it's also a crushing end of rock.

2553
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:48,260
He's on his long affair with the assistants.

2554
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:50,260
And then the other beat.

2555
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:52,260
It's all strife and turmoil.

2556
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:54,260
The Bruce one is like,

2557
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:56,260
it's a bummer, but it's a very funny story.

2558
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:58,260
They're all there.

2559
01:34:58,260 --> 01:35:00,260
The whole band is there.

2560
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:02,260
They're rebelling.

2561
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:04,260
That's rock and roll.

2562
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:06,260
A letter was written that's rock and roll.

2563
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:08,260
A funny rock and roll letter was written.

2564
01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:10,260
I mean, that feels like it wins probably.

2565
01:35:10,260 --> 01:35:12,260
I think I might, yeah,

2566
01:35:12,260 --> 01:35:14,260
I think I might agree with you.

2567
01:35:14,260 --> 01:35:16,260
I mean, in my heart, it's always gonna be

2568
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:18,260
a child whose name I don't know

2569
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:20,260
performing King of Wishful Thinking.

2570
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:22,260
But, you know,

2571
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:24,260
there's less of a bigger

2572
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:26,260
message there.

2573
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:28,260
Yeah.

2574
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:30,260
Unfortunately, there's not too many options.

2575
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:32,260
No.

2576
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:34,260
I think what we determined.

2577
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:36,260
So you're saying

2578
01:35:36,260 --> 01:35:38,260
the moment is it's not the Gugudals

2579
01:35:38,260 --> 01:35:40,260
playing an Intel corporate gig.

2580
01:35:40,260 --> 01:35:42,260
I don't think so.

2581
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:44,260
It's not Tom Petty referring to Disneyland verbally.

2582
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:46,260
No.

2583
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:48,260
No. I mean, it could have been those

2584
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:50,260
in the Jackie Johnson episode.

2585
01:35:50,260 --> 01:35:52,260
I showed some photos of like Ringo

2586
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:54,260
at the parks, but we don't know what he did.

2587
01:35:54,260 --> 01:35:56,260
We don't know what Paul did when he was

2588
01:35:56,260 --> 01:35:58,260
at the parks.

2589
01:35:58,260 --> 01:36:00,260
But in this case, we know specifically what happened.

2590
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:02,260
Yes. In Springsteen and Little Stevie.

2591
01:36:02,260 --> 01:36:04,260
And it was rebellion.

2592
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:06,260
It was some rebellion.

2593
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:08,260
They were kicked out unfairly.

2594
01:36:08,260 --> 01:36:10,260
That's rock and roll. Counterculture is rock and roll.

2595
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:12,260
I think at all, all the ingredients

2596
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:14,260
are there.

2597
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:16,260
I think that's the moment. I wonder what will happen

2598
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:18,260
when Bruce and Stephen find out they've been awarded this.

2599
01:36:20,260 --> 01:36:22,260
Will they come on the show to accept?

2600
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:24,260
I mean, you start to run out of rock

2601
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:26,260
honors. Once you're in the Hall of Fame

2602
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:28,260
and, you know, if you're

2603
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:30,260
once your guitar pick has been

2604
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:32,260
donated to the Hard Rock

2605
01:36:32,260 --> 01:36:34,260
Cafe in Indianapolis, like

2606
01:36:34,260 --> 01:36:36,260
what else do you got?

2607
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:38,260
They've won them all.

2608
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:40,260
And, you know, Broadway accolades.

2609
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:42,260
So there's not a lot left.

2610
01:36:42,260 --> 01:36:44,260
And I think they're going to be really

2611
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:46,260
touched by this. The moment that they stood up

2612
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:48,260
to that rodent and said

2613
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:50,260
no more.

2614
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:52,260
I want to know if Little Stephen ever went back.

2615
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:54,260
Hmm. Yeah, that's a good question.

2616
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:56,260
Have we just Googled Little Stephen at Disneyland?

2617
01:36:56,260 --> 01:36:58,260
Because I don't think there's

2618
01:36:58,260 --> 01:37:00,260
Times have

2619
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:02,260
changed. Yeah.

2620
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:04,260
It's 2019.

2621
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:06,260
I'd like to think they'd allow some bad.

2622
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:08,260
Who would have could have imagined Disneyland was going to have

2623
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:10,260
gangs of their own? Right.

2624
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:12,260
Not only, it's 83. They're saying

2625
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:14,260
no, like pseudo gang

2626
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:16,260
members. Now they encourage

2627
01:37:16,260 --> 01:37:18,260
gangs. Right.

2628
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:20,260
On their property.

2629
01:37:20,260 --> 01:37:22,260
So they were right,

2630
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:24,260
honestly. Yeah.

2631
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:26,260
If you're listening to this and you're a member

2632
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:28,260
one of those gangs, it couldn't have been done without

2633
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:30,260
Bruce and Stevie.

2634
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:32,260
The quick thing I forgot is

2635
01:37:32,260 --> 01:37:34,260
one of the

2636
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:36,260
Stephen and Liv Tyler going on the Rock and Roller

2637
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:38,260
Coaster in Disneyland Paris. Is that

2638
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:40,260
part, is that a Rock and Roll moment?

2639
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:42,260
Rocking on your own ride is cool.

2640
01:37:42,260 --> 01:37:44,260
That wins now. Great. Maybe that wins.

2641
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:46,260
Alright, that wins.

2642
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:48,260
I might have said that wins to anything you brought up.

2643
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:50,260
I thought that maybe this episode

2644
01:37:50,260 --> 01:37:52,260
wouldn't go that long, but this is full length

2645
01:37:52,260 --> 01:37:54,260
episode. Yeah, I figured it might.

2646
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:56,260
Well, when you get us talking

2647
01:37:56,260 --> 01:37:58,260
about the Rock and.

2648
01:37:58,260 --> 01:38:00,260
It's true. You can't hold us back,

2649
01:38:00,260 --> 01:38:02,260
Jason. It's a limited topic as far as

2650
01:38:02,260 --> 01:38:04,260
Rock is concerned. It really is.

2651
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:06,260
Yes, we stretched

2652
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:08,260
eight mentions of Rock and Roll. I'm just getting

2653
01:38:08,260 --> 01:38:10,260
Bruce Willis' fun time warmed up. So keep talking.

2654
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:12,260
I'm just going to find the spot. Cue it up.

2655
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:14,260
Yeah. And you know what? The next

2656
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:16,260
time we record an episode, I think you

2657
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:18,260
and I, in solidarity with

2658
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:20,260
Bruce and Stephen in that great moment,

2659
01:38:20,260 --> 01:38:22,260
we're going to wear bandanas.

2660
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:24,260
And if Jason says, what are you doing?

2661
01:38:24,260 --> 01:38:26,260
That's stupid. Then we'll

2662
01:38:26,260 --> 01:38:28,260
say, Jason enforcing this ridiculous

2663
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:30,260
law is an attack on Rock

2664
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:32,260
and music and all the people who believe

2665
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:34,260
in it. It's time to boycott Podcast

2666
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:36,260
The Ride until Jason's vague

2667
01:38:36,260 --> 01:38:38,260
and unfair dress code is abolished once

2668
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:40,260
and for all. Keep on

2669
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:42,260
rocking in the free world. Keep on

2670
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:44,260
rocking. And with that, Bruce

2671
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:46,260
Willis, take us out.

2672
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:48,260
All right. Hold on. It's that way.

2673
01:38:48,260 --> 01:38:50,260
I don't have time. No, no.

2674
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:52,260
That's not going to be Rock fumbling. Hold on. Hold on.

2675
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:54,260
No, no. Here we go.

2676
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:56,260
This is the live

2677
01:38:56,260 --> 01:38:58,260
version.

2678
01:38:58,260 --> 01:39:00,260
Pardon me.

2679
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:02,260
Pardon me.

2680
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:28,260
No, no, no.

2681
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:32,260
It's fun.

2682
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:36,260
Brown is what he's saying.

2683
01:39:48,260 --> 01:39:50,260
All right.

2684
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:52,260
Hope you enjoyed that.

2685
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:54,260
You have your own fun time.
