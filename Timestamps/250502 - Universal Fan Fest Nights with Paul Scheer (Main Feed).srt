Welcome to Podcast The Ride

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
a podcast about theme parks that you guys

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
aren't ready for yet but your kids

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
are gonna love it. I'm Scott Gardner

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
joined by Mike Carlson. Are they

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Are they gonna love it?

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,840
Oh, I think so.

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,320
Oh, I think all of the, you know,

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,680
the references to William Frawley and-

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,720
We're pushing it with people our age is what I'm saying

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,440
when it comes to old TV references.

26
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,020
Well, and you know, the recurring specter

28
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,160
of the puppet madam that like increasingly,

29
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,000
I think you were-

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,820
Whelan Flowers and Madam.

31
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,800
Whelan Flowers, soon you will be the oldest living person

32
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,480
who remembers this reference.

33
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,320
Yeah.

34
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,040
And then we're, but I don't know,

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,360
but also maybe it'll all be so foreign

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,440
30 years down the line that there'll be a novelty to that.

37
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,280
That's a good point.

38
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,600
That'll be the appeal of the whole thing.

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,360
So the young people will look up to me in a lot of ways.

40
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,600
Yeah, yeah, well, you know,

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,280
if we get into the nostalgia neck of the woods,

42
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,120
which is certainly what we're dealing with today

43
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,040
with this thing that we got to go to.

44
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
Yes.

45
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,680
Jason Sheridan is not with us, unfortunately.

46
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,200
However, we're gonna have a good time here

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,640
because we're gonna talk about a really fun thing

48
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,460
that we got to go to.

49
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,840
The Universal Studios Hollywood has been doing it,

50
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,440
they're trying out that we were the guinea pigs for,

51
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,760
the first ever test subjects for.

52
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,600
Basically, yeah.

53
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,360
We were prepared for danger and brain damage

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,120
and anything that could've,

55
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,240
I assumed the shit was gonna go down at this thing,

56
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,160
but we were safe, we're able to come talk about it now.

57
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,400
FanFest Nights was the event.

58
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,320
It's a separately-ticketed after-hours event

59
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,120
that they have just begun

60
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,160
that celebrates different worlds and IPs and fandoms.

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,640
They encourage costumes and cosplay.

62
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,880
The big stars of this show,

63
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,320
Back to the Future, Star Trek, Dungeons and Dragons,

64
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,960
those are the big things that they're pushing.

65
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,920
It's kind of like an attempt

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,320
at a new Halloween Horror Nights.

67
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,960
It doesn't have to be stuck to Halloween.

68
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,640
But very few scares.

69
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,320
I would say so, thankfully for me.

70
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,160
I was worried about scares in this one zone.

71
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,840
Instead, it was nothing but delay.

72
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,440
I was, honestly, and this may be,

73
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,760
you sound this alone, sick,

74
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,080
but I was kind of hoping there would be some scares for you

75
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,200
because obviously, as listeners know,

76
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,720
Scott has not done Horror Nights yet.

77
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,280
So I was hoping maybe in a way,

78
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,880
it would be like a little bit of exposure,

79
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,960
be like a booster of that scene.

80
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,440
Taking a little bit of the virus to, yeah, yeah.

81
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,560
Exactly, for the future Horror Nights trip

82
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,880
that you, I think, are going to go on still as of this moment.

83
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,720
Well, we'll see.

84
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,320
Maybe we'll talk about how this went

85
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,080
and then we'll see if we're willing to do it.

86
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,720
But I'd say in broad strokes, a fun time was had,

87
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,360
especially because of our guest who joined us then

88
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,600
and who joins us now, an old pal of the show,

89
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,280
a good pal of the show,

90
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,120
writer of the book, Joyful Recollections of Trauma,

91
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,360
soon available on paperback, it's Paul Scheer.

92
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,200
Guys, I am so excited to be back, back here.

93
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,040
Yes, we're back.

94
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,880
It's been a long time.

95
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,240
For fan, Universal Fan Nights,

96
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,920
something that I will tell you in my circle of friends,

97
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,240
when it was first announced, I got a lot of emails.

98
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,880
You see this, it's happening,

99
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,080
because I think Star Trek, you know,

100
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,960
connects me to a lot of different people

101
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,120
and it felt like this was going to be a special

102
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,920
Star Trek celebration.

103
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,080
And immediately, I was excited, but suspicious.

104
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,920
What could it be?

105
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,640
What could a fan night be?

106
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,120
Because it really is like building a new experience

107
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,760
in Universal, like horror nights, you know,

108
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,720
you got these mazes, I get the idea of it,

109
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,640
but this felt to me like, it was a big swing.

110
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,720
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

111
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,480
And how do you possibly, just saying Star Trek

112
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,640
will be at Universal Studios

113
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,480
doesn't answer a lot of questions.

114
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,800
There's so much, there could not be more

115
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,440
that defines Star Trek,

116
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,280
so what does it all get boiled down to?

117
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,480
As a fan of the Vegas experience,

118
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,520
and much upset that that has closed,

119
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,480
and I feel like it has just disappeared.

120
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,080
There's no, it didn't go anywhere, it just done, right?

121
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,160
There's no quark spar.

122
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,360
Well, the funny thing is, it all still,

123
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,440
maybe not anymore, but for a long time after,

124
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,360
it still did look like quark spar,

125
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,800
it just became an unthemed space,

126
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,080
including the place where you could go

127
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,400
to have meetings about time shares.

128
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,360
Just all was inexplicably like,

129
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,600
space stores, and yeah, yeah.

130
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,440
I was excited about this,

131
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,440
because I feel like there's a turn right now.

132
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,080
All these theme parks are trying to figure out

133
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,400
how do we capitalize on the new way

134
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,240
that theme parks should be,

135
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,560
and I feel like Galaxy's Edge was an attempt to be like,

136
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,760
it's immersive, it's interactive,

137
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,400
and in my opinion, all of these parks have failed

138
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,360
to capture what I think people like about escape rooms,

139
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,400
or these really seminal immersive places,

140
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,560
sleep no more and stuff like that,

141
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,760
because it has to be corporate,

142
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,680
and you have to bring in thousands of people, right?

143
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,360
At the end of the day, it's thousands of people,

144
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,600
so I always feel like I'm always,

145
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,440
I'm interested that they're going in this direction,

146
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,280
but it seems like immediately at Galaxy's Edge,

147
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,280
it was like, you bring your phone,

148
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,760
and you're competing on things, and you're getting points,

149
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,160
and then that seemed to not be a part

150
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,440
of Galaxy's Edge anymore.

151
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,800
They always opened very strong,

152
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,080
so I like this idea that Fan Nights is coming in

153
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,440
a little bit softer, softer and trying

154
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,280
something a little bit different.

155
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,880
Yes, not over-hyped.

156
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,920
If anything under-hyped, I mean, maybe not,

157
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,880
I mean, I was certainly aware of it,

158
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,360
and I'd been to Universal Studios,

159
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,880
and they'd put a flyer in my car for it,

160
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,920
but it didn't, like, that doesn't tell you.

161
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,760
They handed it to you, though,

162
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,680
they didn't just sneak it in when you were parked.

163
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,600
No, no, no, they didn't force it on me,

164
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,240
or just put it on my windshield.

165
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,400
Okay, like save the clock tower, it wasn't.

166
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,040
Oh, yeah, yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah, yeah.

167
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,480
Some odd cults is trying to get invested.

168
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,800
Did they call this number to sell your car?

169
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,720
Yeah, yeah, no, it was all on the up and up.

170
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,440
However, it really, it was just like

171
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,360
Universal Fan Fest Nights three photos,

172
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,720
no further information.

173
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,240
Then I think more photos were added

174
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,280
as the anime properties started to become part of it.

175
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,200
Well, I was under the impression

176
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,360
that it was going to be, like, each weekend

177
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,320
a celebration of one of the things.

178
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,160
Like, there's a Star Trek night,

179
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,360
and then there would be a Dungeons and Dragons night,

180
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,120
and that's how at least it was,

181
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,440
at least I envisioned it

182
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,640
when I first had read the information about it.

183
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,880
I thought the same thing, yeah,

184
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,080
and I found it confusing to realize

185
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,760
that it was gonna be these, like,

186
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,520
disparate fandoms all thrown together.

187
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,560
That remains kind of a funny thing about it,

188
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,800
that you're like, get ready, geeks,

189
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,280
the ultimate celebration, the things you love,

190
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,320
Star Trek, sure, Back to the Future, yeah,

191
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,960
Dungeons and Dragons, more different Harry Potter,

192
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,160
the general existence of Yoshi.

193
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,560
I mean, those are five things people are nerdy about.

194
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,720
One Piece, I mean, One Piece is really like,

195
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,680
I think that One Piece was that late edition

196
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,040
that became like, ooh, we need this

197
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,680
to pull the whole thing together,

198
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,920
because ultimately, look, I'm a huge Star Trek fan.

199
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,840
Mike and I had texts about Star Trek things

200
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,280
on the side over here, like, hey, you know,

201
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,680
but that's not gonna be,

202
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,640
I don't think that's gonna be fueling the night.

203
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,400
Dungeons and Dragons, like, I feel like I love that movie.

204
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,240
I don't know how wide that movie goes,

205
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,920
but the property Dungeons and Dragons, big,

206
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,480
but you are, like, I feel like the One Piece

207
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,160
was the one, the biggest thing that pulled it all together.

208
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,480
Harry Potter, definitely, but Harry Potter

209
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,520
really wasn't doing anything different

210
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,080
besides having puppets. Little shows, yeah.

211
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,800
Yeah. Oh, right, we ran into,

212
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
late into the night, we ran into a dragon

213
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,720
that is not usually there. They were like three creatures,

214
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,960
one like a wraparound dragon, one like a little,

215
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,760
like, very cool, like new creatures,

216
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,760
but it wasn't, it wasn't anything,

217
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,440
and that's already a very immersive land.

218
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,240
That could and should just be there.

219
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,480
Yes, it should. Always.

220
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,560
So a lot of the things they did just should be there,

221
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,520
always, I think. Yeah, yeah.

222
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,120
Yoshi could be there always.

223
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,520
I don't think anyone would notice. 100%, yeah.

224
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,840
I don't know, only the top tier Nintendo nerds

225
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,280
know the name Yoshi, kind of a deep cut.

226
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,680
But I will say the, what made it hard about Yoshi was,

227
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,560
like, Yoshi was there, but, you know, to see Yoshi,

228
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,320
you had to collect stickers on a head, like a headpiece,

229
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,880
to then get into a giant line.

230
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,880
So it was really like a lot of barrier to Yoshi, you know?

231
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,640
I mean, like, you had to spend about two hours,

232
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,520
and that was, I think that's part of this night.

233
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,480
It's like, what is this night?

234
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,200
Because I think when you go to a Star Trek convention,

235
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,040
it's really fun.

236
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,440
You see, obviously, Star Trek leading,

237
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,760
and then there's a lot of, like, sub pops of nerd culture.

238
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,200
But there are people here that were like,

239
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,160
I am fully dressed in Back to the Future,

240
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,720
I am fully dressed in Star Wars,

241
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,760
I am fully dressed in Dungeons and Dragons,

242
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,480
and One Piece, and seeing them mix around.

243
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,640
It didn't, it felt like somebody drew, like,

244
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,200
three giant circles of fan bases.

245
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,160
It was like, I think this covers all of nerddom.

246
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,280
Like, I think in some, like, I might like Dungeons and Dragons,

247
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,440
and I might like Back to the Future,

248
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,440
I don't like Star Trek, but I do like one,

249
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,080
like, I feel like if you were to, like,

250
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
what do you call that, like, those, like, the circle?

251
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,920
The Venn diagram?

252
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,240
The Venn diagram, yeah.

253
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,360
But it did feel like Comic-Con in a lot of ways.

254
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,280
There's, like, a big mix of people getting together

255
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
to do stuff.

256
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,560
So you like that, you're a Comic-Con person.

257
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,400
I do like that, yeah.

258
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,800
Did you find that exciting,

259
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,520
that it's kind of like a different vibe

260
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,520
than day-to-day Universal Studios?

261
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,360
Yes.

262
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,200
Yeah.

263
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,400
I mean, when they play, like, pop and rock and roll songs

264
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,400
when you're walking down their main street,

265
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,800
I do always like it, it feels different to me.

266
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,600
It feels like it's a different experience.

267
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,160
So I did like all of it.

268
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,680
Part of me was like,

269
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,640
because I had a lot of people also,

270
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,440
who were like, oh, I'm going to Star Trek night,

271
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,760
and I was like, it's not just Star Trek,

272
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,880
it's the whole thing.

273
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,200
But part of me is like, oh, was it maybe like,

274
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,600
should they just do a Star Trek weekend,

275
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,720
a Back to the Future weekend?

276
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,960
Well, that's what I kind of think,

277
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,440
but I don't think that the park can handle that.

278
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,800
Like, they need to have everyone going

279
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,640
because, you know, as we saw,

280
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,920
the Star Trek experience in general

281
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,720
was about, like, little less than 10 minutes

282
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,760
from start to finish.

283
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,960
I mean, you know, like, you know.

284
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,720
That's not enough for a whole thing.

285
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,560
Yeah.

286
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,880
But I would say for like a ticketed after hours event,

287
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,200
like Disney charges for Star Wars nights.

288
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,040
Yeah.

289
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,720
They charge for whatever retro night, 90s night.

290
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,120
They charge, by the way,

291
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,040
much, much more than Universal is charging for any of this.

292
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,840
And all that really is, is like meeting Yoshi.

293
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,680
Right, it's photo ops, right?

294
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,680
So if you factor in the fact that you're getting

295
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,600
like all the rides at Universal,

296
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,920
and you're in like most of them.

297
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,560
Which is also an odd choice.

298
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,560
The fact that Transformers was not open,

299
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,800
and it is open during Halloween Horror Nights,

300
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,840
and is often one of the best stops on Halloween.

301
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,240
Well, I was very upset because I wanted,

302
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,320
I said, you know, may as well go on a quick Transformers.

303
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,160
Yeah, of course.

304
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,000
Yeah, that's true.

305
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,840
Well, and the last we were with Paul,

306
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,960
you proved the case forever, permanently,

307
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,240
that Transformers is better than Resident Existence,

308
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,880
so you wanted to, like, enjoy your spoils with the two of them.

309
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,680
Right, I was gonna gloat the whole time we were on it.

310
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,720
See, that was better, right?

311
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,560
Have you seen this part?

312
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,400
He told you he's proud of you.

313
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,480
Have you seen this part?

314
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,640
Oh, that really hurt our backs, huh?

315
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,480
That was awesome.

316
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,320
Kind of fucked you up,

317
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,040
but that's what you want, is to get fucked up, right?

318
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,640
Yes, Mike, yes, you're right, Mike.

319
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,480
We know, Mike.

320
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,680
But that was, like, that's a perfect encapsulation of,

321
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,920
I feel like this was a successful night,

322
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,520
but that's an imperfect encapsulation

323
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,680
of the question marks I have of the night.

324
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,160
Why close that ride?

325
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,400
Like, because the experiences, the three experiences,

326
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,880
are all, I mean, I guess we will save some,

327
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,040
we'll get into all of them, obviously,

328
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,240
but Back to the Future is probably the longest,

329
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,160
but you need more things to fill it up

330
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,000
until two in the morning.

331
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,520
It's up until two in the morning.

332
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,360
Yeah, it's a lot.

333
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,600
Which none of us made it all the way.

334
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,440
Like, we all, we were there pretty much

335
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,120
at the start at seven.

336
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,960
Right.

337
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,960
And then, like, yeah, I was wondering,

338
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,800
like, do we go for it?

339
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,880
And you, like, proven that you can still go.

340
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,720
I want to prove it.

341
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,560
I prove it a lot.

342
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,400
That I can still go.

343
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,960
I had to go, I had to pull back.

344
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,760
I was upset, I want to go, I want to go,

345
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,200
but I don't think I got it done until two, I don't think.

346
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,960
You missed seeing both of us

347
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,880
hit our relatively new parent wall.

348
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
You missed both of us.

349
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,120
I think we saw each other,

350
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,400
the light go out of each other's eyes.

351
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,240
Yeah.

352
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,080
And that is it.

353
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,520
We have no, we'll talk about maybe where it happened

354
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,720
and why it happened.

355
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,920
It felt like, you know, in Mission Impossible Four

356
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,040
when he's got the glove that won't work on the wall

357
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,280
and it keeps, like, shorting out.

358
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,120
I almost was like, no, wait, what?

359
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,760
You're, like, this tired right now?

360
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,560
Like, it's, ah, come on, work, stay awake.

361
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,960
That's a parenting thing that you can't fight against

362
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,120
because the other part of it is we're like vampire.

363
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,480
New parents, parents in general, are like vampires

364
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,080
because you're gonna wake up at a given time

365
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,920
no matter what.

366
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,760
Right.

367
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,240
So you can burn that midnight oil,

368
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,600
but he can get you on the other side.

369
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,880
And I knew the next morning,

370
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,680
I had to go relieve my nanny,

371
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,320
but I had an 8 a.m. soccer game

372
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,960
I had to get my kid to the next morning.

373
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,680
I was like, well, this is, even if I pushed it,

374
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,720
yeah, I'm, there's no, there's no rest for me.

375
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,760
I'm gonna be.

376
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,360
Then that's gonna be a terrible soccer game.

377
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,200
Yeah, it'll be awful.

378
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,640
You'll be, yeah, yeah, yeah.

379
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,040
Anything kid, it's a true punishment.

380
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,880
And I came off.

381
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,240
And let alone, like, sleepless, bad, hungover, never.

382
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,080
Oh, never.

383
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,880
Hangovers are no, parenting is the ultimate hangover cure.

384
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,000
You can't, if you do it to yourself,

385
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,840
you're out with your mind.

386
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,840
I did it once, it was a terrible experience

387
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,120
to be hungover as a parent.

388
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,480
How bad, was there like a, was there like a leave to vomit?

389
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,320
Was it that bad?

390
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,560
It was, I remembered distinctly that my wife and I

391
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,760
were both just like down on the ground with our kids

392
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,920
and being like, we're just gonna hang out

393
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,480
and play on the ground.

394
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,280
Like we were just very, it was, it was for a wedding

395
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,560
and we, and yeah, we just missed it.

396
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,240
We, again, lesson learned, never again.

397
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,240
And yeah, it just, it just knocked us on our ass.

398
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,680
And it was just like, the hangover is a rough spot.

399
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,240
But thankfully, we didn't have to worry about hangovers

400
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,520
because FanFest, it was impossible to get a drink.

401
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,280
I don't understand why it was impossible to get food

402
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,520
or drinks at this place without waiting for,

403
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,200
the longest rides were for food and drink.

404
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,640
And it felt like they staffed it as if no one was coming

405
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,480
on that part.

406
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,840
It's like, well, I don't think anyone will want these drinks.

407
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,680
Like, and I, and I did do a lot, I did my research.

408
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,440
I watched a lot of bloggers and people that were there

409
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,560
had the same exact complaint.

410
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,240
Like everyone was getting off the lines

411
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,320
because they're like, it was like,

412
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,200
I'm not gonna wait 45 minutes to get like a themed drink

413
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,600
that it probably hasn't even had that much alcohol in it.

414
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,120
Like, but it really is a bummer.

415
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,040
It's like, I wanna, I wanna go to, you know,

416
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,000
I wanna go to 10 forward.

417
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,360
I wanna go eat the Dungeons and Dragons, you know,

418
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,560
hot brownie, whatever it is.

419
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,600
Yes, and it's our obligation.

420
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,040
It's our job, quite frankly, to try the special things.

421
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,040
And you got to do it, but at some point I was like,

422
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,920
I want a dessert.

423
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,400
There's literally no line for the basic soft serve.

424
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,000
The unthemed soft serve, you did the same for a churro.

425
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,840
I got a churro from the front of the mummy ride,

426
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,040
which has no theming, but it was very good.

427
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,000
Apparently- It's not special.

428
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,040
It's always there, but very sad.

429
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,640
I loved my basic non-IP dessert.

430
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,640
Well, you know what I think they should do?

431
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,560
And we were lamenting this as well

432
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,600
in the Back to the Future ride.

433
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,320
We, it mainly takes place in the courthouse square.

434
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,200
There's no food down there at all.

435
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,240
Yeah. And there's most famously a diner

436
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,720
in the courthouse square in Back to the Future.

437
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,400
They did recreate that diner

438
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,400
in a different part of the park,

439
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,680
which I also thought was weird,

440
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,920
but like at the Intuit Dome where the Clippers play,

441
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,040
every food station is the same.

442
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,200
So you don't have to like go around for the sushi.

443
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,800
It's like the sushi is with the,

444
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,960
and I feel like that's what they should have done.

445
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,080
They should have had a fan night's,

446
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,480
I don't need to like, so like when I go get something,

447
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,680
it's like, yes, I can get my back,

448
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,560
I can get my Biff burrito,

449
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,360
or I can get my cork sausage or whatever.

450
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,240
Or rain pasta.

451
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,120
Now I will say that I was upset with what you ate

452
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,840
at the corks bar.

453
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,960
That was upsetting to me.

454
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,560
What, the way you're looking at it, really?

455
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,440
Are you talking about the credacean dog?

456
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,520
Yes.

457
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,280
Yeah, well, and you bailed on that pretty quickly.

458
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,640
I sure did.

459
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,040
Yeah, well, this is in the genre.

460
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,800
This has come up here and there on the show

461
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,600
because it seems like it's from a location

462
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,640
that has previously been like a Chucky restaurant.

463
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,840
Well, that was a bar.

464
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,200
That's the bar area.

465
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,040
Oh, okay.

466
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,240
Although, no, excuse me, there was a diner as well.

467
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,080
Isn't that a food counter also?

468
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,520
Because I've gotten caught on that they serve an item

469
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,520
called like Chucky's Macassacre and cheese.

470
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,160
They have the straight, it's like impossible

471
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,000
to wrap your head.

472
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,520
You can like stare at it for five minutes

473
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,480
and not know how to say it.

474
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,480
So it's from, and I know they've also,

475
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,200
they've trafficked in this genre

476
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,320
of like corn dog that is insane.

477
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,160
And that's pretty much what you did, right?

478
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,240
What was the variety in which it was insane?

479
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,680
Well, it was literally visually this big, I feel like.

480
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,520
Yes.

481
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,760
This thick, really thick.

482
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,320
And not straight either, it felt curved.

483
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,960
It felt like an eggplant shape or something like that.

484
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,800
Yeah, it had a weird.

485
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,600
Yeah, the old Bill Clinton curvature.

486
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,280
Yeah, that's what I thought of.

487
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,280
Most famous weirdly curved junk in history.

488
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,000
Bright red Cheeto dusted Bill Clinton thick.

489
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,840
That makes sense.

490
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,800
You think of a different president.

491
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,200
Oh, well, it's a lot of ways

492
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,880
it was a mashup of all the presidents.

493
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,040
Yeah, it was like Cheeto red.

494
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,320
And then it was like a giant hot dog or broad of some kind.

495
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,640
And it was just like deep fried.

496
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,480
Yeah.

497
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,320
And it almost felt like there was like,

498
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,160
I know it wasn't an inch,

499
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,680
but it almost felt like there was an inch,

500
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,600
like an inch from hot dog to deep fry.

501
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,920
I was watching you eat it and at first shock

502
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,680
to know it was a hot dog or a broad.

503
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,520
Like I was like, oh, I thought this was maybe corn.

504
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,360
It looked like Mexican corn.

505
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,160
And then I was like, oh, it's not Mexican corn.

506
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,040
And I was like, well, it must be some sort of dessert.

507
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,880
It wasn't that.

508
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,320
And then when you did cut into it,

509
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,720
it was weird because it looked like

510
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,120
it was a layer of the earth.

511
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,360
It was like, there was the fried layer

512
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,400
and then there was some space.

513
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,240
It wasn't together.

514
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,080
It was like sometimes a corn dog is like together as one.

515
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,160
It did feel like there was like atmosphere between the two.

516
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,040
Oh yeah, a hollow zone, sure.

517
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,880
Right.

518
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,720
It felt like they like meet.

519
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,960
Where the dark universe takes place apparently.

520
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,800
Oh.

521
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,040
Where the Godzilla and King Kong hang out.

522
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,280
Yeah, right.

523
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,880
The upside down, the hollow earth in a lot of ways.

524
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,640
Yeah, I did feel like they maybe like made,

525
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,920
I'm sure they did fry it, but maybe I'm not.

526
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,640
Maybe they made the casing first and slid the hot dog in.

527
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,480
I don't know.

528
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,400
It was odd.

529
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,720
It was odd.

530
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,160
It was, I will say,

531
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,840
as somebody who was most excited to go to Quarks,

532
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,560
a very quick theming of Quarks.

533
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,320
Like, where were that place?

534
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,640
The chunky place.

535
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,320
It felt like a little slap dash.

536
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,880
They did have like the fountain drinks,

537
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,720
had like names on it.

538
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,720
It was like cart, like Bajoran.

539
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,720
Bajoran Plo-meek.

540
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,080
Yeah, it was like they threw up.

541
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,240
Orion, seemingly on their little label,

542
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,640
spelled with one zero and one oh.

543
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,280
So that's a good little Easter egg.

544
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,360
And then it's just green goo.

545
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,760
I assume the same green, yellow, and red goo

546
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,760
they have all day.

547
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,800
I think probably.

548
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,640
Yeah, yeah.

549
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,800
I'm not sure what that is day to day.

550
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,680
They feel like they were definitely trying to make it pop,

551
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,800
but I don't know if these recipes were tested with much.

552
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,520
We're first night out,

553
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,000
so maybe this is gonna be a corn dog

554
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,200
that's gonna get better, I don't know.

555
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,520
I mean, might be optimistic.

556
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,360
I'm looking at,

557
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,720
I don't know if you guys caught this detail,

558
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,480
but also in that kind of service station zone

559
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,960
next to the space drinks,

560
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,280
there's just this kind of weird green,

561
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,240
like spinach green, like a ketchup bottle,

562
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,920
but with green to like beige goo in it.

563
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,960
And then it's like the goo is pouring out everywhere.

564
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,560
And in my photo,

565
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,960
I mean, this is like some science experiment gone awry

566
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,240
and in the photo, the label says don't squeeze too tight.

567
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,720
And then it seems like an explosion has occurred around.

568
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,560
This is not an appetizing thing to see.

569
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,200
No, this is what I will say is that I think that they,

570
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,840
and I looked at a lot of the food,

571
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,640
because again, we couldn't get to the food.

572
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,880
So I went to try to look at people's reviews of the food

573
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,000
and the food they had.

574
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,640
Felt like everything was kind of normal

575
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,720
with an aggressive color on top of it.

576
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,120
So in the Harry Potter world, they had churros,

577
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,560
but then they had these like yellow,

578
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,880
like little bow ties of sauce in the middle of the churros.

579
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,200
They also had meat pies,

580
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,240
which I don't know if that was specific to the knight or.

581
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,680
I don't know if they do always have that there.

582
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,520
I don't know.

583
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,760
It feels like. That's a set familiar.

584
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,720
Universal feels like in normal times,

585
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,600
it has a chicken sandwich, a hamburger,

586
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,920
and then a salad with iceberg lettuce.

587
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,800
Yeah, that feels like three things that they have everywhere,

588
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
except for Harry Potter, I guess,

589
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,800
which has a slightly better, more variety.

590
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,680
Now, next to your Cardassian dog,

591
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,080
and I see the picture here.

592
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,040
I want to ask you about this.

593
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,760
They had a very basic thing

594
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,880
that didn't feel themed at all to me,

595
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,640
which was, you can describe it here,

596
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,600
what the other dish you ordered was.

597
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,640
They were fritters.

598
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,680
And now I'm trying to remember what alien race

599
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,960
is responsible for these fritters.

600
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,440
Vulcans. Vulcans, okay.

601
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,760
Oh, it is the Vulcan symbol there too.

602
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,200
Not to be confused with the Klingon targ legs.

603
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,600
Thank you. I thought about it.

604
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,440
I thought about getting the Klingon targ legs.

605
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,760
Which would be nicely paired with Klingon blood wine.

606
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,480
$22 Klingon, that's inexpensive.

607
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,960
Yeah, these drinks are gonna cost you some cash.

608
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,280
Yeah, yeah.

609
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,880
Was there strong jealousy and desire?

610
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,400
Because you guys are the Trekkies,

611
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,120
blood wine's a big thing, right?

612
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,320
Were you like, kind of itching to try blood wine?

613
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,160
Did you ultimately look at that?

614
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,280
I wanted to get to that Deep Space Nine,

615
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,080
but I really wanted to get in there and see what they had.

616
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,240
But then I also equate it with,

617
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,440
well, this line is so long.

618
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,480
And then the, like,

619
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,680
you can get me to spend money if I can get it spent fast.

620
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,840
But the minute that I'm,

621
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,320
the minute I'm on a line for like 10 minutes,

622
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,120
I'm like, do I really need, you know, the Earl Grey cold?

623
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,360
Probably not.

624
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,240
And then I can walk away very, like,

625
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,280
I'm like, I've made a business decision, yeah.

626
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,120
Anytime.

627
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,200
You start to be too logical where you're like,

628
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,520
it's not really what Baccarat drinks.

629
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,360
Right, exactly.

630
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,280
This is not really from a Klingon planet.

631
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,960
Yes, they just took ingredients

632
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,600
and named them arbitrary things

633
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,560
that are related to properties we like.

634
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,240
And in my case, where it's not a property I care about,

635
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,160
like, I might bail instantly.

636
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,880
That said, my Seti Eel margarita was pretty bangin'.

637
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,720
I really like this.

638
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,560
Yeah, yeah.

639
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,400
I like my cocktail.

640
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,220
And I did have the,

641
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,060
I had the Earl Grey.

642
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,900
Wait, oh my God,

643
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,920
I drank something with White Claw vodka in a margarita?

644
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,160
Wait, that was the,

645
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,200
why was it a margarita if it has White Claw and vodka?

646
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,040
You can make a margarita,

647
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,880
I guess, with White Claw.

648
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,720
I'm so in love.

649
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,720
I feel like I failed some kind of taste test.

650
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,560
I'm not a White Claw person.

651
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,380
You look upset.

652
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,220
I am.

653
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,060
I'm really distressed.

654
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,420
I got tricked.

655
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,260
I have seen people that have,

656
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,180
you can mix a margarita base, I think,

657
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,180
can really adapt to,

658
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,700
because that White Claw vodka is not gonna be,

659
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,380
like, it's not gonna have that much flavor to it.

660
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,220
Yeah, yeah.

661
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,980
So the margarita base is where I probably suck up all,

662
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,140
you're tasting all that flavor

663
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,580
of whatever they're pouring in there.

664
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,700
There was a ton of other stuff.

665
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,940
A jalapeno syrup that was really strong,

666
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,940
but my favorite thing,

667
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,620
the little gummy Seti Eel in it.

668
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,460
Ooh, I like that.

669
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,100
It just looked more like a little cockroach.

670
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,700
That's what crawled into the ears.

671
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,620
And to check off here in Wrath of Khan.

672
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,820
Oh, really?

673
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,660
Okay, so that's the historic.

674
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,480
Have you seen Wrath of Khan?

675
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,320
You've seen Wrath of Khan, right?

676
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,620
I think I have seen Wrath of Khan, and my apologies.

677
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,740
The only one that really resonates

678
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,540
and, like, is loud in my ears at all times

679
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,860
is the Whales one, which I'm very much about the Whales.

680
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,900
I think I, because this is consistent,

681
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,360
and consistent with my love of Back to the Future,

682
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,860
that of all the fantasy worlds that I could ever be sent to,

683
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,220
where I really wanna go is the mid-1980s.

684
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,060
Oh, I mean, look.

685
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,100
That's the one that gets you there.

686
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,380
I wanna talk about Back to the Future desperately,

687
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,780
because, by the way, I mean, look,

688
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,980
I would love to have a FanFest nights

689
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,620
and go to Eddie Murphy's Beverly Hills Cop

690
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,140
and just walk around Beverly Hills or Detroit.

691
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:09,980
I would do any of those.

692
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,740
Yes, that's a great idea.

693
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:16,740
But the Star Trek thing, to me, feels like it has the most,

694
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,740
the most fan night,

695
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,820
you can build a night around Star Trek, ultimately,

696
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,180
because there's fun rides, there's fun food,

697
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,580
there are bars there, it's organic to the place,

698
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,420
and it can feel different.

699
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,260
And I feel like they definitely tried to do that.

700
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,860
I feel like the 10 forward bar,

701
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:39,860
I will give a note on the lackluster enhancement

702
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:44,640
to the area, it felt like a lot of this was set up

703
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,660
to be Instagram museum moments.

704
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,180
So it's like, if you step out from the frame

705
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,020
in which you took the picture,

706
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,060
you're gonna be a little disappointed,

707
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,820
but that picture is gonna look A plus.

708
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,660
Right, yeah.

709
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,860
Well, we sat and had a drink

710
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:02,180
at the one light up little counter that they had,

711
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:05,220
and then the reverse literally on my left,

712
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,260
you can't even see any Star Wars,

713
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,900
it's just an awning, yeah, Star Trek,

714
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,020
it's a fountain and an awning, and the White Claw logo,

715
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,980
is White Claw canon?

716
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,100
Maybe, like, my virtue of it being in all of these things.

717
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,540
It's from space, it is from space,

718
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,980
White Claw is from space, yeah.

719
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,740
I imagine some character has a White Claw.

720
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,620
I was gonna say, Kirk defeated White Claw

721
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,060
on an early episode.

722
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,900
Okay, so that is where the name comes from.

723
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,780
To bring their delicious alcoholic beverages to.

724
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,300
Right, it's really the blood of a creature

725
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,140
that he slayed. You may love

726
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,420
to White Claw's wife, too.

727
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,180
It's a really famous one, you should know it.

728
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,100
I will say this in defense of all the Star Trek,

729
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,820
I am shocked, even though Star Trek,

730
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,980
there's shows on the air,

731
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:45,620
I am shocked that we got something themed to Deep Space Nine

732
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,180
and Next Generation in 2025.

733
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,900
Right. So I am, I will say this,

734
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,820
I am grateful that we got some scraps thrown to us

735
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,820
in regards to just a quark sign,

736
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,780
like who would have thought we would get a quark sign

737
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,660
in this year of our Lord.

738
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:04,660
I believe that that is the Star Trek that,

739
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,300
we talk again about what's the age for this.

740
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:12,060
Well, our age, and our age is that kind of Star Trek.

741
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:15,420
I am on a Star Trek show, a Lower Decks,

742
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,580
which is a very fun show.

743
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,820
Very fun show, it takes place in that era as well, right?

744
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:24,260
So I feel like that was the right choice to make.

745
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,020
I feel like Deep Space Nine has had a real

746
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,220
kind of resurgence in recent years,

747
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,460
but then the ride itself, or the experience,

748
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,060
and we should talk about this, there are no rides,

749
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,260
there are experiences, and they are kind of like,

750
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,580
walk through shows, it's not,

751
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,580
I think of Immersive as, you are a part of the show,

752
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,660
I felt like this was like watching a stage show

753
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,660
in which you walked through it.

754
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,500
Sure.

755
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,220
Instead of the set being changed in front of you,

756
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,180
you get to be in the set changes.

757
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:02,180
Yes, and this is maybe, we'll get into certain elements

758
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,340
of it, but I wanted a little bit more,

759
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,780
okay, we need to do this, you man that, you do this,

760
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,460
and Dungeons and Dragons, we had to touch something,

761
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,380
but, or I did, I got lucky enough.

762
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:17,980
You were the only one with a task in a room with 50 people.

763
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,100
They said at some point, they said like,

764
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,100
man in the cardigan.

765
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,940
Cardigan wizard.

766
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,780
I also.

767
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,600
I also.

768
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,440
Touched a ball like that, it was literally.

769
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,620
Oh, just like is in the room with us.

770
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,460
It was right there.

771
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,300
Yeah, there it is.

772
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,380
You feel right, wow, you're flashing

773
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,220
right back to Friday night.

774
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,580
Holy shit.

775
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,940
It was amazing, they just pop up around you, I guess.

776
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,980
I was also, she's so like, the wizard,

777
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,820
we're like, single, do you want,

778
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,060
I go, oh, the wizard must recognize Paul.

779
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,020
No, no, but your proximity was just near the ball.

780
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,860
It was just near the ball.

781
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,700
It had to be you.

782
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,540
It had to be you.

783
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:46,740
Yes, and, but that was the thing that I wanted,

784
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,860
and this is where I feel like these bigger theme parks,

785
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,380
they have to fail in a way because

786
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,980
you need to get a bunch of people through,

787
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,660
so it's like, I thought the actors did a great job.

788
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,500
Like, I will say that 100%.

789
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,340
Across the board, every one of these things, yeah.

790
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,620
Costumes look great.

791
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:06,100
The way they built the, the red alert is the ride, right?

792
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,220
The Star Trek red alert.

793
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,060
Yes.

794
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,900
Experience.

795
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,720
Experience, yeah.

796
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,340
We are going to the Star Trek museum,

797
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,020
which is a big part of Picard season three.

798
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,860
Yes.

799
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,980
And we are getting to kind of take a tour

800
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,820
of the enterprise.

801
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,620
There's some logic that I will,

802
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,340
like, we're going to a museum,

803
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,500
but it did seem like the enterprise

804
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,980
was fully manned for battle,

805
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,620
which was also a choice that I was like,

806
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,740
oh, okay, these didn't seem like tour guides.

807
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,540
It like, like the medical technicians,

808
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,580
the engineering, like they were fully at work.

809
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,780
I wonder if, I wonder if that was like,

810
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,100
because we talk about like recent theme park stuff

811
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,180
where like it feels like logic.

812
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,940
Sometimes it's too heavily like

813
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,660
they're trying to logic out a problem.

814
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,340
Like, well, if it's Star Trek,

815
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,180
but like really we know the enterprise

816
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,060
is on this new museum for Picard,

817
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,060
that's what Canon is now.

818
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,820
So it wouldn't make sense if you're just on the ship.

819
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,820
But then they also be like, we can't really,

820
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,660
I mean, then they'd be like,

821
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,500
well, we can't really have Picard,

822
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,940
but then you could because then back to the future,

823
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,140
they just embraced the idea.

824
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,140
They just did everything.

825
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:05,980
Yeah, yeah.

826
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,940
And I want to be clear because I will,

827
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,900
and I think we all will point out logic problems

828
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,100
in all of these things.

829
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,980
It doesn't mean that I didn't like it.

830
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,820
100%.

831
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,660
We're still going to do it.

832
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,820
That's why I do think Galaxy's Edge,

833
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,820
they should just put all the characters together

834
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,660
all at once.

835
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,980
Will all the nerds complain?

836
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:22,820
Yes.

837
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,980
Will they keep going back anyway?

838
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,820
Of course.

839
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,700
Some of them will though.

840
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,500
Even I think some of the hardcore nerds won't care.

841
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,660
Yeah, because that's what you want.

842
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,500
You want the experience.

843
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,740
And I think that like for me,

844
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:36,340
it was a really cool recreation of the enterprise.

845
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,180
Again, I have,

846
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,020
Yes.

847
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,380
Oddly traveled to very different places.

848
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,060
Like that used to be right by Man's Chinese Theater.

849
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,540
There used to be a,

850
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,940
like a place where you could get in,

851
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,060
like they had the Cheers Bar

852
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,900
and they had the enterprise set.

853
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,740
That TV museum.

854
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,580
Yes.

855
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,460
It's an LA fitness now.

856
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,300
Yes.

857
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,820
And it was one of the coolest things ever

858
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,420
because you could actually touch these sets.

859
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,620
And then, and I've been on the Paramount tour

860
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,940
and the Paramount tour has elements

861
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,260
of the Star Trek sets as well.

862
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,420
So I love it.

863
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,380
Like I want to walk around in it.

864
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:11,100
That I felt like they did a pretty good job

865
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,260
at capturing what that is.

866
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:17,020
Again, in a main giant like maze kind of situation.

867
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,300
Like we have to walk through it.

868
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,340
Yes.

869
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,180
They clearly did a good job

870
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,580
because for you two who know it

871
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,940
and I who do not,

872
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,940
I walk into a room and I'm like,

873
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,660
there's a bunch of barrels in this room.

874
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,500
Right.

875
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,340
And they're like,

876
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,180
that's what it is.

877
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,020
It's barrels.

878
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,860
There's so many barrels.

879
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,180
The barrels, anytime you're in like a shuttle bay,

880
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,660
there's all these barrels in Star Trek Next Generation.

881
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,500
I don't know.

882
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,320
They just were like,

883
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,160
we need something to fill this space out.

884
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,180
It's such a great like prop designer going,

885
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,860
we have a big bay, we need more barrels.

886
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,700
Right.

887
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,660
But yeah, I loved all of that.

888
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,420
I felt like they really treated us really good

889
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,380
as my character is the lead engineer on,

890
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,220
chief engineer I should say on the Lower Deck Show.

891
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,740
I was excited to be there and I wanted to really razz

892
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,020
that engineering crew.

893
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:02,180
Actually play your character in real life.

894
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,740
That's how I grew this mustache just for fan nights.

895
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,980
To match Billups.

896
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,900
Desperate attempt to be recognized.

897
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,820
You asked us to point at you constantly.

898
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,860
Billups, anyone?

899
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,380
Notice it, notice it.

900
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,220
Touch the ball in Dungeons and Dragons.

901
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,060
I can touch something here if you want.

902
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:16,900
Touch whatever you want.

903
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,720
I'm good at it.

904
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,560
I have experience.

905
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,140
I will say that of the three experiences

906
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,740
that we experienced,

907
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,420
that was an original idea,

908
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:29,300
the Star Trek Red Alert that I thought was executed

909
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,580
at least from a point of view

910
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,580
if I understood what was happening.

911
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:36,620
Like from beginning to end and I was not confused.

912
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,220
Which was good.

913
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,660
Although it felt slightly lackluster

914
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,060
in the sense that you're like,

915
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,660
oh my gosh, an alien is attacking

916
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,700
and you're like getting to battle positions.

917
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,540
Ship is going down.

918
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,780
And can I give a spoiler?

919
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,620
Can we talk a little bit?

920
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,580
I think so, yeah.

921
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,020
And then the result is they were friendly.

922
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:56,860
Yeah, that's good.

923
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,180
It was one of those nice ones.

924
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,220
Once we talked to it, yeah, they were cool.

925
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,620
I was also torn about that

926
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,380
because that is a classic Star Trek resolution

927
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,740
where you like learn a lesson

928
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,540
that of course the alien, oh, it's peaceful.

929
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,980
Like what are you doing worried about?

930
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,580
This could be something that you're overreacting to.

931
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,700
But as a fan of haunts and scares,

932
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,740
I wanted the fucking Borg to burst

933
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,820
through those turbolift doors and scare the shit out of us.

934
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,140
And you wanted me to piss my pants.

935
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,220
I wanted you to piss your pants

936
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,420
and I wanted to be assimilated into their collective.

937
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,060
Well, now here's the thing that I couldn't quite figure out.

938
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,580
They have built this ride.

939
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,380
They have built a version of this ride

940
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,820
in Vegas that we talked about.

941
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,340
Why not just take that?

942
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,260
They had the Borg, they had the things.

943
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,580
I mean, not the actual pieces, but just take that story

944
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,820
because that story is a really fun story.

945
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,180
You're just a part of the assimilation.

946
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,700
And then you got the guys with phasers.

947
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,140
Oh yeah, we did it, we figured it out.

948
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:53,100
And then I wanted some more stakes too

949
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,540
because really at the end of it,

950
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:58,260
then again, no flack to this captain who did a great job.

951
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,140
But she's like, yes, we nailed it.

952
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:05,500
And it felt very like this is the way it was written.

953
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:10,340
She did say yes, and kind of like we do one of the pump fists

954
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,820
and I was like, oh, I didn't feel like a star.

955
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,660
I get what you're saying,

956
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,380
because it is a Star Trek kind of story,

957
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,620
but it just felt a little lackluster.

958
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,460
All right, bye, see you later.

959
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,020
It felt as easily solved as turbulence on a plane.

960
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,860
Yes.

961
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,700
Like, oh, well, they warned us

962
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,020
and then a minute later it was fine.

963
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,260
Yeah, and that was it.

964
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,860
And yeah, that was my only complaint about it

965
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,140
is I wanted some danger.

966
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,860
Yes, I agree, I wanted danger as well.

967
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,780
I mean, I wanted to live there.

968
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,700
That's also the thing.

969
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,140
Can I sit in Riker's chair?

970
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,980
What do you think?

971
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,580
Would it be okay if I?

972
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,700
Right, when you get that close to the bridge,

973
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,620
it's like all you want to do is touch it and see it

974
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,540
and feel it and to their credit,

975
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,660
they do have a great photo op

976
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,740
where you can sit in Picard's chair.

977
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,580
But I mean.

978
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,860
Yes, it's out by the water world.

979
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,220
But it's also, yeah, if you zoom out too wide,

980
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,980
you see the sign for water world,

981
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,820
the live sewers, particularly.

982
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,740
It's also like, I understand logistically,

983
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,100
they did give us more than you would get in a normal maze.

984
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,300
Of all of these things.

985
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,140
You know, is that true?

986
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:07,980
See, I don't know.

987
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,820
Not having done mazes yet.

988
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,660
Yes.

989
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,780
In terms of like getting ample time.

990
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,260
Because you did Dungeons and Dragons for sure,

991
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,300
like a lot of time and everything.

992
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,420
Yeah, you motor through Horror Nights maze.

993
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,420
That's what I was telling you.

994
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,260
You should do that one first

995
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,780
because you were in a single file line,

996
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,820
you were just rolling.

997
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,700
Well, I want to make a very strong case

998
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,620
to not bring you to Horror Nights first,

999
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:29,060
but to bring you to the world's biggest horror maze,

1000
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,260
which is maybe like 20 minutes up near Calabasas,

1001
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,940
which is in an abandoned mall.

1002
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,620
Oh, yes.

1003
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,460
And that is one of the most fun.

1004
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,540
I'm down for you had me at abandoned mall.

1005
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,100
That one is one of the most fun experiences I've ever had

1006
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:45,260
because they worked that right level of people

1007
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,060
to scare ratio where, because sometimes in universal,

1008
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,500
like it's just like a line and it's sort of like,

1009
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,820
you've seen the scare already,

1010
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,700
and if the timing works out,

1011
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,300
you will be scared,

1012
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,140
but sometimes the timing doesn't work out.

1013
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,420
But this, I felt like because it was in groups,

1014
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,580
we had our own experience.

1015
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,380
I really liked that we were like,

1016
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,260
we were in the medical bay, we were in engineering,

1017
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,620
we were like, we went as a group.

1018
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,340
It wasn't like at our own discretion,

1019
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,780
like we were going with the story.

1020
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,740
Yes, I mean, it would have been a real bummer

1021
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,780
if we just marched into the bridge and then marched out,

1022
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,980
but it did feel like, come on,

1023
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,660
isn't like a kid dressed as Q going to pop in here

1024
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,460
and try to put us on trial for something.

1025
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,140
Yes, in a world of villains,

1026
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,260
in a world of villains and a world of characters,

1027
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,140
to have none,

1028
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:35,180
to have zero recognizable characters and villains

1029
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,020
was a bummer to me.

1030
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:40,180
They said the blue face guy and Dorian show up

1031
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,860
with a big fake rubber chest,

1032
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,660
like Ricardo Montalban in the second,

1033
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,980
or by the way, but you just said it perfect.

1034
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,460
Like you could put a guy,

1035
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,260
a guy can pretend to be John DeLan,

1036
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,860
we're going to talk about in Back to Future.

1037
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,860
There was a guy, they recreate everybody in Back to Future.

1038
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,540
So just put a hat and a red robe on somebody and be like,

1039
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,300
I'm Q and I'm challenging you all.

1040
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,140
We need to figure out this puzzle.

1041
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,140
And then let them figure out the puzzle,

1042
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,420
but we feel a part of it.

1043
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,860
Look, I would have done it for free.

1044
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,140
Just let me be Q.

1045
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,140
This is, when we're complaining to some degree,

1046
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,380
even though I really enjoyed a lot of this,

1047
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,780
I do think that I bet if we were to talk to people,

1048
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,820
they would be like, look,

1049
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,940
here's the list of what we couldn't do with this maze.

1050
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,580
Here's what Paramount said we could do.

1051
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,580
Here's what they said we couldn't do.

1052
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,300
And I do wonder if it was like,

1053
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,220
you cannot have somebody playing Picard.

1054
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,500
We just will not allow it.

1055
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,860
Universal owns Back to Future,

1056
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:33,580
so maybe there was a lot more room to do stuff.

1057
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,620
But it seems like if they're leasing it out,

1058
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,460
they definitely are.

1059
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,220
Look, again, this all being said,

1060
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:42,540
I loved that experience because it was fun to,

1061
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,180
like that was an immersive environment

1062
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,220
that was very familiar.

1063
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,180
So you got to walk within a thing

1064
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,860
that I thought was really, really fun.

1065
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,220
And it's just, I want it,

1066
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,620
the idea of it going away is upsetting to me.

1067
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,780
Now that I know it's there, the carpeting is there,

1068
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,420
I can walk by the panels.

1069
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,340
I saw it in a picture of that panel.

1070
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,060
Tear down Hogwarts as far as I'm concerned.

1071
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,860
That's my Hogwarts is that Enterprise-D.

1072
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,900
Well, by the way, so the whole way home,

1073
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,820
I was thinking about this to give you like an old insight

1074
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,100
on where my mind is going.

1075
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,220
I was like, you know what would be awesome

1076
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,260
is if they built a really kick-ass escape room

1077
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,540
that recreated the bridge of the Enterprise, right?

1078
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,460
And you have to solve mysteries

1079
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,460
and you get these communications on the screen

1080
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,380
and somebody has to be the captain.

1081
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,940
It would be so much fun.

1082
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,940
There is something.

1083
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,820
I think escapology, is that the code?

1084
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,460
Cause that's the one moving into Universal at CityWalk.

1085
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,140
There is one, I think they have a start.

1086
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,780
It's not the Enterprise-D though.

1087
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,820
I do think there is a Star Trek escape room somewhere.

1088
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,740
I would love, why not?

1089
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,820
Why not?

1090
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,220
Cause I think that's what I want.

1091
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,660
I want to be like in that bridge,

1092
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,500
touching and feeling.

1093
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,180
With a problem to solve, you have to go to warp.

1094
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,740
You want to go to warp, you want to do this,

1095
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,100
which is not warp in the Millennium Falcon.

1096
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,900
It's like this, you just slide up on a touch screen.

1097
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,460
That's what data would do.

1098
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,860
So it's a less exciting gesture, but that's more exciting.

1099
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,740
But if you're the captain, you can also like.

1100
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,580
Oh, you point.

1101
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,540
Captain, you point like this, then you do this.

1102
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,260
And then like if you're in Counselor Troy's chair,

1103
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,460
and you have something, you can interpret things.

1104
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,500
Cause she's baited so that she can feel things,

1105
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,740
that's an eight person escape room.

1106
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,340
Because you have enough positions

1107
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,260
to actually be effective in the escape room.

1108
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,100
I mean, whatever.

1109
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,420
This is just free ideas for fans.

1110
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,900
If it doesn't exist, yeah,

1111
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,180
it does feel like it should exist.

1112
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,220
People go nuts for it.

1113
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1114
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:35,100
And by the way, I think what's been itching

1115
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:38,140
in the back of my head is, for whatever reason,

1116
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,980
my Instagram account has been getting a lot of John Wick.

1117
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,060
The Continental just opened in Vegas.

1118
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,780
And that seems incredibly interactive.

1119
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,620
I don't know about this.

1120
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,460
What's the John Wick Vegas thing?

1121
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,420
Oh, it's a whole immersive like bar,

1122
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,380
and they don't even allow cameras in certain things.

1123
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,220
And you get to really jump into the John Wick-a-verse.

1124
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,020
Suit guy, everything.

1125
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,860
Yeah.

1126
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,740
By the way, if that comes on the thing,

1127
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,700
I will gladly make a trip to Vegas with you guys

1128
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,540
to check out the Continental.

1129
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,420
Well, couldn't we all pair this

1130
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,660
with cause Universal's opening the Horror Maze in August.

1131
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,500
Ooh.

1132
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,020
So I'm already like adding things to that trip perhaps.

1133
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,740
And Summer League is happening in August.

1134
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,860
So that's great for me.

1135
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,460
I can make a real case for this.

1136
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:22,460
Or another pitch is, do it any time that isn't August,

1137
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,660
due to immense horrible heat.

1138
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,500
That's a bummer, you're right.

1139
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,580
But then Backstreet Boys, it's Sphere also August.

1140
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,660
Oh, I would love to see that.

1141
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,060
So there's a lot of things throwing in this pile.

1142
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,300
If we're rounding it, I mean, I know,

1143
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,980
there's a lot of air conditioning around.

1144
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,820
We can, as long as we can-

1145
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,340
Yeah, just don't leave the buildings,

1146
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,060
which is fine, we're talking about all indoor activities.

1147
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,660
Yeah, as long as we don't make the mistake

1148
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,740
Eve Anderson made of walking from a casino

1149
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,180
to our live show in August.

1150
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,380
Oh, no, no, no.

1151
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,620
I walked outside of the NBA Summer League

1152
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,140
and just waiting for an Uber was awful.

1153
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,420
And I didn't even walk, I guess I was waiting.

1154
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,220
And that's, I guess we don't have to,

1155
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,860
because even I went to Liberace's house

1156
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,220
when we were in Vegas as well.

1157
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,700
Which we really never did an episode on,

1158
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,460
we just talked a little bit at the live show.

1159
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,780
We could have dug in a little more on that.

1160
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,980
I know, well, every comment section

1161
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:09,540
and every episode we've had since, Liberace, Liberace.

1162
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,900
This is the people who want the Wayland Flowers

1163
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,740
and Madam comments.

1164
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:13,980
That's true.

1165
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,820
That's true.

1166
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,060
Where do you land on the, as somebody we can detest,

1167
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,940
I can attest that the last,

1168
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,940
maybe ever since the last episode you did,

1169
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,060
I think Wayland Flowers and Madam

1170
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,260
has come up every single episode.

1171
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,100
How easy, and by the way-

1172
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,740
It's an infestation on the show now.

1173
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,700
You know, at this place, I mean, we need to keep it alive.

1174
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,860
We need to tell, we are the storytellers, you know?

1175
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,260
We need to keep that story going.

1176
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,820
Yes, that's what I feel as well.

1177
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,220
If we don't pass it to the next generation.

1178
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,300
The griots or whatever they are.

1179
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,580
All right, Madam escape room.

1180
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,220
You're in Madam's dressing room

1181
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:45,060
and you have to escape before she makes too many body jokes.

1182
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,700
Your ears will start burning.

1183
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,780
That's a room in the future podcast,

1184
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,500
The Right Immersive Halloween Horror Night's Maze

1185
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,340
that I would want to make.

1186
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,140
With a Madam operated by you.

1187
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:54,980
Yes, I will do that room, yeah.

1188
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,540
From behind one of those dressing room walls.

1189
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,020
Yeah, throw one bowl over. By the way,

1190
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,340
as you're talking about the Madam room,

1191
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,820
I'm thinking, you know, another,

1192
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,020
because we were talking about this too,

1193
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,780
like universal fan nights,

1194
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,180
they'll probably change it every year.

1195
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,620
Muppets would be a great one.

1196
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,740
Go through like the backstage of a Muppet show.

1197
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,580
Sure, sure. Is Disney gonna let them do it?

1198
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,060
Well, who knows? If they're not gonna do

1199
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,740
something better, although we keep hearing

1200
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,860
maybe someone's going on with like,

1201
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,420
I might not have to say. There's a lot of rumors.

1202
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,580
Yeah, there's rumors of more.

1203
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,300
Well, obviously we know the rollercoaster,

1204
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,220
the electric man. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1205
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,340
But I know it'll be.

1206
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,900
They want to screwed universal.

1207
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,780
I feel like they're not in a mode right now.

1208
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,620
I'm not saying it's a good idea.

1209
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,860
I'm amazed that Paramount played ball

1210
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,940
because Paramount isn't playing ball with anybody.

1211
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:34,860
They're fucking with 60 minutes and they're all this stuff.

1212
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,460
But I feel like Star Trek is like a property

1213
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,220
that can be, you're right.

1214
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,140
But there's no Paramount Park, right?

1215
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,900
Yeah. So and I guess like Netflix,

1216
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,300
they must have had to make some sort of deal

1217
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,460
with Netflix too, right?

1218
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,340
Or maybe not, because One Piece can exist

1219
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,020
outside of Netflix.

1220
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,780
I don't know. I don't know.

1221
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,860
But yeah, I don't know who owns them.

1222
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:59,500
There is precedent for Star Trek at Universal

1223
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,740
because they had the. Right, that was the.

1224
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,780
The tape, you get a tape.

1225
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,300
Oh yeah, it's the return of Star Trek.

1226
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,220
While you're buttering up Paul for different experiences,

1227
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,660
this might be your best chance to get a buddy

1228
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,140
to go on the cruise.

1229
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,380
Oh, the Star Trek cruise.

1230
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,900
One of the things I really wanted to do,

1231
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,820
have you ever seen this?

1232
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:14,860
I've heard of this.

1233
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,900
Because like there's a Star Trek cruise

1234
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:21,900
and it looks like the biggest like just messy party ever.

1235
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,180
Well, see, maybe I could get on there

1236
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,940
and get some VIP treatment.

1237
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,700
I am looking at a list of people.

1238
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,540
Tawny went on there.

1239
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,740
Tawny Newsome and Noelle Wells

1240
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,140
that are people from. Yeah, yeah.

1241
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,060
If Eugene has been on there.

1242
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,060
Somebody who's gonna fish,

1243
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,100
somebody who is not your wife

1244
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,660
is going to fish to be a plus one.

1245
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,780
And I hope that maybe.

1246
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,420
We know somebody who works on the cruise from Orlando.

1247
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,260
Oh really?

1248
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,100
Oh is that right?

1249
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:45,940
I'm not sure.

1250
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,220
But you got Shatner this time,

1251
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,900
you got Frakes this time.

1252
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,260
It's almost sold out.

1253
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,180
Do we need to buy it right now while we're recording?

1254
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,020
Maybe we should buy it right now.

1255
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,860
Yeah, do they Shimmerman is gonna be on it?

1256
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,020
My guy Armin, yeah.

1257
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,020
Do they fly them in?

1258
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,500
Because I've heard rumors

1259
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,260
that sometimes the helicopter will come to the boat.

1260
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,660
They don't do the whole time.

1261
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,260
Whoa, they like helicopter Shatner in and out.

1262
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,100
Yeah, in and out.

1263
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,980
We know he's amenable to, you know,

1264
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,060
little craft, little aircraft,

1265
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,220
such as going into space.

1266
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,060
Right.

1267
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,180
Yeah, a little shuttle craft.

1268
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,100
You know, you put a little, yeah.

1269
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,940
He's gonna blue origin out of there.

1270
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,380
A special arrangement for him.

1271
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,540
I just watched the clip,

1272
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,460
if people haven't seen it,

1273
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:24,020
of Shatner like haunted by his experience.

1274
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,140
Oh, I love that.

1275
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,340
It's so bizarre.

1276
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,620
It's so bizarre, he's haunted.

1277
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,260
He's trying to express to Jeff Bezos

1278
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,660
what he's seen and what he's learned about living,

1279
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,500
what humanity.

1280
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,940
And Bezos just pops a cork on champagne

1281
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,140
in the middle of his like profound statement.

1282
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,580
It could not be a better encapsulation of him.

1283
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,540
Yeah, yeah, who cares?

1284
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:41,660
Let's party.

1285
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,300
Now, let's get into the meat of the thing,

1286
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,180
which is, I mean, I think the one thing

1287
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:50,780
that everyone says, universally, no pun intended,

1288
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:54,260
is the best part is the back to the future Hill Valley.

1289
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,100
Yes, yeah, yeah.

1290
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,660
Yeah, destination Hill Valley

1291
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,340
is the official naming mechanism of it.

1292
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:02,100
So this does the thing that a lot of mazes have done

1293
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,220
at Horror Nights over the years

1294
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:06,460
where you board the world famous Universal Tram

1295
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,300
and it takes you down to the lot

1296
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,580
and drops you at this particular part.

1297
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,420
But it's an area that is-

1298
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,140
And I will say, before you even get to that,

1299
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,500
we have the Save the Clock Tower lady.

1300
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,340
Oh, that's right.

1301
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:16,900
She is at the base of the thing.

1302
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:17,740
And what I found so interesting

1303
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:18,780
about the Save the Clock Tower lady,

1304
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,940
who looked great and was doing her part,

1305
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,260
people were actually giving her money.

1306
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,580
And I was like, where does that money go?

1307
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:25,900
Because people were putting money

1308
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,060
in the Save the Clock Tower.

1309
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,940
I saw real money go in there.

1310
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,020
Maybe she got it.

1311
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,340
Hey, look, not bad.

1312
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:34,340
That's for, there should be more opportunities for tips.

1313
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,100
I can tell you that during the training,

1314
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:39,660
they tell you people might offer you tips,

1315
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,140
turn it down.

1316
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:44,580
I did, one time, somebody gave me a 20.

1317
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,420
I took a 20.

1318
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,900
Look, when I worked at the container store,

1319
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:49,700
in Chambord, Illinois, which is filed for bankruptcy,

1320
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,060
I'm a little worried about that.

1321
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,260
Oh no, PTR Curse.

1322
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,420
It's a PTR Curse, talking about it for eight years,

1323
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,180
finally destroyed it.

1324
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,700
They would tell you if someone insisted twice,

1325
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,180
you should take it.

1326
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,380
But that's the only time.

1327
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,860
At Home Depot, when I get my Christmas tree there,

1328
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,300
they can't take tips.

1329
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,740
But then they show you how you could just pop it

1330
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,220
into their little thing.

1331
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:15,140
So you gotta treat them like,

1332
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,740
you have to slip it into it,

1333
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:21,100
which is a little bit more uncomfortable, honestly.

1334
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,740
It's also like a strip club or something.

1335
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,740
Yeah, I know, I was like, all right.

1336
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,620
Here goes, this is for you.

1337
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,980
You get yourself something special.

1338
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,020
But continue, so yes, we get on the tram, we go.

1339
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,340
Yeah, it's one of these experiences

1340
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:32,780
where the tram takes you down somewhere,

1341
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:35,340
but in this case, it takes you to the real courthouse square

1342
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:39,420
where scenes from all throughout the trilogy were filmed.

1343
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,780
Oh yeah, sorry, yeah, good, yes.

1344
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:41,620
Yeah, yeah.

1345
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:43,980
Although, is any of three there?

1346
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:44,820
I could be wrong.

1347
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,900
Is there any proper courthouse square?

1348
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:47,740
I'm not sure.

1349
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:48,860
But you know what it is.

1350
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,740
But yeah, it's a location you get to see

1351
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,340
on the tram tour, obviously,

1352
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,300
but I don't think they've ever done anything

1353
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,260
where you get out and walk around,

1354
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,980
other than for VIPs.

1355
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,140
So I was excited about this,

1356
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,420
because this is one of the only areas

1357
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,020
that I'm super nerdy about, and I've always been,

1358
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,140
and I've gotten to when I was a guide,

1359
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,740
we got to do a tour down there, and I ran around,

1360
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:11,660
and I stood under where the Jaws hologram comes out.

1361
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,780
Then one time, I had a general meeting on the lot,

1362
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:16,340
and I realized that I could exit via the path

1363
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,420
that made me have to drive the path of the DeLorean,

1364
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:22,380
which I did with so much gusto.

1365
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,860
I think I turned on the score.

1366
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:28,460
I found it on Spotify, blared it as I went past

1367
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,100
where the lightning strikes.

1368
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,940
I sang it real loud.

1369
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:33,300
I super durked out.

1370
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,700
So getting to be there and hang out for a long time.

1371
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,260
I love that.

1372
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:41,580
I love that square as a, yeah, that movie,

1373
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,380
that's like, these are playing with big parts

1374
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,220
of my emotions.

1375
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,180
I want to be in that town square.

1376
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,020
I loved it.

1377
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:50,180
It was crowded, but not overly crowded.

1378
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:54,940
I think that where Star Trek brought you in in groups,

1379
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:59,660
this kind of allowed a crowd to kind of form.

1380
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,300
Now, for better or for worse, we could talk about it.

1381
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,340
But what I did like is it didn't feel like

1382
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,420
this was a theme park-based area

1383
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,180
because you're walking on grass, like real grass.

1384
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:13,140
That's a functioning part of the lot.

1385
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:13,980
That's not a...

1386
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,620
That they use a lot, we were talking about throughout.

1387
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,500
In some cases, we were being a little nitpicky

1388
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,460
of like, it doesn't look exactly like in the movies,

1389
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:25,300
but part of that is because they do redress it

1390
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,300
and use it all the time.

1391
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,260
Then that was...

1392
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:31,340
That's what I loved and hated about it,

1393
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,660
which was like, it was so cool to be there

1394
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,900
and there's everything.

1395
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:40,900
But the theming was like someone going like,

1396
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,740
oh, we can make this look a little bit

1397
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,140
like the Back to the Future.

1398
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,260
It wasn't the exact stores or things,

1399
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:54,260
but it felt adjacent to it.

1400
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,860
But then I'm also like, but you have all this stuff, right?

1401
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:01,020
But I guess I can't really decorate it fully.

1402
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:02,460
And I'm sure it's another thing

1403
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,900
where somebody would be like, we wanted to do it.

1404
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:05,740
Right.

1405
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,580
They wouldn't give us the 50K.

1406
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,980
But what is the reason why the sign would not be right?

1407
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,980
The fan night, that's exactly what a fan

1408
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,300
is gonna pick apart immediately.

1409
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:17,620
That kind of drove me the most crazy

1410
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:22,500
because that to me is either have the exact recreation of it

1411
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,660
or have the original one and put some,

1412
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,260
because they did actually have like Biff's car

1413
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,940
and they had like, those were like real, the real cars,

1414
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,780
but they had the locked off so you couldn't touch it.

1415
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,420
Lyon Estates billboard.

1416
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:33,540
Yeah.

1417
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:36,660
But that was a recreation of something

1418
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,140
that wasn't a replica of it.

1419
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:40,580
And that was bumming me out.

1420
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:44,620
Like I was like, give me the thing that is the,

1421
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,900
like you have that, you're so close.

1422
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,860
You're so close.

1423
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:51,860
It is interesting because I think it being the actual place

1424
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:53,300
where they shot the movie is amazing

1425
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,500
to get to do a fun immersive thing there.

1426
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,220
But then the limitations of it being a working studio

1427
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,900
also hurt, there's probably various reasons

1428
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,740
why certain things aren't the way they are.

1429
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:05,180
Probably if they do a recreation of this

1430
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:08,060
for maybe Orlando, maybe UK,

1431
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:09,900
it'll be what we're talking about.

1432
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,300
It'll be more perfect than this is even able to be

1433
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,700
for some reason we don't even.

1434
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,820
Well, because they're building it from scratch

1435
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:17,380
and the courthouse will look exactly right.

1436
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:18,620
It does look like, I don't know,

1437
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,740
it looks like more of a standard city hall kind of,

1438
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:23,460
I don't blame them super.

1439
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,780
You could feel the vibe in the space.

1440
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:28,060
It was, this was, I would have loved

1441
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:28,900
to have spent more time there.

1442
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:31,180
I think the issue that I had with it was,

1443
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,980
so where Star Trek was a unique experience

1444
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:36,580
that was unlike anything from the films,

1445
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:41,580
this was a chance for you to walk around

1446
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:44,220
and interact and put that in quotes

1447
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:48,380
with scenes that are happening from the first film, right?

1448
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:50,260
That's what's like, that's really what's like,

1449
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:52,820
they have multiple scenes happening simultaneously.

1450
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,380
So it has like a sleep no more vibe.

1451
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:57,860
You can follow one character into another character.

1452
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:00,060
You can go over here and you'll see how they all wind up.

1453
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:03,020
And I actually thought that was a really cool idea.

1454
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,780
The only thing missing for me personally

1455
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,660
was I would have loved to have seen Marty McFly

1456
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:10,420
from Back to the Future 2 skulking around

1457
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:14,340
to be watching some of the things happening.

1458
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,180
But that's a new thing.

1459
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:18,100
And if they're hiring tons of Marty's for this experience,

1460
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,620
then yeah, make one of them just work around

1461
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:23,180
and try to be avoided and not answer your question.

1462
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,020
Maybe they just assume there would be enough people

1463
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,740
dressed as Marty with the hat on.

1464
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:27,740
Right, they'd feel like,

1465
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:29,580
we're so many Marty's in the red vest.

1466
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:30,700
That is a really funny aspect

1467
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,380
that you're trying to keep your eyes peeled

1468
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:34,780
for Marty McFly and then you keep seeing the vest,

1469
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:37,460
there he is, no, there he is, no, that's a woman.

1470
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,580
Like, I think at any given time,

1471
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:42,380
because I watch videos of it and then being there live,

1472
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:44,620
like I think there are 13 Marty vests

1473
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:45,860
and then different Marty modes.

1474
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,180
And I think I saw a leather jacket Marty,

1475
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:50,020
there's a bunch of different docks.

1476
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,580
There's every type, there's a bunch of Jennifers

1477
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:53,420
running around.

1478
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,620
Well, yeah, that's the one costume

1479
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:57,740
that I think a lot of people can put together very quickly.

1480
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:01,860
Like, people may not have a Klingon costume at the ready,

1481
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:05,620
but you can put together a Marty McFly costume pretty easily.

1482
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,780
It definitely felt like Rick and Morty,

1483
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:09,460
like the amount of Rick,

1484
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,180
I mean, Rick and Morty is based on Back to the Future,

1485
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:14,340
but I mean, having multiverse Marty's running around,

1486
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:18,380
like 50 Marty's, like where's Waldo of who the real Marty was?

1487
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,700
Knowing that that's kind of a fulcrum point

1488
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,460
in the space-time continuum,

1489
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:24,540
that's a good way to think about it,

1490
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,380
if I were to do it again,

1491
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:28,180
is that since that's an important date and time,

1492
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:32,140
what if too many Marty's have shown up for too many reasons,

1493
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:35,540
now there are 13 all with different tasks and goals,

1494
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:36,940
bunch of docks too.

1495
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:41,100
I don't like, I'm just not into cosplaying necessarily,

1496
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,980
unless it's for like a show or something,

1497
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,300
but I would be almost like,

1498
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,180
if we go back of next year or whatever,

1499
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,700
I'm like, maybe I dress like Marty too,

1500
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,020
maybe we'll all dress like Marty.

1501
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:49,860
I'm down to dress like Marty.

1502
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,340
Everyone should be Marty.

1503
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:54,140
Well, I do love that, I love Halloween,

1504
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,060
and not Halloween Horror Nights,

1505
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:58,220
but I love the Halloween thing that Disneyland does,

1506
00:51:58,220 --> 00:51:59,420
where you can dress in costume.

1507
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,260
I think it's really fun,

1508
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,820
and I love the idea that people could dress in costume

1509
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:04,900
for this, it felt like it made it a lot more fun.

1510
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:05,940
I will say that,

1511
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:09,460
as you're going on this tram ride down,

1512
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,660
it was the first night that we were there,

1513
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:15,300
we could tell that the tram driver, the announcer,

1514
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,540
was kind of still figuring out the script,

1515
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:21,100
and kept on really imploring us to dance.

1516
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:21,940
You're gonna get down there.

1517
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:23,340
Oh yeah, that got said so many times.

1518
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,180
And you're gonna dance.

1519
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,980
Make sure that you feel the music to dance.

1520
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,740
I was like, I don't wanna dance.

1521
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,460
I also don't feel like,

1522
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:32,860
I don't feel back to the future as a dance thing,

1523
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:33,700
but I think that they were like,

1524
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,820
we have a live band there,

1525
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:36,860
and we wanna make sure it's okay for people

1526
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:38,060
to feel like they can dance,

1527
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:41,940
because that town square gets very crowded very quickly.

1528
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:46,940
They did, again, it's a tight square,

1529
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,060
and they have this,

1530
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,540
I think they messed up two things in my opinion,

1531
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:53,420
which is like, on the left-hand side,

1532
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,660
this very cool thing.

1533
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:56,540
It's the spinning license plate,

1534
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:00,540
and the flames from the tires as the DeLorean is gone,

1535
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,260
but it's going into the movie theater,

1536
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:03,100
which is not there,

1537
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:06,220
it's just a poster of a movie theater.

1538
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,060
And that was awesome.

1539
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,220
It was really cool-looking.

1540
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,220
It's lit so well.

1541
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,180
I've seen multiple people's photos of it,

1542
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,060
all of our photos.

1543
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,700
It looks so great.

1544
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,100
That's such a victory,

1545
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,500
that cool line of flames.

1546
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,980
That was beautifully designed.

1547
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,860
Now, on the other side,

1548
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,580
now again, you only have a certain amount of space.

1549
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,980
The other side, they built,

1550
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:29,380
and this is classic universal,

1551
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:32,060
they built like carnival games.

1552
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:32,900
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1553
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:36,140
Nothing that has ever been in the back of the future.

1554
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:36,980
Everything.

1555
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:37,820
Detailed.

1556
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,180
Again, I know I was nitpicking about the,

1557
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,780
oh, the signs aren't the right, whatever,

1558
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:43,100
but carnival games were never a part

1559
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:44,980
of anything in Back to the Future.

1560
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:48,540
Except in the Old West when he learned

1561
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:49,820
he does a shooting gallery,

1562
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:51,420
and he learned how to do it at 7-Eleven.

1563
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,740
That's the only time. Exactly.

1564
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:53,740
But that's not the 50s.

1565
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:54,700
That's not where we were.

1566
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:57,700
And so they have this carnival game thing set up

1567
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:58,740
to win something,

1568
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:02,420
but that's so tightly packed into a picture,

1569
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,820
a photo op in the DeLorean with Einstein,

1570
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:06,020
not a fake Einstein.

1571
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:07,860
A real dog.

1572
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:08,700
A real dog.

1573
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:09,540
It was there.

1574
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:10,380
They cast Einstein.

1575
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,780
Which is, blew my mind as well.

1576
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:14,260
That dog didn't seem,

1577
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:17,580
that seemed like a wild choice to be like,

1578
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:20,580
we're gonna have a dog here to pose for a lot of photos.

1579
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:23,260
Dogs are comfortable meeting hundreds of people

1580
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,020
at a time in quick succession.

1581
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:27,140
They do it with Max during Grinchmas.

1582
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:29,220
You see, so that's, yeah.

1583
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,060
They have experiences.

1584
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:31,740
But they must have tons of Einsteins.

1585
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,580
There must be a whole bunch of cages back there.

1586
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:34,940
Well, that night they had four Mardys.

1587
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,220
I saw multiple things with different Mardys.

1588
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:39,100
I liked our Mardy a lot.

1589
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:40,220
Our Mardy was good, yes.

1590
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:41,060
Yeah, yeah.

1591
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,420
But that's another one of those Rick and Morty paradise.

1592
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,340
We've entered a world where there's so many Einsteins.

1593
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:45,180
So many Einsteins.

1594
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:46,500
What are they all here to do?

1595
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,900
I would love to see the back.

1596
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:48,740
The kennel is great.

1597
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:49,580
There's a bunch of Einsteins.

1598
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:50,780
Show me the Einstein room.

1599
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:52,260
Like one Einstein doesn't wanna go on.

1600
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,100
He's like feeling.

1601
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,100
I can't do it.

1602
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,140
I don't like this Mardy.

1603
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:56,900
I don't feel the connection to this dog.

1604
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,140
Now the thing was,

1605
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:59,860
I feel like they could have opened up the experiences

1606
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:01,500
a little bit wider,

1607
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,660
because when you walked over to that carnival area,

1608
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:06,220
you immediately got in this.

1609
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,540
It was like carnival,

1610
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:08,940
the only place for food,

1611
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,340
non-themed food,

1612
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,180
which is also odd.

1613
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:13,100
Yeah, eat a regular ice cream bar

1614
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,940
in Hill Valley in 1955.

1615
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:15,780
Yeah, and it's like,

1616
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,740
why are we skimping out on the theming here?

1617
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:19,260
Like just call a biff water.

1618
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,100
Give me something.

1619
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:20,940
Yeah.

1620
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:24,740
And then you have this recreation of Doc Brown's lab,

1621
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:25,780
not his 1950s house,

1622
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,860
but his 1980s house

1623
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,380
with the DeLorean inside.

1624
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:30,660
And that's where Einstein is.

1625
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,900
And isn't there something with all the speakers?

1626
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,460
I missed that entirely.

1627
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,860
Peter from Slash on Post did that.

1628
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:37,700
That's where Einstein was.

1629
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:38,540
The amps blown.

1630
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:39,380
Okay, okay.

1631
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:40,220
So that was,

1632
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:41,040
Einstein was like,

1633
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,380
that was like a little tableau,

1634
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,340
but it was so hard

1635
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,700
because once we got into that area,

1636
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:45,540
like people were like,

1637
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:46,380
come on, move around.

1638
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,660
It's not a,

1639
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:50,020
we got ushered by a universal place,

1640
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:50,860
but it was like,

1641
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:53,940
but you've literally walked us into a dead end

1642
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,900
where there's three major things going on,

1643
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:59,060
including a biff who is harassing people

1644
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,060
at the carnival games.

1645
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,140
That is a good move,

1646
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,300
that he's trying to miss people.

1647
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,140
I like that.

1648
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:03,980
That he yells at people

1649
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:05,340
to get them to mess up

1650
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:06,940
when they're trying to hit the buzzer.

1651
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:07,760
I like that.

1652
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,600
I like that a lot.

1653
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,380
I like that the actors in that were fantastic.

1654
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,500
He was running around yelling at everyone.

1655
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,340
Yes.

1656
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:14,700
And you could really hear him.

1657
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:15,540
I would say we,

1658
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,780
I mean, we'll probably get to it,

1659
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:19,500
but like some microphone issues would be good

1660
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,860
because sometimes you wouldn't be able to hear

1661
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:23,100
certain performers in different places.

1662
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:23,940
It's outdoor.

1663
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,260
And they're getting on the courthouse steps.

1664
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:28,460
And I guess they want the community

1665
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,420
of this gather around

1666
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,900
and gather around and you'll hear it.

1667
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,260
Now, I don't know how you guys feel about this,

1668
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:39,540
but when you arrive,

1669
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,340
you might arrive at the,

1670
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:42,460
it's on a cycle, right?

1671
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,300
It's on a loop.

1672
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,140
Yeah.

1673
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,940
All the way to the end of the first movie.

1674
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,780
We, I think, arrived actually at a great time.

1675
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,740
We arrived at the beginning of the story.

1676
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,500
It's up, but I talked to some people

1677
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,460
who arrived at the end.

1678
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,720
And then you're kind of waiting for it to recycle again.

1679
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,480
I didn't know how you guys felt about that.

1680
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,680
I felt we had a great experience.

1681
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,020
We saw it kind of play out perfectly.

1682
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:02,860
It turned out really well.

1683
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,980
I almost didn't realize the extent

1684
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:08,340
to which the events of the film would start playing out.

1685
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:10,740
I do have the nerdy objection of,

1686
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:13,660
they tell you, you watch a video on the way down

1687
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:16,900
with a fake Doc Brown,

1688
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,140
something that we've always enjoyed,

1689
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,660
a guy playing Doc who is not Christopher Lloyd.

1690
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:23,540
And I will ding the one thing about that

1691
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,500
is his background, clearly CGI,

1692
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:30,020
he's in front of giant satellite dishes

1693
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:31,260
from the movie Contact.

1694
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,340
I'm like, well, this is, why would he ever be here?

1695
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:38,020
Just put him in the backdrop of his lab.

1696
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:39,980
Why are we putting him outside

1697
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,980
in front of satellite dishes?

1698
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:44,620
Those little choices are like, what?

1699
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:47,860
You know me, my famous experiments with satellites,

1700
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:50,020
with time travel satellites.

1701
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:54,380
You built it on the, just put him in front of a clock.

1702
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:56,100
Give me something.

1703
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,460
Oh yeah, wait, they've recreated his lab.

1704
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,180
Why don't you film him in his lab?

1705
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:03,020
There's, and I believe the guy we saw on the tram,

1706
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:05,980
we happened to get the, I think it was the same guy.

1707
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:07,060
I think that night, I think.

1708
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:08,940
Oh, who was running around the actor who was running around.

1709
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:11,980
But anyway, that was like, I was a little like,

1710
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,700
what the, like that's where I feel like

1711
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:14,540
there are certain,

1712
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:16,580
and because they clearly own all the footage.

1713
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:17,420
They do everything.

1714
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,220
They can even take a screen grab of the backdrop

1715
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,100
and just have him stand in front of it.

1716
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:21,940
Like it doesn't.

1717
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:24,140
Yes, something recognizable from the movie.

1718
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:25,420
It is a lot of weird little nitpicks.

1719
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:28,380
Also the fact that like, how are we getting to the past?

1720
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,740
We were bemoaning the fact that they,

1721
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,900
why don't they just call it a time tram?

1722
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,660
Yeah, we're on the time tram.

1723
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:34,580
We'd be so excited.

1724
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:37,500
We'd be saying time tram nonstop this whole episode.

1725
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:40,380
And all you need is like, they go,

1726
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:43,940
this time tram, there's some, and again, I get it.

1727
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,580
I love this part.

1728
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:48,500
But it's simple, like these are the little tweaks

1729
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,260
that also feel like it's a first year thing.

1730
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,740
It feels like we're trying to figure it out.

1731
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:54,100
But they're like, the time tram travels so fast.

1732
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,180
You don't even realize that you've time traveled.

1733
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:58,460
You know what, give me two strobes.

1734
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:01,540
We'll walk by and go, this give me like a little strobe

1735
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:02,660
pass as we're driving by.

1736
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:03,500
Oh, that's right.

1737
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:06,740
Right when you pass by the big mannequin of Ted,

1738
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:08,980
right after Ted just flashed some lights at us.

1739
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:11,460
Ted should have like some like weapon,

1740
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,500
kind of like a time travel weapon

1741
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,940
that shoots a light at the tram as you go by him on the lot.

1742
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:18,420
And then you travel like right,

1743
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:20,540
it's pretty close to where you end up off.

1744
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:21,380
Make Ted part of it.

1745
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:23,340
We know, we know already that Doc Brown

1746
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:26,220
is part of the Seth MacFarlane universe

1747
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:27,620
because of the, he appears in the Western.

1748
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:28,780
What's that called again?

1749
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:30,660
Once Upon a Time in, or the West.

1750
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,540
A Million Ways to Die in the West.

1751
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:34,300
How the West was horny or something.

1752
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,100
I don't remember what it was called.

1753
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:36,980
But Doc Brown's in it.

1754
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:39,500
So Doc Brown's allowed to be in Seth MacFarlane things.

1755
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,420
Yeah, have Ted do it.

1756
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:43,460
It just felt like that was, again, we're time traveling.

1757
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:46,220
And one of the coolest things about this movie is

1758
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:50,100
that when you're in the car, the lightning, your time.

1759
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,180
So we are not getting that experience.

1760
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:53,900
Now meanwhile, we get that experience in Star Trek

1761
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:57,300
when you're on, we get the, we fly in

1762
00:59:57,980 --> 00:59:59,620
and we get the warp speed, we get the turbo lift feel.

1763
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:03,100
They give you a little mist, which at least, you know, works.

1764
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:03,940
Yeah, yeah.

1765
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:04,780
Like to kind of.

1766
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:05,620
No, that was super cool.

1767
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:08,580
If you go through mist, you do transform or you.

1768
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:10,740
I like a mist, hell yeah.

1769
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,020
It's something very cool in Epic Universe.

1770
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:15,580
You got a great light and a great mist coming your way

1771
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:17,420
over in the Potter zone, yeah.

1772
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:20,980
It's the best light slash mist thing I've ever seen.

1773
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:23,500
Yeah, very good mist in Epic Universe.

1774
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,020
And then, you know, just push through that.

1775
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:27,100
But we're in Hill Valley, it's awesome.

1776
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:31,180
It's not exactly right, but then I think, look,

1777
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:33,100
we need to be brought in as advisors on this

1778
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:36,060
because I think where we're pitching here is not even.

1779
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:37,180
Right, that's expensive.

1780
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:38,020
Yeah, we're.

1781
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:39,580
No, it's the littlest tweaks

1782
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:40,940
that would just like tie it all together

1783
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:43,540
because everything, there's a lot that is great here.

1784
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:44,620
Performers especially.

1785
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:45,460
The band is great.

1786
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:47,820
They're doing the Enchantment of the Sea dance, great.

1787
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,260
Yeah, absolutely.

1788
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:51,340
And the way it all times out where like a character

1789
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:53,740
might be talking to you and then on stage

1790
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:55,380
at the perfect time a minute later

1791
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,260
to make story points happen.

1792
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,900
But if you're gonna call it fan night,

1793
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,260
here's a place to come and like geek out

1794
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:03,620
about a property you love.

1795
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:05,660
Why are you gonna tell me on the way down

1796
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:06,780
that you're going to the night

1797
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:09,940
where Doc discovered the flux capacitor,

1798
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:12,700
but then you get there and it's all the events

1799
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:15,460
of the night that Marty traveled back to the future.

1800
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:16,820
Those are different nights.

1801
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:19,340
Why would this Under the Sea dance be going on on that?

1802
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:21,140
That's not, it's when Doc bumps his head

1803
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:22,740
and gets the cash.

1804
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:25,020
But when you first meet Doc or when we first met Doc,

1805
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:27,260
he just said this morning he came up with,

1806
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:28,620
he fell off the toilet.

1807
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:30,300
But then the movie kind of progresses.

1808
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:31,140
I know.

1809
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:33,260
These are like, they're like six days apart, aren't they?

1810
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:34,660
It's not very far apart, is it?

1811
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:35,500
I don't think so.

1812
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:38,140
It's like it's enough time to give Marty time

1813
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:39,940
to like hang out and have to get his parents together.

1814
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:41,700
As a nerd, I would have liked to,

1815
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,580
it's seen the recreation of the table

1816
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:45,940
made of like the exact replica of the town square

1817
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:48,340
where like Doc does his like.

1818
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:50,740
Oh yes, oh if he had had some weird,

1819
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,900
like if his, oh that's one missing thing.

1820
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,660
If his like little workshop had been something

1821
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,140
that you could check out.

1822
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:56,980
Yeah, just look at it.

1823
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:57,820
And then Lorraine comes in

1824
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:58,660
and they have to cover it up really fast

1825
01:01:58,660 --> 01:01:59,500
and you have to help cover up.

1826
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:02,180
Yeah, because the DeLorean is nowhere to be seen.

1827
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:04,660
I mean, there's a photo op DeLorean,

1828
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:07,100
but like the whole thing culminates

1829
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,060
and obviously to Marty going back to the future.

1830
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:10,820
And the way they kind of do that

1831
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:12,380
is everything is being acted out

1832
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:15,300
until the final back to the future moment

1833
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:18,300
where it is then projected on the clock tower.

1834
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:19,300
Very cool.

1835
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:20,820
They recreate the lightning from that moment.

1836
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:21,940
That was awesome.

1837
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:24,140
That felt like amazing.

1838
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,740
And then culminating in when lightning strikes,

1839
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:29,460
they represent that with the firework going off.

1840
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,300
Very cool.

1841
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:31,140
From the courthouse.

1842
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:31,980
Yes, which I don't think anybody expected.

1843
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,460
I don't think we saw it coming.

1844
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:35,660
I've read get there before midnight

1845
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:37,300
because past midnight for neighbors,

1846
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:38,940
they are not allowed to do it.

1847
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:40,940
So do it, do it first thing you go.

1848
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:43,460
Which by the way, this is going between now and May 18th

1849
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:45,700
if you're in Los Angeles, you're gonna be in Los Angeles.

1850
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:47,020
Yeah, get to the fan fest.

1851
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:49,180
And wanna check it out, which I do recommend.

1852
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:51,140
Despite all of these, nitpick, nitpick, nitpick,

1853
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:51,980
I had a great time.

1854
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:54,100
No, this is awesome.

1855
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:57,540
I will say the other thing that made me slightly

1856
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:02,540
uncomfortable was seeing them play out

1857
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:05,540
the Biff sexual assault scene.

1858
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:07,380
That is, it's an interesting moment

1859
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:09,740
because everyone's got their cameras out.

1860
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:10,900
Oh, now everyone's filming it.

1861
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:14,660
Yeah, and you're watching this great moment of George,

1862
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,340
hey, you get your damn hands off her.

1863
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:18,820
And then Marty is like with us in the crowd going like,

1864
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:19,660
yes, yes.

1865
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:21,980
And we were watching Marty while Biff

1866
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:23,260
and while that interaction is happening,

1867
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:24,220
he's like looking at the picture,

1868
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:26,540
like he's fully in it acting.

1869
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:27,980
Like, yes, okay, this is great.

1870
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:29,860
I'm gonna go in and I'm gonna play the music.

1871
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:32,340
But it was funny to watch that moment,

1872
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:33,820
which is a great moment in the movie,

1873
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:35,260
but it is funny to be like,

1874
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,060
we're supposed to be interacting here, but.

1875
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:40,380
They told us to dance,

1876
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:42,980
but they didn't tell us to stop any assault.

1877
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:44,220
We should all be getting involved.

1878
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,020
We should probably, each and every one of them.

1879
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:48,140
And that's a fan dream we've all had, I think,

1880
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:51,100
is to prevent that particular famous movie assault.

1881
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:51,940
Yeah, yeah.

1882
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,180
100 people all at once.

1883
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:57,180
Hey, you, get your damn hands off.

1884
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:58,140
And that's what I was missing.

1885
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:03,140
I do want, and I feel like this is all a great baseline

1886
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:04,740
of where we could do it.

1887
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:07,140
But I would love to have had some more,

1888
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:13,580
we were watching, again, we were watching a show.

1889
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:15,380
And yes, I think you could interact with them.

1890
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:17,060
And I felt like we did.

1891
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:20,780
We interacted with Gordy Wilson, the earlier.

1892
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:21,620
Goldie.

1893
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:24,700
Sorry, Goldie Wilson, who is gonna be the next mayor.

1894
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:25,540
And he was great,

1895
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:27,620
because he doesn't really have to do anything

1896
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:29,420
in the story of Back to the Future.

1897
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:30,260
No.

1898
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:31,100
But just walk around and be like, mayor.

1899
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:32,420
He directs Trav, he tells you about some things.

1900
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:33,260
Yeah.

1901
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:35,260
And I was like, maybe I should ask if there's food anywhere,

1902
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:36,340
because he's dressed like a,

1903
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:38,820
this was some of my situation,

1904
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:40,820
is like, okay, go talk to these characters,

1905
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:41,660
and I know who he is,

1906
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:43,060
and I know he's gonna be the mayor.

1907
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:45,100
But the people ahead of me had already spoiled.

1908
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:45,940
They'd just done the thing of,

1909
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:48,020
are you interested in politics at all?

1910
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:49,380
Oh yeah, mayor.

1911
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:51,420
You're obviously just trying to set him up to say it,

1912
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:54,380
which the actor said, great, it's just like in the movie.

1913
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:55,220
Yeah.

1914
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:57,860
But then I'm like, why am I talking to this guy

1915
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:00,740
who cleans up counters at a, like in story,

1916
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:02,260
there has to be a reason I can talk,

1917
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:03,100
I wanna talk to him.

1918
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:03,940
Because he's just walking around town,

1919
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:04,900
so he's not even in front.

1920
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:08,020
Like again, it is a crucial part of the story,

1921
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:09,700
like a lot takes place in that shop.

1922
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:12,140
That's not there, that shop is not there.

1923
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:12,980
Yeah.

1924
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:16,460
And so he's just wandering around in his outfit,

1925
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:20,260
out and about on this night of insanity, I guess.

1926
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:21,180
Yes, yeah, yeah.

1927
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:25,860
They also made an odd choice of giving Biff a friend

1928
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:28,460
that was not dressed like any of his gang.

1929
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:31,220
Like give me the 3D glasses, give me Casey Sermansko.

1930
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:33,420
Billy Zane, Zane, Zane.

1931
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:38,420
Yeah, I mean, they gave Biff a guy in a yellow cardigan.

1932
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:44,860
That was not, that's not a recognizable character

1933
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:47,620
from the movie, in my opinion.

1934
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:50,460
Yes, he seemed, he had a fun, lackey energy.

1935
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:51,820
Because you're nearby, it happened,

1936
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,900
and you get to watch them break up.

1937
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:56,580
You get to watch him be fired as a lackey,

1938
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:58,700
and that's a fun moment to get to see.

1939
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:03,580
Now, the highlight of it all for me, for sure,

1940
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:08,580
was we're gathering to watch Marvin Barry,

1941
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:11,820
and so the set is beginning,

1942
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:13,500
the set that we know is gonna culminate

1943
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,820
in Marty joining for Johnny B. Goode,

1944
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:17,660
but I'm just trying to enjoy some good old-fashioned

1945
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:20,420
rock and roll music, and then who should get in my face

1946
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:23,140
with mean old Principal Strickland?

1947
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:23,980
Yes, that was intense.

1948
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,260
And he just, he chose me, out of nowhere,

1949
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:29,140
he just rounded, like I had no prep

1950
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:30,900
to be talking to Strickland,

1951
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,780
and then he was just right in my face,

1952
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:36,380
uncomfortably in my face, post-COVID uncomfortably.

1953
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:39,100
But you stood up to him, you went, you approached,

1954
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:42,020
as you approached Goldie Wilson with a lot of care,

1955
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:47,020
you approached Principal Strickland as really combative.

1956
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:47,860
Thank you, thank you.

1957
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:50,020
You were like in a David Mamet play with him or something,

1958
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:51,740
and the intensity of both performers,

1959
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:53,100
we haven't un-videotied each other.

1960
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:53,940
Yeah, I guess we had a close-up.

1961
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:54,780
You're like, I want rock and roll.

1962
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:56,180
You were fighting for rock and roll.

1963
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,020
Rock and roll.

1964
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:58,060
Right, and I appreciated that.

1965
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:00,220
Yes, I think I unlocked my inner mic.

1966
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:02,700
I was fighting for, and I was a little embarrassed.

1967
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:03,900
I'll just get ahead of it by something

1968
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,340
that I ended up saying to him.

1969
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:06,500
When you're just in the moment,

1970
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,860
and you're talking to an iconic movie character,

1971
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:10,620
so you're not thinking about what you're saying,

1972
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:13,100
and I think he's saying that rock and roll

1973
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:15,460
is for no good-niks, and I said,

1974
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:17,700
no, rock and roll is an amazing art form.

1975
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:21,180
Rock and roll is the new wave, is what I said to him,

1976
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:22,700
and then later I'm like, oh, good,

1977
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:24,140
and you're gonna wanna post that clip.

1978
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,340
Here I am saying rock and roll is the new wave.

1979
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:27,780
But I felt like that was your character.

1980
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:29,180
I felt like your character was trying to say.

1981
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:31,300
Sure, sure, not just me.

1982
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,500
You were being respectful to character.

1983
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:34,700
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

1984
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:36,420
Well, yeah, I guess I found a character in that moment

1985
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:39,260
who cares about the music, and who knows the good.

1986
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:40,100
We were told.

1987
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:41,980
Rock and roll ends up doing over the,

1988
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,380
I've seen all the many,

1989
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:45,420
Strickland doesn't know about Live Aid.

1990
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:46,260
No.

1991
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,100
No, no, no.

1992
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,860
How rock and roll has healed our planet.

1993
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:51,900
Hard Rock Cafe, how much good it's done for the rainforest.

1994
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:53,140
I had to fight for all that.

1995
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:54,700
Strickland has no idea what's coming.

1996
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,900
Well, we were told explicitly to,

1997
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,540
these people don't know about Instagram.

1998
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:00,020
They only have three tells.

1999
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:02,220
There were good written jokes, I feel,

2000
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:05,100
I don't remember any of them, but to these people,

2001
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:06,580
TikTok is the sound of a clock.

2002
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:07,420
Right, yeah.

2003
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:09,660
Now, I will say that, again,

2004
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:11,780
these are these small details that I'm like,

2005
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:13,380
who's minding the mint here?

2006
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:16,940
Because he's like, the shows that they're watching are,

2007
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:19,740
and they list these shows, but famously,

2008
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:21,940
the show that is a part of Back to the Future

2009
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:23,100
is The Honeymooners.

2010
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:23,940
Oh, that's right.

2011
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:24,780
They don't say The Honeymooners.

2012
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:25,620
Right, yeah, yeah.

2013
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:28,220
Like, he references to other shows, and I'm like,

2014
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:29,060
but we,

2015
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:29,900
Dragnet.

2016
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:31,620
Why are we, yeah, why are we not referencing

2017
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:34,940
the thing that is a plot point of the movie?

2018
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:36,860
He said Jack Benny program.

2019
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:39,420
I was trying to think, like, is The Honeymooners, like,

2020
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:42,860
owned by CBS, or not CBS, like ABC?

2021
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:45,300
Is there a, they aren't allowed to say that.

2022
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:46,500
Is there something, I don't know.

2023
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,300
I think that might be, well, certainly why,

2024
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:49,820
there's no Lucy mentions.

2025
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:51,540
And if Jason had been with us, he would have said,

2026
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:54,140
yeah, I'm, we watch these things today.

2027
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:57,300
This is what I, I watch the Dumont Network every night.

2028
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,220
Well, how is this different?

2029
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:00,380
Exactly, yeah, so I wonder if that's,

2030
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:01,940
I'm always curious about these events,

2031
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:04,180
like, if you would get the real shit of like,

2032
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:05,300
yeah, we couldn't say Honeymooners.

2033
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:07,740
I know, and that, I think that there is some sort of,

2034
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:10,500
but again, like, I think you can say these words.

2035
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,780
You would think you could say them.

2036
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:14,180
But there's somebody who's probably, yeah.

2037
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:16,660
I think my Googling will either help me discover that,

2038
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:18,980
okay, yes, I was gonna say, all right, CBS does own it,

2039
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:21,060
so I think that was a good guess that might be why.

2040
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:23,900
But I was hoping that from Googling, so.

2041
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,460
Oh, but they are, they did,

2042
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:27,020
so when they made a deal with Star Trek,

2043
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:28,620
they should have made a deal to be allowed to say

2044
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:30,540
Honeymooners on the tram tour.

2045
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:31,380
Yeah, they should have thought of that as.

2046
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:32,220
That should have been in there.

2047
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:33,700
That should have been in the contract.

2048
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,340
I will say the ending, like we said,

2049
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:38,100
was a great ending, a really fun way to see it done,

2050
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:40,260
because obviously, look, if I had my dreaders,

2051
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:42,740
I would love to see a Waterworld kind of style car

2052
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:44,020
driving down that street.

2053
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:45,420
Obviously, you can't do that.

2054
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:48,620
The fire in the street seemed like there was a lot

2055
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:50,300
of security around that fire in the street.

2056
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:51,740
A lot of people walking around there,

2057
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:52,580
there's fire people out there,

2058
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:55,180
be like, don't get anywhere near this fire.

2059
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:59,580
But I think we all agreed that the one big plus up

2060
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:03,220
would be to have a stump person, a la Tinkerbell,

2061
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:04,740
from the top of the clock tower.

2062
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:05,580
Sure, yeah.

2063
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:08,060
Shoot down on a little.

2064
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:09,140
It's much better than Tinkerbell.

2065
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:10,140
That'd be amazing to watch a guy.

2066
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:13,660
And it would have still worked perfectly for the moment,

2067
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:15,180
because it's such an iconic moment,

2068
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:16,660
and I feel like it would be,

2069
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:18,540
it would just go from roof to roof.

2070
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:20,260
Just go to, we don't even have to see land.

2071
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:21,100
Just go roof to roof.

2072
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:22,980
Oh, and then somebody, yes, and then somebody runs down

2073
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:24,860
until like more of a face actor comes down,

2074
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:25,700
tests himself on.

2075
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:27,180
Well, send a dummy down.

2076
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:28,460
100%, yeah. I would love that.

2077
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:29,820
Yes, please, dummies.

2078
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:32,180
They have those Spider-Man things now that they do.

2079
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:33,020
Yeah, it's like just Stuntronic or whatever.

2080
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,980
Oh yeah, just throw a simple Stuntronic.

2081
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:37,460
Just throw a Stuntronic around.

2082
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,300
I mean, overall, I really enjoy,

2083
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:41,100
and getting to stay there for a while,

2084
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:43,140
to be immersed in it, despite all these details,

2085
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:44,660
and of all of the,

2086
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:46,820
because I didn't want to wait in the lines

2087
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:48,460
to do the photo ops and everything,

2088
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:50,500
but that I ended up with,

2089
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:53,620
of all the things, that I have a detention slip

2090
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:54,460
written for me.

2091
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:55,300
It was pretty great.

2092
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:56,140
By Strickland.

2093
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:57,900
I'm gonna keep that in my wallet

2094
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,100
for as long as it'll hold,

2095
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:00,660
and then checking it later,

2096
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:04,100
like 3 p.m. Scott Strickland.

2097
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:05,740
And my wife was very impressed by that.

2098
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:06,860
She was like, what was this thing?

2099
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,500
I was like, let me show you how not dumb this was.

2100
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:12,340
I have a Strickland detention slip in my pocket.

2101
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:14,940
And that to me was the thing that,

2102
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:16,740
the Goldie Wilson and Strickland moments

2103
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:17,660
were actually really fun,

2104
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:20,260
because I feel like what I liked about that was

2105
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:22,460
the thing was alive around us.

2106
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:24,860
And I feel like I would like to have seen

2107
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:26,980
even a little bit more of that,

2108
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:28,580
because the main actors,

2109
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:32,020
Doc, Marty, Lorraine, and Biff,

2110
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:35,900
they have to be at certain places at certain times.

2111
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:38,860
They're telling a story that is on a loop.

2112
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:42,020
A couple more side characters around

2113
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:43,260
for these interactions, I think,

2114
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:46,540
would even be a little plus up.

2115
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:49,100
Just a little, because it's fun.

2116
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:49,940
I think I talked to a lot of people

2117
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:51,460
who spent a long time there,

2118
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:52,300
like two hours.

2119
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:56,500
It was a great, that was A plus, A plus.

2120
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:57,860
I mean, nitpicks put aside.

2121
01:11:57,860 --> 01:12:00,420
Yeah, if you could have gotten a hamburger

2122
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:02,780
and a beer and hung out even,

2123
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:04,900
it would have been even better.

2124
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:06,820
But it's like, that's what I want from

2125
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:08,420
the Back to the Future template

2126
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:11,900
is what I want from almost all the immersive things.

2127
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:15,820
Star Wars, you want just a loop of all the movies

2128
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:18,540
character-wise going on in Galaxy's Edge.

2129
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,420
Doesn't matter that they don't take place in Batuu.

2130
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:22,300
I don't give a shit about it.

2131
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:25,060
It's just Luke, he's looking for Aunt Beru and Uncle Owen.

2132
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:25,900
Doesn't matter.

2133
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:26,740
Look, they've already decided,

2134
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:28,340
the new movies decided that the same things

2135
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:30,020
happen over and over in Star Wars.

2136
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:31,100
Just make it happen.

2137
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:32,620
Just have it happen here on Batuu.

2138
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:33,900
That's totally fine.

2139
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,220
We'll complain about it for 90 minutes

2140
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:38,820
because we got the shit to fill in a podcast.

2141
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:39,660
That's right.

2142
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:41,500
Doesn't mean we won't go over and over again.

2143
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:44,140
And again, the iconic location is a big deal.

2144
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,580
I think what you want is just,

2145
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:48,860
I think it's really fulfilling.

2146
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:50,380
We didn't get to interact with

2147
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:52,860
any characters in Star Trek.

2148
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:54,140
They're moving you through.

2149
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:59,140
Very good actors, fun experience, all for it, aces.

2150
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,380
This is really fun because I felt like

2151
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:03,060
they really wanted you to interact

2152
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:05,460
with the characters, but because they're on a timeline,

2153
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:06,300
it's hard.

2154
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:09,060
So I found when watching the Marty character

2155
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,620
that we had who was great,

2156
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,020
he does have to be like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2157
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:13,740
Okay, but I got a thing.

2158
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:14,580
I gotta get over.

2159
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:15,420
Oh, sure.

2160
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:16,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, very busy.

2161
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:18,060
Whereas Strickland, I got a second with.

2162
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,900
The goal, I feel like a lot of people were having.

2163
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:21,100
Strickland has no plot points.

2164
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,260
He had one cue to meet, which I was really impressed.

2165
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:25,180
Oh my God, he was just in my face.

2166
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:27,100
And now he's up here scolding Marty

2167
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:29,420
for playing a solo that was too darn loud.

2168
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:30,260
Yeah.

2169
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:31,100
Which is also not- It is really

2170
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:32,020
cleverly blocked out.

2171
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:34,380
Not from that part of the movie.

2172
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:35,220
Oh, that's true, yes.

2173
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:36,060
It's messed in there.

2174
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:40,100
He has to be Huey Lewis and Strickland at the same time.

2175
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:42,020
It was fascinating because you know how like,

2176
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:44,340
there's concepts that are tried to,

2177
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:45,660
I've read about, you know, like,

2178
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:47,660
if you were able to see space time,

2179
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:49,140
if you were able to remove yourself

2180
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:51,380
and see time and space all as one,

2181
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:52,940
it would look like a single line.

2182
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:55,220
It's almost like we were seeing Back to the Future

2183
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:57,260
removed from linear time.

2184
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:58,220
Oh, yeah.

2185
01:13:58,220 --> 01:13:59,900
Which I kind of found fascinating.

2186
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:01,980
Like you were just seeing all of it happening at once

2187
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:03,700
which is kind of how our lives would look

2188
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:05,820
if you could see them from a certain vantage point.

2189
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:07,820
Especially with a time travel movie,

2190
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:09,540
I found that very fascinating that like,

2191
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:11,460
everything is like folding in on itself

2192
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:13,460
and we're seeing it and we can experience it

2193
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:14,940
in different ways and you could experience

2194
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:17,740
the same timeline in an hour differently

2195
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:19,300
than you did before.

2196
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:21,420
It was very, it's kind of a mind-boggling thing, yeah.

2197
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:23,180
And the fact that they were even switching Marty

2198
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:26,140
so you would get there and maybe see one loop end

2199
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:28,580
and a new Marty begin is kind of crazy too.

2200
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:30,100
Right, because that's a multiversal.

2201
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:30,940
Yeah.

2202
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:33,140
You would see a different Scott who loves haunts.

2203
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:35,300
You would see different things and slightly different

2204
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:36,780
or it's almost exactly the same

2205
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:38,660
and it's like you just have a slightly different haircut.

2206
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:39,500
Who knows?

2207
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:40,340
I loved it.

2208
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:42,460
I think it should expand a little bit.

2209
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:44,340
If they bring that back as a kid,

2210
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:45,180
that would be the number one.

2211
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:47,260
Like these are the rides that I wanted

2212
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:48,900
that I never got as a kid, right?

2213
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:51,540
Like I wanted, like if this was a thing,

2214
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:52,540
this should always be a thing.

2215
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:56,020
And I feel like if universal was smart,

2216
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:57,260
they should keep this.

2217
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:59,020
As long as there's nothing shooting on that line.

2218
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:01,220
And I think if the rumors are true

2219
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:04,180
and the little hill valleys are going up across the globe

2220
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:05,740
and universal parks all around,

2221
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:07,300
this is a strong rumored thing.

2222
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:09,300
And if they're testing the waters for that,

2223
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:12,980
that like, because we can't do that ride again.

2224
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:17,420
We can't go to 2015 and have the video with Doc and Biff.

2225
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:21,420
So like just section off an entire other part of

2226
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:24,140
Back to the Future and interact with 50s characters.

2227
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:25,060
And it's a cool idea.

2228
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:25,900
It's just a cool thing to do.

2229
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:28,100
But by the way, in VR, I have done that

2230
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:28,940
Back to the Future ride.

2231
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:30,300
They have that ride in VR now.

2232
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,820
You can do, it's great.

2233
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:34,820
You can actually even put that,

2234
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:37,100
give everybody a headset, put them in their room.

2235
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,900
This is the, you've made the strongest sell

2236
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,460
for me to get a headset, finally.

2237
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:43,300
Yeah, you get to go on old rides

2238
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:45,620
with old outmoded technology.

2239
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:47,780
Because it's like all that stuff is built

2240
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:49,140
for that kind of perspective.

2241
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:50,620
It's kind of great.

2242
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:52,660
Let's touch a little before we wrap up

2243
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:54,380
on Dungeons & Dragons.

2244
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:57,100
Which was, we were told was the highlight of the night.

2245
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:59,940
Some people had really dinged that as being like,

2246
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:00,940
that's the one to see.

2247
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:02,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2248
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:04,580
Which I felt, I don't know if it was just

2249
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:09,060
the quickly downed Isla Nublar IPAs talking.

2250
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:12,300
We had to chug a beer because of the waiting in line.

2251
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:15,740
What a nice thing of all to be my favorite beer to chug.

2252
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:18,500
And then having that kind of hit and then be,

2253
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:21,100
first of all, told by you that maybe,

2254
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:22,060
I think this is gonna be scarce.

2255
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:22,900
I think you're gonna be scared.

2256
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:25,940
And I told you, I'm betting it will be.

2257
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:26,780
And it was not.

2258
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:29,300
So the relief of that hitting me.

2259
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:31,820
And then also, I'm just getting a little floaty

2260
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,820
while I'm being ushered from room to room

2261
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:36,100
where I don't understand what the hell is going on.

2262
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:37,620
I sort of love it.

2263
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:39,180
Couldn't tell you anything that happened

2264
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:40,300
in Dungeons & Dragons.

2265
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:42,820
I was paying 100% attention.

2266
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:45,180
Part of that was due to the lack of microphones.

2267
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:48,820
Some sound bleed happening from the other things.

2268
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:50,140
Oh yeah, yes, from room to room.

2269
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:51,820
But I truly don't care.

2270
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:52,940
I liked that I didn't know.

2271
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:54,220
I'm just like, oh, this now.

2272
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:55,580
Oh, what, this now?

2273
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:57,540
I felt so dumb, but I loved it.

2274
01:16:57,540 --> 01:17:00,220
There was one part where they said a bunch of stuff.

2275
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:02,820
Somebody said, okay, your mission is clear.

2276
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:05,780
And then three things I didn't understand remotely.

2277
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:08,460
Well, this is, so the,

2278
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:10,580
I would say of all,

2279
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:12,820
Back to the Future is a different beast, right?

2280
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:14,860
Because Back to the Future is literally

2281
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:18,420
an area in Universal Studios where they shot the movie.

2282
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:19,700
You can't beat that.

2283
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:20,700
But the props and stuff,

2284
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:22,420
I think we thought a little lackluster.

2285
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:24,220
Star Trek, pretty good.

2286
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:27,220
But also, moments where you're like,

2287
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:28,500
okay, it could maybe be better,

2288
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,340
but it was definitely high quality.

2289
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:31,820
Generic enterprise, good enterprise,

2290
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:33,220
but generic enterprise.

2291
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:34,660
Right, and certain parts.

2292
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:38,300
This T2B, great design.

2293
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:41,340
Fully, beautifully worked out, thought out,

2294
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:45,140
looked like they spent a lot of money

2295
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:46,500
on whatever this was.

2296
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,940
Yes, I have a little bit of factoid

2297
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:51,660
that was told to me that VIP guides tell people

2298
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:52,740
when they're in this.

2299
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:55,180
Some of the trees in this experience

2300
01:17:55,180 --> 01:17:57,220
are from the E.T. Adventure.

2301
01:17:57,220 --> 01:17:58,820
What are you talking about?

2302
01:17:58,820 --> 01:17:59,660
What?

2303
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:00,500
What?

2304
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:01,340
I don't know which one specifically.

2305
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:03,180
Now it's a true fan festival.

2306
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:04,580
The thing I'm the biggest fan of.

2307
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:05,860
Those were the old trees.

2308
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:07,580
I mean, by the way, I love those trees.

2309
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:08,700
The way you walk through the forest

2310
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:09,700
and smell the pine like that.

2311
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:11,180
They still have the trees

2312
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:13,620
and we were seeing them and we didn't even know.

2313
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:15,180
Why aren't they out somewhere all the time?

2314
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:16,380
Well, get mummy out of there.

2315
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:17,220
Put it back in.

2316
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:18,860
Just put the trees in.

2317
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:20,500
Supposedly the trees sometimes are used

2318
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,340
in the Horror Nights mazes.

2319
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:24,820
Apparently these are trees that are maybe often used.

2320
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:25,660
I love that these trees are out.

2321
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:27,700
You've sent me straight to watching

2322
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:29,420
a ride through of this again,

2323
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:31,580
just to see a purely tree spot.

2324
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:32,420
A walk through.

2325
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:34,460
Thank you, Scott.

2326
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:37,100
Thank you, Mike.

2327
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:38,500
Now I will say.

2328
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:40,860
Oh, thank you, friend.

2329
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:44,540
This is, again, I am,

2330
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:45,700
first of all, I love this.

2331
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:48,020
I love that we are catering.

2332
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:49,540
I think that people are trying to figure out

2333
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:50,740
how to make theme parks.

2334
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:53,660
As magical as they were for us

2335
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:55,700
and we went and continued to be,

2336
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:58,300
but try to get people in, try to do new things.

2337
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:00,180
I felt like each one of these experiences

2338
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:01,820
had something that I really, really liked,

2339
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:04,220
but it was almost like every experience had

2340
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:06,060
two of three things, but it's like,

2341
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:09,780
oh, but one would, this one, we walk in

2342
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:12,460
and you are in these different spots.

2343
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:13,660
You're wizards.

2344
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:17,780
You are knights and you're clerics.

2345
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:20,060
You happen to be a cleric when you could be a wizard?

2346
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:21,180
We all got wizards.

2347
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:22,020
We all got wizards.

2348
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:23,820
We were the only three in the wizard spot.

2349
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:27,660
But it played no part in our story,

2350
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:31,140
nor what we had to do, nor was it ever referenced again.

2351
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:34,660
It was like, and that was the thing that I'm like,

2352
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:36,260
well, why go out of the way to say

2353
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:38,300
that we're in the spot of the wizards

2354
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:41,340
and we're on our block, that's the wizard block,

2355
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:43,940
and then they keep on going, well, come with us.

2356
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:45,460
And you think, oh, okay, well, the wizards

2357
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:46,820
are going in this one room

2358
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:48,660
and the clerics are going in the other room.

2359
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:51,660
But no, it's just two doors that open to the same room.

2360
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:53,540
So some people on the left-hand side,

2361
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:54,420
some people are on the right,

2362
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:57,740
and there's no difference because the performance

2363
01:19:57,740 --> 01:19:58,580
is in the middle.

2364
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:02,300
By the way, I love this.

2365
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:03,660
Don't know what happened in it,

2366
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:05,980
but I felt like we're walking this line.

2367
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:09,380
I'm like, I wanna, you're so close to giving me,

2368
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:10,660
all right, all the wizards.

2369
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:13,380
I would even go for, all the wizards go, yay.

2370
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:14,900
All the clerics go, ooh.

2371
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:15,740
Give me just something where I feel like.

2372
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:18,420
All the rogues in the house say, hey.

2373
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:21,540
That's what I think was missing in all of these things

2374
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:26,540
is just the slightest bit of audience participation.

2375
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:28,580
And it didn't have to be big.

2376
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:29,860
I don't need you to give me a sword

2377
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:31,740
and run out to fight things,

2378
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:34,500
but just give me a vocalization.

2379
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:35,740
Give me something like, you did it.

2380
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:38,180
Your world opened up because you said something.

2381
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:39,020
I was like, oh, I don't care.

2382
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:41,900
You can just remember your color and point to it.

2383
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:42,740
Sure.

2384
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:44,620
Truly, there was not a thing. Medieval time style.

2385
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:46,060
Yeah, yeah.

2386
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:48,980
I mean, there's these nitpicks with all of these things,

2387
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:51,860
but don't you feel like this could all be

2388
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:53,620
super solved next year,

2389
01:20:53,620 --> 01:20:55,740
and this could be a hell of an event.

2390
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:56,580
I think it already is.

2391
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:58,180
I think it's off to a great start.

2392
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:01,180
I could just see a little bit more kinks get worked out,

2393
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:03,140
and then this becomes a, you have to.

2394
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:04,820
There's a whole new way to see

2395
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:07,260
Universal Studios killer. I like a soft launch of this.

2396
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:08,860
I think that this can,

2397
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:12,660
I imagine the first year of Horror Nights was similar.

2398
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:14,100
They're trying a lot of different stuff.

2399
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:16,220
It feels like they're very invested in it.

2400
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:18,980
I thought it was not done cheaply.

2401
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:20,380
I think they were like, let's figure it out.

2402
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:22,020
Let's build these experiences.

2403
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:23,140
Let's make this a fun night.

2404
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:24,700
We're celebrating fans.

2405
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:27,100
And I think it's about how do you balance out

2406
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:30,700
that many people making it unique,

2407
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:33,420
and how do you get it beyond the photo op?

2408
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:34,660
And maybe they're part of them,

2409
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:36,540
which is like, that's the biggest thing.

2410
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:37,820
The biggest goal for them is photo ops.

2411
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:39,980
And I think a lot of people in those cosplay outfits,

2412
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:41,860
to be in Picard's chair,

2413
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:44,060
to be in the DeLorean with Einstein,

2414
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:46,580
that's worth the price of admission.

2415
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:49,380
And I've been to a lot of these events with my kids,

2416
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:52,220
not these events, but Instagrammable museums.

2417
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:54,220
To have those pictures, it's like, oh, that's the best.

2418
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:56,820
It almost makes your night more memorable,

2419
01:21:56,820 --> 01:21:59,340
because here's a million pictures of what we did.

2420
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:01,020
And I think a lot, we weren't doing that.

2421
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:04,700
We were just kind of enjoying the rides and or the experiences.

2422
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:06,020
I think they can make this,

2423
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:09,780
I think this is a giant solid foot in the right direction,

2424
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:11,380
and it will only get better.

2425
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:13,620
Ding.

2426
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:15,220
It's not the nitpicks, it's the food.

2427
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:17,620
The food needs to be more accessible.

2428
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:20,300
They clearly were not ready for the amount.

2429
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:23,580
We waited, what, conservatively 30 minutes to get a beer?

2430
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:26,500
Yeah, and that wasn't one of the fun ones.

2431
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:29,700
That was the regular Isla New Bar that I like,

2432
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:32,340
and I thank you all for waiting in that line.

2433
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:35,220
Dad really wanted that Isla New Bar.

2434
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:36,700
By the way, I was excited to have it,

2435
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:40,580
but I'm also like, why have one person manning that?

2436
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:44,740
I'm constantly making complicated tiki drinks,

2437
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:47,660
and then go, yeah, that was strangely understanding.

2438
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:49,260
And it felt like that's what happened

2439
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:51,740
at the Dungeons and Dragons Tavern,

2440
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:53,340
which looked really cool and themed,

2441
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:55,020
and they had all these really cool things.

2442
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:57,300
But it's like, there is something about,

2443
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:01,300
and I don't know if this is like, maybe it's like a,

2444
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:03,140
they have to just have them ready to go.

2445
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:04,820
And it's almost like, pre-make these drinks,

2446
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:05,980
and be like, you want that?

2447
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,820
Boom, boom, and they're like, here, you want this?

2448
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:09,860
Because it's like, it just felt like we were waiting

2449
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:12,740
for Chipotle-level weights.

2450
01:23:12,740 --> 01:23:14,860
It's like, it shouldn't be this,

2451
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:16,140
this shouldn't be this complicated.

2452
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:17,620
It's not like bespoke food.

2453
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:21,100
It's like, or they should have more vendors out.

2454
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:24,140
It felt like they were understaffed, which is odd.

2455
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:27,300
That's really the only nitpick of the night is like,

2456
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:29,020
and maybe they'll fix that on night two.

2457
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:29,860
They must have been like-

2458
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:31,420
It might have been a random thing.

2459
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:33,060
Yeah, maybe they didn't know how many people would show up.

2460
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:34,620
I'm at least happy that there's a ton

2461
01:23:34,620 --> 01:23:37,540
of great performers employed and doing a great job.

2462
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:39,620
That's a good amount of staffing,

2463
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:42,060
and yeah, so many talented people did so great.

2464
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:43,460
I might have one more nitpick,

2465
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:47,180
which is the sheer volume of Billy Joel.

2466
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:48,860
There was so much Billy Joel playing

2467
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:51,620
that it could have been, here's Star Trek,

2468
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:54,020
here's Doc Brown, here's Billy.

2469
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:55,780
So much was that a part of the night.

2470
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:59,100
I think they had like a half-hour music loop,

2471
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:01,100
and three of them were Billy Joel songs.

2472
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:03,660
I heard We Didn't Start the Fire three separate times.

2473
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:04,940
When I was walking through City Walk,

2474
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:05,780
I even heard of Billy.

2475
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:07,580
My God, and I am a big Billy Joel fan.

2476
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:08,980
I saw him here at the Intuit Dome

2477
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:10,060
and he'd bring out Axl Rose.

2478
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:11,020
Oh, right? Amazing.

2479
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:11,860
Wow, wow.

2480
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:12,700
Axl Rose singing Welcome to the Jungle,

2481
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:14,260
and I was like, very impressive.

2482
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:15,300
Not even a Billy Joel?

2483
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:16,940
Yeah, no, I was like, this is great.

2484
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:17,820
That's fun.

2485
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:20,620
Yes, no, not even shade on Billy in particular.

2486
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:22,940
It's just a high volume of one particular thing.

2487
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:25,420
Then I went home, as I put on like,

2488
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:27,820
oh, let me watch a live feed of what's going on up there

2489
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:29,460
now that I'm back here on my couch,

2490
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:32,500
turn it on, Marilyn Monroe,

2491
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:35,380
straight to We Didn't Start the Fire again.

2492
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:36,860
Why this?

2493
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:37,700
Why this so much?

2494
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:38,540
That's a great question.

2495
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:40,100
We also, we didn't talk about this,

2496
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:41,460
but I wanted to just mention it for a second.

2497
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:44,420
There was also a new part of the park experience

2498
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:47,420
that was going on where these coins

2499
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:50,940
that were in these cases that we were scanning,

2500
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:52,660
and if you scanned all four coins,

2501
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:54,820
you would get some sort of badge or a pass.

2502
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:57,500
We opted out after we realized that once you scanned it,

2503
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,420
you had to log in to like a...

2504
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:02,780
You had to have an nvcuni.com account.

2505
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:03,620
Yeah, and that felt like...

2506
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:05,780
That's the thing you do on day one of employment.

2507
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:08,780
Yeah, it felt, and it didn't feel like a fun thing

2508
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:10,100
to get a membership on.

2509
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:10,940
It seemed hard, yeah.

2510
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:13,260
Yeah, no, and it was just stations.

2511
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:16,220
There was just a light, a circle with a question mark.

2512
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:17,060
And the gentleman...

2513
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:18,540
That's the fun medallion you gotta look for.

2514
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:20,900
They're like, we don't even know what this is.

2515
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:23,820
The guy who was speaking to us was like,

2516
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:26,100
what I like is, I like when you're in these moments,

2517
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:28,580
I'm so bummed I never got to experience

2518
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:30,140
when Frontierland became that day

2519
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:31,940
where they were doing immersive.

2520
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:32,780
Oh, yeah.

2521
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:34,420
People had sides and stuff like that,

2522
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:35,260
and that was the idea,

2523
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:37,940
like that might be what Galaxy Edges.

2524
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:39,140
But he was like, yeah, we're doing something

2525
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:39,980
really interesting.

2526
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:41,500
We hid these all around the park.

2527
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,020
Now, I did clock all of them.

2528
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:45,900
It's hard to hide something that is a cylindrical post

2529
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:48,900
with a rotating, glowing coin in it.

2530
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:50,340
It's not hidden.

2531
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:53,380
It felt like the guy was having to sell something

2532
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:54,940
that even he didn't believe in.

2533
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:57,380
Because I was saying out loud, what is this thing?

2534
01:25:57,380 --> 01:25:58,300
Why isn't it working?

2535
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:00,700
I can explain that, why you see...

2536
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:02,020
And then within one sentence,

2537
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:04,380
he was catching the logic flaws himself.

2538
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:06,220
And he was like, you just tap it with your phone,

2539
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:08,900
and then I did, and he's like, well, actually,

2540
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:10,580
maybe just take a picture of it, yeah.

2541
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:12,660
That's gonna be a cleaner way to do it.

2542
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:13,620
And then we all walked away

2543
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:15,900
once we saw the additional login step.

2544
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,300
Yeah, so all right, that's a note.

2545
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:20,900
Maybe whatever that is, we don't need to do that.

2546
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:21,740
I like the idea.

2547
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:22,580
I like the idea.

2548
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:24,660
Just one Billy Joel song an hour

2549
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:26,660
instead of three every half hour.

2550
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:28,580
These are all nitpicks for what I think overall

2551
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:29,980
was a fantastic thing.

2552
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:30,860
Do we all approve?

2553
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:32,300
Would we all do it again?

2554
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:33,140
Or are we all for another year?

2555
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:34,540
I kinda wanna do it now.

2556
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:36,180
I kinda said I'd like to go back again

2557
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:37,020
knowing what it was.

2558
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:39,100
I didn't know what it was going into it.

2559
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:42,220
I think where this thing needs to improve,

2560
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:45,620
or not even prove, is to your point,

2561
01:26:45,620 --> 01:26:49,900
keep the theming going on throughout the park.

2562
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:51,940
Horror nights, they got a million clowns

2563
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:54,300
running around with chainsaws wherever you're going.

2564
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:57,020
They know how to do this type of thing.

2565
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:59,180
I think it's just about getting that infrastructure in.

2566
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:01,740
Now horror nights may bring in a lot more money

2567
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:03,900
and they can afford a lot more people,

2568
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:04,860
so that may be part of it.

2569
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:08,180
But it seems like there were areas

2570
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:11,780
where we're just dead on theming Billy Joel songs

2571
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:13,060
and then fully Star Trek.

2572
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:15,660
But even the Star Trek area was Billy Joel songs.

2573
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:18,540
So it's almost like, can we isolate the islands?

2574
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:19,380
Can we?

2575
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:20,220
That would be nice, yeah.

2576
01:27:20,220 --> 01:27:21,620
Because then when we were down

2577
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:24,100
at the Dungeons and Dragons area,

2578
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:26,860
it was that DJ who was doing wedding music.

2579
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:28,060
He did Casper Slide, yeah.

2580
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:30,340
Yeah, so they were like,

2581
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:32,500
I just feel like there are these things where it's like,

2582
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,220
they were trying to keep it a party vibe,

2583
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:36,220
but it's also like, we're nerds, we're here,

2584
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:37,740
we're in costume.

2585
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:38,980
Play me some, you know.

2586
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:40,540
The Star Trek First Contact score.

2587
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:42,460
Yeah, give me that stuff, but we want that.

2588
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:43,860
We wanna feel like we're in Quark's bar,

2589
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:46,780
not hearing Sabrina Carpenter.

2590
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:49,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can hear that back up at City Walk,

2591
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:50,780
and we will.

2592
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:53,700
Although it was kind of special to get a mashup,

2593
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:56,380
as you noticed, of Party in the USA with Pitbull.

2594
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:57,340
Yes, that was nice.

2595
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:58,340
I love that.

2596
01:27:58,340 --> 01:27:59,180
That's all crafted for us.

2597
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:01,020
And by the way, that's a real DJ, not a person.

2598
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:01,860
They're not playing track,

2599
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:03,220
that was the DJ that was up there doing his thing.

2600
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:04,340
Yeah, I got the right idea.

2601
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:07,340
But then mash it up into that ZZ Top.

2602
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:09,860
Dun, dun, dun, do, dun, dun, do.

2603
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:10,700
I love that.

2604
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:11,940
Yeah, I wanna hear that all night long.

2605
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:14,740
And I also think that they had an issue with spacing,

2606
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:17,260
because we saw Back to the Future, it was awesome.

2607
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:19,420
You get off, and it's seemingly like

2608
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:20,740
there was a Back to the Future restaurant

2609
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:21,940
that we did not see,

2610
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:24,900
and there's also a Back to the Future band

2611
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,180
called the Flux Capacitors,

2612
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:28,220
and they're just doing full music all the time.

2613
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,820
Really cool, but they seem all separate.

2614
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:34,140
They're islands.

2615
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:36,940
An island, yeah, away from the main attraction.

2616
01:28:36,940 --> 01:28:37,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2617
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:40,700
You know, there's one more thing on the way out the door.

2618
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:43,060
We have not mentioned Xanathar.

2619
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:45,780
Xanathar, the gigantic puppet who shows,

2620
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:47,820
spoiler alert, although I'm sure you've seen it already,

2621
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:50,500
if you've watched the YouTube video about this,

2622
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:52,700
Xanathar is a gigantic puppet

2623
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,420
in Dungeons & Dragons experience.

2624
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:58,260
I think if Xanathar were in the park year round,

2625
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:00,860
you'd become a new icon of Universal Studios.

2626
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:03,780
It's one of the best things in the park in any form.

2627
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:04,620
Well, this is what I'm saying,

2628
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:05,900
like the money that,

2629
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:07,780
whatever they did for Dungeons & Dragons,

2630
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:08,780
and I thought it was really interesting

2631
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:10,220
that they spent the most money,

2632
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:11,860
clearly the most money on Dungeons & Dragons.

2633
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:15,300
It's like, that's what I was so confused about.

2634
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:16,620
I was like, you created this awesome thing.

2635
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:17,580
The costumes there were great,

2636
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:19,980
the characters there were great,

2637
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:21,100
but just to take that away,

2638
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:22,460
and somebody, when I posted a picture of that,

2639
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:23,300
somebody was like,

2640
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:25,740
oh, is that a Big Trouble in Little China attraction?

2641
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:26,580
Oh, yeah, it looks similar.

2642
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:30,340
Oh, yeah, it's a little shop of horrors, too.

2643
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:33,460
I wonder why the money was spent on Dungeons & Dragons,

2644
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:34,540
and I wonder if it's partly

2645
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:36,980
because that's a new property for them,

2646
01:29:36,980 --> 01:29:37,820
they did that movie,

2647
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:39,620
there's a new series that I think is coming out

2648
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:42,260
that someone is behind.

2649
01:29:42,260 --> 01:29:43,460
So maybe they're like,

2650
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:45,580
this might be something that we are investing

2651
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:47,500
more time and money into,

2652
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:48,940
whereas the rest is like,

2653
01:29:48,940 --> 01:29:51,260
ye nostalgia guys.

2654
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:52,100
Yeah, maybe.

2655
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:55,620
I feel like if it's gonna be a little bit scattershot,

2656
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:58,020
it's little things that can tie it all together,

2657
01:29:58,020 --> 01:29:59,700
it would all work for me if,

2658
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:01,100
as you're leaving for the night,

2659
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:03,220
you meet one more Xanathar,

2660
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:05,860
and he sings Harry Truman, Doris Day,

2661
01:30:05,860 --> 01:30:07,020
Red China, John D. Ricks.

2662
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:07,860
Well, there you go.

2663
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:08,700
That's a dream.

2664
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:11,420
By the way, you have a very talented listenership.

2665
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:13,900
They should take any videos from the livestreams and stuff

2666
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:15,380
and just put that together,

2667
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:18,340
and let's sing it together, and let's do it.

2668
01:30:18,340 --> 01:30:19,740
That is a mashup I'd love to see,

2669
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:21,860
even more than Miley Cyrus and Pitbull.

2670
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:25,620
But overall, good reports,

2671
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:27,620
especially from the evening, a great time.

2672
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:29,460
Great excuse to hang, Paul.

2673
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:30,300
Thank you for coming.

2674
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:31,580
I was thrilled to be there.

2675
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:32,620
I loved it.

2676
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:36,660
And I am excited for more of it.

2677
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:39,740
I'm excited if next year is three different properties,

2678
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:42,820
or you continue to build out more properties.

2679
01:30:42,820 --> 01:30:44,620
Alternate 85, different backstories.

2680
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:46,460
Yeah, that's what we want.

2681
01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:49,420
And I guess there's, I'll say one more thing,

2682
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:52,300
where they should also just embrace,

2683
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:55,220
the Simpsons, obviously,

2684
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:57,300
it's so beautiful, the Simpsons area.

2685
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:00,700
That should be also thriving with Simpsons characters

2686
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:01,540
during fan nights, right?

2687
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:02,820
I mean, to a certain extent.

2688
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:04,140
And deep cuts.

2689
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:07,620
Yeah, the one-eyed baby should be walking around.

2690
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:09,460
But maybe that's a Disney problem.

2691
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:11,540
Oh, yeah, yeah, they're not gonna free up money.

2692
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:13,460
I bet they would if it wasn't just for Disney.

2693
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:14,340
Yeah, it's a bummer.

2694
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:16,620
That's a bummer, because you are walking through these areas.

2695
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:18,740
Well, maybe next year, you have Fast and Furious,

2696
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:21,460
we'll get to bump into Kurt Russell's character,

2697
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:23,580
to be at the Corona dealership.

2698
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:25,740
I don't know these movies well,

2699
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:27,540
and you have to tell us who you wanna meet

2700
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:28,860
from Fast and Furious.

2701
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:30,580
Who's the dream, who's the ultimate fan dream?

2702
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:32,020
Look, I think you would, for me,

2703
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:35,860
it's be Mamoa with the going around being crazy.

2704
01:31:35,860 --> 01:31:36,700
I'd love to meet any of them.

2705
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:38,900
I mean, they're big personnel, big shoes to fill.

2706
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:39,740
Of course.

2707
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:41,860
Harder to cast, because it's so muscular.

2708
01:31:41,860 --> 01:31:43,580
Oh, sure, but they find, hey,

2709
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:45,660
Waterworld's got a lot of Bloodjack guys.

2710
01:31:45,660 --> 01:31:47,340
They can, yeah, and save one Jack one

2711
01:31:47,380 --> 01:31:49,740
to do the Doc Brown slide.

2712
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:51,900
And let's bring back some of that universal

2713
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:54,460
old West stunt show in that night.

2714
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:55,940
Let's have somebody fall off the building

2715
01:31:55,940 --> 01:31:57,380
from the Fast and Furious building.

2716
01:31:57,380 --> 01:31:58,580
Let's do some more stuff.

2717
01:31:58,580 --> 01:31:59,900
Yeah, yeah, absolutely, yeah.

2718
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:00,980
Just don't go off the other side,

2719
01:32:00,980 --> 01:32:04,420
which goes all the way down the entire mountain.

2720
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:06,540
Well, this was a blast to talk with you today,

2721
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:07,780
a blast to do it the other night.

2722
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:08,620
So much fun.

2723
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:10,020
I'll sure you survived podcast The Ride.

2724
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:11,580
Thanks for joining us again.

2725
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:14,380
Yes, narrowly escaped, narrowly survived.

2726
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:15,460
Let's exit through the gift shop.

2727
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:16,340
Anything you'd like to plug?

2728
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:17,180
No, that's it.

Oh yeah, I've been seeing some clips of it.

2735
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:27,820
Yeah, it's been fun.

Thanks today to Brendan, Lucas, and Kelly

2743
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:45,040
at Frog City Studios, and shout out to Brendan's cousin,

2744
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:46,880
who's in the flux capacitors.

2745
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,800
I'm sorry we didn't get to see the band.

2746
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:49,640
We've heard good things.

2747
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:50,460
We briefly did.

2748
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:51,300
We walked by them.

2749
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:52,120
Oh, we did, okay, great.

2750
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:52,960
I watched some stuff online

2751
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:53,800
and I was like, that's pretty cool.

2752
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:54,640
Yeah.

2753
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:58,040
It reminds me of, and again, that's a great,

2754
01:32:58,040 --> 01:32:59,740
a great, smart, cool thing to do.

2755
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:00,580
Yeah, very cool.

2756
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:02,000
Like, it's not Billy Joel, it's the flux capacitors.

2757
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yeah.

2758
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:04,600
Little less Billy, but just a little.

2759
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:05,440
Just a little.

2760
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:06,280
Just a little.

2761
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:07,100
Just a little, we need to see it last.

2762
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:07,940
Definitely keep some Billy.

2763
01:33:07,940 --> 01:33:09,140
Okay.

2764
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:09,980
Forever.

2765
