1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:12,520
Warning, the following podcast contains messy clots, drug humor, scary wooden flats, a tasteless

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:17,520
candy gag gift that threatens to derail the entire episode with its vulgarity, and a far

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,880
out look man at the Alice in Wonderland ride.

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,520
We're through the looking glass.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,440
It's Podcast The Ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, hosted by three very good boys who immediately leave the Alice

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,440
in Wonderland ride and narc on the hookah smoking caterpillar.

10
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,040
I'm Scott Gertner, joined by Mike Carlson.

11
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,640
Yeah, Mike Carlson here.

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
Jason Sheridan.

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,400
Jason, yeah, I don't like it.

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,520
I don't care for it.

15
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,720
It's clearly like some funny stuff in there.

16
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,040
You're not supposed to do that inside.

17
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,840
In fact, you're not supposed to do it in the parks at all anymore.

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,240
So security, they've been actually they've been looking into it and they've taken a lot

19
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,460
of the smoking areas away.

20
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,640
So I find it a little offensive that on the ride, there's somebody smoking, not only smoking,

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,680
but smoking and making vows with his smoke.

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,800
I'm offended by his language.

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,880
He's flaunting it.

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,240
He's being flashy about his brazen breaking of the rules.

25
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,600
And I don't care for it.

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,240
It's only going to lead to more of that kind of thing.

27
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,320
Yeah. And it's not tobacco.

28
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,680
It can't be tobacco.

29
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,360
Yeah, it's it's a what is it?

30
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,080
What is it? What is it?

31
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,760
Hookah is traditionally a kind of tobacco.

32
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,200
Yeah, but but I'm saying with this caterpillar, this is not.

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,000
Oh, who knows? It's probably opium.

34
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,840
Yeah, OK, that actually makes a lot more sense.

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,000
We're mixed in with tobacco.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,200
And we're dealing with the twisted mind of Lewis Carroll.

37
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,560
The twisted mind of Lewis Carroll.

38
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,240
What's the Sean William Scott and Ashton Kutcher?

39
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,280
Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

40
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,960
That's good. Yeah, actually, I like to see that.

41
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,760
That's good. Rachel Lee.

42
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,240
Rachel Lee Cook is Alice.

43
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,640
Man, this is great casting with like the she's all that era.

44
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,760
You're putting this in 2001.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,080
D.J. Qualls, D.J. Qualls.

46
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,400
I was like, oh, shit, who's D.J. Qualls?

47
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,680
Seth Green is the king of hearts.

48
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,920
Oh, yes. But they kind of like shrunken down with bad CGI.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,840
Like, yeah, it doesn't look good.

50
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,360
And the queen is already laying in drag.

51
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,200
Oh, my God. Oh, yeah.

52
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,840
That's outrageous.

53
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,360
I don't know if he would have gotten that part.

54
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,280
I don't know. Maybe.

55
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,320
I don't know. He was in some movies here and there.

56
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,400
Yeah. Yeah.

57
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,560
It would have been like there was like six months where he could have gotten that.

58
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,360
Yes. Like if he was on his best behavior in the quick little window.

59
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,120
Like Norm Show season two.

60
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,360
There's a six month window where Artie Lang would have been cast.

61
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,760
Yes. As the queen.

62
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,560
And Norm's the mad hatter.

63
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,280
No, no one was a mad hatter.

64
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,040
They're the mad hatter.

65
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,040
That's an impression of shitty Norm Impressions is what it is.

66
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,040
Hey, well, you know, before we get into

67
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,240
today's topic, this ride, one of the Disneyland dark rides,

68
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,640
you know, in the the Alice tale

69
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,880
kicks off with her, you know, trying these potions, these little,

70
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,640
you know, the eat me and the drink me. Right.

71
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,160
And I realize that's maybe that's a fun way

72
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,680
to start our little journey, to try a little experimental spirit.

73
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,200
As it were. Yes, indeed.

74
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,000
You're giving me weird looks here, but allow me to explain.

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,280
I've not that long ago, I was in Las Vegas.

76
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,960
Right. Real real life wonderland.

77
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,160
Huh? Just you have things in this bag.

78
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,480
What's that? Do you have things for?

79
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,960
I do. I do have things in the bag and I can explain.

80
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:19,800
So I was I was on my way to to the Bally's Resort, which, by the way,

81
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,920
I mean, I'll say this separately.

82
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:28,600
I was going to the Twilight Zone mini golf course by made by Monster mini golf,

83
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,440
the same place that made the Kiss mini golf.

84
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,760
Right. Anybody's been on that.

85
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,160
I have been to that. And yeah, yeah.

86
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,040
I think that was that was really great.

87
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,440
I think it's moved. It's it's at one of the casinos now.

88
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,000
I forget which was across the street from Hard Rock Hotel.

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,360
Yes, I believe it is not anymore.

90
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,520
I think it's part of a casino complex now.

91
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,440
And now Bally's has a second one, the Twilight Zone, which I would highly recommend.

92
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,880
It's a lot of fun. This place does good stuff.

93
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,480
Some great, great characters and great black light, much like today's attraction as well.

94
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,640
So and and and relatively cheap, I will say, for it being a strip attraction.

95
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,280
Right. You get out of there without spending a ton.

96
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,320
Anybody looking for weird stuff to do in Vegas?

97
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not.

98
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,560
They do take your ball at the end.

99
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,920
You know, you don't get to take that home.

100
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,240
You're not buying a ball for that price.

101
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,520
But so I was on my way into Bally's.

102
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,960
And what should I see?

103
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Jump out of me in the shopping center in front of Bally's.

104
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,680
But one of our beloved city walk stores, it's sugar.

105
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,520
It's sugar. Oh, yes.

106
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,360
Now in front of the Bally's hotel.

107
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,880
And I didn't realize till I got home.

108
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,960
That is a brand new Bally's or not.

109
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,200
Bally's is not new brand, brand new.

110
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,800
It's sugar only opened in June.

111
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,600
It is now they consider it a flagship location.

112
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,560
Only the second location on the strip, there's already one at the Venetian.

113
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,600
But now there's this new gigantic, it's sugar,

114
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,800
which is very theme parky in general when you end up going to Vegas again.

115
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,400
I mean, I guess maybe I shouldn't spoil everything, but you can see

116
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,240
gigantic nerds made of nerds.

117
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,040
Yes, that got a gasp out of you.

118
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,880
I was hoping it would.

119
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,040
You can get a picture with a big jelly belly on a bench.

120
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,880
That's good. Yeah, there's tons of like big theme parky figures and stuff.

121
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,600
But there was something that jumped out at me and something that I haven't seen

122
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
in the city walk. It's sugar.

123
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,160
Maybe it's a new thing. Maybe they do have it.

124
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,920
But I was like, I have to bring this home to the guys and we have to

125
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,480
we have to give this a try.

126
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,640
And here, give me a sec. Let me pull it out.

127
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,160
What I have with me.

128
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,880
What what a treat.

129
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,960
Get ready for urine. Yeah.

130
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,120
Have you seen urine before?

131
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,560
And just a few minutes ago, in fact,

132
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,880
your own urine.

133
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,040
This is clinical looking.

134
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,840
Yes. It the urine comes in a sample jar.

135
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,800
It looks like you would do a copy.

136
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,320
Yes. And on the back, a little form of name reason, time date

137
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,600
and a sterile sticker, sterile interior if the seal is not broken.

138
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,880
But this is a jar of some strange yellow liquid of candy piss.

139
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,080
Candy piss is what I hold in my hands.

140
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,920
Tag candy piss.

141
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,400
The the official name of this product is urine for a treat.

142
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,080
Whoa. And this was also this is one of the eye popping displays

143
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,200
of the new Vegas at Sugar.

144
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,920
There was one.

145
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,560
This is one of 50 that were all overflowing out of a urinal

146
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,400
attached to the wall.

147
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,720
Wait, a full a regular sized urinal or a novelty sized urinal?

148
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,440
I would call it more novelty.

149
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,840
OK, although the urinals can be large and they go down to the floor.

150
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,600
But this was a mounted one, not a floor length one.

151
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,240
So they're all in on selling candy piss.

152
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,480
This isn't just like we're trying it out for a while.

153
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,480
Yeah, this is like a permanent part.

154
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,720
It's a load bearing urinal.

155
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,040
Jeff, on the pillar of the store, I feel like

156
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,960
Mike and I were talking about Vegas recently and I was pulling up pictures

157
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,440
of the it was Vince Neal's Tatuado

158
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,840
each drink party where they briefly served drinks in plastic toilet cups.

159
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,920
Or maybe it was each drink party and Tatuado is the current

160
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,920
Vince Neal restaurant at Circus Circus.

161
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:35,240
Well, I mean, that's a question of how do we how do we consume this urine?

162
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,400
I mean, it's I also if we just want to dip forks, I have forks with me.

163
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,840
I mean, how is it thick here?

164
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,200
You see it turning? Not really.

165
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,880
I know what you mean by forks, though.

166
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,480
But like I feel like you need to be like honey.

167
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,800
You could like it could be the you think it's viscous.

168
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,560
Maybe we should do it like it should be.

169
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,840
Let's do let's do it like it's heroin with a spoon.

170
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,240
Yeah, that's good.

171
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,320
That's what we dip a little bit into a spoon.

172
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,000
Like, yeah, maybe, maybe it's I should have warned you.

173
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,880
I'm sorry, but I wanted to spring this year and you're all.

174
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,800
So now you can hear me cracking the seal.

175
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,680
So, you know that this urine has not been contaminated.

176
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,200
It has not been.

177
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,040
It is it is still sterilized in as much as.

178
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,720
But yeah, apparently the toilet cups were briefly popular.

179
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,840
And for a while, they had a version where you would drink out of the bowl

180
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,240
or your food would be in the bowl and then the.

181
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,800
Yes, you're going to have your drink down.

182
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,640
OK.

183
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,360
OK, here now they're breaking the seal, no longer sterile and quick.

184
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
OK, great.

185
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,000
So yeah, maybe you stay standing and you can hand this to.

186
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,560
Carol and Jason not have predicted this level.

187
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,120
And I mean, he was perverted, but OK, let me take a little dip here.

188
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,040
Hmm. I mean, it feels like it looks like medicine or it looks like a honey.

189
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,560
We'll document this in some way here.

190
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,560
No, you're you take and then take it to Jason.

191
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,000
I'll take a picture. Oh, yes. Yeah.

192
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,800
Take a picture of this process.

193
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,560
And at home, if you're in Las Vegas already, get your own piss.

194
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,520
Edwin is lined up to get it.

195
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,920
So yeah, this is going to be a bit.

196
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,760
Yeah, you're going to have to.

197
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,120
All right, Scott, you take yours.

198
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,880
Mike, take the cup and the spoon. OK.

199
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,280
And he's locked in and staring daggers.

200
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,960
Maybe maybe just put it in Jason's mouth.

201
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,600
Maybe just feed Jason.

202
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,880
Wait, wait, wait. Let me let me take a photo of this, too.

203
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,040
Sorry, listener.

204
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,560
I we should have walked in on a candy piss again.

205
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,240
Thank you. Thank you, my boy.

206
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,480
Hang on. Here we go. OK.

207
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,640
A photo and Edwin's in there, too.

208
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,280
That's fantastic.

209
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,200
OK, let's hear it.

210
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,760
And you do it, too, Mike. So there's not too much of a delay.

211
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,600
I'm going to take a big spoonful of this. Here we go.

212
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,360
Hey, let me say officially, Mike, Jason, eat my piss.

213
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,400
You want to say it?

214
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,760
Because finally.

215
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,240
Oof. Oh, it tastes like medicine.

216
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,440
So it stays like a yellow medicine.

217
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,320
I did have to drink out of a bottle like that is awful.

218
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,440
That is really sour.

219
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,800
Oh, Mike is very unhappy.

220
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,360
Like you left lemon heads in the car and they melted.

221
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,240
And you like took it.

222
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,040
Mike is eating an actual lemon now for relief.

223
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,960
That's not a joke.

224
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,680
Yeah. From like an old Dunkin Donuts.

225
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,640
Oh, I crave the smooth taste of lemon.

226
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,720
Should I go back?

227
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,120
You want more? You want more?

228
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,040
I think I need another to like get your full.

229
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,680
We'll get up.

230
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,560
I think that I don't because my I think I think my teeth are rotting already.

231
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,040
It's a candy that rots your teeth instantly.

232
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,800
I will say I have a canker sore in my mouth.

233
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,440
Oh, no. And it really inflamed it.

234
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,880
The it's like medicine, except it fucks up your mouth problems more.

235
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,840
Yeah, it's an awesome.

236
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,240
Also, too.

237
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,920
Uh, not great.

238
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,200
Less better because I used the end of the spoon, so I got very little.

239
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,200
I sometimes sometimes some people say like,

240
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,160
I don't like this food because of the texture.

241
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,960
And sometimes I'm like, I guess a real asshole and I'm skeptical.

242
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,160
And I'm like, well, the texture doesn't really bother me.

243
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,080
I will say that's maybe the most unpleasant texture I've ever put in my mouth.

244
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,280
Because it's somewhere between is not as thick as maple syrup or something.

245
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:33,280
And though it is a little more solid and it is certainly not just pure water or soda.

246
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,080
Right. It's a really uncanny valley of liquid consistency.

247
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,400
At first, I thought, oh, it's going to be like gelatin.

248
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,360
And it's not. It is like syrup.

249
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,400
Yeah. From a distance, it looked very watery.

250
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,920
And then when I got up close, I was like, oh, this is syrup.

251
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,920
It has the same color as like some.

252
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Like very intense medicine I had to take when I was like very ill in high school.

253
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,160
Like I had to go to the hospital and get fluids and like that sort of thing.

254
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,520
And they're like, you have to take this for a week.

255
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,920
And it's just like, oh, it tastes bad.

256
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,760
Yeah. Oh, my God.

257
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,200
I mean, kind of thing you would only eat for survival.

258
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,240
Yeah. Not dying.

259
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,280
That's going to go on our earthquake kit unless you guys want to take it.

260
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,440
Did you just buy? Is that what that is?

261
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,520
Is that a backpack?

262
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,960
We've had that earthquake thing for a while.

263
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,120
We just had an earthquake a couple of weeks ago.

264
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,360
Two weeks. You know, things are bad when you're subsisting on that urine.

265
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,800
You're drinking candy piss.

266
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,040
Before you get to your own.

267
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,840
Would you maybe would you choose your own piss over this fake piss?

268
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,880
I do think my own piss would be more pleasant than this candy piss.

269
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,640
I think so, too.

270
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,160
You know what it is?

271
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,360
Yeah, it's it's the liquid.

272
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,680
It's just like liquid, at least not this bizarre in between

273
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,760
that you're dealing with here.

274
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,840
Yeah, I would.

275
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,960
You know, I think the hotness of this would be the trouble for me.

276
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,680
But maybe I kind of pre do it, let it cool down a little.

277
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,800
Well, you would piss into a glass with ice.

278
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,760
Yeah. Assuming that in this

279
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,640
like emergency scenario, ice is still available.

280
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,600
Aren't there those things where you like break it open and it turns icy?

281
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,200
Am I making something up?

282
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,440
Yeah, for like pain relief, not for eating.

283
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,880
Yeah, there you go. Yeah.

284
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,720
It's for like your back. Yeah, yeah.

285
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,520
But you could use it to cool your piss in a disaster.

286
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,320
I suppose. Yeah.

287
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:22,960
Oh, you could.

288
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,320
Yeah, there are like refreezeable, like liquid things that you can put

289
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,080
in your or something because there's a thing like for my there's a back thing

290
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,160
that we have where you like snap it and it like turns things on.

291
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,960
And it heats. Sure.

292
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,840
So if you use one of those, not to relieve an injury, but wrapped

293
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,680
a cup of your piss, that would that I think that what I'm describing

294
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,880
would taste better than what we just. Yeah.

295
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,120
I mean, thanks for thinking of us.

296
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,240
Thank you. That is nice.

297
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,960
I want you to know when I saw that you're full of these samples.

298
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,080
Yeah. Oh, my God.

299
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,440
In the hot in a hot desert.

300
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,360
You also talked about like bringing back like Italian meat,

301
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,400
delicious Italian meats and cheese.

302
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,280
Oh, yes, that's true.

303
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,920
I went to Italy and then I and I and then I had a flight that day

304
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,680
and I didn't have to do the full security screening.

305
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,720
So, yes, in my bag was both.

306
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,320
Yeah, like fantastic prosciutto de parma

307
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,320
and the sealed sealed candy piss.

308
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,400
That's Vegas, baby.

309
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,520
That's Vegas.

310
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,920
I know. I know it's supposed to stay there, but hey, I'm talking about it.

311
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,400
I brought it home with me.

312
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,040
My last question about the candy piss is, is it

313
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,600
was their intention to like obviously make it look gross,

314
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,760
but then you'd have and you go, oh, this is delicious.

315
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,680
Or is the idea that it's going to be like, oh, we're all eating a gross thing.

316
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,880
And it's like a little bit unpleasant.

317
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,400
Of course, it's just sugar.

318
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,480
Because it's also not like so vile.

319
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,280
It's not like it's not like a joke, like fart flavor.

320
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,160
Right. Yeah.

321
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,840
Have you we had any in any of our sugar wanderings?

322
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,800
Did we ever have some nobody had like one of the poop candies or something?

323
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,480
No, I've had the jelly belly like the birdie bots, the Harry Potter jelly beans.

324
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,000
And every now and then there's like grass or booger or like.

325
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,920
Mm hmm. Yeah, those are.

326
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,960
Those are unpleasant, but won't kill you.

327
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,480
But this is just that just felt like this is I don't even know.

328
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,560
Like how are you meant to consume?

329
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,560
Like, I feel like if I took a sip, I'd be really upset.

330
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,200
Like, it seems like a thing you would you would open the lid and then sip from it.

331
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,120
But like, it doesn't dripping.

332
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,280
Yeah, down. Yeah.

333
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,480
Is there with you both with facial hair?

334
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,560
Thank God you didn't just dive in.

335
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,480
Then you've got piss in your. Yeah.

336
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,000
I also wonder, like, why couldn't it just be like a yellow soda?

337
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,600
Sure. Is it just look right into in the container?

338
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,920
Maybe like, you never see better.

339
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,320
Hmm. Yeah, I think the fact that because any like sodas

340
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,520
usually contain in such a way that you can't like quite see the flavor inside.

341
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,400
You know, the bottles are dark like vitamin water.

342
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,920
Yellow vitamin water looks like that, doesn't it?

343
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,200
Yeah, that's true.

344
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,960
Is it that I don't know if it's that thick piss yellow.

345
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,480
I guess that's why it just has to be thicker because piss is thicker than vitamin water.

346
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,880
This is thicker than water.

347
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,080
That was very unpleasant.

348
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,920
I wasn't. Yeah, I wasn't sure it was going to go that way.

349
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,880
It seemed possible to me that like, oh, and then it's kind of a fun little lemon treat.

350
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,240
But that was very unpleasant and I was unpleasant to listen to.

351
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,040
We said the word piss a lot.

352
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,360
Yeah. Sorry about that. If you're piss sensitive

353
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,680
or any piss, it's really going down the rabbit hole or any listeners

354
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,280
who enjoy drinking piss and are offended that we've spoken a little bit.

355
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,720
Mm hmm. So yeah, either way, it's an acquired taste and a flavor that we apologize.

356
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,760
Either way, enjoy.

357
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,440
I apologize to you guys, I suppose,

358
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,560
but I would still recommend a trip to the flagship, it's sugar for fine products like that.

359
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,720
I just want to know what else they're working on.

360
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,240
Is there like a do they have blood? They sell candy blood already, right?

361
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,280
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I think so.

362
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,480
So what other what other fluids?

363
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,480
No, never mind.

364
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,920
There's only so many.

365
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,960
Let's just talk about Alice in Wonderland.

366
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,320
Let's now talk about Alice in Wonderland.

367
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,680
Let's open the big door.

368
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,680
Do you guys feel like anything's happening to you?

369
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,760
Do you feel like you do?

370
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,080
Do you feel like you're growing 10 feet tall from that consumption of urine? No.

371
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,000
Is your mind open now?

372
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,160
That's yeah, I feel like I'm coming off of a lot of number opium.

373
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,640
I feel like I've got the shakes and I'm sweating.

374
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,800
I do have a weird feeling in my I think that could have provoked a headache.

375
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,600
I'm not sure.

376
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,120
The lemon I really is a as if I did a shot of tequila.

377
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,560
I took the lemon afterwards.

378
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,680
I would rather my palate. Yeah.

379
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,520
You want that alcohol aftertaste without the taste?

380
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,600
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

381
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,640
Give me some rubbing alcohol, please.

382
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,000
I need something here.

383
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,680
Oh, boy. Well, yeah.

384
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,280
Let's swing from that to what I think is a pretty fun and pleasant ride.

385
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,240
Alice in Wonderland Disneyland and at no other parks.

386
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,480
Interestingly, Disneyland, Disneyland, Dark Ride exclusive.

387
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,160
One of the only dark rides. It's only one park. Yeah.

388
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,600
Fifty one years old.

389
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,080
Opened June 14th, 1958.

390
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,800
Same day as the sailing ship Columbia.

391
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,480
Important day for you. An important day for me.

392
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,400
Fun fact, when it opened, the sailing ship Columbia cost three hundred

393
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,640
thousand dollars, which in today's

394
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,800
money would be over two million dollars.

395
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,480
That's still pretty cheap.

396
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,440
That's still they could.

397
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,760
That's one one hundredth of Galaxy's.

398
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,520
Yeah, that is true.

399
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,080
Yeah, not even more.

400
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,320
Wait, I'm no, I'm not even close.

401
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,920
They're both a billion dollars.

402
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,760
Both galaxies.

403
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,040
I think that's what Jim Hill said or over a bit.

404
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,240
That's what he always says.

405
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,400
Like, that's what they admit they've spent on both parts.

406
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,400
Part of both parts.

407
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,320
So like it's possible it's over a billion dollars.

408
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,920
When you factor in like movie budgets are like, oh, and then there's

409
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,040
marketing on top of that.

410
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,120
Yeah. And then then the I assume to fix rise of the resistance,

411
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,360
which we haven't even talked about as opening next year,

412
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,520
which is just here.

413
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,560
Insane. Yeah.

414
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,440
But it's not without precedent, of course.

415
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,280
But still, I just want to go on the goddamn right.

416
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:14,960
Yeah, I know.

417
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,400
When the Disney world gets it before us and yet after we've been there

418
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,080
for our live show tickets available now, maybe hopefully.

419
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,840
Or they're not. They're not.

420
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,720
Go get them fast.

421
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,200
That was Mike's theory.

422
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,880
Your theory was that like you maybe they would let you know,

423
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,720
that would be a surprise for people going to the parks panel.

424
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,440
Well, that's supposedly what you get a wristband to go on.

425
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,200
Rise of the resistance.

426
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,960
They usually do that kind of fun thing at D23.

427
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,720
And like you one time I got a world of color fast pass for the new show

428
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
for that night. And they do fun stuff like that.

429
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,920
And Jim Hill was saying that they wanted it open just at least for D23 weekend.

430
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,880
So people would go on it, whether they were going to do that,

431
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,800
if like kind of fun event or not.

432
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,760
But no, instead of that, six months later.

433
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,160
Yeah. So there's only one fun choice for D23 weekend,

434
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:07,160
which is to come see the podcast, the ride gang at the Anaheim Hotel.

435
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,160
The night before. Don't do it after the parks panel.

436
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,480
Come do it the night before. That's when that's when we're actually there.

437
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,000
Do it. Do it when we're doing it.

438
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,480
Hit up the pizza press beforehand.

439
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,640
Design your own pizza. It's very fun.

440
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,920
That pizza press. I feel like you are. You love the designer on pizza.

441
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,080
I like that. Well, pizza press.

442
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,520
I like the concept.

443
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,960
I do think pizza press is one of the better ones.

444
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,880
If you remember at City Walk, I really beefed it with Blaze. OK.

445
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,960
And I'm still not quite sure how much of that was them and how much was me.

446
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,080
But you've been working it out with your therapist.

447
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,720
I still try to figure it out. You'll crack it one day.

448
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,120
So this Alice in Wonderland.

449
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,600
Well, you know, I was going to say, did they ever do you think they looked

450
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,520
at the numbers for Galaxy's Edge and thought, maybe we should just build

451
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,760
200 more Columbia's?

452
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,720
Like for this price. Yeah.

453
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,920
I think that more ships

454
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,440
crammed all over every bit of empty space, crammed ships.

455
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,440
Bob Chapek now is crunching the numbers on the ships.

456
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,240
This ride is this is kind of a creeper for me in that

457
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,640
not in the Lewis Carroll way in the it's a creeper on my list of

458
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,560
favorite dark rides.

459
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,040
It's depending on the day.

460
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,120
I could even maybe list this as my as my number one of the Disneyland.

461
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,520
Of the Disneyland, you said that, OK, like, OK, I guess that's how you feel.

462
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,480
Oh, I didn't intend to.

463
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,720
I think I'm still processing the thing.

464
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,160
My mouth still feels bad.

465
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,680
Oh, yeah, that's going to be a subject.

466
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,880
I guess we are still. Yeah.

467
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,120
I would not disagree with that.

468
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,920
I have always been a big Mr.

469
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,800
Toad kid, and I was so delighted when I came out here and found it was still here

470
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,000
after it had been tragically closed in Florida.

471
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,320
I might still have to call it that, but I think it's those two are vying for one.

472
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,880
I mean, this has so many unique elements to it, too, that kind of set it apart.

473
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,080
Yeah, I it the location of it for whatever reason.

474
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,840
I don't go on it that much, but it's not fair to it.

475
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,640
Like because it is really good.

476
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,240
Yeah, it is one of the best ones.

477
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,560
Well, I yeah, I never feel like waiting in that line, but that's a great one.

478
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,400
If you're there in that last hour and it's sort of thinning out

479
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,720
because those quitter kids have all left. Yes.

480
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,680
And I ended up doing this was actually the first thing that I went to

481
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,080
in this bizarre night that I told you guys about, but I didn't go.

482
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,240
I didn't talk about on the show that I ended up at.

483
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,200
I was like that was a Disneyland solo.

484
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,600
And I was like kind of looking forward to like, yeah, you know,

485
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,200
I'll take off early and, you know, just like that was a good, quick little trip.

486
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,920
That was nice. I got to Mickey and friends.

487
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,240
It was full to the brim because there was an accident.

488
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,640
Two exits up the five.

489
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,200
And I was looking at the map and the freeway was mostly fine.

490
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,400
It was mainly affecting Mickey and friends.

491
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,800
Yeah, it was like that.

492
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,360
It was like a degree of traffic that would have been OK

493
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,400
where they're not, you know, like thousands and thousands of people

494
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,480
leaving one location with only one way out at the same.

495
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,080
So I got to Mickey and friends, saw the crowd.

496
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,480
Nope, never mind.

497
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,280
Went straight back on the tram.

498
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,840
And I went straight to Alice in Wonderland, which probably put this in my brain.

499
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,720
And I thought we should talk about this thing.

500
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,440
What was the weight? 15, maybe less, maybe like 10.

501
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,400
Wow. Yeah.

502
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,040
And I think it's a nice area to hang, especially at night.

503
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,600
Like that's an area that you maybe don't want to do in a hot summer sun.

504
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,240
But at night with those mad tea party lanterns

505
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,000
and the Matterhorn looks cool at night, I think that's and that's another thing

506
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,040
real estate wise that you get in the shadow of the of the Matterhorn.

507
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,560
And when you come out on that second layer, you get them at the Matterhorn

508
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,360
off in the distance.

509
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,840
It's a cool little pocket over there.

510
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,480
Yeah, it is. I went on this a couple of weeks ago with friend of the show,

511
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,560
Andrew Grissom, and then we went on that on the teacups right after.

512
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,680
This was like the last 15 minutes.

513
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,040
So we crammed we were like, can we do teacups right at the end?

514
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,480
And we got it like two minutes before. Nice.

515
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,880
And yeah, hell yeah.

516
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,880
What a hell yeah.

517
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,680
Rock and roll. Right.

518
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,160
Midnight teacup ride.

519
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,360
Too bad, Espros.

520
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,560
Too cool boys.

521
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,560
Yeah, I think I yeah, that night.

522
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,760
This is one of those I like.

523
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,000
It looks OK during the day, but at night it looks amazing.

524
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:34,400
I kind of I kind of feel like the outside of the ride looks OK

525
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,520
during the day. It's not my favorite visually of like the queue

526
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,480
and like of the exterior.

527
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,600
But at night, it's awesome. I don't know.

528
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,840
Well, you know, that might be a point in Mr.

529
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,240
Toad's favor that that the little like

530
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,040
the little outdoor courtyard part of that line is very neat.

531
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:56,520
And then you get inside and that that wooden toad statue and you're

532
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,760
you know, you're looking at the bookcase, the entry area.

533
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,920
Yeah. So that might be an argument that notches it over to Toad.

534
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:09,360
But right, because the area about round Alice doesn't beckon me until the night.

535
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,520
Night, I feel beckoned by it, but not during the day.

536
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Not that I just go, oh, there's that like cramped little line and like,

537
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,720
oh, yeah, yeah, the outside looks OK.

538
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,160
And then I then I remember, oh, it's a great ride.

539
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,960
It's a great dark ride.

540
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,320
You know what? I think you got to give it some credit for is that

541
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,720
I think I think you're correct today, you're saying.

542
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,400
But I think the that in 58 when it opened,

543
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:40,040
think about how this was not the new fantasy land that Tony Baxter oversaw

544
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,520
in the 80s when the fantasy land opened, it was much more of these

545
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,600
these flat carnival exteriors.

546
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,880
And then this thing joins three years after.

547
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,880
And it's a much more dynamic

548
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,280
exterior than all of them with the with the caterpillars

549
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,560
coming down that big vine.

550
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,240
You call it a vine or a leaf trail or what you call it.

551
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,560
But I think it was a super dynamic exterior compared to the other ones in.

552
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,680
Right at the time, for sure.

553
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,400
And it's two stories.

554
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,880
Yeah, coming out on the top.

555
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,920
The majority of the ride is the takes place over top of Mr.

556
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,000
Toad. Yeah, which I never knew.

557
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,680
You were above Mr. Toad.

558
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,360
And then the strange is where the duplex of attractions.

559
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,400
That's a good did.

560
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,800
I didn't see this when I was looking up.

561
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,560
But is it a situation where if like a fire alarm gets pulled on Toad,

562
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,280
they have to shut Alice down? I would think because that's the

563
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,960
that's the problem they're having with Avatar is that the river

564
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,880
ride and flight of passage are in the same building.

565
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,520
So if a fire alarm gets pulled in one of them, they have to shut both rides down,

566
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,280
which just destroys capacity for the land for an hour.

567
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,880
The whole part, I'm sure.

568
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,040
So I wonder if that's the same situation or maybe it just rarely happens.

569
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,200
It's interesting this guy ride got built at all

570
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:02,160
because the Alice movie was considered a flop on its first release in 1951.

571
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,520
Disney himself thought the problem was it didn't have a lot of heart.

572
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:13,520
The movie has multiple directors, I believe, five credited directors.

573
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,200
Really? Yeah.

574
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,640
And so like he threw it on like this,

575
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,040
an early episode of the Disneyland TV show, he like tossed it on there.

576
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,440
They cut it down to an hour.

577
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,040
Cut it down to an hour.

578
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,880
Well, I mean, then the the re releases is when it got successful,

579
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,840
especially during the psychedelic 60s.

580
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,280
Oh, yes. And they re released it with that in mind.

581
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:42,240
Yeah. Nodded to like for Disney, oddly cheeky to nod to the Jefferson

582
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,280
airplane, White Rabbit song.

583
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,320
I watched a video, a yesterworld video that was talking about a lot of this stuff.

584
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,920
And there's like clips of Alice Wonderland.

585
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,160
And let me this is a realization I had as I was looking all this stuff up.

586
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,280
I love Alice in Wonderland.

587
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,120
And I didn't remember if you asked me last week, I would have said,

588
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
oh, yeah, I like some of it.

589
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,600
I like to I apparently love Alice in Wonderland, the movie, the Disney movie.

590
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,680
Because as I was watching this, then I went and just watched clips from the movie.

591
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,640
I went, oh, yeah.

592
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,880
Like, I guess I haven't watched this in 25 years.

593
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,600
But so many that just like the shot of Alice looking through

594
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,120
the handles on the teak on the teapots.

595
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,480
I was like, oh, my God.

596
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,800
Like, I just started like getting child memories of like, oh, awesome.

597
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,600
Awesome. All like her in the room shrinking, growing big with a doorknob.

598
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,640
I remember just being fascinated by this.

599
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:41,560
And it was dormant in me up until hours, like days ago.

600
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,960
I rewatched when Netflix very first started

601
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,760
streaming a lot of the old, old Disney movies, like six or seven years ago.

602
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:55,200
I rewatched a bunch and I was shocked at how similarly how much I enjoyed Alice.

603
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,800
The characters are fantastic.

604
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,480
The design is great. The colors are amazing.

605
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,640
And then I was shocked how short it is.

606
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,680
It's only 75 minutes long.

607
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,800
But it moves and everything like it's all great voice actors.

608
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,640
All the character designs are specific.

609
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,480
All the sequences are very, very imaginative, very imaginative.

610
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,040
Sorry to correct myself.

611
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,200
There were three credited directors, but 13 people had the story by credit.

612
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,040
Wow. Wow. Yes. Yeah.

613
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:25,320
So that that was another criticism of the time of like, oh, is it to just join in?

614
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,240
Are there too many cooks on this one?

615
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,920
I guess the fact that it is all of these little like disconnected sequences.

616
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,960
Yeah. Way. Maybe that was the the Waltz

617
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,240
like insecurity at the time was is like there's not this

618
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,120
big story that you feel this emotion about.

619
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,720
But I think maybe I liked it for that reason, because I yeah, I you know,

620
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,440
my favorite things as a kid were specials and whatever.

621
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,040
And Sesame Street, which is a new thing every two minutes.

622
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,800
And I liked it for that reason that it was like a lot of like

623
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,160
just choppy little.

624
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,360
I think that's the source material is is split up.

625
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,600
And Alice's adventures in Wonderland and through the looking glass

626
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,200
is kind of split up into chunks. Sure. Yeah.

627
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,400
So I yeah, I read the Queen of which playing croquet.

628
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,240
I was like, I love this. Yeah.

629
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,520
I forgot I loved this.

630
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:15,200
The painting of the roses has just a real I just have some like baby brain.

631
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,240
Yeah. I meant to I just think that's neat. Yeah.

632
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,320
Somehow, for sure.

633
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,920
I think all of that stuff and I honestly going on this

634
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,360
the ride a couple of weeks ago, it didn't necessarily unlock

635
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,640
what I felt watching the clips of the movie.

636
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,080
So I still really like the ride.

637
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,520
I just didn't quite I didn't remember yet

638
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,400
that I loved Alice in Wonderland.

639
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,840
So I so it's official.

640
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,200
I love Alice in Wonderland, the Disney movie. Sure.

641
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,040
And you adore the two Tim Burton ones, right?

642
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,080
No, I didn't say that.

643
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,160
Twisted. I did not say that.

644
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,080
Hugely popular internationally.

645
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,440
Oh, yeah. Very successful.

646
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,280
Second one. Second one, I don't think as much, but probably not as much.

647
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,680
But there's like a walkthrough garden at the Shanghai Disney.

648
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:03,120
Like, oh, yes. In Shanghai, the attraction is the gigantic

649
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,480
Helena Bonham Carter head. Yes.

650
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,880
Which is a rare case of the live action

651
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,640
remake getting the parks treatment over the cartoon.

652
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,040
Yeah. I walked by a Lion King Cart at California Adventure, and I was like,

653
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,480
why is it stupid old simple Simba

654
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:29,640
and not the fully dimensionalized, the photo real lion that I love?

655
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,400
Why is this my dad's Simba?

656
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,880
Yeah, I want this real lion that can't really open its mouth.

657
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,240
I don't want the one voice by James Earl Jones.

658
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,440
I want the one voice by James Earl Jones.

659
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,400
I guess we are wrong.

660
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,160
The second one only made 300 million and the first one made a billion.

661
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,920
Yikes. Wow. So I mean, a lot of money, but like that's one Star Wars land.

662
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,680
Yeah. One is a massive hit and the other is like great drop offs.

663
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,680
And who would ever blame them for making a sequel? Right.

664
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,960
They'd be like, this is slam dunk.

665
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,200
Yeah. What what does that is that one of those people

666
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,480
that didn't actually like it as much as they thought?

667
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,640
Yeah, it might be the Johnny Depp syndrome.

668
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,120
They were saying that was that internationally.

669
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,720
I don't think I though the Fantastic Beasts had a very similar.

670
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,880
Yeah, but this is years before that.

671
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,120
Yeah. I don't.

672
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,920
And I think especially I don't know who was keeping.

673
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,880
I don't know why.

674
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,000
That's why the latest Hollywood vampires

675
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,760
see the as opposed to the first one sold 1200 copies.

676
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,160
This one only sold the nine and nine hundred fifty. Yeah.

677
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,040
So Johnny Depp, precipitous.

678
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,040
Depth effect.

679
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,120
Let's let's say is personally just more like I think people are a little

680
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,880
that coincides with people being burned out.

681
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,760
I mean, yes, that's like it's going to be him.

682
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,120
He's going to be doing a voice doesn't have the same effects that it used to.

683
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,760
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

684
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,560
People have been let down by those a number of times.

685
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:04,080
Remember when we all watched the Kevin Smith film in which you.

686
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,280
Yoga hosers. Yes.

687
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,720
Started fast forwarding through it.

688
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,360
Almighty listener might not have heard those words.

689
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,400
They might not know that Johnny Depp is in this film and you might watch it

690
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,360
and you might not even see him.

691
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,320
But keep an eye on a certain plastic looking man.

692
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,600
Your favorite character from Tusk might make a reappearance.

693
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,760
Is it the same character?

694
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,840
It's the same private detective character.

695
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,840
What? This is another this is a second view of skewniverse.

696
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,520
There is a second view of skewniverse that has the Tusk

697
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,600
yoga hosers and then isn't there one more or or did it not get made?

698
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,640
I don't think the third one got me.

699
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,120
Red State is not in this second view of skewniverse.

700
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,400
No, I think Red State stands alone.

701
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,440
OK, I forgot about Red State.

702
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,360
I watched Red State, too.

703
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,200
Mm hmm. And it's not.

704
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,960
Why am I having the Johnny Depp detective movie?

705
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,280
Oh, Mordecai. The one you love.

706
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,320
Yes. It's not Mordecai.

707
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,000
He's not playing Mordecai in these either.

708
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,960
That's a different universe.

709
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,920
I would you also believe that these,

710
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,120
you know, Red State and yoga hosers also not represented in the Disney park.

711
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,000
Shopping. Did they buy?

712
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,200
Did Disney buy those?

713
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,800
Do they own some of it via Miramax?

714
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,480
I know Miramax doesn't some Miramax isn't really them anymore.

715
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,200
Yeah, right. They sold that.

716
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,920
So that's a whole but then, yeah,

717
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,640
we'll have to look into that. Don't know.

718
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,080
Yes. Candy, you're an update.

719
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,280
My teeth are starting to hurt.

720
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,680
Yeah, I've got a bad feeling in the back of my throat.

721
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,880
I'm feeling my molars. Are we sick now?

722
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,080
I drugged you unknowingly.

723
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,520
I'm sorry.

724
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:49,960
But maybe but maybe we don't even realize how good and crazy this episode is.

725
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,320
And people tell us you didn't even know you were you were tripping

726
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,960
and you just thought that your teeth hurt.

727
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,200
But really, you are on the right of your lives.

728
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,280
One pill makes you a larger one pill makes you small.

729
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,800
You know, I'm going to set my next your throat taste like shit.

730
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,400
The urine now is sitting on this

731
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,640
this table I have next to the couch right by Dexter Jekster,

732
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,280
my Dexter Jekster toy from Attack of the Clones,

733
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,240
diner owner from Attack of the Clones.

734
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,320
And as soon as I see him start moving,

735
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,520
oh, no, it's kick time.

736
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,400
You know, looking at it earlier, I did get the feeling of when like

737
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,200
the Ghostbusters are trepidatiously standing around the ooze.

738
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,960
And then Ray makes the toaster dance Ghostbusters to.

739
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,960
OK, yeah, that's right.

740
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,520
They realize it can be be positive as well.

741
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,240
But right now, still at the negative feeling towards it.

742
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,040
If Dexter starts scooping up that urine and using it in some recipes.

743
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,440
So if I play higher and higher,

744
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,400
Jackie Wilson, Jackie Wilson's higher and higher than maybe pure.

745
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,840
Something good will happen.

746
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,960
Something good, something pure.

747
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,640
Am I quoting that correctly?

748
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,320
That is correct.

749
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:57,640
Yeah.

750
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,240
Nobody says this line like get a gunpoint way.

751
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,440
You can tell he's kind of like, I don't think I like the narrative

752
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,160
thrust of this movie as much.

753
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
He's checked out already.

754
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,920
I think so, yeah.

755
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,760
But he will be in the new one.

756
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,360
You think he's now like just when they all do whatever you want.

757
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,880
I mean, you'd probably be like tilted two days on it.

758
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,360
He's not going to be in it.

759
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,720
I mean, he was in the other one, too.

760
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,680
He did the other one.

761
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,400
He did the press for the other one.

762
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,000
Mm hmm. Oh, yeah, that's right.

763
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,160
Right. Yeah.

764
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,080
So like, I don't know, he he probably needs money.

765
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,920
Yeah, that's right.

766
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,280
Now, he owns a minor like baseball team.

767
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,640
That's one of those things that you would think like

768
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,480
like, because like, you know, Bill Murray press on the Internet is so.

769
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,080
Oh, my God.

770
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,560
Jesus Christ have through have risen again.

771
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,360
Bill fucking Murray.

772
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,160
And then like, oh, my God, he's going to be in the new one.

773
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,200
And he was nobody care.

774
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,480
And then it'll be like, yeah, right.

775
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,560
The new one again.

776
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,960
People go, holy shit, stop the fucking presses.

777
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,560
Bill. And then he will be in no one like that either.

778
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,680
And only the same thing.

779
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,240
And yeah, I know the mist.

780
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,840
That's another my mistake.

781
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,600
There might be the Bill Murray effect is what you're referring to

782
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,600
where there's diminishing returns.

783
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,880
I think, yes, similar to the Johnny Depp effect.

784
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,320
Yes, there's a bill Murray effects.

785
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,200
And but there will never, never be a diminishing amount of blog

786
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:19,000
articles about Bill Murray doing anything and bothering people at parties and

787
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,640
being annoying. Yeah.

788
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,520
Running around being annoying and getting away with it.

789
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,600
Well, I guess I'm so polite.

790
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,760
Look, hey, we like things he used to do.

791
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,080
This is nothing to do with the.

792
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,400
I'm not trying to form an anti Bill Murray stance.

793
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,920
No, but it's an anti Bill Murray culture stance.

794
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,160
I think that's it.

795
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,760
I guess the culture, that's the problem.

796
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,280
Wandering 60 something year old man.

797
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,840
But you kind of liked him as blue live.

798
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,400
I did like him as blue.

799
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,920
I'm just I'm not as big of a fan of him.

800
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,000
I seem like roaming from town to town.

801
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,720
Touching people like and saying, you'll never believe that I was here.

802
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,560
But that's the story.

803
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,000
If Baloo the bear walked in and said, you never believe I was here.

804
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,160
Amazing.

805
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,160
You'll never believe what a terrible father I was in real life.

806
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,400
Baloo saying that.

807
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,040
Yeah, you regret his time with Mowgli.

808
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,400
Didn't do a good job.

809
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,040
My little buddy boy.

810
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,600
Great pilot, though. Great pilot.

811
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,120
Kept on carnage and check.

812
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,240
So Alice and Wonderland.

813
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,160
Always happy to see

814
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,360
an Ed Wynn vehicle.

815
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,800
Ed Wynn, of course, and Alice is a Mad Hatter.

816
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,600
Yeah. Which was a newer edition during the 1980s.

817
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,560
Re-update.

818
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,760
Oh, so they didn't talk before.

819
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,640
Well, they did. It was like a nightmare.

820
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,960
OK, so the original version of this was a nightmare.

821
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,680
That's the revelation of the Yesterworld video, which I didn't know because

822
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,000
old Claude Coats Claude Coats was involved.

823
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,600
Wanted to make it creepy.

824
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,520
And Claude Coats was the person responsible for

825
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,760
Snow White's scary adventures in Florida being so scary.

826
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,040
Yeah. And the scarier part of the Haunted Mansion.

827
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,800
Haunted Mansion, the earlier stuff.

828
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,680
OK, OK. Yeah, because it was Mark Davis and Claude Coats

829
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,680
who ultimately both had the biggest influence on when they finally decided

830
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,280
on what they were doing with Haunted Mansion and Claude wanted it scary.

831
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,600
Mark wanted it whimsical. OK, OK.

832
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,600
And Claude was a real creep.

833
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,960
I mean, I'm just saying like a fun crew.

834
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,880
Yeah, I know. I don't know anything about him personally.

835
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,240
Well, because you got to, you know, I mean, because I was looking up Claude Coats

836
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,440
stuff in relation to this, and it is very impressive that he was like

837
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,840
he was a background painter on so many of the early animated films.

838
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,640
And then he, you know, one of those that we talk about where Walt says,

839
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,520
all right, you're going here now.

840
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,200
And he just without missing a beat does it.

841
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,000
I read an interview where he talked about how

842
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,640
it's basically like with Disneyland set to open in a couple of months.

843
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,880
Walt says, hey, we've come down and maybe do some painting and stuff.

844
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,800
And then the story changes to, hey, that that professional scenic

845
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,880
painting company that I hired, they only have time to do Peter Pan and Snow White.

846
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,480
So you got to paint Mr. Toad.

847
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,160
And he's he says, well, so I was going from a medium

848
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,240
that was 20 inches to 18 feet.

849
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,840
He's completely shifting the kind of painting he's doing.

850
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,680
Did incredible job.

851
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,240
And he worked on all the other ones, too.

852
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,800
So he worked on the first three dark rides.

853
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,560
And then this was his chance to go to town and design it all.

854
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,000
Yeah. Ken Anderson also in a similar boat

855
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,040
where like worked on the original movies, painting the original movies.

856
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,560
And then he's painting the rides, you know, weird.

857
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,640
And that it's some of the same people from like he paint

858
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:41,040
that he did backgrounds on Snow White and then is, you know,

859
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,720
a couple of decades later doing the same

860
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,840
going taking you back into that world, but in a whole other medium.

861
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,640
Pretty. Yeah.

862
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,440
But it's to where like this guy, it's all him.

863
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,080
The exterior is him, the way it plays out.

864
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,360
The story is him.

865
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,120
The track layout is him.

866
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,640
And the vehicle is him.

867
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,360
Like the sketches are Claude Coates. Right.

868
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,600
And I found a story about that where he wanted the right vehicles

869
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,320
to be playing cards.

870
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,840
He showed that to Walt.

871
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,120
Walt said, I don't like it. Do a caterpillar.

872
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,880
And then he sketched up a caterpillar by the end of the day.

873
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:14,960
And that was that.

874
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,880
And then they somebody came around and said, we need you to fill out a form

875
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,800
to because we have to patent this vehicle.

876
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,880
And he said, I wouldn't feel right patenting it.

877
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,240
It was Walt's idea.

878
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,800
Wow. They said they actually said, no, no, no.

879
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,240
You will be on the patent.

880
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,040
And for that, he got an extra ten dollars from the company.

881
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,280
Wow. Wow.

882
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:44,160
But in but the patent office has, you know, like a very clinical drawing of,

883
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,040
you can't make your own caterpillar vehicle.

884
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,280
That's cool. Yeah. Yeah.

885
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,360
Stuff. It does seem like because Snow White, scary adventure

886
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,440
is the one everyone talks about as being really scary.

887
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,520
And I obviously didn't go on this original version.

888
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:00,520
I was not alive, nor did I visit Disneyland till the 2000s.

889
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,880
But it does have a similar vibe from the pictures

890
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,960
that are in that yesterworld video of like of like

891
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,240
a little twisted in relation to actually what the character designs were.

892
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:18,200
Like he was going for something like a little surreal and a little scarier.

893
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:24,320
Because the Cheshire cat is like a warped version of the Cheshire cat.

894
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,360
And I think it seems like it's on purpose.

895
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,520
With like gigantic pupils.

896
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,800
Yeah. Like what? Like super dilated.

897
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,400
Like what's happening to us is this urine kicks in. Right.

898
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,200
You guys look crazy.

899
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,880
If you looked in a mirror lately.

900
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,080
And it seems like it's focused like much like Snow White.

901
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:46,760
It focuses on like the scary stuff versus the fun stuff.

902
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,600
Yeah. Yeah. Like the Mad Tea Party.

903
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,920
There's no fun element of it.

904
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,440
It's just big cutouts of the March of the March hair and the man.

905
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,640
They're giant heads and smiling demonic smiles.

906
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,720
Yeah. Noise unsettling noises supposedly.

907
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,560
And just like there's the flowers look creepy as hell.

908
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,760
Like jump out at you.

909
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,520
If there's there's spinning teapots

910
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,400
or teacups in this ride, there are any more original version.

911
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,720
And they're spinning wildly.

912
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,120
And it kind of looks like they're going to slam into your vehicle.

913
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,760
Which I like. I think they should have put that in still.

914
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,600
That's kind of cool.

915
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,040
That's one of the things I was like,

916
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,480
I get why this can't be like weird and surreal anymore.

917
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,200
But I was like, those teacups sound fun.

918
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,640
Yeah. Because there's something similar.

919
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:35,600
Like it reminded me a little bit of the Pooh's Honey Hunt

920
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,880
with the trackless vehicles.

921
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,040
Yeah. That shoot a character car at you.

922
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,760
And I was yeah, I was thinking of that when I watched a different video.

923
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,200
And forgive me, I don't have the credit for it.

924
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,800
But some some other videos said that in the early days, the Mad Tea Party,

925
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,720
that the characters might come in and like join you in their car.

926
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:59,320
Like Jason tried to do with a couple on the inside out emotional whirlwind.

927
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,840
I went on my own emotional whirlwind.

928
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,440
Step one shame.

929
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,120
But this was a ride I forgot to mention when we talked about emotional whirlwind.

930
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,960
When they rethemed that, they flew it to Italy to be redesigned,

931
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,600
because that where the manufacturer was. Really?

932
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,520
This ride they were able to do in Anaheim.

933
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:25,240
But there's been, you know, Jim and Len were talking recently about how long

934
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:30,120
it takes Imagineering to announce something and then get it built and opened.

935
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,840
Maybe it's the flying stuff to Italy is slowing stuff down.

936
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,960
I feel like they did the new fantasy land in the 80s reasonably quickly.

937
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,600
They just banged it out. The grand scheme of things.

938
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,280
Yeah. Yeah. We blew it up.

939
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,640
They blew a big hole. Yeah, they blew a big hole.

940
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,800
Speaking of that big hole,

941
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,640
I saw pictures in that yester yesterworld video.

942
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,520
I had never seen what it actually looked like when they were redoing everything.

943
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,320
Me neither. Yeah. And boy, it's chaos.

944
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,120
It's scary. Yeah.

945
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,520
Because like they got it, those dark rides in fantasy land

946
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,960
when they were making new fantasy land.

947
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,640
And there is just a big chunk taken out of the castle.

948
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,720
I don't know where he got these photos because I've never seen them before.

949
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,120
But they're just it's terrified.

950
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:18,480
It's like what everyone imagines, like the post apocalyptic theme park looks like.

951
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,360
And it's just a castle pieces of the castle gutted, just empty thing,

952
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,640
because they took everything out of those dark rides to redo them.

953
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,400
Which is what Tony Baxter has talked about, that he like when it was in that state,

954
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,840
he was looking around like, what have I done?

955
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,800
And I can totally I mean, I knew it in the abstract, but now seeing the pictures,

956
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,360
I would if I was standing in there, I'd go, oh, my God.

957
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,960
Yeah, that would be traumatic. That's traumatic.

958
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,840
Well, imagine if like a kid somehow got a view of that

959
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,680
because the park never closed.

960
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,840
But in but to redo fantasy land in the 80s, they did close all of fantasy land

961
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:55,160
and they lifted the drawbridge so nobody could go into fantasy land.

962
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:59,200
And if a kid had somehow like snuck in there and gotten a view and like, oh, my God.

963
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,280
Could you see it on the skyway?

964
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,640
Oh, I don't know what they did on the skyway.

965
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,640
Because if that's a good question. Oh, yeah.

966
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,160
Because maybe you would just see just holes punched

967
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,560
into the side of fantasy land in the castle.

968
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,000
Yeah, I had stomped around like the Jack and the Beanstalk giant

969
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,880
just kicked doors in was just like the pirate ship.

970
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,920
They were going to try to save the Peter Pan pirate ship.

971
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,040
And when they tried to move it, it was just too many years of wear and tear.

972
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,720
And it just started collapsing. Right.

973
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,800
It's funny that there were guests stomping around on that all day, every day.

974
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:33,000
And they tried to move it once and it fell apart. Yeah. Yeah.

975
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,320
Like like a slight nudge.

976
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:41,440
I found another related thing from Tony Baxter.

977
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,560
But I'm pulling a lot of stuff from the the ticket magazine.

978
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,640
I went and found my issue of that about Alice in Wonderland magazine in the

979
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,160
I think it's in there that Tony Baxter is quoted as saying that he would like

980
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,800
he he like especially fell in love with the Alice in Wonderland ride

981
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,400
while like looking down on it from Holiday Hill.

982
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:01,840
Oh, what a holiday.

983
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,800
Oh, what the make out pill is this?

984
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,920
Yeah. Yeah. This weird like I forgot about that part of it.

985
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,200
It was a matter of it was my matter of runs, right?

986
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,840
Yeah. Just kind of a big mountain.

987
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,880
We're better than that.

988
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,000
And teens would go up in neck.

989
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,160
Oh, boy. Not Tony, not our Tony.

990
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,120
No, Tony wouldn't disrespect the park like that.

991
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,120
But I other teens went and looked at at track layout.

992
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,560
And that's why he is where he is today.

993
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,000
I do like the idea of like just so many teens making out and Tony's

994
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,720
like sitting in between just like ignoring all of them,

995
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,120
but like sketching the track layout of a drafting paper.

996
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,120
And yeah, well, you like that idea because that's

997
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,560
what I would do. Three of us.

998
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:42,240
Yeah. Yeah, really.

999
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:48,040
But so yeah, but he you know, it's interesting that he said that he like

1000
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:53,040
yeah, he loved looking down on the way the vehicles moved and slinked around

1001
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,880
from the second floor down to the first on that big vine piece.

1002
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:01,000
But then when he went on the ride, he always felt like and that's it.

1003
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,320
And that's that childhood feeling of like it's not as good as what I want it to be

1004
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,600
when I'm looking at it from afar.

1005
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,560
He got to go in and like make it right in his head

1006
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:15,160
and give you this bang at the end of with the the unbirthday scene

1007
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:20,400
and the big, yeah, little extra room that they had because I was not there until 83.

1008
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:24,080
No, that sequence was upstairs where the Queen of Hearts is.

1009
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,440
And they were able to move in and of course, redo it

1010
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,280
and add all the animatronics

1011
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,080
in the 80s redo.

1012
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,520
And that opened up the space for that Queen of Hearts sequence.

1013
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,840
And the King of Hearts is there, too.

1014
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,360
He's real little and he's behind the Queen.

1015
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:46,280
He's a little short king, but he's not a short king in our current definition of it.

1016
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,240
But what do you mean?

1017
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,400
He's a little short king, but not in the common, not in the common,

1018
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:57,720
not in the way the kids say short kings, where it's like shorter, confident people.

1019
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,080
Oh, it's like me.

1020
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:02,480
I was going to say, I've seen people online refer to you as a short.

1021
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,320
Yeah.

1022
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,960
So I think that's what you're getting.

1023
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,200
I have. Yeah. Yeah.

1024
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,480
Probably on our Facebook group, but

1025
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,840
people are saying, but people are saying people are talking with the short kings.

1026
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,320
Yeah. So this one.

1027
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,000
Yeah. So, yeah, it would just end.

1028
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,160
I haven't actually seen the video of it.

1029
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,560
I think it was just the vine would wrap around back to the loading.

1030
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,480
Right. Vine kind of was the ending.

1031
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,360
Yeah. And then originally, too, like all the other fantasy land rides,

1032
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,280
this was just your first person like you were supposed to be Alice initially.

1033
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,200
Yes, correct. Alice was not visible anywhere.

1034
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:44,040
And Alice didn't even speak as she does today because in 83,

1035
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,560
they added narration when you're going down the rabbit hole.

1036
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:51,200
And they got the original voice actress, Catherine Beaumont,

1037
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,120
who was also the voice of Wendy.

1038
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,880
Oh, and it's still alive.

1039
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,520
Wow. And like was still doing voice, like still like

1040
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,600
adding voice stuff, apparently up until 10 years ago or something.

1041
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,320
I don't know the actual amount of time, but still sounded enough like,

1042
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,280
yeah, like your young self.

1043
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,480
That's amazing. So that's fun.

1044
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,520
You know, it's the thing I want to give this ride credit for is

1045
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,520
somebody somebody correct me if I'm wrong, but is this is this the first

1046
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:23,920
Disneyland or Disney theme park indoor outdoor attraction?

1047
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,120
Oh, that's interesting.

1048
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:28,560
I cannot think about that of what else that might be.

1049
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,240
You may have to people who are tunnel.

1050
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,320
And that wasn't there yet.

1051
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,400
Oh, yeah, you're right.

1052
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,000
You may have to take tunnels out of this definition.

1053
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,480
Train counts as an indoor outdoor ride. Huh?

1054
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,040
Dude, our tunnels do tunnels count is question one.

1055
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,280
What was mine train?

1056
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,440
When was mine train through nature's wonderland?

1057
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:53,040
There was some version of that, but I'm not sure that it had indoor scenes.

1058
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,160
Yeah, yeah.

1059
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,240
And count. I could be wrong about that one, but I couldn't.

1060
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,280
I don't know. Yeah, you're probably right.

1061
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,760
Because it's 58. So it's like it's not.

1062
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,560
There haven't been too many.

1063
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:05,800
I haven't been too many rides in general.

1064
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,560
Many attractions. Yeah.

1065
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:10,520
I mean, it's certainly unique, especially under the crop of Disneyland,

1066
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:14,520
Fantasyland rides and the building alone.

1067
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,080
Like you were saying, the facades all used to just be kind of tense

1068
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,960
before they they gussied them up in the 80s.

1069
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,160
But this was always, you know, the sort of castly looking thing, wasn't it?

1070
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,520
Let's see. I think I like that.

1071
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,760
It's that it's castle that it feels like an extension of the castle.

1072
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,560
It's like ties everything together.

1073
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,120
Yeah, I see. Yeah.

1074
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,760
I also like that little bathroom nook over.

1075
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,760
That's one of the bathrooms.

1076
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,960
I'm most fond of, you know, with the Cheshire cat

1077
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,320
poking out nearby and isn't that great?

1078
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:49,240
Isn't the men's sign is the is the short.

1079
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,960
That's a great photo spot is the Cheshire cat.

1080
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,440
The bathrooms. Yeah.

1081
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,640
Oh, the bathrooms. Yes. OK.

1082
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,160
All bathrooms are great.

1083
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,160
He's like just above head like your head.

1084
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,400
That's fun. Like you can get some fun pics there.

1085
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,480
I think I have several over the years.

1086
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,600
Fake rocks. Fake rocks.

1087
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,000
Yeah. Good point.

1088
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:16,440
I think they recently had to redo the outdoor squiggly part of the track

1089
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,880
because of what?

1090
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,320
Safety safety regulations.

1091
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,920
And that part is my own like that part could look maybe a little better,

1092
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,400
but that's sort of we're not happy about how wide.

1093
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,400
Yeah. That track became.

1094
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,920
Yeah, I get it.

1095
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,280
And there's like there's no other way to do it.

1096
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,160
It is what it is. Yeah.

1097
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,200
But the other the everything else I like.

1098
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,200
But you know, it's you know, it's the thing I really like is how,

1099
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,880
you know, it's right.

1100
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,080
So the car goes outdoors.

1101
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,040
So you're waiting and you can see the path.

1102
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,560
You can see what it's going to do.

1103
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,720
But not until you come out of those doors and are actually on the ride.

1104
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,960
You see the other side of that open book and see the little

1105
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,360
the little shoes left behind. Oh, yeah.

1106
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,320
On top of that toast.

1107
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,000
I like how that's a little like that's a little secret.

1108
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,840
And you don't get to find out about it unless you actually

1109
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,480
brave enough to go on the ride.

1110
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,760
The mushroom. Yeah.

1111
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,720
On top of the mushroom. That used to be the ticket booth.

1112
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,280
That's a nod.

1113
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,640
That's a nod because it was in the yesterday world video where there's

1114
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,760
like a people thought that the caterpillar was in the ticket booth.

1115
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:22,240
Well, the idea I believe what I read was that

1116
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:26,800
it's a nod that the caterpillar turned into a like pitter

1117
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,200
pattered away. I see.

1118
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,000
Off of that mushroom or turn it to a butterfly.

1119
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,640
This is coming back into my head.

1120
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,080
Something weird.

1121
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:34,920
I was feeling OK.

1122
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,720
And then like some weird taste started hitting me in the mouth a little bit.

1123
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,960
We shouldn't say we all had.

1124
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,200
I mean, I don't know how to say the amount, but it was like less than

1125
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,440
a few spoons. You gave us a spoonful of piss.

1126
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,360
Mm hmm. A real mild

1127
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:53,880
of spoonful of piss and just a spoonful of piss.

1128
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,000
In the least delightful way.

1129
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Yeah. As an aftertie.

1130
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,680
Yeah. Yeah.

1131
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:01,920
Aperty for.

1132
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,280
Yeah. Yeah.

1133
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,920
We'll keep giving you progress reports, but I don't think it's going anywhere

1134
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,440
good for any. No, it's not.

1135
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,040
The let's see.

1136
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:12,920
Where was I?

1137
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,920
I think. Oh, yeah.

1138
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:18,280
The initial plans for this was a walkthrough.

1139
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,720
OK. It was not going to be a dark ride.

1140
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,960
They eventually did a walkthrough in Paris,

1141
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,960
mostly just of the Queen of Hearts stuff.

1142
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,560
Right. You did it right.

1143
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,880
I don't know if I don't think I ended up going into it.

1144
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,440
OK. I like the idea of that.

1145
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,960
And there's a restaurant in Tokyo.

1146
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,200
There's Queen of Hearts.

1147
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,360
Oh, yeah, there is. Yeah.

1148
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:42,200
That was unbelievably crowded when I was passing by.

1149
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,360
It's very popular.

1150
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,840
Yeah. And but it was going to be a walkthrough.

1151
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,680
There's I think this is all from that yesterworld thing, I think.

1152
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,040
And there was a land.

1153
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,880
It was going to be a thing called Anything Can Happen land,

1154
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,600
which is I think not a good thing to say.

1155
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,680
No rules, no laws.

1156
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,680
Yeah. Maybe that's not good.

1157
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,960
I mean, I guess if that was still the case, like then we wouldn't be upset

1158
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,000
with the caterpillar smoking his opium.

1159
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,480
Because anything can happen.

1160
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,320
Yeah. Yeah.

1161
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,280
Anything can go down.

1162
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,000
It's a good thing Holiday Hill was not at Anything Can Happen land.

1163
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:15,680
Oh, boy.

1164
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,280
Because then it would have been, you know, babies could happen.

1165
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,320
Morgy on Holiday Hill.

1166
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,400
But it was going to be a walkthrough.

1167
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:27,400
And this is going to be the only only ride I see

1168
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:32,520
where I almost see the value in it being a walkthrough as opposed to

1169
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,120
a ride vehicle. Yeah.

1170
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:38,840
Because like Pirates was going to be a walkthrough upon a mansion walkthrough.

1171
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:39,880
And then they became right.

1172
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,080
And I'm like, I don't know.

1173
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,480
I mean, a haunted mansion would be really cool to walk through it, too.

1174
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:46,600
But this one especially, because like they were going to have a scene

1175
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,360
like Alice in the room where she doesn't know how to get out

1176
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,000
and the door handle and talking.

1177
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,360
And I was like that proportions of that in my mind seem very cool

1178
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:01,440
to be able to walk into that room that is all fucked up.

1179
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,560
Like it's the scene in The Simpsons where they rebuild Ned's house.

1180
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,360
And it's like that would be fun to like, yeah, do that.

1181
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:09,800
And it's Willy Wonka.

1182
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,600
Same thing where it's like the proportions are weird. Right.

1183
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,640
And maybe that's just too hard to like

1184
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,040
people would trip over, like angles and things.

1185
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,160
Probably hard to do.

1186
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,560
But walking is an inherent part of Alice in Wonderland.

1187
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:28,040
She's like wandering through trying to find a way out from this.

1188
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,320
Let's call it a nightmare world, like a whimsical, but then frustrating

1189
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,880
dream place.

1190
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:39,760
Because the ride as it is now is a very good, very good dark ride of Alice.

1191
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,800
But I do think you're missing some of like the trippy stuff,

1192
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,920
which maybe you got a little more from the original version of it being like

1193
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,760
kind of this hallucinogenic thing.

1194
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,000
But I was like, if you're walking through a couple of those things

1195
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,200
where the proportions are all weird and you're sort of like,

1196
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:57,640
I don't know, you're questioning how big you are versus something else.

1197
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:58,760
I don't know that did.

1198
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,360
I when I was watching that, I was like, oh, this would be real cool

1199
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,400
if they could have done something that would have given you a little bit

1200
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,720
of a taste of of that movie or feeling like.

1201
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:13,080
Well, I think I think walkthroughs as a genre just never really took off for them.

1202
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,040
Right. Yeah. They're rare at this point in time.

1203
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:19,280
One of those in Disney Paris and a cool one, this 20,000 leagues

1204
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,880
thing in Discoveryland.

1205
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,720
But besides that, they don't frequently.

1206
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,200
I think it was on Jim and Len.

1207
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,280
And I didn't even realize this in Hong Kong.

1208
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,280
They do Halloween mazes.

1209
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,560
Really? Walk through mazes behind Main Street.

1210
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,320
Whoa. Or like maybe alongside, like behind the shops on Main Street.

1211
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,320
I'm unclear of where it is.

1212
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,160
But in general, yeah, Disney doesn't do that.

1213
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:44,040
That has become a thing with Universal and Nats and everything

1214
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,680
with the Halloween stuff.

1215
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,680
But in general, I guess, I guess, I don't know.

1216
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,080
It's easier to control people if they're an old vehicle.

1217
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,640
Yeah. Maybe that's why.

1218
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,320
But it does feel like certain things would be real cool.

1219
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,320
Well, the walkthrough Sleeping Beauty Castle, I guess.

1220
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,080
It's true. It's a walk through.

1221
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,560
Nobody's ever up there.

1222
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,040
Yeah, we walked up there.

1223
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,160
I was there with my family not too long ago.

1224
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,080
My mom likes it. It looks great, honestly.

1225
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,520
It's real great. That's nice.

1226
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,880
There's a couple of really great scenes.

1227
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,920
The one where you look down into the. Yeah.

1228
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,440
Castle is really cool.

1229
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,360
Like, it's very cool.

1230
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,000
It's obviously like low scale.

1231
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,040
The scale isn't too big, but there was briefly a walk through

1232
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,240
in Tomorrowland of sets and props from 20,000 leagues under the sea.

1233
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,440
I think we talked about on that episode.

1234
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:28,080
Like, that's where the Oregon first was before they used it for the Haunted Mansion.

1235
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,000
And that was surprisingly a big hit.

1236
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,200
Yeah.

1237
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,280
So we walk through the cool thing.

1238
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,000
I don't think about a walk through Disney.

1239
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,320
That's all I'm saying.

1240
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,920
It's not the worst way, especially to like, you know,

1241
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:44,120
if you think of them as daytime haunt mazes.

1242
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,600
Yeah, it's not the worst.

1243
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,760
And if they have a bunch of props from something,

1244
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:52,360
sooner, they do do this temporarily sometimes.

1245
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,160
Yeah.

1246
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,640
What do you mean?

1247
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:59,760
Like like like maybe Universal has done this a tiny bit.

1248
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,920
I think there was some like they I think they may have had like a Casper

1249
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,680
walk through. Oh, really?

1250
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,800
Around when Casper came out.

1251
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:07,720
Did you was it a scare?

1252
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:11,680
I mean, was it like lightly fun, scary or I don't think I don't know if I did it.

1253
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,640
Was I too scared to go into a Casper walk through?

1254
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,640
He was a ghost.

1255
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:18,720
You got to give him that.

1256
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,960
Certainly might have been a little boy, but he was a little ghost.

1257
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,320
I do know what you mean of like short run, like

1258
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,920
lightly set dress rooms and props and stuff is very popular.

1259
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,960
Comic con too of like pop up.

1260
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:31,920
Oh, yeah.

1261
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,880
They did. I mean, they did do that Ninja Turtle one out here.

1262
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,400
Yeah. They had it in the parking garage.

1263
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,600
Oh, yeah.

1264
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,560
And you would get a toy at the end.

1265
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:41,880
I didn't do it. I've heard about it.

1266
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,040
And I'm insanely jealous.

1267
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,600
I can't believe I didn't do that.

1268
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:48,640
It's why in the world was I not told my friend who had like one all the time

1269
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,040
said you just get a toy every time.

1270
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:52,360
I think it was one of the six core first line.

1271
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:57,440
It wasn't like, yeah, it wasn't like you were getting man Ray or Mountie Moose.

1272
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,760
I don't know those.

1273
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,200
But I'm saying like it was a core like four turtles and maybe splinter

1274
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,200
April shredder. But you get a toy.

1275
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,200
Yeah. It's wild.

1276
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,840
So you go through the sewer and then get a toy.

1277
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,480
It's my dream. Walkthroughs are great.

1278
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,680
You get toys. Yeah.

1279
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,640
So I guess, yeah, they've they've been doing things here and there.

1280
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,360
But yeah, this one, I mean, it makes sense now that they've done

1281
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:18,600
like two versions of an Alice in Wonderland, because so much of it

1282
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,880
lends itself to being something you should walk through.

1283
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,880
Mm hmm. Yeah.

1284
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,880
So many of the scenes.

1285
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:27,040
But like the rides are popular, like Waterworld, like Waterworld.

1286
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,040
First Waterworld. Yes.

1287
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,040
Yeah, I guess so.

1288
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,040
And it has in like Waterworld as a smoker.

1289
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,040
The cat. Yeah, it has.

1290
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,040
Yeah.

1291
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,040
Yeah.

1292
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:42,040
So anyway, I was a they owe some money to Disney.

1293
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,040
Yeah, they do.

1294
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,040
They owe money to a lot of people still.

1295
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,040
Yeah.

1296
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,040
So yeah, I mean, I think it's a lot of people.

1297
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,760
Yeah, they do.

1298
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:53,280
They owe money to a lot of people still.

1299
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,600
Well, for that fire.

1300
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:59,280
I think I think I heard something crazy, like five years ago,

1301
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:03,560
once you factored in DVD sales, Waterworld had made back its budget.

1302
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,800
Really? Something like that.

1303
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,440
It was like so expensive.

1304
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,200
Ended up being a hit, though.

1305
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,480
Well, not a hit. A breakeven. A breakeven. Yeah.

1306
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,120
Would they count, though, the revenue brought in by the Waterworld show

1307
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,440
at Universal? Does that go into its official?

1308
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,280
I don't know that.

1309
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,440
How do you section off that revenue as?

1310
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,320
That's what Jim Hill was talking about, though, with the Fox properties,

1311
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,520
where it's like Disney wants to recoup the money.

1312
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,240
So they're going to put the properties in the parks.

1313
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:32,320
So they do like in their minds figure that being a way to offset the cost,

1314
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,680
I guess. Yeah.

1315
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,440
Because if you're going to come for a new thing or a show you like,

1316
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,680
you're going to come and see the Ice Age characters

1317
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,640
take over half of Animal Kingdom, which is what he's rumored.

1318
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,800
Which still seems crazy.

1319
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,680
But he says it more than one.

1320
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,200
He says it so often that somebody had to have told him that.

1321
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,120
So there has to be some chatter about Ice Age.

1322
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,200
It's crazy.

1323
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:59,400
Who knows what sort of mischiefs Skitter and Scrat and

1324
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,560
I could not even think of one character and all of those characters we love.

1325
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:04,960
Are those real names?

1326
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,280
I think Scrat is real.

1327
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,480
But do you go to Scribler?

1328
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,240
Scribler.

1329
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:14,680
I don't I confuse Ice Age and Madagascar.

1330
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,760
Yeah. Well, you won't soon.

1331
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,080
I won't know after they're there every park.

1332
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:23,880
And we get full Ice Age Kingdom, the fifth gate in Disneyland.

1333
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,120
Disney World.

1334
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,000
Oh, yeah. What did I say?

1335
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,680
You said fifth gate in Disneyland.

1336
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,400
OK, yeah.

1337
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,040
It'll be the fifth gate in Disneyland as well.

1338
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:36,760
OK, so there'll be a hundred years from now.

1339
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:37,200
Yeah.

1340
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,200
There'll be two other Fox properties that are the third and fourth gate.

1341
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,280
Yeah. Yeah.

1342
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,640
Yeah. They'll do full.

1343
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,400
Seth McFarland Park.

1344
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,120
Yeah. Yeah.

1345
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,160
McFarland Park.

1346
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,160
Sethi land.

1347
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,680
Sethi land is the best.

1348
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:50,880
You go to Kohog.

1349
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,720
You ride on the Orville.

1350
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:56,880
You go to the Pentagon with Stan from American Dad.

1351
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,040
And then the old million ways to die in the Westland.

1352
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,680
Oh, million ways down the West.

1353
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,400
And of course, Ted Ted talk like Turtletalk.

1354
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,840
Yeah. Watch out.

1355
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:08,840
Ted talk.

1356
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:09,560
We're not.

1357
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,520
Ted's not leaving his paws off of you.

1358
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,520
Mm hmm.

1359
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,840
And then, yeah, there's like a teenager playing Ted

1360
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,960
behind a screen like Turtletalk.

1361
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,360
Mm hmm. Great.

1362
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:22,480
And then shall add a nice and when you head to the croon in kingdom.

1363
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,760
Oh, my gosh. That's most of the park.

1364
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:27,640
Seth has a lot to say.

1365
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:28,720
He's the one who designed it.

1366
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,960
So, yeah, that's seven.

1367
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:32,600
He personally hired all of the crooners.

1368
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,200
They all are doing.

1369
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,040
They all look like him, though.

1370
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:40,000
It's the reverse of Oga's Cantina, where that when everyone wants to get

1371
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,560
into this small bar.

1372
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:45,440
But crooner kingdom is like a supper club that seats five hundred

1373
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,440
and is never full.

1374
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,280
Come on, it's just rude.

1375
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,440
Come on in.

1376
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,240
Go on.

1377
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:56,600
There's human beings in here.

1378
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:57,400
Oh, it's possible.

1379
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,520
Makes you so big.

1380
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,320
All of this is possible, honestly.

1381
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,840
Yeah. Anything is possible in the blue sky.

1382
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,720
My God. That's true.

1383
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:08,320
See you in Sethi land.

1384
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:11,080
Sethi land. So what else?

1385
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,360
The original and now it still has not to it.

1386
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,480
Goofy is on this ride.

1387
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,960
What? Yeah.

1388
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,400
Goofy has the original had three goofy screams.

1389
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:23,760
Yeah.

1390
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,280
But you're like leaving out every door.

1391
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:29,200
Yeah. When you go out the doors to the second level,

1392
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,840
it's like you're being like tossed out there

1393
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,440
kind of as the blinding light of day hits you.

1394
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:37,280
And now there still is the one is the Yahoo.

1395
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,320
Right. The famous old screen.

1396
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,840
But there's three goofy screams for whatever reason.

1397
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:44,160
They I guess they thought it was a little nod to goofy.

1398
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,040
So strange. I don't know why.

1399
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:46,720
Very strange.

1400
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,680
There's not a scream in Alice in Wonderland.

1401
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,000
But but then it sort of gets into the Wilhelm scream territory.

1402
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,160
Like that's the Disney scream.

1403
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,280
Right. Which I sort of like.

1404
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,160
Yeah. I know. I don't hate that.

1405
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,480
Yeah. Yeah.

1406
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,200
I like I mean, I really like when you go outside,

1407
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,480
as you were saying, like a night.

1408
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,680
The view of the Matterhorn is great.

1409
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:12,400
And especially now that so many years have passed, that big tree in front of the ride,

1410
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:18,200
he looks that the scale of just because it's so huge now.

1411
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,080
And it's almost cut to me.

1412
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,440
It almost looks like a a large bush.

1413
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:26,440
Like you were looking up at a massive like bush, like in the polo scenes.

1414
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,080
Yeah, I see what you're saying.

1415
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,520
I had not thought of that.

1416
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,280
Wow. It's like a big bush.

1417
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,960
Like a big bush.

1418
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:37,480
But it adds to the feeling of smallness that you've been shrunk down.

1419
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,240
I thought that too.

1420
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,000
Tree looks like a bush. All right.

1421
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,560
No, I'm saying people are like us.

1422
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:45,920
Oh, OK. Yeah.

1423
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,360
Another into it. Yeah. Yeah.

1424
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:48,360
Yeah. Yeah.

1425
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:52,840
It's it's now just like I mean, it is just like, what do you what do you like?

1426
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,520
Because I like a lot.

1427
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,520
Yeah. And I don't know.

1428
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,520
All these episodes don't have to be snark fest.

1429
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,360
No. And I like stuff we drink.

1430
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,880
Remember, we drank piss at the start of the journey.

1431
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,040
And getting this by drinking your own.

1432
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:06,400
So we were allowed to be a little.

1433
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,160
I like that these animatronics more statuesque animatronics

1434
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,160
do have movement to them.

1435
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:16,560
Like they sort of look in the vein of the Pixar fear statues.

1436
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,640
Sure. That statue pier, the old statue pier.

1437
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:22,560
These guys move. They like move a little like that.

1438
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,360
That's what happened in 83.

1439
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:27,200
Was that you got more dimensional figures and they weren't all

1440
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,080
two dimensional cutouts.

1441
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,280
The other thing is, according to Tony Baxter,

1442
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:36,800
the the original ride was it was super blacklight.

1443
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,440
They were really leaning on the blacklight for the for the surrealism

1444
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:44,160
and almost like it was like the point of it was how much blacklight there was.

1445
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,560
And that also, I think I think I'm right.

1446
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,080
Like that gave it like a 3D effect a little bit.

1447
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,040
Oh, sure. Yeah.

1448
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:52,560
Flats mostly.

1449
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,680
And that would kind of give it a little bit of dimension.

1450
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,360
Very novel at the time.

1451
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:59,360
It was a way to I think maybe

1452
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:03,640
it was Claude Coates pointing this out himself in some movies about how

1453
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,520
a giant space you wouldn't you wouldn't want to use blacklight.

1454
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,360
It's too hard to fill.

1455
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:12,120
Like pirates doesn't need it because they have so much space.

1456
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:13,920
They can make it look super huge.

1457
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,800
But in a narrow space, these tricks like blacklight are very important

1458
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,960
to make it seem like a bigger Vistas than it is. Right.

1459
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,920
But by the time like,

1460
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:26,240
you know, hey, this was not there.

1461
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:28,080
There weren't, you know,

1462
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:33,720
bong shops and such place and, you know, Bill Graham posters

1463
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,680
that was made with blacklight.

1464
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:40,160
This was not as common before the 60s and 70s.

1465
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:44,680
So they could, you know, this was a neat style and aesthetic for 1958.

1466
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:49,160
By the time the 80s rolls around, it seems like kind of a cheap chintzy trick,

1467
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:53,800
which is why there was a discussion Tony had was like, that's still part of it.

1468
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:54,600
That's the spirit of it.

1469
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,440
And that's all of the dark rides will always have that.

1470
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,280
But we have to fold in some different.

1471
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:02,360
It's just an aspect rather than the main aspect.

1472
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,360
Yeah. Right. Sorry, blacklight.

1473
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,520
So, yeah, blacklight.

1474
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:09,120
Blacklight on the Knights and White Saturn ride a lot, too.

1475
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:12,600
Yeah, with that, we're back to that's the point of it.

1476
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,680
Is looking at blacklight for a while. Right.

1477
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:17,760
Because it's a rock and roll experience.

1478
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:20,800
They do you guys get worried when you go on any of these rides

1479
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:23,480
with the blacklight that you will look to, you know, because you look down

1480
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:27,680
at your clothing and you see bizarre stains and such.

1481
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:31,840
Do you ever wonder like, is this is this going to reveal something

1482
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,600
I didn't even know was there?

1483
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:37,760
Some like just full pants covering your car.

1484
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:41,760
Like, did I did I pee myself and not realize it?

1485
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,040
Some we were selling a lot of bodily fluids on this episode.

1486
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:51,840
I am not I'm more worried that there's some sort of like food or drink.

1487
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,320
Yeah, because that would show up the same way.

1488
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:57,960
Anything like I don't want everybody to look around.

1489
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,080
Oh, look, you can see things on our clothes.

1490
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,160
Oh, my God. What is that?

1491
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:05,680
Yeah, I am pretty sure as far as fluids, I'm good.

1492
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:10,480
But like at lunch, did I spill a fuzzy tauntaun on my leg?

1493
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,360
Yes, I perhaps did.

1494
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,400
And will like the color or whatever artificial color that's in that

1495
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,080
will that show up on my pants? Perhaps.

1496
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,640
So that is a concern. Right.

1497
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,160
But I think, yeah, other than that, I'm not too worried.

1498
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,600
That being said, I could be surprised. I don't know.

1499
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,400
Who knows, Jason? What about?

1500
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,240
I think that's the reason why I'd have to agree with you.

1501
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:30,440
Yeah. Does fudge show up on a blacklight?

1502
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:32,240
That's a good question.

1503
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,360
I don't know. Glow in the dark fudge.

1504
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,400
Yeah. Does fudge glow in the dark?

1505
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,880
Does anyone know the listeners?

1506
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,800
If you have a blacklight and you can run to a cracker barrel,

1507
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,000
if a forensics team were to go into your bedroom,

1508
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:47,080
would they see fudge everywhere?

1509
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,280
Yeah, it's stacked up to the ceiling.

1510
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:53,720
So this is where that fudge supply went missing.

1511
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,480
We found we got him.

1512
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:59,880
Ladies and gentlemen, we got him.

1513
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,040
Famous fudge heist.

1514
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,760
If you took some of that jar of urine,

1515
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,280
if we poured that on our pants and then went on a ride,

1516
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:10,520
I think it would start talking to us.

1517
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:13,200
Oh, my God. That's how that's how crazy the chemical.

1518
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,560
And it would have Edwin's voice.

1519
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,480
Which is what Edwin?

1520
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,400
Oh, Edwin. Not your dog.

1521
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,080
Not your dog. No, no, no. Edwin.

1522
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:25,880
That was confused. Edwin's voice. Edwin's voice is Edwin.

1523
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:28,520
That's what I do when Lindsay and I are together.

1524
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,240
OK, kind of a wheezy.

1525
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,840
Yeah. But Edwin is Edwin's voice.

1526
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:36,320
Mm hmm. OK. So the piss would sound like that, I think. Sure. Sure.

1527
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:37,520
It might sound different to everybody.

1528
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,600
Mine might sound like like Edwin the dog. That's true.

1529
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,280
I'm urine.

1530
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,520
That was creepier than what you did.

1531
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:46,680
Yeah. That's my.

1532
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:50,040
What would your piss voice sound like?

1533
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:54,560
Sorry to put you on the spot here, but I know.

1534
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,000
You can come back. You can come back to it.

1535
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,760
Yeah, let's circle back.

1536
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:00,080
Circle back. I'm going to think on it.

1537
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,360
We'll tease that for the very end of the episode.

1538
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,640
Is that you'll debut your piss voice.

1539
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:05,400
You know, you got it.

1540
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,840
No, no, no. Save it for the end. Save it for the end.

1541
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,080
We need a reason the listeners are going to want to keep listening to this.

1542
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,280
Yeah. Yeah. Like the final little surprise, like the unbirthday ring.

1543
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:16,000
Yeah. So if you want to go upstairs and workshop it, too.

1544
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:17,320
Oh, sure. Yeah.

1545
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:20,240
Add in old clips of you another episode going, yeah, this is good.

1546
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,920
This ride. I like it.

1547
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,320
So they updated this.

1548
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:25,800
They've updated a few times.

1549
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,760
Twenty fourteen was last big.

1550
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,080
Yes. And that was what Jason Glip.

1551
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,120
He's not here.

1552
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,280
I like it.

1553
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,960
Sounds good. Sounds good.

1554
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,800
It definitely improved things.

1555
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,200
I ate some fudge.

1556
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:48,840
So I forgot all about like all the digital stuff that they added to the ride,

1557
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,920
which is great, like legit great.

1558
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:54,680
I think it's my favorite of the recently added fantasy land.

1559
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,760
Digital plus ups.

1560
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:00,120
And it's the most I think the most obvious ones, I think.

1561
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:03,840
It reminded me of like because in Pooh's Honey Hunt, they do a lot of that, too.

1562
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,360
So I wonder if I don't know.

1563
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:08,080
I'm sure the same people worked on it.

1564
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:12,160
But there's so much they do so much stuff and they do it in such a good way.

1565
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,280
And some of it's like subtle.

1566
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:17,120
Some of it's like the subtle stuff works really well.

1567
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:20,120
Just augment the scene, the stuff that's a little more in your face.

1568
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,560
Like there's like there's just a little like the rabbit moving and stuff.

1569
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,880
That's fun. It's just a little scene.

1570
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:29,040
And then there's like they add like trippier things in the hallway

1571
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,560
with the door and stuff.

1572
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:31,960
It's great as soon as you go in.

1573
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,280
Yeah, that big swirling.

1574
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:37,360
That's it's like a super dynamic introduction.

1575
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:40,920
Like it's really it really like makes it.

1576
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:45,240
That's you could probably argue it's the best ride now,

1577
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,280
even though I still think Peter Pan is I'm still on Team Pan.

1578
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,360
But I do think like it feels the most modern of that and walk around

1579
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:54,840
to the team because there's a big art.

1580
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:58,120
We had, of course, that drag knockout drag down argument.

1581
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,280
Toad or Pan is best dark red.

1582
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,920
But I guess you really should throw Alice in there as well.

1583
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:05,160
Yeah, I think it's in the conversation.

1584
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:07,920
I think it has to be because, yes, it does.

1585
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,880
I'm imagining the Civil War,

1586
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:13,760
kept the Captain America Civil War poster with like J.M.

1587
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:17,960
Barry staring down Lewis Carroll in terms of, you know,

1588
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:21,360
the creators, the original creators of these

1589
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:27,800
rides, the original two British weirdos made Pan and Alice

1590
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:33,680
clash of the British British weirdos, British opium weirdos.

1591
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:37,080
The scene with the cards, I can't like

1592
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,960
there's mirrors in there, right?

1593
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:41,240
Like they're to make it look more.

1594
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:44,480
Or I mean, there used to be or is the effect changed?

1595
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,640
I don't know. I don't know.

1596
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,560
I went through and I was like, oh, there's so many of them.

1597
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,200
Some point in time, there were mirrors.

1598
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,360
I forget what it is now, but I love that.

1599
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:54,520
I love the fact that you what you were saying about how it could be walked

1600
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:57,160
through the fact that there are these like funhouse optical illusion

1601
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:00,360
elements of it here and there is great.

1602
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,680
And then all of the cards

1603
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:06,320
shooting out from behind the Queen. Yes.

1604
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,960
Oh, that's super dynamic.

1605
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:11,000
Queen's face is projection now, too. Is that right?

1606
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,480
That looks good.

1607
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:16,000
I really like to learn in the in the 80s plus up, they color

1608
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,760
match the flowers to Mary Blair's original colors in the film.

1609
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,600
Oh, wow. I really like that attention.

1610
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:27,040
I feel like it's it's of all the ones in fantasy land.

1611
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:30,920
It's maybe the one that I would go on and think, oh, they recently built this.

1612
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:35,800
Yeah, sure. Like with the other one, like Toad feels older and Pan,

1613
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:39,840
like the thing that feels the oldest on Pan, of course, is that the track above you.

1614
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:42,560
There's a couple of times when you lurch down and he feels like the things

1615
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,800
about to come off the ceiling. Yeah.

1616
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,800
Like that was fun until it slammed into the wall when we were on it.

1617
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,800
Like it's slammed into the bumper.

1618
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,040
Yeah. Yeah. When it comes back into docking, we were on it

1619
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,320
and it just jammed in there and we're like, ah.

1620
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,880
But there's a part where you're like, just going because it's such a pleasant,

1621
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,360
beautiful ride.

1622
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,880
And then there's a part where it kind of dips down. Yeah.

1623
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:08,400
And it feels like it has to catch itself from like letting you swing.

1624
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,560
There's something on the track there that's I guess.

1625
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,600
Let me swing is my feeling as well.

1626
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,280
But there's there's aspects of all of the rides.

1627
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:20,880
And I know Pinocchio was newer, but this one feels the newest.

1628
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:25,840
I mean, maybe they did put the most care into to updating it or the most money.

1629
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,160
But I do think you could put me on this.

1630
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,120
I go, oh, yeah, this is like newer, right?

1631
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,320
Yeah. All the effects feel really modern.

1632
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:36,360
And they've taken what was there and yeah, really made it feel new.

1633
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:40,800
I think that's a credit to the movie, the source material, like aging

1634
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,440
the best a little bit.

1635
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:47,400
I mean, I yeah, I see what you're saying, because I think that the references are

1636
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,440
people love that Lewis Carroll shit.

1637
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:53,920
I even just like the 51, the original animated movie.

1638
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:57,680
I mean, I feel like I was saying earlier holds up so well.

1639
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:00,360
And people still like to do drugs.

1640
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,320
So that's still sad. That's true.

1641
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,760
Yes. Yes, I don't.

1642
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,240
I don't care to.

1643
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:07,320
But some people do.

1644
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:08,680
So they they like it.

1645
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:10,920
You're hooked on the most addictive drug at all.

1646
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:14,920
Sugar, all those brightly colored candy drinks.

1647
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:16,200
And I guess you're right.

1648
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:19,200
Just been you've had a crazy straw into that cup of piss.

1649
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,840
You've been you've been lying.

1650
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:22,200
You've been like slurping it up.

1651
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:25,160
You pulled out your own cup, your own one.

1652
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,880
You had already bought yourself.

1653
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:29,800
Yeah, I had a different a different company makes a different kind of candy.

1654
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:32,120
Piss drinking it secretly.

1655
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:35,560
You're disgusted because it's not as good as it is.

1656
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:36,920
Not as good as my company.

1657
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,040
Pepsi versus Coke.

1658
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:39,720
Wonka Pepsi challenge wonka.

1659
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:40,720
Mexico.

1660
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,040
I was going to say Wonka makes a piss as well.

1661
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,040
Yeah, Nestle makes a piss.

1662
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:51,040
Now, that would have been a more unpleasant river for Augustus

1663
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,960
gloop to fall into.

1664
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,200
Oh, yeah. Oh, my boy.

1665
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,240
My boy. Oh, no.

1666
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,400
He is blinded by urine.

1667
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:04,240
What if there should be a national pastime?

1668
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:06,760
You're making a mockery of a national pastime.

1669
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:10,440
A pretty good sketch would be a wonka candy factory,

1670
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:12,640
but all novelty dirty candy.

1671
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:17,360
River of candy piss.

1672
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,920
Everlasting.

1673
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,280
I don't know. You take it from there.

1674
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:26,120
My boy is choking on a choking on a candy thong.

1675
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:28,960
I was going to walk into the candy thong closet.

1676
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:30,040
Now I can't breathe.

1677
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:32,360
OK, a candy kidney stone.

1678
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,840
Never left at everlasting kidney stone.

1679
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:38,680
That is not, by the way, that's patented to me.

1680
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,440
No one has gotten that yet.

1681
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:41,840
No one has thought of that.

1682
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:42,480
It's pretty good.

1683
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:46,200
Make sure to offload this audio file and then mail it to yourself

1684
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,560
and seal the envelope so you have it.

1685
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:49,960
If he does it before it comes out.

1686
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:51,360
A gray piece of candy.

1687
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:53,120
That's a candy kidney stone.

1688
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,760
Fucking I'm a genius.

1689
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,640
The most desirable.

1690
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:03,200
And so it's you have to suck on it to make it be small enough to pass.

1691
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:04,680
Yes, exactly.

1692
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:06,720
That's the whole point of it.

1693
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:11,200
And by the time you're done, you probably will start forming real kidney stones.

1694
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:13,640
Yeah, it is made of calcium.

1695
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,600
Ingredient number one, calcium.

1696
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:17,640
It's good for you.

1697
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:18,440
Calcium and sugar.

1698
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:21,000
It's also your build ups for a growing boy.

1699
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,640
It's good for the elderly.

1700
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:26,080
Yeah, they need that calcium supplement to supplement their bones.

1701
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:31,160
Novelty gift for like look who it's nifty or 50 part.

1702
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:34,880
Like you get like here's your jar of candy kidney stones.

1703
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:37,160
You don't get them. Drink lots of water.

1704
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,960
But do we eat these?

1705
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:46,680
Do we think I know the logic for your bones, which are also aging?

1706
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:47,280
Well, you can.

1707
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,440
Yeah, you could bring it out at a party and say, like,

1708
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:53,200
if there's a jar of 80 of them and like, hey, that's all.

1709
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,320
That's how many old Mike has passed.

1710
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,160
Guess the kidney stones in the jar, too.

1711
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,280
That would be fun.

1712
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,640
Get like a gust of gumballs. Sure.

1713
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:05,080
There's a lot of things you could do with this. Great idea.

1714
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:08,840
Unfortunately, if you look close enough in the Alice in Wonderland

1715
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,120
ride at the man tea party on birthday scene,

1716
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,600
they're offering like tea, crumpets, candy, kidney stones.

1717
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:17,760
Got to get rid of these.

1718
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,760
Some got to get rid of these candy kidney stones.

1719
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,680
Yeah, that's good.

1720
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:25,040
I don't know. This is real good.

1721
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:27,440
I mean, it's you're right that there are we're talking about.

1722
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:32,040
Are there other bodily fluids and we were avoiding certain ones, probably.

1723
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:34,360
But what else can your body make?

1724
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:36,760
You thought of one more. Bile. Yeah.

1725
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:39,520
Oh, bile is good. Bile is great.

1726
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,800
Bile is good. Bile is good. A bile drink.

1727
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,960
You get a little cinnamon or a little pop rock.

1728
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:46,080
So it's like, ah, it's corrosive. Right.

1729
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,040
You know, that's good.

1730
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,080
I think careful with cinnamon, folks.

1731
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,680
Cinnamon can really fuck you up.

1732
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,200
They really fuck up your life.

1733
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,840
There's got to be rest stop water that's like

1734
01:20:56,640 --> 01:21:01,360
liberal tears or something for conservative people making a stop.

1735
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:02,560
Right. And you're good at this.

1736
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:03,360
This is another good one.

1737
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,160
That's a good one. Right. Yeah.

1738
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,520
It's just got to be like the sunny water.

1739
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,320
Diminish our fine highway rest stops.

1740
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:13,600
Sure. I'm well, they usually with these rest stop gift shops,

1741
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,560
they, of course, are equal opportunity offenders.

1742
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:19,080
You'll see the toilet, the Hillary toilet paper and the Trump toilet paper.

1743
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,840
I suppose that's so they might have a different thing to roast the other side.

1744
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:25,360
But the liberal tears water.

1745
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:28,720
This is good. I should really leave this out because I probably would make a million dollars.

1746
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:31,080
You are now the head of Flying J International.

1747
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:34,320
Flying J is like the truck stop.

1748
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:35,640
The rest stop.

1749
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,720
She stopped at one in Barstow once.

1750
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:39,480
OK. Yeah.

1751
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,080
So that's good.

1752
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:43,400
What's the so what's the conservative?

1753
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,680
The equivalent is like

1754
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:48,720
what comes out of your body?

1755
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:51,320
You're so mad at what Cortez

1756
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:55,120
tweeted that you pee yourself.

1757
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:56,800
I'm not sure what.

1758
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:59,880
Oh, I would just my first pitch, honestly, was gun water.

1759
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:01,960
Doesn't make sense.

1760
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,160
Why not?

1761
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:05,560
Yeah, I don't know.

1762
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,280
Or that you it's vomit.

1763
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,160
That's it. It's vomit because what

1764
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:14,840
Alexandria Casio Cortez said made you throw up in your mouth a little bit.

1765
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,640
Right. Oh, that's still slamming liberals.

1766
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:20,120
So that's still.

1767
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:24,520
That doesn't read to you as like they're so like you could sell

1768
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:29,400
candy panties in a bunch because your your panties are in a bunch.

1769
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,480
You're so mad at what Cortez said.

1770
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:34,000
OK, that's not bad.

1771
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,200
Like candy, you make like, oh, make it

1772
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:40,920
AOC, making America puke again.

1773
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:43,400
Like you're not making America great again.

1774
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,120
That one's back on her.

1775
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,400
That's yeah, that's kind of back on her.

1776
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:51,040
It needs to be something that like the conservatives do

1777
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,920
that you could spin off into a candy or a drink.

1778
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:57,080
They're like salivating because they want to fuck Trump.

1779
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:00,520
Maybe that's a stretch.

1780
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:05,960
How do you candy a brain aneurysm because you're just terminally online?

1781
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:08,400
OK, headbandage.

1782
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,920
Like, is that a candy head?

1783
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,920
Oh, it's like fruit roll ups.

1784
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,320
It's a headband.

1785
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:17,440
It's a white mystery like airhead.

1786
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:19,840
Like why?

1787
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:22,000
Yeah, why does that old man have a bandage?

1788
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,480
Yeah, that's good.

1789
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:27,560
It's all a bottle of raindrops from our our perfect,

1790
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:31,000
most beloved Fourth of July celebration of America.

1791
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,240
That's going off.

1792
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,640
Fracking water.

1793
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:34,320
That's good.

1794
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:38,840
Delicious fracking water oil, too, because, you know, like National Park

1795
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,880
oil, because because more conservatives want to drill like national parks

1796
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,760
and off the grill, drill that of Teddy Roosevelt's head.

1797
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:50,320
And yeah, so it's like, yeah, like National Park oil,

1798
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,800
Yellowstone oil.

1799
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,880
Still not as it doesn't read quite as good as the T.

1800
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:57,680
Liberal tears.

1801
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:59,240
Joe Cicis, liberal tears.

1802
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:02,120
The real tears is sort of the gold standard for this type of thing.

1803
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,720
I think it's still in vibe.

1804
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:05,920
It's va about its Pence.

1805
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:10,280
This is Mike Pence's vomit because he saw a gay person smiling

1806
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,480
or was in the room with a woman.

1807
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:15,280
He was in the not his wife.

1808
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,200
Well, then you could say that could be an assorted set

1809
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:19,800
because he relieved himself in every way he threw.

1810
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:20,360
Oh, yeah.

1811
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:23,600
Shit because he was in the room with another woman and sweat.

1812
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:24,720
All of them.

1813
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:27,120
Uh, uh, that's a grab bag.

1814
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:32,160
There could be like a pen that you flip over that a woman's clothes comes off.

1815
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:35,520
And it's just like says like Mike Pence is a worst nightmare or something.

1816
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:37,040
Or no, no, it wouldn't even be new.

1817
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:37,640
No more.

1818
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,560
We go on. Yes, yes, yes.

1819
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:42,080
It was just like you turn the pen over and she would just say, hello,

1820
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:43,160
we're in the room together.

1821
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,000
And that would be it.

1822
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:44,960
There wouldn't be any nudity.

1823
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:48,040
The pen novelty pen where the clothes don't come off, the clothes don't come up.

1824
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,200
She just says hello.

1825
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,600
And then that's the worst.

1826
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,280
Yeah, yeah, that's the worst it could be.

1827
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,760
Oh, oh, thank God.

1828
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:57,600
It was just a joke pen.

1829
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:58,440
She thank you.

1830
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:00,840
This has been a wonderful birthday.

1831
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:04,000
She's like a full suit and turns it up and she's got like a winter coat on.

1832
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,440
She says hello.

1833
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:11,200
And his fantasy would just be a big candy Garfield

1834
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:13,080
because he loves Garfield.

1835
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,000
Is that true? Yeah.

1836
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,560
Have you seen he there's a bizarre him like taking some time out of

1837
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:25,360
like a congressional session or whatever to say that it's Jim Davis's birthday?

1838
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,120
Oh, I have seen that.

1839
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,360
I have a daughtering.

1840
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:31,840
He's been making us laugh for 50 years.

1841
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,800
He may not be perfect.

1842
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,920
He doesn't care much for Mondays.

1843
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:39,960
But the spirit of this cat is like the spirit of our nation.

1844
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,480
Why they get Garfield's name out of your mouth.

1845
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:46,000
Mr. Sir, Mr. Pence, sir.

1846
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:47,480
Do we know?

1847
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:48,280
Funnier than you.

1848
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:50,400
But do we know Jim Davis's politics?

1849
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,440
I believe he's pretty apolitical.

1850
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:54,080
I believe that that seems right.

1851
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:55,360
That's what's great about him.

1852
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,880
Everybody who is just on another planet.

1853
01:25:58,160 --> 01:25:59,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1854
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:02,120
Who we have taken some turns on this one.

1855
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:04,920
It's a kooky world of fouls and wonderland.

1856
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:09,000
You know what? I like that there's a little dandelion projections flying around.

1857
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:10,400
Yeah, that might be it.

1858
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,480
That might be all I have.

1859
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:12,640
I don't know. I'm running out.

1860
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:14,760
It is one of those ones who is just good.

1861
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:15,760
It's good.

1862
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,120
And there's not a ton of like lore.

1863
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:20,480
It's nice to just like rides.

1864
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:21,800
But then you do then.

1865
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:24,120
And we're just saying this thing's good and that thing's good.

1866
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:26,640
I have some background on the manufacturer.

1867
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,280
Oh, please.

1868
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:29,600
Now we're getting to the good shit.

1869
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,600
Arrow development.

1870
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,640
Later, followed by Arrow dynamics.

1871
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:39,280
They were involved in a lot of the early rides of Disneyland,

1872
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:42,200
in fact, six opening day Disneyland rides,

1873
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:45,200
Manatee Party, King Arthur Carousel, Mr.

1874
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:49,200
Toad Dumbo, Casey Jr. and Snow White Scary Adventures.

1875
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:50,720
Hmm. Yes.

1876
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:55,480
And still around in Virginia, the state around in a different form, I believe.

1877
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:58,800
I believe the one company went under and then reformed something like that.

1878
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:02,040
But they helped out a lot of Disney rides through the year.

1879
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:05,600
Alice, the Matterhorn, Flying Saucers,

1880
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:09,040
the Mark four redesign of the Autopia cars.

1881
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,320
Yeah. Good for them.

1882
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:14,280
Good for them. Thanks, Arrow.

1883
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:15,520
We salute you.

1884
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:20,240
I will also say that the caterpillar cars were ultimately sculpted

1885
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:25,360
by Blaine Gibson, which is weird because Blaine Gibson made a lot of the famous,

1886
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:29,680
you know, like a lot of the great humanesque animatronics

1887
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:32,360
like Abraham Lincoln, like all of the Hall of Presidents,

1888
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:34,960
all the way up through George W.

1889
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:37,320
Bush, when there was a new president, he would come out of retirement

1890
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:39,520
and make the new president. Wow.

1891
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,080
And and the the partners statue

1892
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:47,120
was this guy, Waltz and Mickey holding hands.

1893
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:50,720
But it's weird that you're in a ride vehicle that he merely he at least made

1894
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:53,360
the mold and they made, you know, 16.

1895
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:55,520
That's 16 of them total.

1896
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,000
But yeah, which is that's the thing you got to give it credit for.

1897
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,160
That it's a it's a cool ride vehicle.

1898
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:03,920
And I think it's one of the one of the best of those darker red vehicles,

1899
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:05,880
maybe one of the best in one of the most

1900
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:10,040
one of the oddest, most specific ride vehicles in all of the. Yeah. Sure.

1901
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:14,560
And it's a character, which is fun and different colors.

1902
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,880
Always fun. Yeah.

1903
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:21,560
And not dissimilar to the leaked Nintendo art or model.

1904
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:25,200
Did you see that the leaked Nintendo land model where apparently,

1905
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:26,840
yeah, it's not we're not getting it.

1906
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:28,920
I hope Japan is getting it.

1907
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:33,280
I guess because of space is that there seems to be a Yoshi Omnimover type.

1908
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,640
Wow. Hell, yeah.

1909
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:36,880
And they're just different colored Yoshi's.

1910
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:37,720
I don't know how.

1911
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:41,040
I don't know if it's one per Yoshi or like it's a little thing on his back.

1912
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:45,520
Whatever it looks like, there's a cool outdoor indoor Yoshi Omnimover,

1913
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,160
which reminded me of this because it's like all the same character,

1914
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:50,160
but different colors. Yeah.

1915
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:54,840
Which, God, I hope I hope that's in Japan because people are saying that's so bad.

1916
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:58,720
Yeah. People were saying that like maybe this is like an initial model.

1917
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:00,760
So we don't know. We don't have confirmation yet

1918
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:04,840
that that is going somewhere, hopefully at least Florida,

1919
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:06,840
because that's going to be the biggest one, supposedly.

1920
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:11,120
And if the ride breaks, then every every Yoshi just scurries

1921
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:13,760
in multiple directions until it falls into a pit.

1922
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,360
Unless you can jump on top of it.

1923
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,200
Yes. And they hurry.

1924
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:19,520
They scream at you to get back on.

1925
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:20,920
It's going to die.

1926
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:23,920
I had such panic as a kid when I would get hit

1927
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:26,920
and Yoshi would run around because I would say it was

1928
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:30,200
it was traumatizing to seem like run off a cliff. Yeah.

1929
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:32,720
Because like you'd hit and he would run around and you'd have to get him

1930
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:34,600
before he hit off of a cliff.

1931
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:35,960
And I would just feel such pressure.

1932
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:38,200
And sometimes it wouldn't happen. And I'd feel depressed.

1933
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:41,720
There's a lot of characters being murdered at all times in the Mario games.

1934
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:43,560
Oh, yeah. Most of them are villains. Right.

1935
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,440
And some of them are you and that's on you.

1936
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:48,960
And you know, you'll be back watching your pal, somebody you bonded with

1937
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:52,880
and flown the skies with, watching him just jump into a

1938
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:55,120
jump into a pit because he was scared.

1939
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,680
That's what's the worst part about it.

1940
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:59,880
He's scared and he just throws himself off a cliff.

1941
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:01,440
He's not.

1942
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,760
No, there's always extremely relatable.

1943
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,680
Very relatable. Better do this.

1944
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:07,800
Getting scared and throwing yourself off a cliff. Yeah.

1945
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:10,480
It's what we're all it's what we're all thinking about doing.

1946
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:13,080
Every time we check Twitter.

1947
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,920
I'm scared now.

1948
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:20,160
Oh, maybe a Trump's Twitter candy of some kind or a drink like, hmm,

1949
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:21,960
something like that.

1950
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:23,160
It's going to keep you up at night.

1951
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:25,280
It is. Yeah, I got to crack it. I'll crack it.

1952
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:25,880
Well, just yeah.

1953
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:29,080
Well, if you get it and do a conference call, patch us in,

1954
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:33,120
wake us up at three in the morning, record it and put it on podcasts.

1955
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,600
The right way. Well, I'll do it.

1956
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:38,120
Yeah. The last you content at all times, even as we sleep.

1957
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:40,840
I'm looking through the last bit of my notes here and I'm trying to.

1958
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,400
I'm like, I guess he's talked about everything.

1959
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,640
And then I looked at this and I said, what is this note?

1960
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:46,800
And it says clock jam.

1961
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:50,040
And then I remember I wanted to make a note because my favorite part,

1962
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:53,280
I think of Alice in Wonderland, the movie is where the mad hatter

1963
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:56,960
and the March hair try to fix the clock by putting jam on it.

1964
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,600
And you remember this? Yeah.

1965
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:00,760
And then they just smash it. Oh, yeah.

1966
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:02,440
Yeah, that's one of those lodged memories.

1967
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:03,440
I haven't watched them forever.

1968
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:06,080
You should watch it because my goodness, did it bring up.

1969
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,600
I was like, oh, oh, man, I love this.

1970
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:10,760
This is so good.

1971
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:11,760
I don't know what it was about.

1972
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:14,640
I don't know if I like I guess I was a fan of jams and jellies.

1973
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:16,520
I think it's so silly as a kid.

1974
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:17,960
Like, you know, you don't know a lot.

1975
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,480
You can't get complex humor, but you know that condiments don't belong on a clock.

1976
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:26,840
Yeah. And I think it's also like a mix of like I didn't like

1977
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:29,160
they were breaking the clock, but I also liked what they were doing.

1978
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:31,440
I was just a bunch of emotions at once.

1979
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:35,000
And seeing what's in a clock, seeing all those crazy doodads.

1980
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:37,280
Yes. And I that's another one.

1981
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,520
Oh, shit. I think this is the best scene in the movie.

1982
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:42,880
That's a snack they should sell is an edible clock.

1983
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:45,320
Oh, yeah. They should.

1984
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:46,280
Oh, that'd be great.

1985
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:47,120
Yeah, that's great.

1986
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:52,160
Like cakey piece or it's like a chocolate shell thing that crumbles.

1987
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,600
Yeah. Oh, man, that's great.

1988
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:58,920
Yeah. A lot of good ideas on this episode with marshmallow gears inside.

1989
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:03,200
Jason, what do you think is the expert?

1990
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,480
Do you want to hear my piss voice?

1991
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:06,960
You're just going to I asked you a question.

1992
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:08,040
Oh, I'm sorry.

1993
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:11,360
I was asking you, what do you think about the treat?

1994
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,160
I'm into it. I think they could even they're always

1995
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:16,440
they're fussing around with churros so much nowadays.

1996
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:19,880
I bet you could reverse and you could figure out how to do it in churro form.

1997
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:23,760
Or it's a wide churro instead of a long churro that looks like a clock.

1998
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:24,920
And you spread the jam on top.

1999
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:26,880
Wide churro sounds fantastic.

2000
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,280
Wide churro sounds good, right?

2001
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:30,440
Were you just sitting thinking of your piss voice?

2002
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:33,000
Yeah, I was kind of.

2003
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:33,880
All right. Well, let's hear it.

2004
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:34,840
Let's hear it.

2005
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:38,160
Hey, it's Jason's piss.

2006
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:41,000
It's one of two voices, Jason.

2007
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,240
Put me in a toilet. Whoa.

2008
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:45,720
Wow. Wow.

2009
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:47,160
And applause for it.

2010
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:49,880
Wow. It's a very specific area.

2011
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:51,080
What's your piss voice?

2012
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:52,560
Sure. There's only so many.

2013
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:54,600
Yeah, yeah. The answers there could be.

2014
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:57,000
But don't let that

2015
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,240
a, you know, a rousing voice.

2016
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:02,040
Don't let that incredible voice performance overshadow.

2017
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:03,040
A rousing voice.

2018
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:05,000
You say a rousing voice. Rousing.

2019
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,040
Oh, I've been seeing a lot of people online

2020
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:11,440
are saying that Jason is a short king and that his voice is a rousing.

2021
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,760
Let's not let it all overshadow wide churro.

2022
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:17,440
My idea that I am copyrighting.

2023
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,280
Wide churro. There's so many good ideas.

2024
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:21,280
We're all copywriting. Yeah.

2025
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,520
Who? I don't know.

2026
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:24,440
I got nothing else.

2027
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:26,080
What's it? Wait, so can I copy?

2028
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:30,600
I guess I would take I guess the deadable jam clocks was my idea.

2029
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,360
You brought up jam clocks, but me making a snack was my idea.

2030
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:34,400
It was. Yes. OK.

2031
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,080
OK, great. So we don't have to sue each other.

2032
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:38,080
I have kidney stone candy.

2033
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,080
I'm still liberal.

2034
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:42,440
Which I bet I bet already you can buy liberal tears somewhere.

2035
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:44,840
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's not.

2036
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:48,080
But I do believe I invented kidney stone candy because liberal tear.

2037
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:50,680
That's the thing. That's not like a new

2038
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:53,280
that could have been sold 20 years ago.

2039
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,760
Just would have been a more niche. Yeah. Market.

2040
01:33:56,320 --> 01:34:00,240
There's got to be like a liberal snowflake, snowflake cookie or something

2041
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:03,160
where you like a snowflake and you eat it, an edible snowflake.

2042
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:05,560
The most fragile. Yeah.

2043
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:07,920
Right. The most fragile candy.

2044
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:09,600
The console immediately.

2045
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:15,600
My friend Avery Monson briefly sold a coffee mug online that instead of

2046
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:19,480
tear, he removed the R from the phrase liberal tears.

2047
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:21,600
So it just said liberal tease.

2048
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:25,800
And everyone from every side of the aisle got mad at him

2049
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:27,800
because they read it too quickly.

2050
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:29,880
And he's like, what? It's just tea.

2051
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:32,800
It's just a mug for tea.

2052
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,240
That's good.

2053
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:36,800
Well, here I'm looking I looked up candy.

2054
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:42,560
There may not be candy necessarily, actually, but there's mugs.

2055
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:46,520
Liberal tears and melted snowflakes is on a mug. Right.

2056
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,920
So that's that covers both of them.

2057
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:53,840
There's a coffee mug that says I lubricate my AR 15 with liberal tears.

2058
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:58,200
Which is nice to hear because that probably makes it less

2059
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:00,200
lubricated and less likely to hurt people.

2060
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:02,200
So keep on doing it, sir.

2061
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:06,560
And how can you possibly procure enough to lubricate the firearms?

2062
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:09,120
Go deal with saltwater. Great.

2063
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:11,840
Handle it very well.

2064
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,040
Yeah, I'm sure.

2065
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:15,640
There are three useless things in this world.

2066
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:19,160
A dull knife, an unloaded gun and liberals.

2067
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:23,360
I didn't know that didn't say tears until I got to the end.

2068
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:25,520
Liberals is real much bigger than the rest.

2069
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,640
That's why I shouted it.

2070
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:29,440
So that's all great stuff.

2071
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:33,880
You can. Oh, wait, I'm seeing maybe as a zazzle tin you can buy.

2072
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:35,960
Oh, OK. Yeah.

2073
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:41,040
And it's yeah, there's a little snowflake on it and it says from the salt mines.

2074
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:44,040
I'm sure what that part's about. Yeah, that's a leap.

2075
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:45,000
Yeah, I don't get it.

2076
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,560
It's a reach. Are tears salty?

2077
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:49,800
I suppose.

2078
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:52,120
Hmm. All right.

2079
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:57,520
Well, the point is, if you want liberal tears, there's many ways to get them.

2080
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:00,800
I looked up candy kidney stones. Uh huh.

2081
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:03,480
It doesn't appear. Great.

2082
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:05,920
The first thing that comes up is sugar kidney stones.

2083
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:08,920
So maybe there's kidney stones that are sugar,

2084
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:12,240
which honestly would lend itself better.

2085
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:13,880
So we just saw it as like a real thing.

2086
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:17,440
And Disney could market these also because, as we discussed with Big

2087
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:20,360
Thunder Mountain, there was a study about how that ride is effective

2088
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:21,640
for passing kidney stones.

2089
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:22,840
So they go specifically.

2090
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:26,680
You could sell this idea to Disney and give and they sell it in gift shops

2091
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:28,640
outside of Big Thunder.

2092
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:31,520
Kind of lacking for Big Thunder merch. That's true.

2093
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:32,800
That's a good point. Yeah.

2094
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:36,640
Very good. So you sell them in a in a tin that looks like the train,

2095
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:39,520
like those popcorn tins are becoming popular.

2096
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:43,480
So Big Thunder train full of kidney stones. Right.

2097
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,120
Big Thunder mining company.

2098
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:47,640
We hit a bonanza. We hit a jackpot.

2099
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:49,400
Look at all these stones.

2100
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:51,520
All these kidney stones.

2101
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:55,920
Of all the trains over the years that have been going through the mines

2102
01:36:55,920 --> 01:37:00,400
and just shooting kidney stones off, ripping straight through the pants,

2103
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:03,160
banging around the innards of the cave.

2104
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:06,720
And they all land in a big pile.

2105
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:08,200
That's what's being portrayed here.

2106
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:09,360
It is unpleasant.

2107
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,400
There's been a lot of, well, it's all, you know,

2108
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:15,000
by kicking it off with the urine, I was guaranteeing

2109
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:18,640
that we would it would be an unpleasant episode and that we would feel unpleasant.

2110
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:20,720
Do how do we feel? OK, now do we ride the wave?

2111
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:21,480
Do we feel all right?

2112
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:25,960
That's what happens when you record a show through the looking glass, man.

2113
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:29,800
And. Yeah, everyone like that.

2114
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:32,360
Everyone. Yes, I found it very arising. Great.

2115
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,480
Very erosive.

2116
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,360
Well, I guess in that case, everyone has survived.

2117
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:41,120
We survived podcast the ride.

2118
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:43,400
Disgusting edition.

2119
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:46,440
Disgusting. Our gross out humor today.

2120
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:52,160
Our nanny, our au pair is shaking us awake under a tree.

2121
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,920
Wake up. Get up.

2122
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,560
Oh, right. It was a dream.

2123
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:57,680
Right. Stupid idiot.

2124
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:59,600
Stupid opium addicted idiot.

2125
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:04,280
Is that what inspired like was somebody yelling that to Lewis Carroll?

2126
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,880
Probably. Yeah.

2127
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:07,960
Many times in his life.

2128
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:10,200
He was asleep down at the dock, almost rolled into the water.

2129
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,800
Candy opium another.

2130
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,240
Yeah, that's good.

2131
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:18,320
With kind of steampunky design.

2132
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:22,680
Yeah, that would be really out there, though, because that opium isn't legal.

2133
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:24,720
Yes, true.

2134
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:29,240
All right. Well, like a lot of merch ideas and presumably on our tea

2135
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:31,960
public eventually will be able to sell all of these candies.

2136
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:33,360
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

2137
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:34,320
And we'll start.

2138
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,160
You know what? We'll start selling liberal tears.

2139
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,360
Yeah. Why don't we? Yeah.

2140
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:39,280
Let's just sell out entirely.

2141
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,800
Yeah. Liberal tears.

2142
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:43,840
It's our tea public is your place for Disney.

2143
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:46,600
Theme park adjacent comedy shirts.

2144
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:48,480
And also, yeah,

2145
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:53,320
I use liberal tears to power my gas guzzling,

2146
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:56,200
rolling coal SUV.

2147
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,520
I use liberal tears instead of gas.

2148
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,640
It's also a clean, which is also clean energy.

2149
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:08,720
Yeah, that's a way to trick people into supporting clean energy.

2150
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:09,960
Yeah. Mm hmm.

2151
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:12,080
We'll probably sell more conservative

2152
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:14,560
shirts and merch than we do our own podcast.

2153
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:18,960
Honestly, it's half about Sonia clips and stuff and half about all tears.

2154
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:23,000
Yeah. Sonia clips with a gun is outselling all of our other shirts.

2155
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:25,280
Just unrelated.

2156
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:29,760
Like I drink liberal tears for breakfast and it's a picture of Sonia clips.

2157
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:32,320
He's straight. Yeah, he's drinking it.

2158
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:33,560
And he's also saluting.

2159
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:38,360
It's unclear what he's saluting this tie together like Pepe the Frog.

2160
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:40,440
Why would these things be?

2161
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:41,520
But he's a backwards man.

2162
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:45,160
So he he salutes the ground.

2163
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:50,040
He salutes the ground and he drinks libtabular liars.

2164
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:56,080
Anyway, OK, what else?

2165
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:58,920
Live shows coming up, as we mentioned.

2166
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:01,080
