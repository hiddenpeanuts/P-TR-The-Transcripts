1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,400
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate,

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,060
a Patreon about theme parks,

4
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,180
unless we're talking about unwatchable film and TV

5
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,700
byproducts of Las Vegas magicians.

6
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,140
I'm Scott Gardner.

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,500
Jason Sheridan's up in that Zoom window as well.

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,720
Yes, I think I can conclusively say this is up there,

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,100
maybe one of the worst things we've watched.

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,740
And you know, I can be quick to anger.

11
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,200
I know that is a flaw in myself.

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,260
And as I've gotten older, I realized it's less

13
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,860
a self-righteous anger, like when I was a younger man

14
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,820
and more, more just misunderstandings and confusions.

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,220
And I'll be God damned if I wasn't confused by this thing.

16
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,380
What a review.

17
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,560
You know, I was more with you and then oddly I got on board.

18
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,060
I think I was watching it in such short installments.

19
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,240
And then surprisingly, Erin, my wife joined me

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,020
and started watching it with me and she was kind of on board.

21
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,220
It just, maybe it was, maybe it's meant to be a group watch.

22
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,180
Maybe that's what I discovered.

23
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,540
Cause I was pretty grumpy until she joined.

24
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,060
And then we started having a good time

25
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,340
with Billy Toppett, Master Magician.

26
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,900
Mike Carlson, I feel like,

27
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,140
I feel this is your fault primarily.

28
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,500
For sure my fault.

29
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,580
I actually don't remember what's the episode

30
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,500
where I bring up the fact that I learned about Billy Toppett.

31
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,380
I'm not sure.

32
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,200
And yeah, I was trying to recall if this was like

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,220
a pre-standing weird obsession that you were bringing in

34
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,660
or if you discovered it in the moment during an episode.

35
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,500
It was not a pre-existing condition.

36
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,420
It was not a pre-existing interest of mine.

37
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,660
I feel like I looked it up at,

38
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,700
I think maybe I did even discover it while watching

39
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,900
or while doing the show.

40
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,740
I don't know.

41
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,580
We'll look.

42
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,400
That sounds right.

43
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,580
And I have a theory about when it came up,

44
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,420
which I think can sort of take us into the general facts

45
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,240
of what we're doing.

46
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,860
As I said, we're talking about a film called

47
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,900
Billy Toppett, Master Magician.

48
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,740
This is a film made by Lance Burton

49
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,300
and who is a magician, who goes by Master Magician

50
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,820
separately from his character,

51
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,820
his character Billy Toppett,

52
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,660
who is entirely different than the man Lance Burton.

53
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,140
And I thought maybe we should talk about

54
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,900
what do we know about Lance Burton

55
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,860
or before you watched the film,

56
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,260
can we just say conclusively anything that we knew

57
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,700
about him going into this experience?

58
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,180
Well, I knew a little bit

59
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,540
and then I did a modicum of research

60
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,580
and I was kind of fascinated.

61
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,020
I always thought of him,

62
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,180
like, cause I, anytime there was a magic special

63
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,260
on broadcast TV in the nineties was very popular.

64
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,460
I can't remember at the time if it was Sweep Sweep

65
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,380
or if it was filler or what,

66
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,580
but it's very popular television format in the nineties.

67
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,900
It was like an hour long magic special.

68
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,660
And I remember Lance Burton,

69
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,460
after I saw the live Copperfield show,

70
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,340
I realized like, oh, I did not remember this guy's deal

71
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,340
at all, but Lance Burton, I kind of thought of

72
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,500
as like the Pepsi to David Copperfield's Coca-Cola.

73
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

74
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,780
I guess sort of the number two

75
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,140
in terms of prominent magicians,

76
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,940
prominent Vegas magicians especially.

77
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,620
I just always remember seeing his face on the Monte Carlo,

78
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,300
which is now the Park MGM where we've all hung out.

79
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,780
Yeah, I remember seeing his old very like airbrushed photo

80
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,580
big on that, but I never looked into it more.

81
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,300
I guess I remember seeing TV specials.

82
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,540
Did they air on like Fox Family?

83
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,020
Was he like a cable magic guy?

84
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,580
Oh, that's a good question.

85
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,460
Yeah, I'm not sure, but that sounds familiar.

86
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,740
That's in my head, like aesthetically,

87
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,580
whatever special I put on reminded me

88
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,100
of the Fox Family channel.

89
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,020
Yes, and previously the Family channel,

90
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,660
then ABC Family, now Freeform,

91
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,020
and much sexier than it used to be.

92
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,860
The 700 Club due to legal contracts

93
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,500
still has to air every night.

94
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,300
Even though I just drove by their headquarters,

95
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,780
which is in the Burbank area,

96
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,860
and they had a big poster that said like,

97
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,780
kick them in the ballot.

98
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,860
Like they still do like performative liberal stuff,

99
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,340
but then they have to air this like televangelist nightmare

100
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,740
every Saturday morning.

101
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,460
The skeleton asking for money has to be on this channel.

102
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,260
Is it every night?

103
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,820
Is that a nightly experience?

104
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,380
At least every weeknight.

105
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,980
Like there is a moment where it switches over

106
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,780
and they have a disclaimer card that Freeform

107
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,380
does not endorse the contents of this programming.

108
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,660
But due to old requirements,

109
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,340
every time the Family channel got sold,

110
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,980
one of the things in the contract was you have to keep

111
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,580
showing the 700 Club.

112
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,460
Which like, thank God they put that disclaimer there

113
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,740
because there was a time where Pat Robertson on that show

114
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,500
said like, we deserve 9-11 for our sins.

115
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,820
So then like that comes out of probably like at that time,

116
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,220
the Mary-Kate and Ashley sitcom, So Little Time.

117
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,900
Like they're having some date troubles

118
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,260
and then all of a sudden, but this needed to happen.

119
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,100
It was a punishment from God.

120
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,940
Yeah.

121
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,220
I saw some other Lance Burton stuff

122
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,420
that I thought was interesting.

123
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,940
So we should make sure to make, Lance Burton was a star.

124
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,500
Lance Burton was a star on TV.

125
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,420
Lance Burton did the Tonight Show

126
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,300
under Johnny Carson 10 times.

127
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,620
And then he did the Tonight Show under Jay Leno 10 times.

128
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,860
They built the theater at the Monte Carlo for him.

129
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,300
It was the Lance Burton Theater, 1274 seats.

130
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,780
And they gave him a 13 year contract,

131
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,860
which at the time was the longest in Vegas history.

132
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,500
Pretty good.

133
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,420
Yeah.

134
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,700
I had his magic kit as a kid, I realize.

135
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,820
Whoa.

136
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,860
That's a big one.

137
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,860
He had a kit.

138
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,900
And it was not that there's, I'm looking it up,

139
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,900
but I'm trying to find the exact picture.

140
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,940
And there's a big one with like a hundred tricks.

141
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,460
We did not have that, I don't think.

142
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,500
I think I had more like cup and ball,

143
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,900
like cup disappearing thing.

144
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,380
I'm trying to find the exact picture,

145
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,300
but I knew him as like a guy in a box.

146
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,060
I don't think I even ever watched the specials.

147
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,580
I liked magic, but I was not obsessed with it.

148
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,220
Like I was obsessed with other stuff I liked.

149
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,060
Yeah.

150
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,220
The persona is kind of the foggiest thing to me.

151
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,020
And the poster that I saw so ubiquitously

152
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,220
and probably this similar art on your magic kit

153
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,460
is he's just kind of like, he's like a slick guy.

154
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,180
He's dressed in a tux and he's putting his hands out.

155
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,460
It doesn't tell you a lot.

156
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,700
It's not, it's not like, cause I see there's a,

157
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,140
I see there's a new updated type of this magic kit

158
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,780
for Chris Angel and it says mind freak.

159
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,660
And you know, he, you can get his vibe from the picture.

160
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,100
And yes, with Lance, it's like, okay, this is a,

161
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,420
this is a man who is slightly looks like David Copperfield,

162
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,500
but is not.

163
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,380
That's kind of his vibe.

164
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,660
He also, there's a really great clip,

165
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,620
which I'll try to post where he, from one of his specials,

166
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:50,220
that involves a ride because he narrowly escapes

167
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,540
getting run over by the Desperado coaster

168
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,340
at Buffalo Bills in Prim, Nevada,

169
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,620
the little town on the state line,

170
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,180
which all of those rides I would love to talk about

171
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,020
at some point.

172
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,100
I watched a ride through of the Flume for some reason,

173
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,940
a little while ago.

174
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,260
We're going to hit up Buffalo Bills,

175
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,940
but it's the lamest clip ever.

176
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,340
Jason, you saw it?

177
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,300
Well, I know a lot about Prim, Nevada,

178
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,460
cause an old sketch team I was on wrote a show

179
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,940
because someone came back like from vacation was like,

180
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,780
Hey, do you guys know about Prim?

181
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,700
And it's like, it's a little town that was just like

182
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,780
a rest stop.

183
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,820
And then they built three massive hotels and attractions

184
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,460
and they only sometimes work.

185
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,900
And there's outlet malls there now too.

186
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,380
It used to be called State Line Nevada,

187
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,500
cause it's right by the state line.

188
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,340
And I believe known for cheap gas.

189
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,140
And like, if you want to play both lotteries,

190
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,260
you can play or Nevada doesn't have a state lottery.

191
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,740
California has a state lottery.

192
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,780
Oddly enough, I feel like Nevada does not.

193
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,500
So people would go across the state line to buy tickets.

194
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,500
Oh, gotcha.

195
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,340
Oh, interesting.

196
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,460
Yeah, we always stop there.

197
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,820
That's like a good, like, you know,

198
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,100
as you begin the big drive back or your go to stop

199
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,380
when you're almost in Vegas,

200
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,220
the rides seem like so shady.

201
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,380
And in this Lance Burton clip, it's just a great,

202
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,860
like clear, you know, what's going on,

203
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,420
which is they like set the cameras still,

204
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,820
he takes out of some ropes and dives out of the way,

205
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,380
but they edit it to look way tighter than it was.

206
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,420
It's like the most tepid little, you know,

207
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,420
barely avoiding disaster scenario you can imagine.

208
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,260
Yeah.

209
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,900
Yes. Someone found the artifact.

210
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,580
Someone found like, there was a shadow behind him

211
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,460
this whole time.

212
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,580
And when he jumps out of the way, the shadow is gone.

213
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,220
They forgot to fix that in the edit.

214
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,060
Like.

215
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,260
Which is, which sort of paves the way

216
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,380
for the kind of care to editing that is featured

217
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,660
in his feature, Billy Toppett, Master Magician.

218
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,180
Yes. The editing, not top notch.

219
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,780
I will first ask Scott, you know,

220
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,940
you have a history with the great cult film,

221
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,300
The Room, of course.

222
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,100
Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah.

223
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,980
When you rate. It was an early viewer of it.

224
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,820
Yeah.

225
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,660
Yes.

226
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,580
When you look at this movie versus The Room,

227
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,020
obviously The Room is a masterpiece.

228
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,860
Yeah.

229
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,660
So you, there are things, similarities that you appreciate.

230
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,900
Cause I think they're in the same,

231
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,180
these are in the same ballpark.

232
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,940
They, yeah, they are.

233
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,820
Yeah, you're right.

234
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,660
Off the top of my head, similar thing.

235
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,900
I mean, I was thinking about The Room

236
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,820
because it has a part that's very room-esque with like,

237
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,220
hey, where's my money?

238
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,780
Give me my money.

239
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,860
This very like vague understanding.

240
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,940
Yeah, I guess movies have plots where people need money

241
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,860
from other people and they rough them up.

242
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,260
It's also a hero who is often seen in a tuxedo

243
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:55,260
who is constantly praised from beginning of film to end.

244
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,660
Ha ha ha.

245
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,100
Who does not have any sort of journey.

246
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,140
He's like always good and gets gooder.

247
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,300
But I think the, I mean, this is an argument

248
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,620
I make about The Room a lot

249
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,460
that I think a lot of what is special about it

250
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,820
is that it was shot on film, famously shot on film,

251
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,900
but also shot on digital at the same time

252
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,140
with two cameras on top of each other.

253
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:22,060
And you can see footage of the digital room

254
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,540
and it just doesn't, it's not the same.

255
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,820
It just looks cheaper, chintzy, or it's like too hard

256
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,900
to watch, but when you watch something shot on film

257
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,260
and the care that goes into film,

258
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,340
that somebody like really like crafted the look of this.

259
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,180
And then what you're, like I think with bad movies,

260
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,340
like something has to be done right.

261
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,460
There's gotta be one good performance

262
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,820
or all right, I guess the costumes are good

263
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,500
or it's shot nicely or like the one decent element

264
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,100
kind of carries you through everything that is not so good.

265
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,860
And that's sort of a problem with Billy Toppett.

266
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,180
I'm not sure there is that one good element.

267
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,180
Yeah, I don't know.

268
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,260
Off the top of my head, maybe it's just the dummy

269
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,500
that's in it is my favorite part.

270
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,780
Maybe there's a ventriloquist dummy

271
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,580
and that might be the best.

272
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,580
I don't think I, I'm not like particularly bothered

273
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,420
by the dummy.

274
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,860
We talked about dummies recently.

275
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,220
I'm not like scared of him or anything.

276
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,100
He just didn't like land for me terribly.

277
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,180
Well, I'm not, look, I'm reaching here.

278
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,180
I'm not saying this is my favorite dummy.

279
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,020
I don't like him better than a lot of other dummies.

280
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,540
He falls, he's down the list of dummies that I like.

281
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,620
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

282
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,860
Oh, we should say the other reason

283
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,500
why this might've come up is because when we talked about,

284
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,180
when we did our David Copperfield episode a while back,

285
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,220
I was recounting all of the stuff

286
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,860
about the magic themed restaurant devoted

287
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,900
to David Copperfield and how at some point

288
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,780
towards the end of it,

289
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,020
as things were getting more difficult,

290
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,220
the investors tried to stage a coup

291
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,580
and replace David Copperfield with Lance Burton.

292
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,940
Quote from a newspaper, a Las Vegas magician

293
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,140
who they presumed would be more compliant.

294
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,540
Which I guess is his deal in general.

295
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,540
I checked with a magic industry insider expert.

296
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,860
I don't think she would mind outing,

297
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,540
I'm talking about Eva Anderson, our friend,

298
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,940
who I was just like, do you know anything about Lance Burton?

299
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,700
And she checked with some sources

300
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,340
and said everybody likes him.

301
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,460
He's everything that Copperfield is not, quote.

302
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,020
I guess in terms of character being a nice,

303
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,740
so let's give him that.

304
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,020
That I guess Lance Burton is a good guy.

305
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,780
So everyone hates Copperfield

306
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,300
and everyone loves Lance Burton.

307
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,260
I guess so.

308
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,340
And Lance Burton is not as successful,

309
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,340
I mean he's very successful,

310
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,980
but not as successful as Copperfield.

311
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,940
So that should teach everyone a lesson.

312
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,740
Be more of a dickhead.

313
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,740
Maybe the lesson is, I wasn't thinking be more of a monster,

314
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,340
but I guess that is what the lesson is.

315
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,060
Yeah, I think the one thing that really confused me

316
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,900
about this movie is I think by all accounts

317
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,700
of entertainment success,

318
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,940
Lance Burton was very successful

319
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,380
and likely made a lot of money.

320
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:16,380
And he could have thrown a little more money at this movie.

321
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,220
Well look, they say don't self-finance your movies.

322
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,060
That's what they famously say.

323
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,900
That's true, but there was also a lot of money

324
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,100
floating around out there.

325
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,860
So I feel like one or two more phone calls.

326
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,940
Do we have Lance?

327
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,260
Do we have his net worth?

328
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,220
Let me look this up.

329
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,300
This is never accurate.

330
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,380
I checked a couple and a few different websites

331
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,020
said around 100 million.

332
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,220
Those websites always seem suspicious,

333
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,100
but that seems like, I don't know,

334
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,420
it seems like a good amount of money.

335
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,140
Put 50 million into the movie, Lance, come on.

336
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:47,980
I even can.

337
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,500
Well this is also, this is the Tommy Wiseau thing,

338
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,860
is that Tommy Wiseau on paper,

339
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,620
he's left a paper trail to where he has no money.

340
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,540
And yet, mysteriously through whatever connections he has

341
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,340
that he will not speak of, he somehow managed

342
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,300
to put like six million dollars

343
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,980
into the production of The Room.

344
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,180
It's like a deceptively high budget.

345
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,500
Which I think is what they needed at least

346
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,900
to pull off Billy Toppett, Master Magician.

347
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,700
I think honestly Tommy and Lance, and I don't know,

348
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,100
do we know that Lance self-financed this movie?

349
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,380
No, that's how it feels though.

350
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,620
I mean it is produced by Toppett Entertainment.

351
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,780
But there could be investors to Toppett Entertainment.

352
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,620
True, true.

353
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,980
We don't know necessarily.

354
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,140
I'm just saying that Tommy and Lance maybe give me

355
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,780
some hope because it's so hard to make your own stuff

356
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,940
these days, maybe we should really be looking harder

357
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,740
into where Toppett Entertainment got its funding.

358
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,060
And maybe Tommy as well.

359
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,900
Maybe that's self-financing good for our own projects.

360
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,940
Maybe for like Scott's show about Ruben Kincaid,

361
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,700
Colt Kincaid or Jason's show about,

362
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,980
what was the one you were gonna do?

363
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,860
Gale, the prequel to The Wizard of Oz

364
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,980
about Dorothy Gale's life on the farm.

365
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,820
That's right.

366
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,220
So yeah, for stuff like this,

367
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,620
maybe we need to look into sort of self-financing.

368
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,140
There's gotta be a bunch of weirdo Las Vegas investors

369
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,460
that are around.

370
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:19,460
Yeah, Toppett, if we fully produced a project

371
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,300
that said Toppett Entertainment at the beginning,

372
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,780
if it was exactly this also, like we're podcasters,

373
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,420
but we do it at a kid's birthday party.

374
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,020
We're not, we play not the superstar podcasters

375
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,940
we are today, but like what it was like

376
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,420
when we were up and comers.

377
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,500
Yes. Right.

378
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,580
And we play like 15 year old versions of ourselves.

379
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,740
And then we all went to high school together.

380
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,700
At the end of the movie.

381
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,980
We were all in high school dreaming of being podcasters

382
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,420
in 2002.

383
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,580
And we were on like bumper car.

384
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,500
We were, I'm not bumper cars, cause that's,

385
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,100
we know what that leads to, but yeah, we were all on

386
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,660
like the Gravitron at a carnival.

387
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,780
And like, we were all like, like pushed to get back

388
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,940
into the wall and we all like made eye contact

389
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:13,180
and realized what we need to do in that moment.

390
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,340
Yeah.

391
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,540
This is something.

392
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,020
Yeah. And then we went and discussed it

393
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,380
at the saddest diner you've ever seen.

394
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,420
Let's start talking about what happens in the movie.

395
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:30,420
And also if you wish to follow along with the film,

396
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,940
what I found initially is that this movie is available

397
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,940
for purchase on Amazon for $6.

398
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,420
So that's your cost of entry.

399
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,300
But then I discovered while watching it

400
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,460
that there is another way, which is that you can watch it

401
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,820
in pieces on YouTube broken up

402
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:53,860
amidst a Billy Toppett Zoom reunion that occurred

403
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,340
at the beginning of all, like in April, like this

404
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,180
in the early days of Zoom reunions, the cast

405
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,500
of Billy Toppett very kindly got together.

406
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,580
They managed to carve out some time

407
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,460
and their busy schedules.

408
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,060
So they did show the entire movie and left it on YouTube.

409
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:16,060
The quality seems worse if you can imagine that.

410
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,500
But I also feel, I'm just saying all this

411
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,100
in case you want to follow along.

412
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,980
I feel like we should sort of cliff notes this

413
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,420
with the vague thought that the listener

414
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,020
may never watch Billy Toppett.

415
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,860
What? Yeah.

416
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,260
Just say in case, just in case

417
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,940
this is not a follow along scenario.

418
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,780
That's weird.

419
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,940
They wouldn't want to watch this movie,

420
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,060
but we've already made it sound so good.

421
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,980
Let me say the synopsis, which might help

422
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,740
just clear through the clutter.

423
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,100
A Las Vegas magician who performs

424
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,580
at children's birthday parties convinces the woman

425
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,820
of his dreams to be his assistant

426
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,100
while the local mob guys try to make him disappear permanently.

427
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,460
That sort of gives you the overview.

428
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,420
That's the bulk of it.

429
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,420
But you know, it's so much more than that, obviously.

430
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,700
Yes, there's a lot of different nuance

431
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,420
to the whole story as well.

432
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,260
Yeah. Certainly.

433
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,460
He has, you know, he has a gang of friends.

434
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,580
Yes. Really does.

435
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,660
He sure does.

436
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,460
The friends, the friends is really,

437
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,660
here, let me go and let me go and order a little more.

438
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,500
Sure, sure.

439
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,820
We'll get another friend.

440
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,580
I just want to say, I wrote down notes

441
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,940
before the movie even began.

442
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,260
I had notes just from the Amazon order page

443
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,460
because a couple things.

444
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,180
One, 111 minutes.

445
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,380
Hell yeah.

446
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,780
That's a real, now that's time.

447
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,140
I don't want some 90 minute cop out.

448
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,260
I want to be watching this for almost two hours.

449
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,500
So thank you filmmakers.

450
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,260
I also like, right off the bat, you look at the title.

451
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,780
No colon.

452
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,780
This is not Billy Toppett colon master magician.

453
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,460
It's Billy Toppett master magician.

454
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,380
They break from the strident formula

455
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,380
of Ace Ventura Pet Detective

456
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,940
or Deuce Bigelow male gigolo

457
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,660
or Bucky Larson born to be a star.

458
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,500
All of our favorite comedic films with colons.

459
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,460
They broke the colon curse.

460
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,940
Yeah, and then on IMDB, it just calls it Billy Toppett.

461
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,020
It doesn't even have the subtitle.

462
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,860
Yeah.

463
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:31,780
Correct, except that there is one with the subtitle

464
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,260
that only has one credit.

465
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,340
I think one stray extra added themselves

466
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,820
and didn't attach it to the right thing

467
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,380
and just re-uploaded them.

468
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,660
So if you want more information about the movie,

469
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,860
go to IMDB, it's Billy Toppett,

470
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,020
not Billy Toppett master magician.

471
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,060
Yes.

472
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:51,420
And further streaming, as I made notes too before this,

473
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,860
because I was trying to find,

474
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,940
can you only watch it rental or purchase on Amazon?

475
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,300
Billy Toppett, yes, is on IMDB.

476
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,140
It does not show up in the iTunes store.

477
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,460
It does not show up on Just Watch,

478
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,300
which I don't know if everyone uses Just Watch.

479
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,900
Just Watch I find to be the easiest thing to search.

480
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,700
How can I stream T2 judgment?

481
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,940
Search any movie.

482
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,780
It's got 90% of streaming services on there.

483
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,780
It's not 100% accurate, but it's pretty solid.

484
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,140
It is on Letterbox.

485
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,900
So it made it to Letterbox and IMDB and Amazon Prime.

486
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,300
But it is a rental Amazon, whatever you call it.

487
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,700
But there's some holes, there's some holes.

488
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,100
Yeah, not full market penetration.

489
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,220
Yeah, right.

490
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,060
So you start the film, you get your Toppett Entertainment

491
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,140
logo, which has a rabbit and a hat and a magic wand.

492
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,780
And then you get the first two shots,

493
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:56,780
which are not so blurry that I got kind of nauseous.

494
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,380
So it has that going for that.

495
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,580
There are two full shots before there is one

496
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,260
that is extremely blurry,

497
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,220
where I had to look away from the TV.

498
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:10,220
And then it takes a different path.

499
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,220
This does, did he just get a friend to shoot it

500
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,020
with a camera?

501
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,940
Somebody who was just like, yeah, I can hold a camera.

502
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,300
I can set up a tripod.

503
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,300
It's hard to convey.

504
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,660
I was trying to think of a comparable aesthetic.

505
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,980
I mean, it's extremely student film.

506
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,340
It is just very much a student film made

507
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,300
by a man in his 50s.

508
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,140
Yeah, that's about right.

509
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,420
And honestly, I've seen some better student films.

510
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,660
And I went to college at the time of The Office

511
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,420
was the most popular thing in entertainment.

512
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,860
So I saw some rough student mockumentaries.

513
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,660
Oh no, I'm sorry.

514
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,220
This also, this in general took me back to film school

515
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,500
because it was so full of like shakily shot,

516
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,660
unconvincing mobsters.

517
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:09,660
That's kind of like, I feel like a very recurring aspect

518
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,740
of student films.

519
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,940
Evergreen, yes, no matter what.

520
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,300
Tommy DeLeo says you'll be sleeping with a fishes.

521
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,540
There's a couple of things I, yeah,

522
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,540
there's a couple of things about that.

523
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,780
I think sometimes you take for granted,

524
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,820
like how casting is important.

525
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:31,100
But I also think you can take for granted

526
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,780
how the presentation of a movie or a TV show

527
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,380
affects how you're viewing a performance.

528
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,580
Because I remember very early, maybe it was very early,

529
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,500
maybe it was like 2000, 2001.

530
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,500
And I saw a Star Trek fan film and it looked like this.

531
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,580
They had gotten, like, and I've seen some,

532
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,020
somehow some of these, there's some of these

533
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,860
Star Trek films, they make, they get access to a bridge

534
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,220
or they build a bridge in someone's basement.

535
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,340
And it honestly looks pretty good, but it is shot poorly.

536
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,660
And the one I'm watching had Alan Ruck in it,

537
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:12,340
who, Alan Ruck is in Star Trek Generations,

538
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,500
my favorite Star Trek movie,

539
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,220
because it has the meeting of Captain Picard

540
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,060
and Captain Kirk and they meet and ride horses

541
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,860
because that's what everyone wanted.

542
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,740
But Alan Ruck is in it and he's playing

543
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,180
the captain of the Enterprise B.

544
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,380
And I remember watching him act and I was like,

545
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,780
this just seems like a guy.

546
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,460
This doesn't seem like, I love Alan Ruck,

547
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,900
but he seemed worse, he seemed bad.

548
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,260
And I was like, no, no, what?

549
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,260
And then I was like, oh, it's important

550
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,340
that everything else is good too.

551
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,300
The writing and the camera,

552
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,740
because you could really make a person you like look bad.

553
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:54,700
Mike, have you seen the CGI computer animated

554
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,740
Star Trek fan films?

555
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,900
I think it's like a web series someone discovered

556
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:03,060
where for whatever reason, every installment,

557
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:07,300
they go to the holodeck and meticulously recreate

558
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,060
the Price is Right set.

559
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:14,700
I have not seen that, but that is high on my priority list now.

560
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:18,740
The world of Star Trek fan films is immense

561
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:24,100
and like staggering, probably worth some sort of deep dive,

562
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,260
maybe on a separate podcast because I feel, yeah,

563
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,020
but I have not seen the thing you're talking about.

564
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,540
That sounds wild.

565
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,300
That was the early bit of quarantine madness

566
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,420
that someone discovered.

567
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,660
And I didn't even watch all of them.

568
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,620
I was like, this can't be true.

569
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,260
And I would just scrub to the moment in each installment.

570
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,060
And I was like, oh, yeah, there's the Price is Right set

571
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,300
again, they're playing the song.

572
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:49,740
There are like seasons worth of Star Trek fan films.

573
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:54,740
People make seasons of shows that have the production value

574
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,860
of Billy Toppett.

575
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,180
Jesus.

576
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,300
So yes, I-

577
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,700
What do you get out of it?

578
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,060
Besides when you take it to the one thing

579
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,460
that you show it at.

580
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,460
I don't know the answer to this.

581
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,540
And I guess it's like, yeah, you can show stuff

582
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,980
at Star Trek cons, which I have yet,

583
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,820
it's embarrassing.

584
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,660
I have never been to the Las Vegas Star Trek convention

585
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,460
for being a pretty decent Star Trek fan.

586
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,020
I'm not some, I don't know everything about it,

587
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,020
but I guess, yeah, you show it there.

588
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,340
That's embarrassing?

589
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,260
Well, embarrassing in the sense that I claim

590
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,820
to be a big Star Trek fan.

591
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,780
Yes, so embarrassing for me.

592
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,500
That's my shame.

593
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,180
That's what I feel shame over is never going

594
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,580
to that big Star Trek con.

595
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,620
I was planning on going into it honestly this year.

596
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,780
I had declared last year, this is the year.

597
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,340
Nothing's getting in the way of me

598
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,860
and Star Trek convention in Vegas in August.

599
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,020
And then something did.

600
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,460
And you didn't do the whatever virtual equivalent?

601
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,020
That's what I'm saying.

602
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,900
Like a real Star Trek fan could be like, fuck you,

603
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,740
you poser.

604
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,460
And they would be, I would feel, I would be like,

605
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,460
yeah, you're right.

606
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,140
You know, I have to take that.

607
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,700
Being bullied by somebody for not attending the convention.

608
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,940
I think Star Trek convention would be full of people

609
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,140
that had that opinion of me.

610
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,100
After I explained that I had not been on the ride.

611
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,900
I had not been to the convention before

612
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,220
and I'm in my third mid thirties.

613
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,700
Hey, I heard all this.

614
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,660
I know that you haven't done any of this

615
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,620
because I subscribed to your Patreon,

616
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,700
but I put money in your pocket, but fuck you.

617
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,460
Give me my money back.

618
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,300
Honestly, I would give them the money back

619
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,140
and it would be so great if somebody were like that

620
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,260
and mad at me for saying I'm a Star Trek fan, but not.

621
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,260
So, all right, so we're in the movie.

622
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:46,100
There's a, you know, he's on stage in the beginning

623
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,340
and he's twirling an assistant around.

624
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,900
It's like he has a big successful show,

625
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,180
much like Lance Burton has.

626
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,380
But then he wakes up and am I making this up?

627
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,100
I think he wakes up, whatever.

628
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,100
He then, you see his real life

629
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,700
and he does not have a big show

630
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,780
because when he goes to work, eventually,

631
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:08,740
it is to a children's birthday party, imagine.

632
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,740
But before that, you know how you,

633
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,660
I think a great way to get to know a character

634
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,700
is to watch him get ready in the morning,

635
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,140
to see what is their routine,

636
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,500
what is that little thing about them,

637
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,020
what does that tell you that's deeper about the character?

638
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,660
And in this case, I don't know if you guys picked up on this,

639
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,340
when you watch Billy Toppett get ready for his day,

640
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,260
this guy is obsessed with magic.

641
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,620
You know, I did pick up everywhere.

642
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,940
You know what I did?

643
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:43,100
And I just like to see characters getting ready

644
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:47,060
for something which happens multiple times in this movie.

645
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,740
This movie has an embarrassment of riches

646
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,220
when it comes to establishing shots.

647
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,900
They didn't have an embarrassment of riches

648
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,460
to produce these shots, but.

649
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,300
Yeah.

650
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,180
But they had a lot of them, a lot of shots.

651
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,060
This guy, you know, he's getting ready,

652
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,460
he's brushing his teeth and you look up

653
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:13,620
and he's got a poster of Houdini up on his shelf.

654
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,020
When he goes to sip his morning coffee,

655
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:21,020
he pulls up his mug and the mug has an image of Keller,

656
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:26,060
who one assumes is a magician.

657
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,460
The guy loves magic.

658
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,020
Yeah, he's doing card stuff,

659
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,180
he's doing card business while he's brushing his teeth.

660
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,980
The cabinet appears to be magic,

661
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,700
I think when he's getting his cereal,

662
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,460
because it's like opening and closing

663
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,020
with a wave of a hand sort of.

664
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,980
Oh, is that right?

665
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,580
He does little tricks?

666
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,420
Yeah, that's what I think.

667
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,500
I think that's what they were going for, yeah.

668
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,860
And he's good at magic.

669
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,700
Yes.

670
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,980
Yes, this is important.

671
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,380
He starts the movie good at magic.

672
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,860
This movie isn't like, you know, he's got something,

673
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,380
but there's also something holding him back.

674
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,780
He's very good at magic from the get go.

675
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,780
I've heard of, and I don't know if they've talked

676
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,140
about this in public, I've heard tell

677
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,500
of certain action stars have in their contract

678
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,180
that I cannot lose a fight in the movie I'm gonna be in.

679
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,260
The Rock or Jason Statham, they don't want to look weak

680
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,300
in the film, which I think, you know,

681
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,100
that seems a bit silly to me.

682
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,780
People know this is a movie.

683
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,420
They know you're not actually in a real fight,

684
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,860
but I think some people feel like they need to do that.

685
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,020
And I feel like Billy Toppett is a similar situation

686
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,220
where it was like, it's a funny idea

687
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,540
of this guy down on his luck doing kids' parties.

688
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,260
Wouldn't it also be funny if he was bad at magic?

689
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,180
And he was like, no way, I'm Lance Burton, I'm very good.

690
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,940
Billy Toppett is very good.

691
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,020
Something funny about me being bad.

692
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:59,340
And you're like, well, all right, well then,

693
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,700
where do you go, where does it go?

694
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,700
And he's like, we'll find a way, we'll figure it out.

695
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,300
It's, yeah, he's so good at this children's birthday party

696
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,460
with it, which is massive.

697
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,260
This is not like when you see the Ghostbusters

698
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,580
in part two at their sorry state

699
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,420
where kids are like beating them up

700
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,220
and it's like in a little apartment.

701
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,620
This is a giant party.

702
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,300
There are so many children there.

703
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,780
And not only do they like the show,

704
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,100
they love it so much that when he leaves,

705
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:32,100
they all follow him out the door and chant magic, magic.

706
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,300
He's such a hit.

707
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,980
Yes, he's the greatest magician and he never made it, right?

708
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,260
Like, is there, how much, yeah, like,

709
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,780
you would think this guy would be performing in Las Vegas.

710
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,780
He's so good.

711
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,660
Yeah, I mean, he's clearly like set up shop

712
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,260
in Vegas with that intent.

713
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,900
There was something that stuck with me,

714
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,940
maybe it's in the next seat.

715
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,740
No, I guess it was when he was getting ready.

716
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,220
He gets like stiff poster board

717
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,500
and makes a high collar for his shirt.

718
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,140
And he's already wearing a very elaborate ruffled shirt.

719
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:11,340
And it's like, I think it would come with that collar.

720
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,100
Like, I feel like you can buy that.

721
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,700
I don't know, I thought it was setting up like a low moment

722
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,380
someone would rip his collar off and rip it in half.

723
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,660
That does not happen.

724
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,420
Hmm, so he's a fraud that he had to prop up

725
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,140
his own high magician's collar.

726
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,780
That is not at all a high starched collar.

727
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:35,220
Yes, you are a fraud with poster board or foam core board.

728
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,620
I oftentimes will declare like a moment

729
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,020
of the most something moment on this podcast.

730
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,340
And I think this little conversation

731
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,100
might be the most alienating,

732
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,500
hard to explain conversation to anybody.

733
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,380
That we're talking about Billy Toppett's collar.

734
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,700
Huh?

735
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,100
Seems universal to me.

736
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,340
Like somebody's in their car going like they're talking.

737
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,180
They're talking about me.

738
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,540
We're taking a piss at Billy Toppett's unstarched collar.

739
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,340
That moment just doesn't land.

740
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,180
Yeah.

741
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,620
The collar, I know what you're saying, Jason.

742
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,300
Cause the collar, there's a lot of potential

743
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,100
for collar humor, you know?

744
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,780
I think in general, I like collar humor.

745
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,620
You can use a collar to indicate someone's just been like

746
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,980
making out in a closet or something.

747
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,500
Or they were just beaten up.

748
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,020
Or maybe they're like, yeah, it's down on their luck.

749
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,900
And like they slept in a weird spot last night.

750
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,540
A lipstick on collar.

751
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,540
Like a regular bag. Lipstick on collar.

752
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,100
Can we think of any other collar material

753
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,620
from famous films we like?

754
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,500
One of those no good mobsters could grab him by the collar.

755
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,860
Collar gets pulled out.

756
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,260
He escapes. That's right.

757
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,780
Does not on the docket for this movie.

758
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:49,580
So it's like somebody has a gun and then nobody fires it.

759
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,060
It's Chekhov's collar.

760
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,940
It's Chekhov's collar.

761
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,740
You know what I, David Mamet wrote a short book

762
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,580
about directing film.

763
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:02,140
And take it or leave it, take or leave, hero's journey.

764
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,060
But his whole idea was like just trying

765
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,740
to communicate visually.

766
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,420
Like, well, how many shots do you need

767
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,140
to communicate something?

768
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,100
And the students are all like explaining

769
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,900
like 10 different items.

770
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:16,300
And he like trains them all to like,

771
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,500
okay, take out everything, but like two things.

772
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,860
You need two things to communicate.

773
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,540
Like person is late for class.

774
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:30,580
And this movie adds eight, it gets all 10 in there

775
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,220
and then adds a couple more sometimes.

776
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,860
Well, if we're talking about literal items

777
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:38,100
on Billy Toppett's shelf, you get to see like all his CDs

778
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:42,140
and DVDs and like loose food around.

779
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,820
It's a very busy apartment shelves.

780
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,460
I'm so, because obviously like Lance Burton

781
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,980
must have a mansion in Vegas.

782
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,660
Like this is not his house, I would think.

783
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,260
Do we ever see it?

784
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,340
Are any of the locations in this film

785
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,060
where Lance Burton lives?

786
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,900
Yeah, that's what I was trying to figure out as well.

787
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,620
I'm not sure.

788
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,180
You would feel like every location in the movie

789
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:10,060
is where somebody lives involved in the production.

790
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,300
Yeah. Or the, you know,

791
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,380
when they go to like the carb shop,

792
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,740
like somebody, you know, works there.

793
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,540
Or like owed them a favor.

794
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,380
I don't think they paid for a location.

795
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,660
No, no. I would imagine.

796
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:26,460
But does he live at the kind of boring house

797
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,220
where the kid's birthday party happened?

798
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,500
Like the Henderson nice house.

799
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,380
This is all like, this movie is all,

800
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,060
it reminded me how like, if anybody ever starts thinking

801
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,260
it would be a fun idea to move to Las Vegas,

802
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,780
especially because you could maybe like afford

803
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,140
to like do better there.

804
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,300
This movie is a reminder why you should not.

805
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,060
It's dull, how is it like?

806
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,980
Yeah, all right.

807
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,740
I know that is bigger than where I live,

808
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,740
but it's also very depressing.

809
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,820
Yeah, it's, yeah, Jason, go ahead.

810
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:01,500
Well, Vegas is one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas

811
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:06,180
in the country, partly because of lower cost of living.

812
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,980
And also I believe there's no state income tax in Nevada.

813
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,380
So I practically get why someone would live there.

814
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,460
And also if someone was a stage magician,

815
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,180
I get why they would live there.

816
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,300
I mean, it seems like they're always building.

817
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,140
It's like a constantly expanding area.

818
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:27,660
So I kind of see the appeal, but dry heat is not for me.

819
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,020
Yeah, yeah, it's rough around there for sure.

820
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:36,020
You also, as I said, just where the birthday party happens

821
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,660
is like a little depressing,

822
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,820
despite being like a nice two story house.

823
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:44,180
Things get extremely depressing and extremely Henderson-y.

824
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:47,500
By that I mean Henderson, kind of the suburb city of Nevada.

825
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,500
When we go to the casino where Lance hangs out the most,

826
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:00,460
a lot of the movie happens in this diner inside a casino.

827
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,860
And boy, I was a little loopy enjoying the movie

828
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,940
for the first 10 minutes.

829
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,860
And then when we get to the diner, my spirits sank.

830
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,900
Because I mean, yeah.

831
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,500
So do we know where any of the, like, do they say,

832
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,660
I kind of, I'll be honest,

833
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,620
they zoned out some of the Zoom parts.

834
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:24,500
Do we know where some of these locations are at all?

835
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,020
I looked up this one, the casino where they are at,

836
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,540
because it was so miserable.

837
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,180
It was like, I have to know.

838
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,740
It is a place called the Klondike Sunset Casino.

839
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,380
That's sort of, I don't know.

840
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,740
It's like miles east of the strip, right thing.

841
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:45,460
It had a Wikipedia page that seemed like many sob stories

842
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,540
of changes of hands and ownership.

843
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,220
But none of them interesting enough

844
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,780
to make fun of on the podcast.

845
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:56,020
There's a lot of smaller casinos in Nevada.

846
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:59,220
There's a lot of locals' casinos, a lot of station casinos.

847
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,540
I think the locals go to the station brand.

848
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,700
Oh, that's all one brand?

849
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,540
And that's like where you go?

850
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,860
That's designed to be not touristy?

851
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,980
I think so, yeah.

852
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,460
Cause one of them, I saw a video where it's like,

853
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,100
oh, they put a big IMAX.

854
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,580
They put a bunch of movie theaters.

855
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,420
Like kind of stuff where it's like you can park for free.

856
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:25,260
It's kind of like a mall or like an Americana almost,

857
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,460
where it's like, yeah, there's a casino,

858
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,060
but there's other stuff here to do for families and stuff.

859
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,660
And there's a hotel, but probably not everyone

860
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,420
is gonna be staying at the hotel.

861
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,020
Cause filming on the strip, very expensive,

862
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,660
very complicated.

863
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:44,420
I think that last board movie has a big strip sequence.

864
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,020
And by the sheer fact they were able to do it,

865
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,140
I think it was either a casino that was being redone

866
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,420
or they got it to partially close,

867
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,980
which you gotta dole out some money

868
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,740
if you're getting a casino to close for a few hours.

869
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,780
You know?

870
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,620
Yeah, geez.

871
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:04,620
I think the Klondike Sunset, they just left open

872
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,860
with its regular clientele.

873
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,740
And that was as good as closing it.

874
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,580
Yeah.

875
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,660
It's the same thing.

876
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:14,740
It is, I mean, I kind of wanted some sort of excuse

877
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,420
to be in Vegas for like a month

878
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,940
to be able to go to like this place,

879
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,820
but there's just no way I'll ever get to it.

880
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:25,340
Cause there's so much like of this like little outlier

881
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,660
casino-y stuff.

882
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:29,340
And I'm assuming most of it was a little depressing,

883
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:32,500
but I am intrigued by all of it.

884
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,340
Yeah, yeah.

885
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,300
I'd take a walk around.

886
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,620
You gotta be careful with that

887
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,020
cause I love walking around weird desolate places,

888
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,700
but in Vegas, you may be like,

889
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,540
your desolate places might get you killed or something.

890
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,380
That's all right.

891
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,380
That's fair.

892
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,380
Like you run into like the Joe Pesci

893
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,540
buried alive scene in casino.

894
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,660
You turn a corner and there's a guy getting buried alive.

895
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,140
Walk away, son.

896
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,060
No, no, no.

897
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,220
Steve Wynn is burying a guy in the desert.

898
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,660
Joe Francis of Girls Gone Wild.

899
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,340
I believe he's made that threat to him.

900
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,180
I believe that-

901
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,020
To kill him, to bury him alive.

902
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,900
I believe, let me, I'll look it up.

903
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,900
I want to be accurate here with Steve Wynn's threats.

904
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,940
Oh my God.

905
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:25,220
Not the last reference to Martin Scorsese's casino

906
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,380
that will come up in this, I feel like.

907
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,860
Yeah, very similar.

908
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,980
Very equivalent films.

909
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,820
Oh yeah.

910
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:39,780
So, and interrupt whatever you have your findings, Mike.

911
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,820
But the, so we end up in this diner

912
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:47,380
where Billy hangs out with his equivalent friends,

913
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,460
his similarly down and out crew

914
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:54,260
of wannabe Vegas entertainers.

915
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,540
And among them are some jugglers

916
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,620
and ventriloquists,

917
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,940
and then a guy who like can't figure it out.

918
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:05,340
Is he a Spider-Man you take pictures with?

919
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,060
Is he an Elvis?

920
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,260
His pro, he's kind of a jack of all trades

921
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,460
and master of none.

922
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:15,460
So, and the other thing that bonds all of these guys

923
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,260
is that they are all north of 50.

924
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:25,220
The only one whose hair isn't dyed is the one with no hair.

925
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,940
And surely the first time it cuts to all of them,

926
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:32,740
you just, you shiver at this group.

927
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,180
This is like the most, like if you were growing up

928
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:40,380
in a divorce situation and then you meet your dad's friends,

929
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,820
your dad's new friends and they're like this,

930
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,580
you know the rest of your childhood

931
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,860
is gonna be very depressing.

932
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:51,020
It's, it's the less, I think I've said this before,

933
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,460
it's the less good version of when you go

934
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,020
and see an old rock band.

935
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,900
And from far away, you kind of go,

936
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,460
well, they look kind of the same

937
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,780
and their hair kind of looks the same.

938
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,260
But then if you get closer, you go,

939
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,660
oh, they just have either a wig that's an approximation

940
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,460
of what their hair looked like 30 years ago,

941
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,900
or it's just like jet black.

942
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,140
And you're like, this is an 80 year old man.

943
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,580
He has jet black hair.

944
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,940
Every one of these guys, if Billy Toppett's friends

945
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:19,140
could be in the Beach Boys in 2020.

946
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,660
They all look like current Beach Boys.

947
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,660
How do you, can I ask, I hit the sidebar.

948
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,900
Do you know the name of all the touring Beach Boys in 2020?

949
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,420
I'm so happy to say that I don't.

950
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,940
Like there are even depths to which I cannot plummet.

951
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,780
Wow.

952
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,300
It's always funny watching people rediscover

953
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,980
the crappiness of the Beach Boys

954
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,340
and that Brian Wilson's been gone for a long time.

955
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,580
And you know, everybody got mad

956
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:45,780
because they did a Trump benefit in Orange County

957
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,580
and everybody had to learn like,

958
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,940
but wait, that's not really them.

959
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,420
And I'm like, yeah, look at these,

960
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,980
it's been like seven anonymous guys in bowling shirts

961
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:56,980
for like literally two decades now.

962
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:02,460
I wonder like, do you think you could get involved somehow?

963
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,140
Like maybe, like we could just make it clear,

964
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,140
like it's on record, you're doing it as a bit,

965
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,260
you're not supporting any of Mike Love's shit.

966
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,900
But like, I think I'd be, if I put myself out there,

967
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,820
I'd be like directing their music videos immediately.

968
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:20,780
Just by virtue that I have a computer.

969
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,220
Just like one for a bit.

970
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,220
Yeah, that's true.

971
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,820
I feel like there's certain things.

972
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,820
I was just talking to Anthony Geo about how like,

973
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:32,820
if we just hung around in Washington DC in like a lobby,

974
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:35,580
we could have been in Trump's cabinet in like six months

975
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:38,780
if we just like pretended we were Republicans.

976
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:41,220
I feel like there's certain places

977
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,500
where you just hang around a little bit

978
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,100
and they're just like, yeah, welcome to the club.

979
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:48,940
You just have to both like go fully clean shaven

980
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:51,100
and then do your hair in that like super,

981
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,900
that like three passes of gel, Matt Gates style.

982
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,740
Yes.

983
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,940
As long as you like look like sharp assholes.

984
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,300
Yeah, 100%.

985
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,740
I don't think it would be hard at all

986
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,860
to fool a bunch of people.

987
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:05,700
And like, we would be getting like the same exact access

988
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,940
as like the guy in charge of the CIA.

989
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,380
Like we would have been like, no problem.

990
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:16,580
We would be running just whole parts of the United States

991
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,300
that we have no business running because we like said it.

992
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,420
You would have been like the number,

993
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:25,420
you two are the number threes on solving the coronavirus.

994
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,900
100%

995
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,980
Not qualified, like all we have to do

996
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,340
is just kiss the president's ass

997
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,140
and that's all we have, like it doesn't matter.

998
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:35,540
That's the only qualification for the job.

999
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,340
I think you could have done both,

1000
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:40,180
you could have done like a Yo Jimbo fist full of dollars

1001
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:43,620
sort of thing where you are fixers for both,

1002
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,140
you're playing both parties.

1003
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,020
You're playing both and then you get the hell out of Dodge.

1004
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,060
It doesn't seem that hard is what I'm saying.

1005
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:53,340
And I think that applies to the Mike Love Beach Boys.

1006
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,980
I think Scott, if you know where to hang out

1007
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,380
or if you know where to talk,

1008
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:00,820
and if you know you have probably the right clothes for it.

1009
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:01,660
Oh, I sure do.

1010
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:05,020
I'm looking at a Tommy Bahamas shirt in my closet right now.

1011
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:05,860
Yeah.

1012
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,060
That's usually the right clothes to me.

1013
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:11,940
I think maybe, yeah, like if you get to work now

1014
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:15,740
when Mike Love is 87, you maybe like,

1015
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,940
you could be in the band, you could be playing.

1016
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:18,780
Woodblock.

1017
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,740
That's the thing to aim for,

1018
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,500
like despite not really having musical abilities,

1019
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,300
but that might, I don't know,

1020
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,340
considering the state of the current band, yeah.

1021
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,580
I think that might not be a problem.

1022
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:31,500
Long-term, it's just, I have such a fantasy

1023
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,060
of doing a long-term con, you know?

1024
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,460
I really wish. Yeah.

1025
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,180
I really wish I have the stamina to do it.

1026
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1027
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,380
It would be so funny. It takes energy.

1028
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,220
But yeah, you're right.

1029
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,500
If I could like, if then if someday

1030
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,900
people are describing this podcast,

1031
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,780
like yeah, it's these guys and they're all comedians,

1032
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,660
I've seen them in other stuff,

1033
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,660
and one of them has been in the Beach Boys

1034
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:53,980
for three years.

1035
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,100
That's the funny, that's so much funnier than anything.

1036
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,740
If you were in the Beach Boys.

1037
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:05,300
As a prank, I was in the Beach Boys for a long time.

1038
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:07,580
Like when?

1039
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,140
No, like starting in 2021.

1040
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,100
Right.

1041
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:14,660
For their, he was there for their 70th anniversary tour.

1042
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,660
Mike Love on his 85th birthday asked you to join.

1043
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,820
Meanwhile, Mike has mysteriously become

1044
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,860
the head of Urban Life.

1045
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,060
Yeah.

1046
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,900
Or what's the one that all the presidents have spoken at,

1047
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,740
like the national get together?

1048
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,420
Oh, I know what you're talking about.

1049
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,260
Oh God, they sell garbage.

1050
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,460
Fuck.

1051
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,300
I forget.

1052
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,140
And what?

1053
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:36,980
I know what you're talking about.

1054
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:37,820
Oh, sure, sure.

1055
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:38,660
Oh, oh.

1056
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,500
Yeah.

1057
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,140
And honestly with the Trump, like it goes both ways.

1058
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:45,420
I think I could get in,

1059
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:48,060
I could be in the Democratic establishment

1060
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,180
some like very quickly if I just hung around

1061
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,820
the right hotel lobbies in DC.

1062
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1063
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:54,500
I'd say so.

1064
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:58,340
Well, I'll see what I can do if I can warm my way in.

1065
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,740
I'll look into this on your behalf as well.

1066
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,860
I think there's a way.

1067
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:06,380
I think it's maybe worth mentioning

1068
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:08,100
that this is the very first podcast

1069
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,620
that we've recorded since the defeat of Donald Trump.

1070
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,940
And I like that.

1071
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:17,140
I was like, I put my baby down for a nap

1072
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:18,580
and then like, I got a little time,

1073
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,700
now I can watch a little more Billy Toppett.

1074
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,420
Let me see if the results are in yet.

1075
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,580
And they were.

1076
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:28,020
My evening was drinking champagne

1077
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,620
and then watching the end of Billy Toppett.

1078
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:33,940
So Billy Toppett, Master Magician is forever tied in

1079
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:36,420
to me getting this historic news.

1080
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,260
I guess all of that, right?

1081
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,100
The last 40 hours.

1082
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:38,940
Yeah, I didn't watch that.

1083
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:42,740
Have been checking results and watching Billy Toppett.

1084
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,620
I have not watched any other movie

1085
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,140
since the results came in.

1086
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:50,300
So Billy Toppett is now forever linked to this moment

1087
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:56,340
when, as Scott put it, a villain has been defeated.

1088
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,180
Yes.

1089
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:58,020
Like.

1090
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:58,860
A real life.

1091
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:01,580
A real life villain has been defeated.

1092
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,620
So yeah, this is gonna be,

1093
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:06,220
it's gonna be a memorable weekend for a lot of reasons.

1094
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:10,180
Half of them Billy Toppett related.

1095
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:13,300
I think I'm just realizing I had the weirdest order

1096
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,460
of events, which was Friday night.

1097
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:18,980
We watched the 2018 David Gordon Green Halloween

1098
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,220
and then went to sleep, woke up,

1099
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:25,940
learned Biden was called from text messages

1100
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,380
cause I slept in.

1101
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:33,420
And then shortly thereafter started watching Billy Toppett.

1102
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,260
So.

1103
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:37,940
That's history.

1104
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:40,020
A little side note for,

1105
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:43,900
if you think my checking was out of control

1106
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,580
in regular time,

1107
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,820
I would just like to explain to you

1108
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:52,460
that the checking was on another fucking level

1109
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,900
since Tuesday.

1110
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,180
And part of the conversation,

1111
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:03,060
I have not texted more with anybody than Gio.

1112
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:07,180
Gio and I were up till 5.30, I think on election night,

1113
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:11,060
5.30 AM, texting each other.

1114
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:15,500
We found Decision Desk HQ Twitter account.

1115
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,100
All of a sudden we found this other account

1116
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,660
that was dumping like number results

1117
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,020
and we started texting back and forth.

1118
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:25,300
We both signed up for this website to get updates.

1119
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,500
And then I think we both tried to go to bed at about 3 AM.

1120
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,260
And then both of us picked up our phone

1121
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:31,780
about 20 minutes later.

1122
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:34,220
He's like, I'm back at the computer.

1123
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,300
And then I think about five, we were like,

1124
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,100
I don't think anything's coming in tonight.

1125
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:42,340
I watched half of Vegas vacation and fell asleep.

1126
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:43,220
That's nice.

1127
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,100
I like that.

1128
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,820
But yeah, no, it was,

1129
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:48,780
I think I would, you know,

1130
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,740
I tried to go to bed or even earlier than that.

1131
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,820
And then all of a sudden Wisconsin numbers came in

1132
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,820
and it was like, whoa, whoa, whoa,

1133
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:55,860
Wisconsin number is good.

1134
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,740
And I got a surge of adrenaline.

1135
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,820
And then we were up and then we were, yeah.

1136
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:04,300
Then we were going, but yes, my checking,

1137
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,780
oh my God, it's never been more,

1138
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,260
I've never checked more.

1139
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:12,540
I resisted for a while and then gave into it.

1140
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,420
I resisted all day election day

1141
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,340
and then the polls started close on the East coast.

1142
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:17,460
I was like, oh, fine.

1143
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:19,540
Yeah, I know.

1144
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:22,900
I have, and I've noticed this recently.

1145
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:26,500
I have something wrong with my finger.

1146
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,860
You can't see it for sure.

1147
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,860
There's like, it looks like my finger,

1148
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,700
my like pinky on my left hand is like swollen.

1149
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:37,140
And it's, I believe because when I'm holding the phone,

1150
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:39,420
I'm holding it down here.

1151
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:40,500
Yeah, it's the shelf.

1152
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,500
Yeah, I've had that.

1153
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,820
I've had like pins and needles or aches.

1154
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:46,500
So it looks like I had a burn.

1155
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,540
It looks like I had a burn on my left hand, on my pinky

1156
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:52,620
from holding the phone so much.

1157
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,900
It's exactly how my finger looked

1158
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,980
when I got like a little burn in science class,

1159
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:57,820
like in high school.

1160
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:02,820
So yeah, my checking, my checking has been out of control.

1161
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,460
So you burn your finger, but the important thing is,

1162
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:09,140
it sounds like you had fun doing it.

1163
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:11,380
Let's see.

1164
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,740
There were moments of fun, I will say.

1165
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:15,580
Sure, sure.

1166
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:17,660
There were moments, I mean, there were multiple hours

1167
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,340
as we all remember of pure dread.

1168
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,180
Yeah, boy.

1169
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:23,660
Oh, the poles work.

1170
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,260
The poles are very wrong.

1171
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:26,260
Uh oh.

1172
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:31,220
Hey, we're approximately 15 minutes into Billy Toppett,

1173
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:32,060
Master Magician.

1174
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,180
There's no reason this should be a two hour episode.

1175
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:35,260
No, I know you're right.

1176
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,100
Zero, zero.

1177
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,340
There's a lot on our mind right now.

1178
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,700
You know, we're blowing off some steam, catching up.

1179
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:40,860
You know.

1180
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:42,020
Yeah, we haven't talked in time.

1181
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,260
I really didn't text a lot of people.

1182
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:45,540
I just kind of froze.

1183
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:49,940
Oh, I also was eating like handfuls of edibles for days.

1184
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:54,940
So that's how I stayed off anxiety for me, you know.

1185
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:58,020
Yeah, but how would you have felt if he got reelected

1186
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:59,980
and now you're like, oh God,

1187
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:04,260
like it would have been like a literal nightmare unfolding.

1188
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:07,180
I was gonna try to go to bed without looking up anything.

1189
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:10,140
I mean, I was doing research for an upcoming

1190
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:15,060
very big episode about a very hopeful attraction.

1191
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:17,860
And so that's how I was keeping my head level.

1192
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:21,260
And then I jumped head first into darkness.

1193
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:23,140
So, yeah.

1194
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,260
Okay, Billy Toppett.

1195
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:30,060
All right, so we're at a depressing diner

1196
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,860
with a bunch of losers.

1197
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:36,140
And then they all like, like, ogle waitresses

1198
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:38,300
and that's supposed to make them likable.

1199
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,180
Waitresses who were dressed like

1200
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:43,300
the bagged Halloween costume version of waitresses,

1201
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,660
where it's like pink and their names are on it.

1202
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,940
It's like kind of the Lucy and Ethel

1203
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,740
chocolate factory outfit as well.

1204
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,580
Very much so, yes.

1205
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,300
When they're sitting around the table,

1206
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,460
did you have a flashback to the Louie poker scene?

1207
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,740
Oh, big time.

1208
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:01,820
Oh yeah, well, definitely that.

1209
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:04,780
And not to jump around, although we might as well.

1210
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:07,900
I don't think we owe this movie a slavish scene by scene,

1211
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:11,020
but I really got the Louie poker scene

1212
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,980
when later in the movie,

1213
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:17,500
so Billy Toppett develops a relationship

1214
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,820
with one of the waitresses.

1215
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:22,140
And they end up going on a date.

1216
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:26,660
And then later back at Billy's apartment,

1217
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:28,820
it's just the boys and they're hanging out

1218
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:31,700
and they're going over details of the date

1219
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:36,700
while also watching old magic footage like it's sports.

1220
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,780
Like they're watching a guy go through a trap door

1221
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:43,060
or something and then go, oh, how'd he do that?

1222
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,540
Oh man, the best.

1223
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:47,420
Anyway, so dude, how'd the date go?

1224
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:48,860
Give me those deets.

1225
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:55,060
It is the most like, and then they also in this scene,

1226
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,820
Billy Toppett as well, he always,

1227
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,580
Lance Burton has this jet black dyed hair.

1228
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:06,340
But in this scene, he's got a backwards baseball cap

1229
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,780
and there's a pizza open and they're drinking

1230
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,780
out of red solo cups.

1231
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:14,540
Like it's this dorm energy, but with like,

1232
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:18,660
truly like 59 year old men, it's so strange.

1233
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:21,540
Yes, no, I don't know.

1234
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,300
Does Lance, like this is my question.

1235
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:26,980
Like, does Lance do that with his buddies now?

1236
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:29,980
Like it's such a, it's such a sex,

1237
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:33,100
like teen sex comedy scene.

1238
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,340
Like, I don't know.

1239
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:37,460
Guys being guys, I have a question I cannot remember.

1240
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:39,420
Was the dummy in that scene,

1241
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,820
was the dummy watching the TV with them?

1242
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:44,820
Oh, the dummy isn't, oh, wait a minute.

1243
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:45,660
I'm scrolling back through that.

1244
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,780
The dummy doesn't really come into play that often.

1245
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,860
At some point you see the ventriloquist waking up.

1246
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:54,180
You see all of these guys start their day.

1247
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:57,380
You see all of them get ready for the day at some point.

1248
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:01,460
But the dummy in one of the diner scenes, two things.

1249
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:05,380
One, the dummy, and you're talking about Louis jokes

1250
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:09,940
that don't land, the dummy refers to plywood Americans.

1251
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:13,020
And ooh, boy, that really doesn't land.

1252
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:17,380
And then the dummy, much like our friend blue 32

1253
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,300
at some point looks at the waitress and goes, she's hot.

1254
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:26,140
There's a lot of ogling of these waitresses.

1255
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,980
I don't know what they're supposed to.

1256
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:31,980
These are the two female, women characters in the movie.

1257
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,700
They definitely do not pass the Bechdel test.

1258
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:37,220
I was gonna say, Jason, are you saying that Billy Toppett

1259
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:39,100
doesn't pass the Bechdel test?

1260
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,060
Definitely, for sure does not.

1261
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:44,740
I guess she does talk, she's really into the magic act.

1262
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:47,940
Eventually she gets pulled into being his assistant

1263
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,820
and is passionate about magic.

1264
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:51,300
So I guess, you know.

1265
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,460
This movie is from, what is it, 2015?

1266
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:57,140
2015, yeah.

1267
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:00,340
Doesn't it feel like these people were all in a bunker

1268
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:02,740
until 2015 for like 15 years.

1269
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:04,980
They have no clue what happened in the world at all.

1270
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:07,740
And then they decided to just immediately make a movie.

1271
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:11,020
I think so.

1272
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:13,100
You know, I looked up some of the process

1273
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,980
of making this film and he,

1274
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,660
by Lance Burton's account, he was developing this

1275
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,740
for decades.

1276
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:25,700
And he and one of the juggler guys,

1277
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,980
he and one of the jugglers,

1278
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:31,540
apparently quote Burton worked on the script

1279
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,540
for six years.

1280
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,140
Wow.

1281
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:35,980
How?

1282
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:41,940
What made it, it was just to crack.

1283
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:45,500
What should they be eating when the magic bros

1284
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,660
hang out and watch magic together?

1285
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:51,180
Pepperoni pizza, sausage pizza.

1286
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:53,820
What's these, I'm trying to get into their heads.

1287
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,060
What's their pizza vibe?

1288
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:57,620
How long did Tommy, how long did it take Tommy Wiseau

1289
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:59,220
to write The Room, do you know?

1290
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:01,060
That I'm not sure.

1291
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:03,580
I think it was being nursed along for a long time.

1292
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,660
I don't have a year count.

1293
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:08,620
I wonder if some, a lot of these type of projects,

1294
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:11,260
they're just decades in the making.

1295
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,300
I think so.

1296
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,420
Two decades, jotting notes for a script

1297
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,220
and developing the character.

1298
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:21,500
So yeah, the character, how would you,

1299
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:25,220
anyone want to ascribe some qualities to Billy Toppett,

1300
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:27,780
the character who took two decades to develop?

1301
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:30,660
Hmm.

1302
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:33,060
Well, he has kind of a Southern accent.

1303
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:36,220
Yes, he's from Kentucky.

1304
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,220
Yeah, okay.

1305
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,500
Do you dispute that?

1306
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,060
I couldn't, I didn't pick up on it.

1307
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:49,820
He's loyal to his friends because in the end,

1308
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:52,860
he puts them in his show that he gets, spoiler.

1309
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,220
Seems like that's the real life.

1310
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,060
A lot of, I'll be honest, a lot of it comes from

1311
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:58,980
maybe the real life man, Lance Burton,

1312
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:02,140
because he's loyal, everyone likes him, he's nice.

1313
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:02,980
Nice, he's another one.

1314
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,620
A lot of biggest actors, performers in this movie.

1315
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:09,620
He's talented, Billy Toppett is talented.

1316
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:10,460
Yeah.

1317
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:16,500
And I guess desirous would be another thing I would say.

1318
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,980
That he, because he desires a woman's touch

1319
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:21,900
or that he is desired.

1320
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,180
I think, I guess both.

1321
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:25,180
Kind of both.

1322
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:27,900
I mean, while we're on the subject of his dating life,

1323
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:32,300
he, because it sort of runs parallel to the other plot,

1324
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:37,300
which we'll talk about, but he asks this waitress on a date,

1325
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,940
he kind of gets up there, like his magic career's

1326
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:42,620
going well enough that he's starting to get his confidence.

1327
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:45,300
So he asks her out and they go to a depressing

1328
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,060
hookah restaurant together.

1329
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:53,140
Where he does little bits of magic, obviously,

1330
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:54,540
to sort of charmer.

1331
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:57,260
And then before you know it, everyone at the restaurant

1332
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:00,380
is watching the magic together and they're all laughing

1333
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:01,300
and enjoying it.

1334
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:06,300
And then they leave the restaurant and he walks her to her car

1335
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:12,540
and she drops something and bends down to pick it up.

1336
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:15,620
And then he kind of shoots a glance her way.

1337
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:17,500
And then she comes back up and says,

1338
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,580
were you looking at my butt?

1339
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:24,180
And he defends himself by saying, no, no, no,

1340
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:26,980
I was doing research and development.

1341
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:28,700
For a trick.

1342
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,900
I was wondering if you'd be the right size

1343
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,820
to fit into a box.

1344
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,180
I know this all sounds strange.

1345
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:39,300
He kind of sputters and it's unclear if he's making that up.

1346
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,740
Or I'll take, I will take him at his word that he was

1347
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:46,460
checking out her proportions to see if she'd fit in a box

1348
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:48,260
or not, but not to kill her.

1349
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:51,300
Don't go, don't start thinking that.

1350
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:55,340
Anyway, he explains himself and then at the end she says,

1351
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:57,460
hey, and if you were checking me out,

1352
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:58,980
I'm okay with that too.

1353
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,100
One of the creepiest scenes.

1354
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,060
The scene is okay.

1355
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,660
The fact that he probably only could get locations

1356
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:13,020
that were the dingiest worst places around Las Vegas

1357
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:15,740
gives the movie an accidental air.

1358
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:17,420
I don't think that he was looking for.

1359
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,380
And then this scene that you're talking about

1360
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:23,060
when they're out in the parking lot is not lit at all.

1361
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:24,580
So it's like zero.

1362
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:28,340
He's in like this just weird shadow.

1363
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:32,820
And he's, it's just like, he comes off so bad.

1364
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:36,820
And it's like, they're accidental things that give this

1365
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:41,260
movie such a dark, a darkness that I don't think.

1366
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:44,540
I think this scene was intended to be very cute.

1367
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:45,500
And oh, it is funny.

1368
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,580
He was checking her out, but he just thought of something

1369
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:50,260
cute to say, look, this is just a nice thing.

1370
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:51,540
But instead it's just like, yes,

1371
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:53,500
I've been sizing you up for a box.

1372
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:58,900
Like that's, and I'm in the outskirts of Las Vegas.

1373
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,580
In the outskirts or in the desert.

1374
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:03,260
And I'm cast my shadow over my face.

1375
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:08,260
And I looking for, I'm checking your rear to see.

1376
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:10,700
See if you fit a box.

1377
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,740
I have asked no questions about your life on this date.

1378
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:18,060
Solely done magic.

1379
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:22,020
And she's like, oh, okay, great.

1380
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:23,260
This fine.

1381
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:26,540
Also it's in a, it's a general strip mall parking lot.

1382
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:31,380
And a bunch of it, like you see just some of the adjacent

1383
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:35,540
sign of the store next door, which is like a salon,

1384
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:37,100
like a nail salon.

1385
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:38,940
So for a lot of this discussion,

1386
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:42,980
just the neon word fingers up inside of the frame.

1387
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:46,180
And then when you go to the other side,

1388
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:50,340
a lot of it is lit by a red Panda Express sign.

1389
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:56,180
Like the lighting on an episode of Bar Rescue is better.

1390
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:00,300
Like when John Taffer is outside in the,

1391
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,540
in like a parking lot of a strip mall, he's,

1392
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:05,260
his lighting looks like, you know,

1393
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:10,260
it's a Roger Deakins shot, like compared to this.

1394
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:14,620
I was thinking completely of Bar Rescue

1395
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:16,260
and that he would have to go to the,

1396
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,700
the olive Mediterranean grill.

1397
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:21,500
John Taffer would have to rescue all of the locations

1398
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,100
in this movie.

1399
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,700
The olive Mediterranean grill is located

1400
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,260
in Henderson, Nevada.

1401
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:28,100
Just on the outskirts of Las Vegas.

1402
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:30,100
This place is depressing.

1403
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:31,900
It's depressing.

1404
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:34,940
You, what are you doing?

1405
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:36,700
Doing magic in here?

1406
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:39,140
You was lighting the bill on fire.

1407
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:41,060
You didn't ask him to leave?

1408
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:42,540
What's shutting it down?

1409
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:44,620
You're mistreating women.

1410
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:46,700
You were looking,

1411
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,700
you allowed somebody to look at a butt

1412
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,140
in your parking lot.

1413
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,380
No, it was for a box.

1414
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:53,460
I don't care if it was for a box.

1415
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:57,060
Yeah.

1416
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:59,660
That really, that could be a whole season of Bar Rescue

1417
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:01,180
is all these locations.

1418
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:02,020
Saving.

1419
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:03,620
Yeah, he could save the diner.

1420
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:07,540
He could save the Shriner's auditorium

1421
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:09,700
where a show happens.

1422
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:10,540
Yes.

1423
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:12,620
They just, they just like go to a real thing

1424
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,620
that Lance Burton would do,

1425
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:16,820
or Shriner's benefit and film it.

1426
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:21,100
It's just all like, it's all clearly just connects like,

1427
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:22,380
hey, can you do me a solid?

1428
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:23,860
Let me film my movie here.

1429
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:25,060
Yeah.

1430
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:27,940
We should probably mention the mobsters.

1431
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:32,700
I was about to say, yeah, the romance story

1432
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:36,060
is kind of parallel with the mob story

1433
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:41,060
because a, so after there's a little bit of flirting

1434
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:43,940
with the waitress and you meet his friend

1435
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:46,860
group of divorced dads,

1436
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:51,660
he then encounters a guy named George Joseph.

1437
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:55,300
And George Joseph is the head of security for the casino.

1438
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,340
And he was also once a magician.

1439
01:03:57,340 --> 01:04:00,460
And he uses his sleight of hand knowledge

1440
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:03,300
from being a magician to look at,

1441
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,980
to see if people are trying to cheat at the games.

1442
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:08,540
And that was all so specific and weird.

1443
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:10,740
And then I looked it up and it turns out George Joseph

1444
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:13,060
is a real guy who, and that is his story.

1445
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:15,860
He's a former magician who now,

1446
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:18,020
so this is a real thing he just pulled into the movie.

1447
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:21,700
This guy was a magician and then now works in security

1448
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:24,660
at valleys, but it all feels, I mean,

1449
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:29,220
the whole thing feels very Decker to me in many ways.

1450
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:32,020
And like the Decker seasons before they got budget,

1451
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:33,940
like the online Decker seasons.

1452
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:36,540
And this one, especially, cause they're always trying

1453
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:40,220
to work in Greg Turkington, cracking codes.

1454
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:41,620
I could crack the code.

1455
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:46,100
And this feels like this weird contrived, but real,

1456
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:50,380
I was a magician, so I know sleight of hand when I see it.

1457
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:53,220
And then, but then that George Joseph

1458
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:56,060
is the name of the character, but that's not who plays him.

1459
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:58,060
But then later there's this kind of bizarre

1460
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:02,620
little sheriff man and that's the real George Joseph.

1461
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:05,100
Oh, so it's like as if Kenny Kramer from Seinfeld

1462
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:08,940
was making a cameo in Seinfeld, but he did not play Kramer.

1463
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:10,620
Yes, as a different thing.

1464
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:13,780
So when you see a weird little sheriff

1465
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:16,660
with like Sergeant Pepper epaulettes

1466
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:19,460
and ropes on his sheriff's uniform,

1467
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:22,140
that's the real sleight of hand security man.

1468
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:24,780
Yeah, he thought that was a compelling narrative

1469
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:26,660
to put into the movie.

1470
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:29,260
Pretty interesting, yeah, let's stop for a while

1471
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,340
and hear him explain his tale

1472
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:33,540
of how he became the head of security.

1473
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:35,740
Yeah.

1474
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:38,460
Why couldn't he just cast him as the guy then?

1475
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:41,820
Well, he's kind of weird as the sheriff.

1476
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:42,860
It's that I think he even-

1477
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:45,500
Well, who's not weird as any of these characters?

1478
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:46,940
Okay, there's one person-

1479
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:49,220
I get you're right that traditionally the guy

1480
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:52,860
who they cast looks more like it, but who cares?

1481
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:53,700
What does it matter?

1482
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,380
There's one guy who seems very comfortable on camera.

1483
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:59,340
I'm just gonna come out and say it, it's Louis Anderson.

1484
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:01,980
All the characters are Vegas people in this movie.

1485
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,980
And Louis Anderson, longtime Vegas,

1486
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:07,540
performing residency.

1487
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:10,460
And he seems comfortable on camera.

1488
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:13,780
Lance Burton, comfortable-ish on camera.

1489
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:18,060
But Louis seemed fine on camera.

1490
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:19,460
He was so nice to see.

1491
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:22,980
He's just a security guard for a minute, for like 30 seconds.

1492
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:25,300
And you just light up, he reminds you

1493
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:30,300
of how funny he is in baskets, and then he's gone.

1494
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:31,940
It's the briefest taste.

1495
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,700
But we do get a lot of mob guys,

1496
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,940
a lot of mob guys who are sort of questionable

1497
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:41,260
in their ability to be on camera.

1498
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:43,740
What's going on with the mob?

1499
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:47,660
They're like cheating at the games with sleight of hand.

1500
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:49,460
Yeah, they have like a contraption.

1501
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:50,460
I forget what it's called.

1502
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:51,380
He says it.

1503
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:52,460
They have like cards up there,

1504
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:53,980
literally cards up their sleeve

1505
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:58,260
with like a mechanized like card feeding thing.

1506
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:00,660
Like it might be one of the most expensive elements

1507
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:03,300
of this movie is this cheating contraption.

1508
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:06,540
Now, if you've seen the movie Casino,

1509
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:09,580
you know casinos take cheating very seriously.

1510
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:14,340
And sometimes they will break your legs or beat you up.

1511
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:20,820
But in this, they are kind of like, hey, get out of here.

1512
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:25,820
And then they take his, is the plot that they confiscate

1513
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:30,060
the money that the guy won with cheating,

1514
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:34,180
and then he wants Lance to get it back to him.

1515
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:35,700
Well, he doesn't want Lance to get it back.

1516
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:37,780
He wants Billy Toppett to get it back.

1517
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:40,300
Oh, Billy, yes, Billy Toppett, master magician.

1518
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:41,980
Yeah, that's right.

1519
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,660
The other thing you might remember

1520
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:47,700
from Martin Scorsese's Casino is that if mobsters are across,

1521
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:49,820
they will just walk up behind you

1522
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:51,820
and shoot you twice in the head

1523
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:53,820
or drive you out to the desert,

1524
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:56,620
make you dig your own grave and then shoot you

1525
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:58,620
and then fill up the grave.

1526
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:03,460
These mobsters are pretty patient people, you know?

1527
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:05,740
Yeah, yeah, they're nicer mobsters.

1528
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:08,020
It is the mobster fail son.

1529
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:12,100
Like the big mobster is going into legitimate casinos,

1530
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:12,980
I believe, right?

1531
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:15,580
Like his father is opening a new hotel

1532
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:17,820
and like Billy Stubble.

1533
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:19,540
Oh yeah, there's a lot of jokes that don't land

1534
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:22,980
about construction companies being a front for the mob.

1535
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:24,580
Yeah. Right.

1536
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:26,940
And Lance, I mean, Lance crosses over, I think,

1537
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:30,780
from my understanding, the time when the mob ran Vegas

1538
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:32,940
to when the corporations ran Vegas.

1539
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:36,300
So he's again, drawing real life experience,

1540
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:37,580
I think, into this.

1541
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:43,540
Scorsese's Casino is about the mob controlled casino.

1542
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:48,300
Yeah, which kind of came before the like 90s

1543
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:50,740
like theme park Vegas era.

1544
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:55,460
Yes, and I believe from what I think the performers,

1545
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,220
I preferred when the mob ran it.

1546
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:59,420
I think I've heard Bob Newhart say,

1547
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:01,940
who's like the nicest man, supposedly,

1548
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:04,340
that Vegas was better when the mob ran it.

1549
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:08,380
I think the entertainers were well taken care of

1550
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:10,380
by the mob, yes.

1551
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,780
I think he also said like, you know,

1552
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:15,140
things could not necessarily have to make a maximum profit

1553
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:15,980
and stay open.

1554
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:16,820
Oh yeah.

1555
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:18,620
Didn't it all have to be, you know,

1556
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:21,780
passing a certain threshold for making money

1557
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:23,700
to keep a certain performer there,

1558
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:26,820
to keep a certain element of the casino open.

1559
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:30,020
The Backstreet Boys often bemoan that it isn't the mob.

1560
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:32,060
They're on record many times saying,

1561
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:33,220
really wish that.

1562
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:34,060
Yeah.

1563
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:39,060
I mean, that would be very interesting if that happened.

1564
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:44,660
I have an answer about the Steve Wynn thing.

1565
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:46,420
Oh, please. Oh, sure.

1566
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:49,260
So there was a lawsuit, Casino Mogul Steve Wynn

1567
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:52,540
is accusing Girls Gone Wild soft core porn impresario,

1568
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:55,540
Joe Francis of slander for saying that Wynn wanted

1569
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:57,500
to kill him and bury him in the desert.

1570
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:02,980
Oh, it's the other side.

1571
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:04,260
It's a slander suit.

1572
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:07,060
Yeah. And Steve Wynn won the case.

1573
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:08,140
Wow. Wow.

1574
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:10,500
So I don't know that.

1575
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:14,300
Pretty good at losing lawsuits, I believe, Joe Francis.

1576
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:15,420
Now that doesn't necessarily mean

1577
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:17,020
that Steve Wynn didn't say that.

1578
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:19,460
Oh no.

1579
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:20,420
Probably.

1580
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:21,940
And we'll do.

1581
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:24,820
We've been promising more Steve Wynn content, I think,

1582
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:26,180
on the Patreon.

1583
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,100
Oh, yeah. Big time.

1584
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:31,060
Well, there's so much Vegas, certainly, to get to.

1585
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:34,980
And yeah, more horrible Vegas men to talk about.

1586
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:35,860
Yeah.

1587
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:37,020
Steve, I like Lance.

1588
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:39,020
So he seems like a good one.

1589
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:40,500
Well, Lance seems nice.

1590
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:41,780
Yeah, Lance seems nice.

1591
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:44,740
Steve Wynn run out of the Atlantic City casino business

1592
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:48,100
by the outgoing president, Donald Trump.

1593
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:48,860
Oh, man.

1594
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:51,380
How nice to say it when we refer to him.

1595
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,060
It's that he's...

1596
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:56,660
They're blowing up his casino, right?

1597
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:57,500
The Atlantic City?

1598
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,340
In Atlantic City?

1599
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:01,860
Well, the Taj Mahal is the brand new Hard Rock casino,

1600
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:03,260
like new a year ago.

1601
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:07,220
Trump Marina is a golden nugget now,

1602
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:12,220
which would be part of the Tillman Fertitta empire.

1603
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:13,940
Oh, yeah.

1604
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:17,300
And then Trump Plaza, last I heard, was still empty,

1605
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:22,140
but the Rainforest Cafe had gotten clearance from a judge

1606
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:24,180
to get their own utility bills

1607
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:26,740
so they could still keep operating on the boardwalk

1608
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:30,340
separately from the empty, vacant Trump Plaza.

1609
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:34,860
This is from a recent news story.

1610
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:38,060
Trump Plaza, the main building is being demolished

1611
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:38,900
Oh, my God.

1612
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:43,420
on January 29th, right after he is out of office,

1613
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:45,100
potentially dragged, kicking and screaming.

1614
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,060
That's gonna be a mess.

1615
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:48,260
That's like the dead center of town.

1616
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:52,620
That is next to the massive Caesar outlet balls

1617
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:55,620
that are around there.

1618
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:56,460
That's wild.

1619
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:59,620
Can we do our implosions episode?

1620
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:00,460
Oh, yeah.

1621
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:03,220
It's not a Vegas implosion, but yeah, yeah, yeah.

1622
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:08,220
Good way to celebrate the implosion of his presidency as well.

1623
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:11,540
Man.

1624
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:14,900
So, all right, Billy Toppett, master magician.

1625
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:18,980
Yeah, he runs a foul of Rocco Chicarico.

1626
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:23,980
Rocco Rich Boy, that translates to Rocco Rich Boy.

1627
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:28,180
Perfect.

1628
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:29,380
Right?

1629
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:30,420
Subtle name.

1630
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:35,460
Yeah, so there's a lot of, oh, you know,

1631
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:37,420
on that casino point, something that's different

1632
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,540
about Scorsese's casino in this film,

1633
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:43,580
in Scorsese's casino, the suits were fitted

1634
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:45,660
to the mobsters to be to their proportions

1635
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:48,980
because mobsters look nice and they were not loose

1636
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:51,540
and like Halloween costumes where the sleeves

1637
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:53,620
are rolled up multiple times,

1638
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:57,540
like they're like custodial uniforms.

1639
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,740
That's just one slight difference.

1640
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:02,940
One of them is wearing the shiniest suit I've ever seen.

1641
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:07,100
Like, it's shocking when the lights come up in the room.

1642
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:09,220
It's like, oh my God, look at that suit.

1643
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,580
And then one of them's later is in the,

1644
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:17,380
before he gets conked on the noggin,

1645
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:20,540
felling him, he's wearing a sleeveless,

1646
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:22,700
he looks like Robin Hood or something.

1647
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:24,420
I don't know what's going on there.

1648
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:27,420
The wardrobe in general.

1649
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:31,860
There's a scene, I don't wanna get ahead of myself,

1650
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:34,260
there's a scene where they're being cool guys

1651
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:37,260
about to take everything, the team is assembled

1652
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:40,620
and the outfits everyone's wearing.

1653
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:42,220
I'm just- Oh, that's right.

1654
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:44,580
It's like an Avengers shot.

1655
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:48,260
Oh, that cool guy, yeah, them suiting up,

1656
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:52,300
and that's one of the longest shots in movie history.

1657
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:54,020
Yeah. In slow motion.

1658
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:57,220
But it's another thing where you take that for granted

1659
01:13:57,220 --> 01:14:00,820
in movies and TV, you take that stuff for granted.

1660
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:02,900
That like they put, people put their time

1661
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:06,340
into picking things out and making sure

1662
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:08,500
things are not insanely wrinkled.

1663
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:11,940
That was one of the getting ready for the day

1664
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,900
sequences, but that one involved so,

1665
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:17,700
there were so many shots of people plugging in phones

1666
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:19,940
to charge, like every one of them had to make sure

1667
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:22,020
they're fully charged.

1668
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:24,100
And I was like, wait a minute, did they just unplug

1669
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:26,100
the previous mode and plug a new one?

1670
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:30,820
It's a messy pile of like 11 cords.

1671
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:32,260
I forgot about that.

1672
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:33,860
It looks like a death trap.

1673
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:39,020
Oh yeah, that's the other key, you can't plug all that

1674
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:41,620
into an outlet at the same time.

1675
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:44,900
Your apartment's gonna catch on fire, Billy Toppett.

1676
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:46,180
Yeah, it's,

1677
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:51,740
I, it's, yeah, this is, what a film.

1678
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:56,260
I, yeah, Louis Anderson definitely brightens it up.

1679
01:14:56,260 --> 01:15:01,260
The, then, but then they have you with Louis Anderson,

1680
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:04,340
who's the security guard at this like fancy building

1681
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:08,380
up on a hill where Billy gets a big gig,

1682
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:10,700
and he checks in with Louis at the security station,

1683
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:12,460
and you're like, oh, you're happy to see him, that's fun.

1684
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:13,940
But then it zooms up from that,

1685
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:18,540
from the most poorly operated drone you've ever seen.

1686
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:22,100
Like bugs out, there's the fisheye, it's really weird,

1687
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:26,220
and it, like, I can't emphasize enough how much camera

1688
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:31,060
shaking is in this movie, how many unsteady zooms there are.

1689
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:35,500
There's a lot of like kind of wide angle or fisheye lens,

1690
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:38,700
like especially shots of Lance Burton's head,

1691
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,780
where you go, why was that the choice?

1692
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:44,820
You're not trying to make him seem like unnerving.

1693
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:47,460
It's like, it's not natural born killers or something,

1694
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,660
where it's like, you're trying to make it

1695
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:50,620
like this twisted reality.

1696
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:55,660
There's a great part in the depressing diner,

1697
01:15:55,660 --> 01:16:00,660
where the sleight of hand security man comes up and says,

1698
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:02,940
hey, all right, everybody enjoying their lunch.

1699
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:04,180
Okay, hey, Billy, come with me.

1700
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:05,340
Can I talk to you for a second?

1701
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:09,140
And then they walk, you know, a total of nine feet away,

1702
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:12,580
and then it cuts to the closest closeups you've ever seen,

1703
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:15,260
which have a ton of soft focus filter,

1704
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:17,820
which the movie has not had up until that point.

1705
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,540
Suddenly the audio is blown out,

1706
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:22,260
suddenly Billy is talking into like a back sit,

1707
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:24,940
he has not used for the rest of the film.

1708
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:27,020
Well, I guess that's what I say, Southern accent.

1709
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:29,300
It's like, sometimes the accent's gone.

1710
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:31,340
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1711
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:32,760
And it comes and goes.

1712
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:36,000
There's something else about him I was gonna say.

1713
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,160
Oh, not about him, but the,

1714
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,040
so another thing that comes and goes,

1715
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,880
it's like the first 15 minutes of movie they use it,

1716
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,520
and then not till the very, very end.

1717
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:47,000
There's a bunch of like page peel transitions.

1718
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,640
Yeah, they use like iMovie type,

1719
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:55,200
or like a weird like, you know, little scatter dissolve,

1720
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:58,660
or the whole image flips around completely.

1721
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,760
Yeah, they get creative with those transitions,

1722
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,800
rarely used in film.

1723
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:07,560
I wonder if, I don't know, I gotta look at the credits.

1724
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:11,920
Is it like, did multiple people end up editing it,

1725
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,800
so like for a couple scenes,

1726
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:17,120
someone is like, I'm gonna throw a lot of page wipes in.

1727
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:17,960
Cause it feels like something-

1728
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,920
Oh, it's like the remnant of another editor, yeah, yeah.

1729
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:23,120
Yeah, I feel like, I mean, I've been involved,

1730
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:26,840
early on in my career, I was editing a lot of things,

1731
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:29,400
and there would be so many like,

1732
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:34,400
somebody needs an editor, they're gonna pay $200,

1733
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:36,520
it's a 25 minute short film,

1734
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:39,020
somebody else has already edited it,

1735
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:42,240
and now you have to come in and re-edit it.

1736
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,440
And this would have, like, I would hear of this a lot,

1737
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,880
and I've known people who had gone through a similar thing,

1738
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:50,560
that there's these films, probably self-financed,

1739
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:53,320
that just end up going through like 10 editors,

1740
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:54,980
and maybe then still never coming out,

1741
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:59,120
because whoever has made them is a crazy person.

1742
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:00,680
Not Lance, of course.

1743
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:01,560
You end up probably with weird,

1744
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:03,600
like this might be the kind of movie where like,

1745
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,680
the editor has the files, and he left town,

1746
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,680
and he went back to live with his mom,

1747
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:12,040
and we had nobody's talk to him,

1748
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,640
like we weren't really like friends with him,

1749
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,360
we were just using him for his setup,

1750
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:17,900
so I don't know how to get the footage again.

1751
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:21,300
Yes, I will say now here that,

1752
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:24,320
I did do this when the first six months of living,

1753
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:25,780
I was editing something,

1754
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:27,800
that had obviously been edited 10 times,

1755
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,000
and then I really wasn't getting like paid.

1756
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,880
This was hooked up, by the way, through Pauly Shore.

1757
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:38,540
I remembered vaguely that your early days in LA

1758
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:39,840
involved Pauly Shore.

1759
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:40,680
I met Pauly Shore.

1760
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,560
One of the traps you can, anyone listening,

1761
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,520
if you're trying to make it in LA,

1762
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,980
you will in your first year have to avoid Pauly Shore,

1763
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:50,240
and more dangerously, Andy Dick.

1764
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:51,080
Yes.

1765
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:52,720
So just, if you're thinking about coming,

1766
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:55,180
I mean, coronavirus is now the bigger danger,

1767
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:57,380
but second and third to that,

1768
01:18:57,940 --> 01:18:58,780
is running into these people.

1769
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:01,900
I met Pauly Shore three days into being in LA.

1770
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:04,300
Wow, that was fast.

1771
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:07,420
This is a luck, three person, and luck,

1772
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:10,420
I use luck in quotes, a three person,

1773
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:13,200
like we weren't family friends with anyone in Hollywood.

1774
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,240
It was like my friend who lived out here,

1775
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:18,420
knew three people who had all gone through the ringer

1776
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,980
of being Pauly Shore editing guy.

1777
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:26,120
I have seen that job listing multiple times over the years.

1778
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:29,960
Oh yeah, and now Pauly paid me money.

1779
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:30,800
Okay, good.

1780
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:34,060
But he was like, I got a guy who wants to movie edit it.

1781
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,000
And then I like met this guy, and that's a whole story,

1782
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:38,840
but yes, I-

1783
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:42,880
Is he just kind of sleepy that Pauly's like, ah, yeah.

1784
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:46,680
Yeah, no, that's exactly, there's literally no difference

1785
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:50,240
in real life versus what you imagine.

1786
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:52,000
It's kind of slow moving.

1787
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,200
Yeah, hey, hey there.

1788
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,420
Hey man.

1789
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:57,900
It's just the stats, and he's just like, yeah,

1790
01:19:57,900 --> 01:19:59,460
he's been in the sun too long.

1791
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:03,500
It's just like burned out, I would say.

1792
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:05,820
I got more stories, maybe that's a different Patreon.

1793
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:07,340
Yeah, that's a different Patreon.

1794
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:10,340
That's the third Gate episode.

1795
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:12,180
Where you get more gossip.

1796
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:14,740
Yeah, gossipy and nasty on the third Gate.

1797
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:15,580
I-

1798
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:17,060
It's 50 dollars.

1799
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:19,840
That just reminds me of a big turning point experience

1800
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:24,580
for me in LA, was a producer, I was on set for something,

1801
01:20:24,580 --> 01:20:28,580
and the producer was very seriously dropping some knowledge

1802
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:30,100
on these young actors, and he was like,

1803
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:32,940
and guys, make sure, the number one rule,

1804
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:34,780
always make sure you get paid.

1805
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:36,140
Always make sure you get paid.

1806
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:37,980
And then he walked away, and I'm like,

1807
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:40,660
we're doing this for free, he's not paying us,

1808
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:41,820
what the fuck was that?

1809
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:44,900
He himself was not?

1810
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:45,740
Yeah.

1811
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:47,560
Yeah.

1812
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,580
There is a whole cottage industry

1813
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:53,160
of making money off of people,

1814
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,960
and the people that are making money on that industry

1815
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:58,480
are people that have never worked in entertainment

1816
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:01,280
in their lives, or have worked so little,

1817
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:04,520
or gotten anywhere close to anything legitimate.

1818
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:08,640
And it's an entire, it's a multi-million dollar industry,

1819
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:12,520
and I am fascinated with it, but it also bums me out.

1820
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:14,080
Well, this is probably the world

1821
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:17,240
that Billy Toppett, Master Magician, found himself in.

1822
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:20,700
He's dreaming of being a well-paid performer at a theater,

1823
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:23,080
but he's doing all these fly-by-night gigs,

1824
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:26,320
and that's true of his friends, of the jugglers,

1825
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:29,840
and of the ventriloquists.

1826
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:33,780
That's why I think this movie rings so true.

1827
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:39,160
And it rings true also, how when you move to LA

1828
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:39,980
and you're trying to make it,

1829
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:44,120
you're around a lot of dyed-haired 60-year-olds

1830
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:46,160
who never mention their age.

1831
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:51,720
Like, yeah, dude, wanna come over to my pad, man?

1832
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:55,960
It is Mr. Burns pretending he's a teenager.

1833
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:58,580
It's just the same exact thing.

1834
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,120
Or the Buscemi on 30 Rock.

1835
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:09,320
Well, actually, I was thinking, with Lance Burton

1836
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:12,240
portraying himself, pretending that he's in his 20s

1837
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:14,560
and just starting out in his career,

1838
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:19,480
Billy Toppett is really the crashing of magic movies.

1839
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,920
I think that's right.

1840
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:26,960
Why wouldn't Judd work with Lance?

1841
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:29,720
Give Judd.

1842
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:32,000
Judd could've brought the magic to it, absolutely.

1843
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,840
Yes, he could've fixed some of these shots,

1844
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,160
given some of the parking lot shots,

1845
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:39,480
some better lit composition, come on.

1846
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:41,480
Yeah, would've been shot on film with Judd.

1847
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:42,320
Would've been shot on film.

1848
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,920
On like four film cameras,

1849
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:48,560
expensive music to clear in every scene.

1850
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:53,000
All right, anyway, we end up in this house with,

1851
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:57,160
again, this is nice, I guess,

1852
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:59,880
but it's also some of the strangest architecture

1853
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,240
I've ever seen.

1854
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:05,440
This is another thing with rudimentary movie-making stuff.

1855
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,520
If the audience doesn't comprehend

1856
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,600
what kind of room we're in,

1857
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,160
the scene where he ends up doing a magic show

1858
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:16,640
where here's a big maroon wall

1859
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:20,640
and then a purple, like a neon purple wall

1860
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:23,440
that's only three feet wide.

1861
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,680
And I can't draw the shape.

1862
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:30,240
This is like a weird dodecahedron room.

1863
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:33,600
I don't understand the layout of where I am ever in this,

1864
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,640
especially this house, but a lot of places in the movie.

1865
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:37,480
Yeah.

1866
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:40,120
I think this house was a fancy development

1867
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:43,880
that was started before the 2008, 2009 recession

1868
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,320
and then frozen in time

1869
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:47,320
because Vegas was hit hard by that.

1870
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:50,720
There were so many projects shelved or rejiggered

1871
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:55,120
after the recession cleared up.

1872
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,600
And that's what this seems like.

1873
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:59,400
Because it's just on a hill, there's nothing around it.

1874
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,200
Yeah, that's so odd.

1875
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,800
It's not part of a development.

1876
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:06,840
It's like there's a big fence and then a hill

1877
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:08,880
and then a weird house.

1878
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:12,800
And it turns out that this big show

1879
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:17,640
that Billy thinks is maybe a big break, this is a trap.

1880
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:19,960
He's being trapped by the mob.

1881
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:23,000
And then there's a big chase through the mansion.

1882
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,960
But then he ends up with the mayor and the sheriff.

1883
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:27,680
I still don't understand what's going on.

1884
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:31,000
Do they not know that the mob was there?

1885
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,200
Okay, I think I can answer this.

1886
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:39,080
What I discerned was that the trap

1887
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:41,720
was from the fail son, Bobster.

1888
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:45,960
The fail son's father, who is now out of prison

1889
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:49,280
and building a new construction project,

1890
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:54,280
was having this fundraiser schmoozing for the project.

1891
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,960
Billy Toppett stumbled into it and like,

1892
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,920
oh good, the entertainment's here.

1893
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:03,200
And fell head over heels.

1894
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:08,200
Because the mobster, the father mobster eventually cuts off

1895
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:11,800
the idiot son gambler.

1896
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,720
You seem to have a much better, I'll be honest,

1897
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,920
I'm going on not so much sleep.

1898
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:21,000
And as far as the details of the plot,

1899
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,040
I'm impressed, Jason, that you've followed this so well.

1900
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,960
I think that's what it was.

1901
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:30,960
And it's solely because I looked up from maybe my phone,

1902
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:34,200
like when the fixer, there's a fixer character

1903
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:39,200
for the father and he kind of delivers some explanation.

1904
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:40,640
Right.

1905
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:42,120
A couple times.

1906
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:44,960
I was just staring at like bad curtains.

1907
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:46,280
I think that would distract me.

1908
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:49,000
I'm just like, why would you put this up?

1909
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,560
I know this is an expensive house,

1910
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,040
but you ruin it with that curtain.

1911
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,760
And then I just wouldn't hear the plot.

1912
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,920
I can't take my eyes off of Lance's hair.

1913
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,720
Just, yeah, like maybe we haven't conveyed also,

1914
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:06,560
the jettest black on a 60 year old man,

1915
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,880
but then spiked as well.

1916
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:11,520
It is so interesting.

1917
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,640
That's when you, Michael, you said earlier about

1918
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:16,200
how they've just been in a cave until 2015.

1919
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,440
I think that's right because like they don't know

1920
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:21,920
that even young people don't spike their hair anymore.

1921
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,920
Like this guy, like he like left the planet

1922
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:29,320
during the boy band era and didn't know that things changed.

1923
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:30,160
Yeah, I'm not sure.

1924
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:34,080
In the Zoom reunion, Lance honestly looks a little hipper

1925
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,920
with some of his choices.

1926
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,600
He does, yeah, I would agree with that.

1927
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:42,120
Is part of it also like things move slower in the desert?

1928
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:45,520
Like Vegas, like all the magicians are still dressing

1929
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:47,800
like it's 2005, like anyway.

1930
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:48,720
They didn't get the, yeah,

1931
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:51,520
they didn't hear about the new fashion.

1932
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:52,360
Yeah.

1933
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:54,280
They didn't hear about fashion until like a year ago.

1934
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:55,100
Sure.

1935
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,120
I think there's something to that.

1936
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:02,560
What I like that we start getting into is like

1937
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:07,560
contrived ways that Billy's gang of idiots can help out

1938
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:12,080
and help like make escapes from the mob and save the girl,

1939
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:16,920
which is like the bad guy's gonna like run after

1940
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:18,560
the assistant.

1941
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:22,720
What if we juggle knives around him?

1942
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:26,580
Like create a wall of slowly juggled knives

1943
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:29,980
that he wouldn't dare step out of.

1944
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:34,980
And then later he's like, they have to stop somebody else.

1945
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:39,020
Some guys run out the door and then right in their face

1946
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:43,380
is the ventriloquist and his dummy who has a flower

1947
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:46,580
that squirts water and they shoot it right in the mobster's

1948
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:50,020
face and he falls over, ah, ah,

1949
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:52,380
as if it was full of sulfuric acid.

1950
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:55,580
Like the joker's, yes, poison flower.

1951
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:57,180
Yes, as far as I can tell in the next scene,

1952
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:59,300
he's not permanently disfigured.

1953
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:00,420
Right.

1954
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:01,940
But he acts as if he was.

1955
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:07,980
I don't really ever want to see more Billy Toppett,

1956
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:10,700
but I also, the idea that these guys would all just go

1957
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:14,940
around having to solve problems with magic.

1958
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:16,420
I would like to see it. Absolutely.

1959
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:19,940
This here is the movie that I want it to be the whole time.

1960
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:20,940
Not just for one scene.

1961
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:25,940
I want like scenes oddly, contrivately solved with magic.

1962
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:28,340
That's like kind of the fun of it.

1963
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:30,500
I think if you're looking for the fun,

1964
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:33,020
I think that's what I like.

1965
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:37,300
You know, like we're somewhere where the keys are over there

1966
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:40,820
but we can't get to the keys because the only way to get

1967
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:42,820
to them is this like little gap in the wall.

1968
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:43,900
It's only a foot tall.

1969
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,540
Well, a person can't fit through that.

1970
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:48,180
Yeah, but maybe a rabbit can.

1971
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:51,220
And then you send a rabbit in to steal the keys.

1972
01:28:51,220 --> 01:28:53,980
And then it comes back and, but whoa, quick

1973
01:28:53,980 --> 01:28:55,260
make the rabbit disappear.

1974
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:56,540
And then they throw it into the hat.

1975
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:59,420
And then it, you know, the coast is clear.

1976
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:01,340
The mobsters are none the wiser.

1977
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:02,260
Yeah. That's what I want.

1978
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:03,860
Like constantly wall to wall.

1979
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:04,700
I want it. Yeah.

1980
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:05,520
I want it.

1981
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:08,700
Yes. I want even like, if it's a more mundane thing,

1982
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:11,620
you know, if somebody drops their keys down

1983
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:15,620
like a sewer or something, like, I guess you could, hmm.

1984
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:18,340
Hmm. I guess you could tell, you could transfer

1985
01:29:18,340 --> 01:29:19,460
like I said, the can't transport.

1986
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:21,540
I guess you have to use an illusion to do it

1987
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:23,380
but it would worst off to work.

1988
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:24,940
Like they always have their keys connected

1989
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:26,180
to that invisible wire.

1990
01:29:26,180 --> 01:29:29,300
So then like they rise the keys up from the sewer.

1991
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:32,380
Like these guys are just magic machines nonstop.

1992
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:33,500
Yeah. Yeah.

1993
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:37,940
What if like, you know, like the mobsters, like, you know

1994
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:40,700
we ended up in this like weird suburban Las Vegas

1995
01:29:40,700 --> 01:29:43,180
industrial area and where characters are trapped

1996
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:44,740
in like an auto shop.

1997
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:47,660
But if it's, if you ended up like bursting through a wall

1998
01:29:47,660 --> 01:29:49,420
like what's on the other side of the auto shop.

1999
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:52,180
Oh my God. It's a handkerchief factory.

2000
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:54,500
And it's like 400 handkerchiefs.

2001
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:57,780
So now they have like all the ammo they need

2002
01:29:57,780 --> 01:30:00,340
to defeat as many mobsters as they can make

2003
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:01,580
so many things disappear.

2004
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:03,820
They can make entire cars disappear.

2005
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:06,140
Yeah. That's yes. That's very good.

2006
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:09,700
Yeah. Skip through the handkerchief factory.

2007
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:10,540
They were overthinking.

2008
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:12,220
They were trying to do it all or get, they needed

2009
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:13,940
to lean into the magic.

2010
01:30:13,940 --> 01:30:14,780
Obviously.

2011
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:15,620
Yeah. Like a, yeah.

2012
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:19,140
Like a Decker style show with just these same actors

2013
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:21,580
but solving everything with magic.

2014
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:23,860
I mean, if they, they should become a, like

2015
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:27,500
I think maybe the Decker team should team up

2016
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:30,020
with Toppett entertainment and just finance it.

2017
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:32,780
They would just read as a found object show.

2018
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:35,580
You just made, if you greenlit six episodes

2019
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:37,620
of Billy Toppett master magician.

2020
01:30:39,820 --> 01:30:42,580
But just try to influence the writing a little bit.

2021
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:43,700
A little, yeah.

2022
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:45,380
Just to, yes.

2023
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:46,500
They would, they would, they should definitely be

2024
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:48,900
like traveling the globe too and doing it.

2025
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:52,940
Like all the UN ambassadors are kidnapped

2026
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:56,260
by generic terrorists.

2027
01:30:56,260 --> 01:31:00,780
Billy Toppett international master magician.

2028
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:04,780
What else?

2029
01:31:04,780 --> 01:31:07,980
I just wrote down some lines when the, after the,

2030
01:31:08,780 --> 01:31:12,300
there's a gross mobster, you know,

2031
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,980
who's trapped the waitress and eventually

2032
01:31:14,980 --> 01:31:16,580
Billy Toppett's assistant.

2033
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:22,500
And she like lures him in with the possibility of a smooch.

2034
01:31:23,660 --> 01:31:25,820
And then, and when that doesn't work out

2035
01:31:25,820 --> 01:31:30,460
and Billy very tepidly smashes a breakaway bottle

2036
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:35,380
over his head, then you get lines like, like, are you okay?

2037
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:36,420
I'm fine.

2038
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:39,380
Other than almost having to kiss that jerk.

2039
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:41,860
And then another, I don't know when this happens

2040
01:31:41,860 --> 01:31:44,100
but this might be the line of the movie for me.

2041
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:47,580
You're the loser who's going to jail, you butt face.

2042
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:52,460
It's hard to top that.

2043
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:55,180
To top it.

2044
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:56,020
To top it.

2045
01:31:56,020 --> 01:31:56,860
To top it.

2046
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:02,100
Anything else anybody enjoyed?

2047
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:02,940
You know what?

2048
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:03,780
I really should have written it down.

2049
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:05,140
There's, he's on the phone with,

2050
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:07,860
I'm scrolling through here.

2051
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:09,220
Is there, hold on.

2052
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:10,940
Let me, somebody Jason, you talk real quick.

2053
01:32:10,940 --> 01:32:11,780
I'm trying to find it.

2054
01:32:11,780 --> 01:32:14,260
Well, I, you know, when it all gets wrapped up

2055
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:16,860
and the sheriff and the mob team up

2056
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:19,420
to take the goofy son away,

2057
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:21,860
Billy Toppett is given a large check.

2058
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:26,700
The mayor of Las Vegas declares it Billy Toppett Day

2059
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:28,580
and gives him the key to the city.

2060
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:32,900
And then he gets a contract for a big show,

2061
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:37,420
which you see, you see him and his buddies

2062
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:39,700
all looking up at the sign at the very end

2063
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:40,780
when it all works out.

2064
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:44,500
And it's the beautiful West Gate Resort sign.

2065
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:45,340
Uh huh.

2066
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:49,260
Yes, where the Star Trek experience was

2067
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:53,220
in West Gate from, what's that movie called?

2068
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:54,060
Queen of Versailles.

2069
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:56,380
Queen of Versailles, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2070
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:58,700
That guy's probably doing great right now

2071
01:32:58,700 --> 01:33:00,740
after a Trump loss.

2072
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:04,420
The man who seemed very miserable the entire movie,

2073
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:07,180
the scumbag who owns that timeshare company.

2074
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:08,140
Oh yeah, right.

2075
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:11,700
Yeah, has he used it as an excuse to fire people

2076
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:13,180
like he did with Bush?

2077
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:14,780
Oh God, I can only imagine.

2078
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:19,700
You better vote for him or you won't have a job.

2079
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:23,060
I can't name all of my children, not even by a long shot.

2080
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:26,940
That's such a good movie.

2081
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:33,980
Yeah, you end up basically, long story short,

2082
01:33:33,980 --> 01:33:37,660
Billy gains confidence through all of his adventures

2083
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:40,420
and through defeating the mob and getting the girl.

2084
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:43,940
And it gives, and he becomes this notorious figure

2085
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:47,580
because he helped defeat Carmine DeLeo

2086
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:50,060
or something I think is one of the people.

2087
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:53,100
And he's such a figure in the press

2088
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:55,060
because he gets the key to the city and all this stuff.

2089
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:57,420
And so of course he ends up with his own show.

2090
01:33:57,420 --> 01:33:59,140
And then you just watch kind of like a bunch

2091
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:02,340
of a real Lance Burton show, presumably,

2092
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:07,340
in a theater with the most taped up floor ever.

2093
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:11,500
There's so many colors of tape everywhere,

2094
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:14,900
which I know would have, that's okay for a show

2095
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:15,820
to look like that.

2096
01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:18,460
That's like all of the marks and the places

2097
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:20,940
where pieces of scenery and props roll up.

2098
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:24,780
But to film it in a movie, maybe you don't want

2099
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:29,780
like 150 pieces of different colored duct tape

2100
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:31,420
marring the stage.

2101
01:34:31,420 --> 01:34:33,660
Maybe like wet it down, maybe shine it up,

2102
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:35,260
make it look good on camera.

2103
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:42,500
It's, I would like, do we look up,

2104
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:44,020
are there Lance Burton, there has to be

2105
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:46,100
like specials of his online.

2106
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:47,340
Oh, there are, yeah.

2107
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:48,180
There are.

2108
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:49,580
Well, there's the roller coaster one, yeah.

2109
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:50,460
Right.

2110
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:52,700
But I watched him make some elephants disappear

2111
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:53,620
in the desert.

2112
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:56,620
It just feels like, I mean, those are shot by,

2113
01:34:56,620 --> 01:34:58,060
he's seen those.

2114
01:34:59,100 --> 01:34:59,940
Yes. Right?

2115
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:01,820
He was part of them, yeah.

2116
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:02,900
He's watched them.

2117
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:06,420
Oh, the roller coaster one I know aired on NBC

2118
01:35:06,420 --> 01:35:09,780
because it had the NBC like coming up next tag.

2119
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:11,420
And I think what was either coming up next

2120
01:35:11,420 --> 01:35:14,300
or coming up the next day was that horrifying

2121
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:16,900
Alice in Wonderland live action,

2122
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:18,620
Alice in Wonderland made for TV.

2123
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:22,420
I think where Martin Short is the mad hatter.

2124
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:24,140
Is this where you get the else?

2125
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:29,780
Oh, that era, oh my God.

2126
01:35:29,780 --> 01:35:32,260
Wow, so he made, yeah, he made good looking

2127
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:33,740
primetime NBC special.

2128
01:35:33,740 --> 01:35:36,580
Yeah, why would he just like let somebody's kid

2129
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:38,820
shoot his movie, especially after working on it

2130
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:40,700
for 20 years.

2131
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:42,580
Yeah. Yeah.

2132
01:35:42,580 --> 01:35:46,300
It also seems like, by the way, he lost his residency

2133
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:49,220
at the Monte Carlo or it ended, I don't know

2134
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:51,540
if it was his choice or it just came to a natural end,

2135
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:54,220
but he was done with that in 2010 and then it was like,

2136
01:35:54,220 --> 01:35:58,580
great, now I have the time to make my film.

2137
01:35:58,580 --> 01:35:59,420
Yeah.

2138
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:02,980
So instead of doing nightly shows in Vegas, he did this.

2139
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:03,820
Why?

2140
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:07,540
I mean, look, any artist that wants to branch out,

2141
01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:10,540
you gotta give them some credit for trying something new,

2142
01:36:11,580 --> 01:36:13,940
but why?

2143
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:16,580
You might think it was crazy that Jordan Peele

2144
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:19,500
was leaving behind his comedy acting career.

2145
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:21,140
To make a horror film.

2146
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:21,980
Seems crazy.

2147
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:22,820
That worked out.

2148
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:23,660
Mm-hmm.

2149
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:27,820
And so you might on paper say Lance Burton is leaving magic

2150
01:36:27,820 --> 01:36:31,100
to make a film about a magician.

2151
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:36,020
Sounds like it was, that seems like it'll never work.

2152
01:36:36,020 --> 01:36:36,860
And maybe.

2153
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:43,140
And he's still retired, yes?

2154
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:43,980
Yeah. Yeah.

2155
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:45,780
From what I can tell.

2156
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:47,940
Maybe comes out of retirement for charity

2157
01:36:47,940 --> 01:36:49,380
every now and then maybe.

2158
01:36:50,140 --> 01:36:51,220
I think. Yeah.

2159
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:56,220
He of course made a big splash when the movie premiered

2160
01:36:56,220 --> 01:37:00,580
because there was a big red carpet premiere of the movie,

2161
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:02,740
why Rich Little was there,

2162
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:06,180
several hunks from Thunder Down Under,

2163
01:37:07,060 --> 01:37:10,740
Robin Leitch, who was briefly in this film,

2164
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:15,260
wishing Billy Toppett good luck and champagne wishes.

2165
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:16,540
Yes.

2166
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:19,020
Do you have the list of who thanks him?

2167
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:21,820
Or says good luck Billy Toppett,

2168
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:24,060
a bunch of Vegas all-stars thank him.

2169
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:26,100
Well, Louis Anderson does again,

2170
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:29,140
despite having been a different character already

2171
01:37:29,140 --> 01:37:30,180
in the movie.

2172
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:34,700
And oh my God, we haven't even talked about Chris Angel.

2173
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:36,340
Chris Angel, yeah.

2174
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:38,420
He congratulates Billy Toppett.

2175
01:37:39,780 --> 01:37:42,660
And then someone named like Puff the Magic Drag,

2176
01:37:42,660 --> 01:37:45,220
it was unclear what that was.

2177
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:46,580
I did not know what I was looking at,

2178
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:48,820
that last person thanking Billy Toppett.

2179
01:37:51,180 --> 01:37:52,180
Don't know.

2180
01:37:53,380 --> 01:37:55,740
Yeah, there was this premiere

2181
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:59,180
and everybody seemed in good spirits at that.

2182
01:37:59,180 --> 01:38:04,180
And then this movie did make some appearances at festivals.

2183
01:38:05,140 --> 01:38:10,020
I found an article about this film winning six awards

2184
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:13,740
at the Wild Rose Independent Film Festival,

2185
01:38:13,740 --> 01:38:15,860
where we've all been mocking it,

2186
01:38:15,860 --> 01:38:20,100
but prepare to eat crow because Billy Toppett,

2187
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:22,660
Master Magician won six awards,

2188
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:25,500
including a coveted best award.

2189
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:30,500
Oh, with the awardees.

2190
01:38:33,980 --> 01:38:36,580
And won an awardee for best award.

2191
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:37,420
Best award.

2192
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:45,780
Was this film festival programmed by bots?

2193
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:53,180
These are Russian bots trying to learn English

2194
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:56,820
by putting together a film festival.

2195
01:38:58,260 --> 01:39:01,220
Congratulations, you won outstanding best.

2196
01:39:01,220 --> 01:39:03,100
Best award.

2197
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:06,860
You are simply the best at being the best.

2198
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:09,260
What else was it?

2199
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:10,780
Do we know what else was nominated?

2200
01:39:11,900 --> 01:39:13,900
I have no further info about the Wild...

2201
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:16,140
It's also possible that the Wild Rose Film Festival

2202
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:18,820
was a production of Toppett Industries.

2203
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:22,660
Toppett Awards, Toppett Award Productions.

2204
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:25,180
Is the Wild Rose just the name of that illusion

2205
01:39:25,180 --> 01:39:27,540
where you make a paper flower lighted on fire

2206
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:32,540
and it's a real rose, which I've now seen both Lance

2207
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:36,140
as Billy Toppett and Copperfield do that illusion.

2208
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:39,580
Oh yeah, he does that in the movie,

2209
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:42,300
but like right next to the woman's car.

2210
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:43,140
Yes.

2211
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:44,100
Just very alarming.

2212
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:48,460
Let me light a fire right next to your on car.

2213
01:39:48,460 --> 01:39:49,300
Yeah.

2214
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:53,100
After we just had an awkward exchange

2215
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:56,100
about me looking at your butt.

2216
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:59,180
It's boy, we at least go,

2217
01:39:59,180 --> 01:40:00,900
we'll try to do a couple of clips.

2218
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:03,660
I mean, he put it up for the world to see on his YouTube

2219
01:40:03,660 --> 01:40:06,340
and 1400 people did.

2220
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:08,700
Mike, did you watch some of,

2221
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:12,180
you did watch some of the Zoom, some of the reunion content?

2222
01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:14,940
Some of it, but look, again, I'm very tired.

2223
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:18,460
I didn't have a big stomach for it right now,

2224
01:40:18,460 --> 01:40:21,220
but Louie was on it, Louie Anderson was on it

2225
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:24,740
and he got some people talking.

2226
01:40:25,900 --> 01:40:26,740
All right.

2227
01:40:26,740 --> 01:40:30,300
I thought I would, and then I saw that the runtime

2228
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:33,260
for Billy Toppett was an hour and 50 minutes

2229
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:36,580
and the total runtime of the Zoom video

2230
01:40:36,580 --> 01:40:39,300
was three hours and 22 minutes.

2231
01:40:40,180 --> 01:40:42,140
It was very, very long.

2232
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:42,980
Very long.

2233
01:40:42,980 --> 01:40:45,460
Lord, which is where this episode is ending

2234
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:48,700
if we aren't careful.

2235
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:49,980
I think we've talked about this,

2236
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:52,540
about Billy Toppett, master magician Pliny.

2237
01:40:52,540 --> 01:40:54,060
I think so.

2238
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:57,540
It's another one of those weird curse episodes.

2239
01:40:57,540 --> 01:40:59,940
One of these, the things we sentence ourselves to,

2240
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:04,220
we sentence ourselves to be trapped in a box,

2241
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:08,380
in one of Lance Burton's proportional boxes.

2242
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:12,980
But I hope that you were entertained as you would be

2243
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:16,180
if Lance Burton put blades through the box.

2244
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:18,460
Just kind of what happened to us, I feel.

2245
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:21,260
But we put the blades ourselves.

2246
01:41:21,260 --> 01:41:24,140
We were inflicting the blades ourselves.

2247
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:25,260
Yeah, yeah.

2248
01:41:25,260 --> 01:41:28,500
Which we keep, so is there more, if this was a trilogy,

2249
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:32,460
is there one more bad Vegas entertainment?

2250
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:35,980
I willingly watched a weird Siegfried and Roy IMAX movie,

2251
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:37,740
but I don't think there was enough there

2252
01:41:37,740 --> 01:41:42,740
to necessarily to do an episode about.

2253
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:45,860
I don't know, we could throw this out to the audience

2254
01:41:45,860 --> 01:41:47,740
if you have suggestions for one more

2255
01:41:47,740 --> 01:41:50,900
in the Vegas punishment trilogy.

2256
01:41:50,900 --> 01:41:52,940
Vegas punishment trilogy.

2257
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:55,340
We're kind of talking of course about Father of the Pride,

2258
01:41:55,340 --> 01:41:58,420
if you weren't aware, which we did a, that was,

2259
01:41:58,420 --> 01:42:01,820
I mean, look, that was a truly hateful show

2260
01:42:01,820 --> 01:42:04,020
with some truly hateful language.

2261
01:42:04,980 --> 01:42:08,540
I got a fun time watching Billy Toppett.

2262
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:11,460
As I said, it ties, it's forever tied into,

2263
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:16,460
between the events of Saturday, November 7th,

2264
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:19,180
I think the things that happened on Saturday, November 7th

2265
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:21,100
have made the world a better place.

2266
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:22,740
It made me more optimistic.

2267
01:42:22,740 --> 01:42:27,740
And some of that must, they has to include

2268
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:29,540
Billy Toppett, Master Magician.

2269
01:42:29,540 --> 01:42:31,380
Billy Toppett, yeah.

2270
01:42:31,380 --> 01:42:34,580
I will look into, does Tapeface have

2271
01:42:34,580 --> 01:42:37,260
some sort of a self-made movie?

2272
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:38,620
Does.

2273
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:40,380
Puppetry of the Penis.

2274
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:42,260
Puppetry of the Penis.

2275
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:46,180
Does, can we find like a bootleg copy of Zumanity,

2276
01:42:46,180 --> 01:42:49,060
the Cirque du Soleil, Erotic Animals show.

2277
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:49,900
Yeah.

2278
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:51,620
Did Rich Little, Rich Little has to have

2279
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:53,300
some pilots floating around.

2280
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:54,140
Oh, for sure.

2281
01:42:54,140 --> 01:42:55,860
Oh man, oh there's gotta be some bad,

2282
01:42:55,860 --> 01:42:59,100
well Rich Little has, I've recently watched Rich Little

2283
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:02,420
as a sit-down guest on Huckabee, my favorite.

2284
01:43:02,420 --> 01:43:03,260
Oh yeah. Oh man.

2285
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:07,060
Talk show, which by the way, I think Mike Huckabee

2286
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:10,340
and Lance Burton have very similar voices.

2287
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:12,180
Oh yeah. I was trying to place,

2288
01:43:12,180 --> 01:43:13,020
like why does this voice sound familiar to me?

2289
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:15,380
And then suddenly I went, ah, Huckabee.

2290
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:17,540
It's like, yeah, so there's a pleasant,

2291
01:43:17,540 --> 01:43:19,180
there's kind of like a higher,

2292
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:21,500
a little higher pitched southern voice.

2293
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:24,300
Yeah, and sort of a, just a blandness

2294
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:26,420
and sort of a matter of fact.

2295
01:43:26,420 --> 01:43:30,300
It's like this note, er, er, er.

2296
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:31,620
Yes.

2297
01:43:31,620 --> 01:43:32,460
Yeah.

2298
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:34,260
But sharing that about like, you'll never win the day,

2299
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:35,620
Carmine DeLeo.

2300
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:40,100
My lovely new assistant and I will foil you

2301
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:41,180
at every turn.

2302
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:46,820
Yeah, Huckabee's similar, yeah.

2303
01:43:46,820 --> 01:43:47,660
Yeah, yeah.

2304
01:43:47,660 --> 01:43:49,700
Well, all right, so suggest, we need suggestions

2305
01:43:49,700 --> 01:43:52,820
for the Vegas, the Vegas torture trilogy.

2306
01:43:52,820 --> 01:43:56,580
Oh, I, did Terry Phaidor ever make a movie?

2307
01:43:56,580 --> 01:43:59,540
Oh yeah, we gotta look into that.

2308
01:43:59,540 --> 01:44:02,420
There's a really depressing documentary

2309
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:05,940
about multiple ventriloquists and he is one of them

2310
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:08,180
and he's presented as like the best end of it.

2311
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:09,860
On the other end, there's a lot of,

2312
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:11,500
the theme of the movie seems to be

2313
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:12,940
that if you get into ventriloquism,

2314
01:44:12,940 --> 01:44:17,020
it will distance you from anyone you love in your life.

2315
01:44:17,020 --> 01:44:17,860
Oh my God.

2316
01:44:19,780 --> 01:44:21,700
It's just really grim.

2317
01:44:21,700 --> 01:44:25,540
Besides Terry, if you, anyone who isn't Terry.

2318
01:44:25,540 --> 01:44:27,940
Interesting, well that sounds like too big

2319
01:44:27,940 --> 01:44:29,380
of a bummer to talk about.

2320
01:44:29,380 --> 01:44:31,820
I will say, I will say non Vegas,

2321
01:44:31,820 --> 01:44:33,260
I think we haven't talked about this in a while,

2322
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:34,980
but we did hype it for a little while.

2323
01:44:34,980 --> 01:44:37,500
I think we gotta come back to Bible Man.

2324
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:38,340
Oh yeah.

2325
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:39,180
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

2326
01:44:39,180 --> 01:44:40,020
Oh certainly.

2327
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:43,500
And apparently I was just made aware

2328
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:46,420
there is a newer Bible Man cartoon.

2329
01:44:46,420 --> 01:44:48,060
Oh my God.

2330
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:50,420
In the last couple of years, new Bible Man cartoon,

2331
01:44:50,420 --> 01:44:53,900
but not voiced by Willie Ames, the original Bible Man.

2332
01:44:53,900 --> 01:44:54,740
You love to do that.

2333
01:44:54,740 --> 01:44:57,180
Willie Ames has also similar charisma to Lance Burton.

2334
01:44:57,180 --> 01:45:00,060
He's kind of, listen fiddler,

2335
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:05,060
your lies will never puncture these children's ears.

2336
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:08,460
Yeah, I look forward to that one.

2337
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:10,340
Well, all right, so suggestions we need,

2338
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:13,580
but other, would we, earnestly,

2339
01:45:13,580 --> 01:45:16,100
would we suggest that our audience watch Billy Toppett

2340
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:18,460
or not, master magician?

2341
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:22,620
If you want to put something on,

2342
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:24,060
you wanna half watch something.

2343
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:26,420
I'd watch the trailer.

2344
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:29,340
Yeah, let's watch the trailer, scrub around.

2345
01:45:29,340 --> 01:45:30,820
We could have just done the trailer

2346
01:45:30,820 --> 01:45:32,060
and that could have been it.

2347
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:33,620
We could have done that, yes.

2348
01:45:34,620 --> 01:45:36,060
Yeah, should have learned our lesson

2349
01:45:36,060 --> 01:45:38,060
when we checked out the trailer.

2350
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:40,980
We did it, so they might not have to.

2351
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:45,580
Yes, we fell on this sword for you.

2352
01:45:45,580 --> 01:45:46,700
You're welcome.

2353
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:52,900
Well, you survived podcast, The Ride, The Second Gate,

2354
01:45:52,900 --> 01:45:57,620
which in today's episode has no colons anywhere

2355
01:45:57,620 --> 01:46:00,940
in solidarity with Billy Toppett, master magician.

2356
01:46:00,940 --> 01:46:02,180
No colons.

2357
01:46:02,180 --> 01:46:05,820
But we'll be back with more colons next week.

2358
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:07,620
We will restore the colon.

2359
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:12,500
In solidarity with whatever we're doing then.

2360
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:15,700
So stay subscribed, three bonus episodes every month.

2361
01:46:16,820 --> 01:46:19,340
And as Billy Toppett would say,

2362
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:22,900
I left myself hanging there.

2363
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:24,820
I don't know what Billy Toppett would say.

2364
01:46:24,820 --> 01:46:28,300
Well, we have, wanna go out with me?

2365
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:30,380
That's a land right?

2366
01:46:31,420 --> 01:46:35,620
Billy Toppett would say, no, I wasn't looking at your butt.

2367
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:37,220
No, I was.

2368
01:46:40,740 --> 01:46:42,740
It's like it's Nanny from Muppet Babies.

2369
01:46:45,020 --> 01:46:46,460
Barely even a word.

2370
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:50,700
I hope this starts Mike's career

2371
01:46:50,700 --> 01:46:55,100
as a Lance Burton impressionist in Vegas.

2372
01:46:56,780 --> 01:46:59,780
Opening four of the Beach Boys featuring Scott.

2373
01:46:59,780 --> 01:47:00,620
Yes.

2374
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:02,980
That's another one where we gotta make that happen.

2375
01:47:02,980 --> 01:47:03,820
We'll work on it.

2376
01:47:03,820 --> 01:47:05,540
We don't want to do them.

2377
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:07,340
All right.

2378
01:47:07,340 --> 01:47:08,180
Bye.
