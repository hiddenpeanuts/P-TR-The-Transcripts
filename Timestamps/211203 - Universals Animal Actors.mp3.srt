1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,480
Warning, the following podcast contains company issued khaki shorts, regal but imposing owls,

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,120
and madcap animal bra hijinks.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,080
It's Universal's Animal Actors on Podcast The Ride.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,280
Hey everybody, welcome to Podcast The Ride.

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,080
My name is Scott and I am a podcaster trainer here at the podcast.

8
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:50,200
Now you might not know that a lot of our podcasters are actually rescue podcasters.

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,960
They were brought to a shelter and we put them to work reading ads for online therapy

10
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,960
and bitcoin exchanges.

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,560
You want to meet a couple of our podcasters right now?

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,760
All right everybody, give it up.

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,960
Let's meet a few of our stars.

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,400
Say hello to Jason and Mike everyone.

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,840
It's Jason and Mike.

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,840
That's right.

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,520
All our podcasters today were aimless comedy loafs who were rescued from their aimlessness

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,880
and given a microphone to talk into and all sorts of Ponzi scheme-esque startups to advertise

19
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,800
for and aimless conversations to have for hours on end.

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,800
See look at that.

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,960
Jason's doing incredible.

22
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:29,000
He's speaking at a very advanced level, an advanced amount of cynicism which is what

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,400
we look for in our podcasters is what we try to breed.

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,680
Right and Scott's slipping me a fun-sized Mr. Goodbar because I did a good job.

25
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,680
Very good.

26
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,080
Here you go boy and let's see how Mike does.

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,080
If he gets a treat.

28
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,080
Mike can we say our name?

29
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,080
Can we say hello?

30
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,720
Yeah my name is Mike.

31
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,720
I'm a rescue.

32
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,760
We are trying to work the McGruff out of him.

33
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:58,240
Many podcasters start with a base McGruff voice and we see if we can kind of massage

34
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,280
that away.

35
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,640
Can you try saying your name in a regular way?

36
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,640
Hello Michael.

37
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,640
This is Michael.

38
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,640
Very good.

39
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,640
Thank you.

40
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,640
That is very good.

41
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,800
That's very listenable, very normal and for that we give you a treat which for you is

42
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:20,280
a foot high Ninja Turtles plastic figurine.

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,160
Wow its head is the same size as my head so I can kiss it in a realistic way.

44
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,160
Wow.

45
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,160
Thank you.

46
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
It does have tongue.

47
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,560
You can go all the way with it.

48
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,560
Right and the tongue is warm.

49
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,560
That's what's really nice about it.

50
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,560
Well how about that.

51
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,360
We are off to the races.

52
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,880
We have the energy that you find in every edition of Universal's Animal Actors Show.

53
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,200
A stalwart attraction.

54
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,240
I don't know how long it's been running in Hollywood.

55
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,600
They don't chart these things as well in Hollywood.

56
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,440
Universal Hollywood stuff just was one day.

57
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,440
It just evolved.

58
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,280
It sprung up out of the ground like a plant.

59
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,400
In Florida they track these things and this is an opening day attraction.

60
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,920
In Florida the show where you go see your favorite animal stars of stage and screen.

61
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,080
Yeah it may as well have been like it may as well have opened with the studio before

62
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,440
the theme park I feel like where they were just you would like wander in and somebody

63
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,240
would be like hey you want to see a hawk?

64
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,280
You want to see what the hawk just did in the sound stage?

65
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,480
And like that's where like it's almost like a Mrs. Knott chicken like a roadside attraction

66
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,480
first.

67
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,480
It was there before the park.

68
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,520
I saw the date of 1970.

69
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,520
Oh okay.

70
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,520
So I'm not 100% sure.

71
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:39,400
I saw this on the page for Animal Planet Live which was the short lived name for these shows

72
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,280
for a brief period of time.

73
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,200
They classified as Animal Planet Live just by that not having been the name.

74
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,680
I regard it as like an unpleasant era.

75
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:57,280
You get those 2000s fonts going which I'm usually persnickety about.

76
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,280
Yes.

77
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:04,240
There's this show is going by a number of Animal Actors stage, Animal Actors on location,

78
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,240
Animal Planet Live.

79
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
Yeah.

80
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,760
All very similar shows.

81
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,080
Like I'm kind of an annoying pedant sometimes with this stuff of like well this is different

82
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
than this.

83
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,760
I was like well even I have to even I will condense this one down to Animal Actors, Universal's

84
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
Animal Actors.

85
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,760
That's enough.

86
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,000
That sort of says it.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes.

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,760
The current name explains what all of them are.

89
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,800
That's what we're focusing on today which I'd like to say at the top here.

90
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,840
So this is the first main feed episode of December.

91
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,520
And December we sort of usually wind things down right?

92
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,960
We're getting to the end of the year.

93
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,440
We always take a little Christmas break, a little winter slumber.

94
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,280
So you know I feel a little sleepy, a little lazy.

95
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
Me too.

96
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,560
Because we're getting down to there's only a few more episodes left.

97
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,080
We're just going to sort of like sleepwalk through those and then we'll get the podcast

98
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,000
done for the year.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,640
Completely phone it just a few.

100
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,640
Wrong.

101
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,640
Incorrect.

102
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
What?

103
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,000
We guys, we are, I have an idea.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,320
I'm having it right now.

105
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,320
What if we didn't just do a few.

106
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,480
What if we did too many?

107
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,200
What if we went out for the year with an unnecessary amount of effort?

108
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,560
Isn't that the podcast the right way?

109
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,200
You're suggesting we hit the big red button and make ourselves even stupider.

110
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,400
Like you're suggesting we give ourselves a little obstacle course like a dog running

111
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:39,120
through a little tunnel and a child you know as a you know.

112
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,560
We're barely ducking weave through cones.

113
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,560
That's how we're going to go out this year.

114
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,120
We're barely making it through December.

115
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,120
I almost dropped my phone cracking the zoom recorder destroying all the files on it.

116
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,400
Yeah we all we came in with so many maladies.

117
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
So many energy.

118
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
I was yelling before.

119
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,280
Stan Anilman's throwing us off.

120
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,280
But we got to fight through.

121
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:07,760
We got to muscle through because I think it's time in the last episodes of the year of 2021

122
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,600
to make good on a promise made in the first episode of 2020.

123
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,320
It is finally time for Country Bear Jambor Week.

124
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,480
Let's go out with Country Bear Jambor Week guys.

125
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,480
Are we in?

126
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
Are we going to do it?

127
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,480
We're in.

128
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,680
I thought you were about to say let's review Captain Kidd's buffet and I was going to

129
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,080
have to tell you something really tragic.

130
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,400
But Country Bears is good too.

131
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Yes.

132
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
I thought it was interesting that that got.

133
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Why did that suddenly end up in our feed as if we didn't know it?

134
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,960
I think the fate of Captain Kidd's was very clear.

135
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
Yeah.

136
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,480
It was confirmed this odd bad I assume buffet right outside the gates of Disneyland.

137
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,280
Very poorly reviewed and now it's gone forever.

138
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,680
I think it boomeranged a little.

139
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,880
I think people saw that it was closed.

140
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,320
Everyone talked about it for a day and then like the boomerang went out and then it came

141
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,420
back and someone else went, hey, wait a minute, it's closed.

142
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,920
And then there was a second day of it.

143
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
It got a second.

144
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,440
This happens every now and then on the internet.

145
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,120
Like something comes back.

146
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
For some reason.

147
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,120
Right.

148
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,360
It gets more of a swell this time.

149
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,640
So we pay our respect.

150
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,640
I mean, that's our that's in our in memoriam.

151
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,760
Twenty twenty one montage.

152
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,240
That's really remember what we used to do.

153
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,560
Like it's the start of the year.

154
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,840
Here's the things coming to the theme park world this year.

155
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,960
I think now maybe we have to switch the tradition to the in memory of everything we lost in

156
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,960
2020.

157
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,960
Glendale's creative.

158
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,880
Oh, yeah.

159
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,880
Something unpredictable.

160
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,720
No, it'll still be just not as I will play it over.

161
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:38,360
I'll play the Green Day song live when we do it to several times, multiple times and

162
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,600
then Green Day songs.

163
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Yeah.

164
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
Yeah.

165
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,080
Most of the play, most of their discography over the course of the episode.

166
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,360
No, but look, yeah, we could mourn our losses for the year or we can go out on a fun note,

167
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,680
a celebration note, a jamber, a jamboree, a jamber week.

168
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,360
And that's what we're going to do.

169
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,560
So the last week of new shows for December will be Country Bear Jamber Week.

170
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,720
We're just we're excited to announce it.

171
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,000
To it. If we don't say it on the podcast, then maybe we don't finish it.

172
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,840
This is a we have at this point in time recorded some of it.

173
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:18,200
And I so far would say this in the other episodes before the end of the year, if Get

174
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,680
Back hasn't whetted your appetite for extremely long content, we're going to we're going to

175
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,160
blow get back out of the water in terms of our count.

176
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,840
Yeah. So get ready.

177
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,000
You got a lot to binge before December's through.

178
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,800
I had like an hour to kill the other day between like things I had to do.

179
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,440
And I was like, oh, what's the first episode of Get Back?

180
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,760
Because I thought it was a for each other.

181
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,720
I thought it went, oh, no.

182
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,120
I mean, I love it.

183
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,120
I'm a big fan of it.

184
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,520
And I'm sort of like I'm really stretching it out.

185
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:53,240
I'm like seeing if I can get a meal and two leftover meals out of every episode.

186
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,760
Like, can I split it into three nights?

187
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,520
Because I want to keep hanging out with my friends, the Beatles.

188
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,480
I'm done with it.

189
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,640
We did it. We did it the first three days.

190
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,120
Wow. Wow. Yeah.

191
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,480
Well, we got there's a lot of talking off air ice because I thought that maybe some

192
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,800
listeners don't like the constant classic rock talk.

193
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,360
There is maybe that strain in in the Disney plus.

194
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,840
We do the plus us up.

195
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,720
Yeah. So it's not. Yeah.

196
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,760
It's I was telling my very just that is we could do plus us up.

197
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,080
Get back in the new year.

198
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,640
It's you know, I was telling Mike Mitchell about how they have a Marvel characters,

199
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,280
like the new Marvel characters from Disney plus shows come in.

200
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,080
And he goes, oh, you mean like characters from Get Back?

201
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,360
And I said, yeah, like Mal Evans and Michael Lindsay Hogg are walking around

202
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,840
Avengers campus. Oh, they get they count.

203
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,640
They get to well.

204
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,000
Mitch opened up a good idea.

205
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,760
Linda Eastman. That's right.

206
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,240
And it wouldn't be it can't be Linda McCartney.

207
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,480
That wouldn't be time accurate.

208
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,800
Exactly. Timeline in the Beatles cinematic universe.

209
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,960
She's Linda Eastman. That's right.

210
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,560
And she's got the daughter from the first marriage or first really.

211
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,000
I forget which relationship she was married before, I think.

212
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yeah. So, yeah, it's they're all they're up for grabs because they're now in there.

213
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,040
So the Apple scruffs, the Apple scruffs, of course, the girls hanging out outside

214
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,800
of Apple Studios. I have to credit my friend Charles Ingram for really.

215
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,760
I think I let Apple scruffs come and go without really noticing.

216
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,960
And he well, he sent a voice memo in a text chain of Joe Biden talking about

217
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,120
the Apple scruffs.

218
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,760
Apple scruffs. We got to get good jobs.

219
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,280
Real jobs. My mother worked as an Apple scruff.

220
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,280
Bring back Apple scruff industry.

221
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,040
Thanks, Charles.

222
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,640
We were listening to All Things Must Pass on the way back from coming from San Diego.

223
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,720
And George Harrison on All Things Must Pass is a song called Apple Scruffs.

224
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,400
What? Really? Yeah.

225
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,720
Oh, that's why that phrase. That's what that song is.

226
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,800
Yeah. Oh, geez.

227
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,080
Yeah. Clearly, I'm no expert in that album. Interesting.

228
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,920
Yeah. OK. But all right.

229
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,960
So we've heard you listeners who don't like that.

230
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,800
What was just done?

231
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,440
You like us to talk about theme park things and we're going to.

232
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,240
We're going to talk about the country, bear jamboree incessantly.

233
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,080
It'll be the get back of the country, bear jamboree.

234
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,640
We'll cover all of the the ins and outs, the breakups,

235
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,240
when things got awkward,

236
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,920
when when Zeke almost walked out, like quit the right with the bear rugs,

237
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,280
but came back triumphantly.

238
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,520
It's all in. It's all in.

239
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,880
So, yeah. So get excited.

240
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,520
Yeah.

241
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,120
Are you ready? Are you ready?

242
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,320
You are already get ready.

243
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,520
You left a good pause there for people to yell.

244
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,320
That's what it was for.

245
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,960
Yes. Yeah. We don't have the luxury of an applause button like a show would.

246
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,720
You just have to assume if there's a little pause that that's what you're.

247
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,520
Yeah. Yeah. That's right.

248
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,680
Are you excited, cricket?

249
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,480
Well, we're here in the cricket again.

250
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,200
No, I was just saying.

251
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,760
I could cue it.

252
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,560
Cricket.

253
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,480
I guess the cricket doesn't know its name is cricket.

254
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,640
Were you doing that because of the animal actors?

255
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,400
No, no, I don't have a little cricket clicker or like a cricket feed.

256
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,240
Or have they ever had a cricket in the animal actor show?

257
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,440
Well, I could like do it's cricket noise on command.

258
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,320
It's funny you say that because there is a bit of internet that doesn't apply

259
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,680
anymore when it was Animal Planet Live.

260
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,760
There was an animal live website

261
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,440
that had like live cams on like tanks of bugs.

262
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:31,240
And the the wiki wiki entry for that said, like,

263
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,960
and that website is still active.

264
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,800
That website is, of course, not still active.

265
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
I don't know.

266
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,880
No one has updated the Animal Planet Live Wikipedia entry in some time.

267
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,760
No, no.

268
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,200
And there's no animal actor entry.

269
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,360
I was shocked to see that.

270
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,400
There's not. The thing that we're talking about today

271
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,000
doesn't have its own.

272
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
No, it's got a very slight fandom page.

273
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,400
OK, OK. The universal.

274
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,400
Similar to Mention on a Bench, which was just discussed.

275
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,280
Right. Second gate.

276
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,320
You can check that out.

277
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,800
But wow.

278
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,400
We well, you know, we're doing deep cuts.

279
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,880
We're doing our Yoko freak out style.

280
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,640
The non album stuff, because if we're talking about things

281
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,040
that don't even have Wikipedia pages, you know, we're in good territory.

282
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,160
Where do you start?

283
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,640
Where do you begin with the research?

284
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,400
If you don't have the Wikipedia page to begin with,

285
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,000
I guess where you dive in is watch the show.

286
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,760
The show. Yeah.

287
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,280
Which, you know, this show is I watched

288
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,920
pretty recent editions, 2020 or 2021 editions of this

289
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,200
Universal Animal Actors Show and

290
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,200
discover that it is exactly the same as the first time I saw it,

291
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,160
which would have been in 1991.

292
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,920
That is really the big takeaway of the show for me is that there's those gags

293
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,400
that have never changed one.

294
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,720
I know it is. They found a formula that works.

295
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,160
It makes the kids laugh. It makes the moms laugh.

296
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,400
And it's a funny thing to see an animal do.

297
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,160
And they it's that forever.

298
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah. And it always seems to hit.

299
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,440
The crowds always like it.

300
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,120
I feel like this is my family.

301
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,520
I always stop and see the show.

302
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,920
I'm trying to remember if I saw it when we were down.

303
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,120
I may have gone the day I just went to Universal.

304
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,080
Yeah. Before I flew out.

305
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,760
But I always like this show.

306
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,840
Yeah. The audience, I think I watched one from four or five years ago.

307
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,760
And the audience reacts like with honest to God shock

308
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,960
almost after every thing, after every trick.

309
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,920
Like it really worked.

310
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,480
These are like time tested tricks that work and like elicit a response

311
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,240
because we've all been to theme park shows where the audience is dead.

312
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,160
The audience is no response or like, I did.

313
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,280
I performed a lot of short solo.

314
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,720
I did a lot of bombed one man shows on wheels and my trip to work.

315
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,800
Yeah. But it seems like this one is always a hit.

316
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,000
Always a hit.

317
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,440
Yeah. The bird, you know, the smaller bird

318
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,920
flying to an audience member to take their dollar.

319
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,400
And then the animal handler pockets the dollar and then says,

320
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,160
is anyone over here? I have a 50 kills every time.

321
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,680
It's like there's so little evergreen comedy.

322
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,200
This always works.

323
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,200
The one I the one I watched, she said she said 20 20.

324
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,400
OK, I think so.

325
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,920
A little wiggle room. Yeah.

326
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,200
Fifty and 20 are both pretty funny. Yeah. Pretty funny.

327
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,400
Depending on how the economy is going, like it's it's scary to lose a 20.

328
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,320
I mean, you know, in boom times,

329
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,400
you have to go to 50, but right.

330
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,880
Everybody's going to make every 20 count depending on what year it is. Right.

331
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,760
So like if you go into work in the morning,

332
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,400
you check the newspaper to see how the stock market did that day.

333
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,720
The dollar. Oh, yeah. The dollar index.

334
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,480
If the dollar index is down, then you go for 20.

335
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,560
But if everything's doing well and the economy is surging, then you go 50.

336
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,440
Yeah, that's in the rule book, I assume.

337
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,240
This is the difficulty of being the host of this show

338
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,200
beyond that you have to work with animals,

339
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,360
beyond that you have to wear slightly embarrassing khaki shorts.

340
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,600
This is where in my universal years, I

341
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:16,320
I send my respects and condolences to the people in the show

342
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,000
who have to wear awkward khaki shorts, as I did.

343
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,200
This is the universal uniform for a number of things, I guess.

344
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,880
Were they you had to purchase your own?

345
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,080
They're not like universal administered shorts.

346
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,840
No, no, no. They give them out.

347
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,120
Oh, they do. Yeah, yeah. No.

348
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,680
Oh, OK. So it's not just check in and get my uniform every day from a,

349
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,240
you know, big dry cleaner, like complicated system.

350
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,720
They scan a code.

351
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,320
So you can't just bring your own khaki shorts.

352
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,280
They have they might know they aren't code khaki shorts.

353
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,840
Yeah, they're kind of uniform.

354
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,280
Interesting. That's actually I didn't even think about this,

355
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,920
because like when I used to work at the container store,

356
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,480
you'd have to wear like khakis and a polo.

357
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,960
And the polo was container store polo.

358
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,200
But you could bring in like as long as they looked about right

359
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,040
as far as the color of pant.

360
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,960
Oh, similar. That's like a that's kind of the level of school uniform I had was.

361
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,560
Right. Doesn't have to be this specific kind of like in this range.

362
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,200
Wow. So you all got your little khaki shorts

363
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,240
in the morning, as I'm sure I've said before, with the awkward

364
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,000
like crotch puff, just you would it would sound men and women.

365
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,960
It would you would sit in such a way where you just get this huge tent

366
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,960
and you're looking at this room of in the little lounge,

367
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,040
this 15 people sitting around all with the worst crotch puffs.

368
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,320
It's like the least glamorous anybody could look just like the founder.

369
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,240
Oh, God, who's the the universal guy that they're like?

370
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,560
And then back in 1916, so and so Carl Lemley,

371
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,600
Carl Lemley, almost said Irving Thalberg, but that's MGM.

372
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,800
They used to talk about and I was thinking you said founder.

373
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
And all I could think was Ray.

374
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,120
Yeah, that's what I was thinking, too.

375
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,440
I was like, oh, Ray Kroc, Jason.

376
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,640
Ray Kroc and the McDonagh brothers.

377
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,000
Yes. But no, that yeah.

378
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
What's his name?

379
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,240
I already forgot the name.

380
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,920
You said what's Carl Lemley was the one who wanted the Lemley theaters

381
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,480
that have nothing to do with universal.

382
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,680
He was the one who instituted the crotch puff.

383
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,000
He was the one who wanted that at Universal.

384
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,640
That was a tradition.

385
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,120
It was in style in the 30s.

386
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,360
Yeah. And they started things like Jodd Hoppers and the big Scott and stuff.

387
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,080
It was a sign that's the same puff.

388
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,080
No one can imagine what else is under there.

389
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,480
It was a sign of wealth, too.

390
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,160
Yes. Well, that's what it was really.

391
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,600
You could afford excess fabric.

392
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,440
Right. It's like that.

393
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,120
Well, I look at that rich gentleman over there with his large crotch puff.

394
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,560
He was people were very tight pants. Right.

395
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,640
Yeah. Less less fabric.

396
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,720
It's all I could afford.

397
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
Well, that's yeah.

398
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,360
So the tradition cares carried on at Universal Studios.

399
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,520
I like that as the general.

400
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,080
I mean, I think it's a style you see also at SeaWorld or any zoo.

401
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,360
Like I don't know at what point in time

402
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,080
khakis became synonymous with handling animals.

403
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,240
Right.

404
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,080
Like which is also how like your Joan Embree's dress, your your your

405
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,600
Erwin's. Yeah.

406
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,120
Yeah. The Irwin's. Absolutely.

407
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,120
Jack. All of them have like khaki shorts or pants.

408
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,520
I feel like shirts, too.

409
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,880
Sometimes shirts.

410
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,360
Is it to blend in?

411
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,920
Is it like a nature color?

412
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,040
My back is green. Safari.

413
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,520
Safari. I mean, it's usually lighter cotton.

414
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,800
It's usually flexible, but sturdy.

415
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,480
Yeah. No.

416
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,440
I mean, I'm sure the answer is like obvious and people know.

417
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,360
And they'll be like, you should have known this is why khakis were worn

418
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,040
by these animal handlers.

419
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,280
But it might be something about like dullness of like a muted color.

420
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,160
Like you wouldn't want to wear,

421
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,200
you know, bright zebra stripes in front of an actual zebra.

422
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,240
It might upset them.

423
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,120
They they might charge. Right.

424
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,840
Some animals you can probably wear their like fur pattern and they like it.

425
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,680
And then some they don't.

426
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,240
I think khaki chinos came.

427
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,280
That was a fashion design that started with the military,

428
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,840
British military,

429
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,720
and slowly got into civilian life.

430
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Oh, hmm.

431
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,760
I don't have any.

432
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,840
I am khaki less for maybe the first time in a long time.

433
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,240
I don't have any khaki pants that I wear.

434
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:27,360
The only khaki pants I have still are the the ones I was issued as a tour guide.

435
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,720
Oh, well, were you supposed to give them back khaki for things like as I've

436
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,720
which has only been in sketches,

437
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,760
like a sketch on stage where I played a universal guy.

438
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,920
Right. For some reason, in my Michael McDonald Halloween video,

439
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,520
I'm in those khakis.

440
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,240
Wow. Really? Not sure why.

441
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,600
He must have been a khaki wearer.

442
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,440
Now, I don't remember why I picked the pants.

443
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,640
Why were you asked for oral history?

444
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,280
Were you supposed to give them back when you left?

445
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,880
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Wow.

446
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,680
And I kept the I kept the uniform and I will use it as wardrobe every once in a while.

447
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,880
Wow. So you are committing to a crime here.

448
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,800
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

449
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,840
Universal. I own.

450
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,400
I don't own. Obviously, I the opposite of own.

451
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,400
I have probably thirty dollars worth of universal property.

452
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,560
Yeah. Give up. Like, let's do a ransom note here.

453
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,880
Let's tell Universal what they have to do to get that clothes.

454
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,240
Those clothes back. Let me do a tour one more time and fill the tram

455
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,480
with podcast, the ride listeners. OK, great.

456
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,360
And you'll strip nude at the end of the tram tour and give it back

457
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,680
to the current president of Universal.

458
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,440
Oh, we're finally branching out into performance art.

459
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,560
Yeah. Yeah. So exciting.

460
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,160
The early days of UCB, man.

461
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,880
Downtown scene, man.

462
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,240
Hell, yeah. Like Yoko.

463
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,520
That's true. Yoko's territory.

464
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,160
Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, true.

465
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,280
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. All right.

466
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,440
So, yeah, you have to let me fill up a tram with only listeners to the show

467
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,600
and to say whatever I want.

468
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,480
And then I get to show my penis and then you'll do the two lovers.

469
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,240
Yoko, John picture with the president of Universal

470
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,800
of the theme park or of the movie studio, which president?

471
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,080
Well, we'll have to negotiate.

472
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,880
Terry, figure that out.

473
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,240
Do you ever see an interview with a guy named Terry Koo?

474
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,360
I have. Yeah.

475
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,120
Theory, go it not.

476
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,320
It's really I don't know.

477
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,320
I mean, that's how it's spelled.

478
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,720
But I think it might be pronounced in a weird, you know, not outspelled way.

479
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,720
Recently, going around because at the IAPA conference

480
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,640
in Orlando, they asked what his biggest career regret was.

481
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:36,200
And he said, not telling management not to build Fast and Furious supercharged.

482
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,400
Wow. Like he admits to that.

483
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,800
Really? Currently in charge.

484
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,880
Room lost it like the room loved it.

485
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,760
Yeah. Geez.

486
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,240
So he's cool. Yeah, he is.

487
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,440
So he would take the photo with you naked.

488
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,600
Yeah. So he probably likes the Beatles, too.

489
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,400
Yeah. I appreciate the nod.

490
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,080
Yeah. Mm hmm.

491
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,320
So I'm am I Yoko?

492
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,720
Am I like I have to cling to him essentially?

493
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,000
No, Yoko was clothed.

494
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,760
John was John was clinging.

495
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,760
Oh, John was nude.

496
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,680
Yoko had clothes on and John was clinging to.

497
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,200
Oh, so Terry gets to keep his clothes on. Easy.

498
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,160
Yeah, that's why.

499
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,520
Just let me a naked man. Yeah.

500
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,520
Yeah. Blowing any universe.

501
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,880
We're going to get quietly removed from the press email.

502
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,880
Oh, they're cool. The social media tweeted us. Remember?

503
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,560
Oh, that's right. They acknowledged the the city.

504
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,080
So the sector keeper is universal cannon.

505
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,200
They probably own it now.

506
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,560
Whatever. By doing that.

507
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,400
Yeah. All right.

508
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,120
Well, that's another you have to give us the sector keeper back and let me do.

509
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,800
I've got a lot of ransom now.

510
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,720
It's all building up.

511
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,920
This is the point where an animal handler would have a spray bottle of water.

512
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,160
And they go like the comedy.

513
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,040
The comedy guys are trying to find reasons to get naked on a stage.

514
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,400
No, no, no, no.

515
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,880
Dad, yeah, doesn't work as well anymore.

516
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,200
Might have flown in 2005 for the CBA today.

517
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:03,320
At that that that to bring back to the animal actors, you know, you were saying,

518
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,840
regardless of your feelings on khaki pants, I always liked.

519
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,920
I thought they had a cool little utility belt and a walkie talkie.

520
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,280
Like I was like, oh, they got a little utility belt.

521
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,360
I've like clickers and treats and stuff.

522
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,680
Mm hmm. Clickers and clickers and treats. Yeah.

523
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,480
Well, do we know what the treats are?

524
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,920
Is there is just like little meat treats.

525
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,480
I'm sure it's a little meat packer kibble or something. Yeah.

526
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,000
Yeah. Probably. They don't say, though, I don't think in the show.

527
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,920
It's just a little I don't know.

528
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,320
No, there's training treats. Right.

529
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,280
Like, yeah, yeah, those little like circles or little little balls.

530
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,000
Sure. Well, Fanny full of treats. Mm hmm.

531
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,400
I guess like, you know, I think the show is is a lot of fun

532
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,440
and we should talk about our fair little moments in it.

533
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,920
I think are you guys what percentage of you is is uneasy

534
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,400
with just the animal training nature of it?

535
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,280
Like, does that put you off a little bit?

536
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,880
Do you feel weird about these animals having to do this stuff?

537
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,360
I mean, like, obviously, there, if they had free will,

538
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,960
they wouldn't be performing 15 shows a day or whatever.

539
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,880
It wouldn't be flipping signs to

540
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,280
signs that say ban bacon. Yeah.

541
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,600
Kind of thing. Ethically, that is an interesting question,

542
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:23,200
because like with with SeaWorld, like Shamu, whatever Shamu,

543
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,520
like they shouldn't be in tanks. Mm hmm.

544
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,720
Like it's a lot more of a like, well, this is not where

545
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,800
this is not a comfortable environment for. Yeah.

546
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,400
These the sea life.

547
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,880
But this is a I don't know. It's different.

548
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,560
It's a little different here, but still like, I don't know.

549
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,520
It's a good question.

550
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,560
Like, do I feel that the dog is having a good time?

551
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,680
Like getting applause.

552
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,800
You know, it's where I think that the the dogs,

553
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,880
I think dogs enjoy it because dogs like doing like little tricks

554
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,000
and getting applause that seems like in the nature of dogs.

555
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,040
I maybe I brought it up because I was I'm looking at cats doing tricks.

556
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,120
And I'm like, this is I ain't never met a cat who wanted to do

557
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,800
anything that anyone asked.

558
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,000
Yeah, I there's I think there's a reason there's only one or two cat.

559
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,520
There's like a limited number of cat moments in this show.

560
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,400
Yeah, yeah. I the one of the first things where we hung out, Mike,

561
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,360
was that that sketch that you were in at Conan, the cat controlled.

562
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,520
Yes, Shubhaka piloted decoyed Shubhaka.

563
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,920
Right. A video about that Andre Dubashe wrote, where if you don't want to go

564
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:39,200
to a Halloween party, you get a Shubhaka costume and put a bunch of cats in it.

565
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,640
Pilot it like a spaceship and they go to the party and your girlfriend

566
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,320
thinks you're in the suit. Right.

567
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,920
And you can look this up.

568
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,680
Mike is the star of it. And I directed it.

569
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,040
And it involved having to have a bunch of cats in the part you weren't in.

570
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,320
The whole morning was like, OK, so we'll shoot out the cats.

571
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,640
We'll do the cat part.

572
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,680
And there's a bunch of cats and little like little like spaceship units

573
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,240
inside this Chewbacca costume.

574
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,240
And I just remember like, oh, God, I've never hated a shoot more.

575
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,040
Yeah. Being around cat wranglers, which is a fake thing.

576
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,720
Cats cannot be wrangled.

577
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,080
Yeah. It's just click city.

578
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,760
Just click, clack, click, clack.

579
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,800
All the treats everywhere are disgusting.

580
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,480
Like we're little cat food plops.

581
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,760
So it smells bad.

582
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,960
And you see it on the props and like I and then like, you know,

583
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,440
somebody like waved their arm too big or something.

584
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,200
And then the cat trainer went like, hey, there's a dog creature.

585
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,960
You do not do that.

586
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,720
You do not dare. They are scared.

587
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,120
You understand we're all getting screamed at.

588
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,640
Yeah. Cat trainers.

589
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,200
It was just like, boy, do I never want to be in this scenario again.

590
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,400
Funny you bring that up because Jason Sheridan and I worked with cats last year.

591
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,400
Yes.

592
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,840
Hmm. On a Nickelodeon show.

593
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,360
You did both of you.

594
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,840
It's a real brief little thing.

595
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,720
Shot in and out in like less than an hour and stuff.

596
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,760
Yeah. Well, we were security guards.

597
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,320
Yeah. The cats could not have.

598
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,800
What the hell is this?

599
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,040
Have we not talked about this? No.

600
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,040
Well, there's like, we'll find it.

601
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,680
We'll find it and rip it.

602
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,200
It's a real quick.

603
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,920
But I had a similar observation because there were cats.

604
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,640
And I was like, these cats barely listen to what they're told to do.

605
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,880
Like they had like plans for the cats and the cats were not interested in the plans.

606
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,560
And I was like, this can't be good.

607
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,080
Like, and it's just like, and it was like, all right, here's what they're going to do.

608
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,680
And then it was like take six, seven.

609
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,400
Their cats are not doing this.

610
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,760
OK, well, what are we going to do?

611
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,440
We're shooting here. Blah, blah, blah.

612
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,120
So why does anyone even let the cat

613
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,440
trainers show up on the set and stay mum about that?

614
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,040
They know there's going to be five unusable take no matter what they're shooting.

615
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,280
At least that many. Yeah.

616
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,560
And they know it and they're letting it happen.

617
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,160
All right. So how long before the jig is up?

618
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,120
Because I won't get hired anymore if they figure out cats can't be trained.

619
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,000
Yes, the whole thing is done the whole job.

620
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,560
But yeah, I don't know.

621
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,040
I think they should just use cat puppet.

622
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,640
Like they should use the Tunesys, the driving cat puppet.

623
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,520
Anytime now they need a cat. Yeah.

624
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,880
That's a really old reference now that I'm realizing I'm saying it.

625
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,680
It's from 30 years ago.

626
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,520
Mm hmm.

627
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,600
But yeah, it was a puppet.

628
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,480
So, yeah, as far as animals, I also think we're in a weird

629
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,920
transitionary time of thinking about ethical treatment of animal.

630
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,440
Like I'm I will still eat meat.

631
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,400
I'm trying to eat less of it still.

632
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:36,160
But I feel like in who knows, 20, 50, 70 years, you look back and go,

633
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,400
we were making animals do what at Universal Studios every day.

634
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,360
Right. What? Yeah.

635
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,320
There's a lot of that with animals, I think that'll still evolve.

636
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,360
There's so many dogs in rescues.

637
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,960
I kind of understand that when you start getting into birds of prey

638
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,280
and pigs and stuff, I mean, I guess there's pigs in rescues, too,

639
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,400
or farms or whatever. Mm hmm.

640
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,040
Yeah, it gets a little confusing.

641
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,600
And then the other thing to consider is like, I've heard stories

642
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,560
from anyone who has worked at any theme park or any chain.

643
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:10,680
You hear stories about corners being cut or like, oh, we didn't have enough staff.

644
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:15,000
And just hoping to God that is not the case with the animals.

645
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,400
Oh, that everybody's taken care of.

646
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,240
Yeah, I think there's a lot of state and federal regulation with working with animals.

647
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,400
So I think that you kind of have to follow the rules a little more strictly.

648
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,480
Yeah. I mean, there are like just seeing animals personalities

649
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,680
like Edwin, our dog Edwin would not be pleased to have to do this.

650
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,360
And you can imagine like, you know, there's certain dogs

651
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,560
that are the friendliest dogs, they love running around, they love doing so.

652
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,320
So I'm sure it depends.

653
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,400
I'm sure it varies from animal to animal.

654
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,200
Exactly what the enjoyment level is.

655
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,840
So Edwin will not be appearing in a live show if we're the next time.

656
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,480
When live show he well, if it's live via satellite and he can like sit in the sun,

657
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,600
because that's maybe his favorite thing to do is find a window

658
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,840
and sit in like a hard sun, like a sunbeam. Yes.

659
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,520
So are you agreeing that's your favorite thing, too?

660
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,440
I don't mind.

661
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,800
I mean, Garfield loves to sit outside in the sun.

662
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,000
Yeah, he gets very energetic and we've trained.

663
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,760
Like he can do he loves to play and we can.

664
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,160
I think we've trained him to go like up up and like jump, jump,

665
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,760
you know, standing on his back legs and like put his front legs on us.

666
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:30,920
But then he needs he also likes to like sleep for a good two thirds of the day.

667
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,200
It seems like so we're on and off two thirds of the day.

668
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,560
Have a big burst energy and then sleep for like two hours. Right.

669
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,120
You know, like you doing the podcast.

670
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,280
Yeah, basically like doing the podcast.

671
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,000
Hey, I'm feeling great.

672
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,240
I'm so happy to hear us all talk about having the December wind down,

673
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:53,960
you know, crutch crutch feelings going on, because I was like,

674
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,760
well, this makes me feel less insane. So you like the fake out part

675
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,120
where I say we're just going to settle into the end of the year.

676
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,840
I did. I did get on his nightcap like like an animal trainer

677
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,120
standing behind an actor holding a treat up. I got fooled.

678
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,400
I got fooled. You got me to do what I wanted.

679
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,400
What? Huh? I'm looking this way.

680
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,360
What do I get it because I'm looking this way?

681
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,960
Yeah. So, I mean, all that being said, we have no we don't know anything about

682
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,920
the what's involved in the show, and they certainly present a good face of that.

683
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,200
Yeah, they do push the rescue animal situation.

684
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,200
Right. They work with dogs and shelters and they push that at the end of the show.

685
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,120
As you're leaving, they say, you know, if you're looking to adopt

686
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,600
those sheltered messages seem very good.

687
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,360
Heather, it's very, yeah, really gentle.

688
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,040
And my point I was trying to make earlier was it's not the same situation

689
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,040
where like the dog is being exclusively kept in a

690
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,240
like a four by four cage for most of its life.

691
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,960
I assume I'm just saying, I think we really don't know.

692
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,520
We really don't know. You're right.

693
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,320
I guess we really don't know.

694
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,920
But I think it's at least a little bit different than the like sea world situation.

695
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:03,360
If you get into that line of work at this point, like you have to be

696
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,040
passionate about animals and they come in from you would think so, because it is.

697
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,160
And now I did. I don't know in the 1940s.

698
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,400
Maybe I do know. I bet.

699
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,800
Oh, you know, yeah. Film was quite awful.

700
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,480
There's an Earl.

701
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,560
I think I've even said this on the show before.

702
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,880
There's a I guess it's like an old Errol Flynn Robin Hood movie

703
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,680
where there's a stunt where somebody jumps out of a fake tree onto a horse.

704
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,760
And it's like 10 feet in the air.

705
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,560
That doesn't feel good for the horse.

706
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,800
I mean, it doesn't feel good for the human, but the human knew what he was doing.

707
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,800
At least the horse just has like a fucking weight

708
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,840
to fall from 10 feet in the air on it.

709
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,080
Like, that's not good for the horse.

710
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,680
Sure. So, yeah, no, we do know what it was like, especially in the old days.

711
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,240
Yeah. The one thing associated with there

712
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,880
should kind of tangentially is associated with Grinchmas is happening at Universal now.

713
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,040
And they always have a Max.

714
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,520
Well, they always have Max. Yes.

715
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:58,400
Few Max's. And then they always say these these will all be adopted

716
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,280
at the end of the throughout the season or at the end of the season.

717
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,400
I met Max. Yes.

718
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,760
Remember my exclusive interview with Grinch a couple of years ago?

719
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,960
I have not been invited back for some weird reason.

720
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,000
You won't be now after I guess that I want to get naked

721
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,880
next to the head of Universal Creative.

722
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,760
I don't even I'm not even sure who it is.

723
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,360
There's so many shifting someone left, someone took over people moving around a lot.

724
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,640
Well, whoever it is, I'm getting naked on them over at Imagineering.

725
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,520
You're going to two virgins that guy.

726
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,920
That's right. Hey, pal, I'm going to two virgins you.

727
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,240
OK, I was warning you.

728
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,800
Shump up on him.

729
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,760
All right. Please escort that man out of city.

730
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,520
Well, take his shirt and away.

731
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,320
He said enough.

732
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,200
I already did the 19 part series about everything in city.

733
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,800
He's definitely had enough.

734
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,360
This guy doesn't need to be here again.

735
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,960
That's like that's like a horror movie.

736
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,080
They'd be like, well, is he a universal fan?

737
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,600
He's done 19 episodes about the shopping mall.

738
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,520
And they'd be like, oh, my God, like, let's get a restraining order,

739
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,360
which is really what they should say about all three of us.

740
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah.

741
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,200
Let's you know, we're working our way through.

742
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,000
We've done so many universal attractions.

743
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,840
It's like, yeah, we're almost getting down to the end with with Hollywood stuff.

744
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,520
But there's plenty in Florida for sure.

745
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,480
The only thing to do is to do them all again.

746
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,120
Art to every single thing. Part two.

747
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,160
The guy who started the show, who like put it in place

748
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:33,560
and is a big pioneer in animal training in general for movies is named Ray Berwick.

749
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,360
He's a pioneer in using positive reinforcement to get animals to perform.

750
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,560
He created shows for the San Diego Wild Animal Park,

751
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,400
and he he produced this show initially in the 70s,

752
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,880
which seems like, you know, he and he was working in film in the city.

753
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,120
So he worked on I think first was Birdman of Alcatraz

754
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,600
with Bert Lancaster and then the birds for Hitchcock in 63.

755
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:04,040
And a quote from this guy in my work, I've trained more than 25000 animals

756
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,400
and I've only lost one in an accident.

757
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,920
And you go, oh, that's nice.

758
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,040
Those are pretty good numbers.

759
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,000
Then he keeps going.

760
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
One of the birds for the birds was crushed by a wagon.

761
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,440
OK, well, you know, the first part was the stat might have been nice.

762
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,920
I know about the bird and the birds.

763
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,960
But that being said, like you'd think just like naturally,

764
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,680
just crew members would be stepping on them.

765
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,200
It's the birds. There are so many birds in the birds.

766
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,440
Yes, there are a lot of birds.

767
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,000
So only one is that that ain't bad, especially in the old days.

768
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:38,240
Yeah, I'm sure the birds had been filmed in 1911.

769
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,960
Then birds would have made it out.

770
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,160
The stat 25000 and he's only lost one.

771
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,400
They would have lost 25000 birds.

772
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,640
Yeah, I feel like film sets back then are just the whole ground is just cigarette.

773
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,040
But right.

774
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,080
Yeah, they can't shoot the ground in old movies

775
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,600
because they're all cigarette.

776
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,560
But one clean footstep.

777
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,360
Anywhere the birds land, they get singed. Yeah.

778
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,360
No, but Berwick made sure that things were comfortable here.

779
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,040
And if this thing did start in the 70s, then that might

780
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,720
it might make sense why the show still feels like the comedy of the 1970s.

781
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,480
Yeah, I think in a bad way.

782
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,040
No, it's fine.

783
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:22,960
It's age is very old sitcom or even like the tale

784
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,080
and like memories of broad broad vaudeville, like old guy.

785
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,160
It kind of like that.

786
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,880
You know, the kid.

787
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,680
This is the one the dollar trick I always remember.

788
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,320
And then I always remember they bring a kid on stage

789
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,480
and they're like this.

790
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,600
Think of a clothing item.

791
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,680
This dog is going to go fetch it. Yeah.

792
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,040
And sometimes they go like, oh, did you think of a hat?

793
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,520
Yeah, he got the hat. Good job.

794
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,480
Think of another one.

795
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,760
And then it's inevitably like bathing suit top or bra or something.

796
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,800
And then dogs are pervert.

797
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,560
Yeah. Or the boys are pervert.

798
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:01,760
I guess pervert and then an orangutan in a towel or a little dog hopping out

799
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,360
on it in a towel.

800
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,640
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

801
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,520
A lot of great public domain like comedy music cues.

802
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,440
Yeah. Yeah. Stock library cues.

803
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,240
But also like the the

804
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,440
what's the what's it called? The peewee like,

805
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,360
didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't.

806
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,640
It's nice to hear that.

807
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,720
Well, a bunch of animal hijinks go on.

808
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,560
Yeah. That sequence.

809
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,680
Yes, a classic.

810
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,080
I think that while I don't remember, maybe I guess I think it was always a dog

811
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,000
in that main role and then yes, an orangutan who would go

812
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,200
who would come out in shower gear and shower cap.

813
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,360
I think that's the big change in terms of,

814
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:48,840
you know, animal equities, whatever you want, safety, whatever you want to call it,

815
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,360
is they stopped in both parks.

816
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,480
Universal stopped working with primates in 2014.

817
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,640
So because that's really the way I remember the show,

818
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,880
is that like multiple monkey appearances and they stopped doing that.

819
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,960
PETA, I think, got them to stop.

820
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,600
There was like a swinging, a rotating like jungle gym kind of thing

821
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,880
that a monkey wouldn't implement and they were like,

822
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,360
you would see if we could swing all the way around and they get cheered on.

823
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,120
And it's yeah, it was I was surprised to learn that they

824
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,920
that they stopped working primates because I that's those are a lot of my

825
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,680
strongest memories and probably the most clear memory of the show is like the

826
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:35,160
it's the physical comedy routine between the monkey and the the trainer,

827
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:43,560
where there's like smacks on the back and like sounds like like,

828
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,400
what do you mean?

829
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,320
Hey, how could you do that?

830
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,760
The crowd to be nice to the people.

831
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,040
And and then the impressions, the impressions is the big thing.

832
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,440
And this is what they can't do with another.

833
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,680
They can plug and play other species for some of these gigs, but they can't

834
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:04,280
push the monkey's lips out and say, look, everybody Mick Jagger.

835
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,040
Right.

836
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,160
Well, for sure, the main thing I remember.

837
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,360
Yeah, that's the big one.

838
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:08,640
Yeah.

839
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,440
And I think I've only seen this show in person, I think once.

840
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,440
And I do remember that because I think it was before they got

841
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,880
they stopped doing the the monkeys or primates.

842
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,680
I think in Florida, it's in a good spot.

843
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,840
If you are going like you want to break from rides

844
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,000
where like it's kind of between Simpsons and ET.

845
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:36,280
So like where if you're having a slow start today, you do ET, you do

846
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,560
Animal Actor, you know, as you like complete the loop, you know,

847
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,000
you're saying it's a good spot to rule.

848
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,480
You're saying it's something in the layout.

849
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,480
It's a good spot for it.

850
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,440
I think it's a good spot.

851
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,240
It's also good if it's just like everything's crowded or you just need to sit down.

852
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,680
We're like, you know, we're like everyone in your party is like,

853
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,880
can we sit for a while?

854
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,640
Can we do this? Because it's it's outdoors, but it's pretty shady.

855
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,240
You know, it's covered and all.

856
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,600
Little amphitheater amphitheater of both these spaces, though,

857
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,440
since we bring in the amphitheaters, huge plots of land.

858
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,160
Yeah, a little surprising these shows are still going.

859
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,240
I mean, the the they the play into the movie,

860
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,160
how the movies are made element of the Universal parks.

861
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,600
But man, they take up a lot of real.

862
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,720
It's a little surprising they haven't been pulled in.

863
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,040
Yeah, yeah, really. In Florida, it's mainly just I guess

864
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,520
just that they have the room in the second park.

865
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,680
Yeah, they don't super need to.

866
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,840
Yeah, Hollywood where it's a little more cramps,

867
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:36,040
but maybe they can't fit a full ride in there necessarily.

868
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,120
So although they got they they made a lot of that

869
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,120
secret life of pets.

870
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,280
Yeah, I was going to say, and that's two stories.

871
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,720
So, yeah, I'm sure there's something.

872
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:50,520
Yeah, maybe they'll do it when Mick Jagger dies, when they when there's no longer

873
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:54,040
the when the the point when the impression isn't relevant right anymore.

874
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,040
I guess they can't do it because the they're they're gone.

875
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,120
So but they probably thought about it.

876
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,920
They probably thought about just get ending it when that joke got cut.

877
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,360
Yeah. Yeah. Why even do the show anymore?

878
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,040
Right. That's what we're here for, isn't it?

879
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,320
This lips thing.

880
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,560
And there's no other celebrities to do this with.

881
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,000
Who else? Right.

882
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,240
Are there? Oh, I think there was maybe a time where they switched it to Angelina

883
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,600
Jolie. Oh, really? OK.

884
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,160
Who else has big lips?

885
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,560
Because I think they tried to play.

886
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,920
Smith. That was a very top of reference for a while.

887
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,520
And you know, 20 years ago, that was good. Yeah. Yeah.

888
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,120
Yeah.

889
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,960
I think they just lucked out that they picked somebody who remained relevant

890
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,720
and around for so many decades, because that had been type.

891
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:40,600
If it was a big lips celebrity who passed in 1973, then what do you do?

892
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,520
Right. So screwed.

893
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,920
Everyone, it's the lips from the opening of the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

894
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,360
The disembodied lips, you know.

895
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,720
Yeah, that would have again.

896
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,760
That would have been great 40 years ago.

897
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,680
I don't know. It may have remained popular and it's been showing way.

898
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:02,360
They do the animal actor show at midnight at Halloween Horror Night.

899
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,720
All the animals are very tired.

900
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,320
Or it's creepier animal.

901
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,320
It's like nocturnal animals.

902
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,320
Oh, yeah. Sure.

903
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:17,480
And they don't shoe the like the the little poodle in the bra way immediately.

904
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,360
Like, that's the whole that's the beginning of the show.

905
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,240
All the animals are in human underwear.

906
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,240
Yeah. Yeah.

907
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,720
That's a that's a sultry show.

908
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,160
They just unleash raccoons into the audience.

909
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:35,360
The Rube Goldberg esque opening where like one hits and one lever and one does this is all.

910
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:39,520
Yeah. Ends with a barrage of raccoons aimed directly at the audience.

911
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,040
Somewhere in the Rube Goldberg, a bunch of like there's a confetti,

912
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,600
but you don't realize that the confetti is pepperoni and it's like a spice.

913
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,920
Pepperoni and it's like a sprayed all over the audience.

914
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,160
And like right when you realize it, when you pick one up, hey, is this oh, God.

915
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,920
And then raccoons are coming at you.

916
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,360
Yeah. Too late to do anything about it.

917
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:01,840
Too late.

918
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,240
So, yeah, they're not be careful of the midnight show, folks.

919
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,560
It feels like these are going to be here for long.

920
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,880
Like it feels like there's so much momentum.

921
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,240
Why would they get rid of these shows?

922
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,920
Yeah, I think so.

923
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,000
And they, you know, like like you said,

924
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
people still laugh at this stuff.

925
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,160
There's always new movies they can cross promote with.

926
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,160
We shove clips of Secret Life of Pets into it or, you know,

927
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,240
they actually have the animals from recent movies.

928
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,720
Now, this is I've always had this question about it.

929
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,120
When they say it's Lassie, when they say it's Beethoven,

930
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:44,720
whatever they were doing at the time, is this just the I certainly took it on faith as a kid,

931
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,440
that that is the real sitting Lassie.

932
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,440
I knew it wasn't the one from the 50s opening that I'd see on syndicated TV,

933
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,440
but it's the current owner of the Lassie throne.

934
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:57,680
Yeah.

935
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,520
But like, is it just we're just talking the same breed, right?

936
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,040
There's no especially in Florida.

937
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,560
They're not flying Lassie down.

938
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,240
I would think so.

939
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,880
I mean, the one I watched the one from a couple of years ago,

940
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,280
and they said this was the bird from Ace Ventura.

941
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,600
But that's not.

942
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,800
And I was like, is that?

943
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:14,960
Yeah.

944
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,600
And then they also that the hawk from 310 to Yuma.

945
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,920
The hawk from 310 to Yuma is a great.

946
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,080
Yeah.

947
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,280
Let's talk about some of these credits.

948
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,080
So yeah, we're just I'm just trying to figure out.

949
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:24,240
Yeah.

950
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,760
Are they just saying it's the same type of animal and they're just lying to us?

951
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,800
Oh, I see what you're saying.

952
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,360
Well, I think some birds can live very long.

953
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:31,760
Sure.

954
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,320
Yes, that's true.

955
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,760
So maybe it is.

956
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,160
Yeah.

957
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:34,880
But there was one.

958
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:40,560
Oh, another one was the pug, Rick the Pug from Men in Black.

959
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,040
Right.

960
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,440
Men in Black 2 is what they say specifically.

961
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,760
They they isn't that character in more than one or maybe?

962
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,240
Yeah, yeah.

963
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,680
Oh, it gets an expanded.

964
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,440
All of them into all of them.

965
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:49,940
Yeah.

966
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,360
So but that can't that's a that's from 2002.

967
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:57,120
There's no way that there's no way that it would be the same.

968
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:03,200
But there's no way that in 2021, the walkout music would still be nod your head.

969
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,320
Black suits coming.

970
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,000
And yet what is the walkout to but nod your head?

971
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,040
Black suits is coming.

972
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:09,680
That's great.

973
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,520
Jason getting pumped up.

974
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,240
I love it.

975
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:19,440
I watch one of them where the pug first off, if you stick a little bit black suit on any pug,

976
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,360
it's going to look like Frank from Men in Black.

977
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,960
And I think that's what I saw.

978
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:29,440
Like they did kind of the mad cap ending where like the animals are crisscrossing the stage

979
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,560
and the trainer comes out with just a pug in a black suit running by her who jumps up on

980
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,360
the one platform.

981
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,080
She goes, thanks for coming and just doesn't really acknowledge him.

982
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:42,080
And he just like hops up and sort of like smiles at the crowd.

983
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,680
I don't know why I'm here.

984
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,180
Yeah.

985
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,520
But are you happy?

986
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,320
I ran from backstage to my little mark here.

987
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,760
Very impressive.

988
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,440
Some of these dogs hitting their marks.

989
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,000
Very good.

990
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,520
Better than some actors I've met better than me.

991
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:02,400
Honestly, just hire Jason to do a dialogue scene, but don't make him run into it.

992
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,240
You're going to shoot right past that camera.

993
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,720
They'll put a piece of tape down and then take it away if they do a wide shot.

994
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,320
And I don't know if I'm supposed to go back.

995
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:10,480
Yeah.

996
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,240
If the tape is gone, how do you know where to go?

997
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,040
I don't think, you know, communication.

998
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,200
Well, if you're going to put, then if you put Jason in something, do it like in this show

999
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,160
where like there's a little stack of rocks and that's where you.

1000
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,640
Little stack of rocks, pepperoni behind the camera or to the side of the camera.

1001
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,000
So I don't look at the camera.

1002
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,480
Pepperoni and a dollar bill.

1003
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,200
That's all Jason needs to work.

1004
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,200
They tried to do a 20, but it kept fading from excitement.

1005
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,280
The swelling salts.

1006
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,560
When you see the 20, you see the 20 again and you pass out.

1007
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,760
Lost our sunlight.

1008
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,080
Shit.

1009
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,200
Lower money this next time.

1010
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,960
Real quick, can I just shout out some of my favorite animal actors?

1011
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,360
Please.

1012
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,240
Yeah, great.

1013
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,160
Crystal the monkey who was in Dr. Doolittle and Night at the Museum.

1014
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,920
Do you remember that?

1015
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,040
And all the other roles.

1016
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:05,840
Well, community.

1017
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,520
This is what I like.

1018
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,400
I like animal actors that have multiple roles.

1019
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1020
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,080
You know what I mean?

1021
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,600
Like Bart the bear.

1022
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,320
Yes, exactly.

1023
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,360
Bear from the edge.

1024
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,160
Moose was the dog on Frasier, but also in My Dog Skip.

1025
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:21,760
Oh really?

1026
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,320
These weren't necessarily in the show.

1027
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,040
You're saying these are just.

1028
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,000
No, these are just in general.

1029
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,280
I just, this is just a fun.

1030
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,480
Esteemed animal actor who some of which could have been in the show.

1031
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,240
I feel like they got prominent.

1032
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:32,720
Right.

1033
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,680
What else are they going to do?

1034
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,560
I didn't realize this.

1035
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,520
And again, they could be lying to me and who knows.

1036
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,320
The dog common on Full House was also Air Bud.

1037
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:41,280
What?

1038
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,480
Wow.

1039
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,600
That makes sense.

1040
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,160
Yeah.

1041
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,120
Wow.

1042
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,400
That really blew my mind.

1043
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,040
Geez, that's a major, major talent.

1044
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,960
Bart the bear is your, you just said Bart, right?

1045
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:51,360
Yeah.

1046
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,280
Was in White Fang and The Edge.

1047
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:54,720
Wow.

1048
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,840
And a movie called The Bear.

1049
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:56,720
I don't even know what that is.

1050
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,320
But there was Bart.

1051
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:03,280
If it was that bear in the, have I ever talked about the Boy Meets World episode I love where they

1052
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,040
there's escalating pranks happening between the gang.

1053
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,320
I don't think so.

1054
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,920
And then like there's, you know, there's one that's a little crazy, but then

1055
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,000
I believe it's Corrie and Topanga and maybe Sean.

1056
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,680
And they realize that they're stuck to their chairs in a college lecture hall.

1057
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,880
And like, okay, so they glued us to our chairs, some prank.

1058
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:28,080
And then suddenly a bear shows up at the door and they launch out of their chair.

1059
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,000
Oh, they get, they get honey dripped on them as well.

1060
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,640
Okay.

1061
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,320
So they know that bears come in right form.

1062
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,920
So they, they jump out of their chairs.

1063
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,960
Some of their clothes rip off and they dive out the window.

1064
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,400
And then there's a little sitcom spin around transition and it cuts to Mr.

1065
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,840
Feeny and extreme closeup.

1066
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,440
And he says, a bear.

1067
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,520
It's my favorite moment of him, William Daniels.

1068
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,020
Uh-huh.

1069
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,880
But then I'm running the math of like.

1070
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,520
Is it Bart?

1071
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,840
I don't, it could have, I don't know.

1072
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,640
It could have been Bart.

1073
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,640
I just mainly am like, these college students,

1074
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:07,520
like got the college to agree to have a bear walking through the hall for a prank.

1075
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,240
Yeah.

1076
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,520
That's pretty intense.

1077
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,020
Yeah.

1078
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,760
They meant, they meant business with that prank.

1079
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,760
You got to find out who, which bear that was.

1080
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,320
But I wanted to also reveal here, there was also Bart the bear too.

1081
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,680
Whoa.

1082
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,640
Like Gallagher.

1083
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,360
Yeah, Gallagher.

1084
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:23,280
Yeah. His brother that stole his name and worked as well.

1085
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:23,920
Fooling people.

1086
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,800
He was in game of Thrones.

1087
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,880
He was in, we bought a zoo.

1088
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,680
Wow.

1089
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,640
Into the wild.

1090
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,160
Yeah.

1091
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,560
So, so we bought a zoo would have been a big, because universal gets these kind of like,

1092
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:41,040
when they get a big multi-animal movie and they can plug it in this show, you can tell.

1093
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:41,520
Right.

1094
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,960
It's a ground swell of excitement.

1095
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,960
It's new blood into the animal actor show.

1096
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,280
They would have like freaked out if that was their movie, but I don't think it was.

1097
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,000
They're still banging the drum for Evan Almighty.

1098
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,200
Yes.

1099
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:53,840
So many of these.

1100
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,640
Yes, a lot of them.

1101
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,760
Evan Almighty.

1102
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:01,760
I know it was a Noah's Ark story, but man, those birds, they got a lot of the Evan Almighty birds.

1103
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,280
You know, it's, it's hard, you know, when you're working actor and it's like,

1104
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,840
you know, my last credit was over 10 years ago.

1105
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:11,840
So you're just like, you're hanging your hat on like, yeah, I was in Evan Almighty.

1106
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,400
Like.

1107
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,960
This bird doesn't even look like their head shot anymore.

1108
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,240
Some reason.

1109
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,800
Bailey was, Bailey, the dog was in a dog's purpose.

1110
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,480
Oh, wow.

1111
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,880
It's really weird that they mentioned a dog's purpose.

1112
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,040
Cause that was on the universal lot that they got in trouble for making a dog.

1113
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,240
Swim.

1114
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,280
Yeah.

1115
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:31,840
Yeah.

1116
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,680
I don't remember the specifics of it.

1117
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:33,920
Yeah.

1118
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:41,920
I can't remember exactly on the lot, but there was a thing where the dog was fine,

1119
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,000
but it was like, oh, you did a lot of takes in a row of that dog swimming.

1120
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,680
Like, are you, that dog was in that water.

1121
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,000
For two.

1122
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,520
There was like a damning video.

1123
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:49,760
I think.

1124
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,320
Yeah.

1125
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,840
So yeah, I don't, I feel like maybe you leave a dog's purpose out

1126
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,200
or people that excited about a dog's purpose anyway.

1127
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:57,840
I don't know.

1128
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,400
Does America still have a dog's purpose fever?

1129
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,120
I don't know.

1130
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,560
Was there a sequel?

1131
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,320
Like, wasn't there a second one in the series?

1132
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:08,400
Was that the one where even though was that the Clint Eastwood racing movie?

1133
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:08,880
What was it?

1134
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,440
Clint Eastwood.

1135
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,000
You know what I'm talking about?

1136
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,840
Where the dog was like, I love to race.

1137
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,640
And I know it was Kevin Costner.

1138
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,320
Oh, what movie was that?

1139
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,680
We talked about it on the show before.

1140
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,480
Was it?

1141
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,560
Kevin Costner is a dog who loves to race.

1142
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,840
That's all I know about it.

1143
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,360
I think he's the dog.

1144
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,440
Voice Costner.

1145
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,680
I'm Googling Kevin Costner racing dog movie and seeing what pops up here.

1146
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,280
Is that one weird talking cat?

1147
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,720
The art nine lives.

1148
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,320
Nine lives is the space.

1149
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:35,680
That's the space.

1150
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,440
So yeah, yeah, screwed that.

1151
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,240
We said his name.

1152
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,120
He's going to appear.

1153
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,560
The art of racing in the rain is the movie I'm thinking of.

1154
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,160
And Kevin Costner is the voice of the dog Enzo.

1155
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,360
And I don't think this is related to a dog's purpose, but in my mind it is.

1156
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,200
The art of raising the rain is Kevin Costner talking, you know.

1157
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,400
Similar.

1158
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,120
Similar.

1159
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,480
Dog era movie.

1160
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,520
Would you consider, let me ask this real quick question.

1161
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:03,920
Would you consider Montecore of Ziegfried and Roy fame an animal actor?

1162
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:06,480
Yes, right?

1163
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,360
Absolutely.

1164
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,400
Yeah, Montecore was the troublemaker.

1165
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,240
Yeah, I think so.

1166
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:12,560
Yeah.

1167
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:16,320
But all the tigers in the show were actors, like they were doing.

1168
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,640
It's kind of an animal actor.

1169
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,960
Ziegfried and Roy is kind of an animal actor's thing.

1170
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,600
It's just a different context for the animals performing.

1171
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,000
Yeah.

1172
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,400
So they were jumping through little hoops and stuff and fire.

1173
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,120
I don't know, fire?

1174
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,080
I've never seen the show.

1175
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,240
I have an answer.

1176
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,320
A dog's purpose 2017.

1177
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,320
A dog's journey 2019.

1178
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:34,960
Ah, okay.

1179
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:35,520
There you go.

1180
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,320
Sequel.

1181
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,800
These are based on very successful books, by the way.

1182
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,120
Right.

1183
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,960
That's why they happen.

1184
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:41,200
Right.

1185
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,960
We're going to GAD in one of them, right?

1186
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,000
Oh, you got GAD.

1187
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,160
Oh, you got GAD.

1188
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,040
Dennis Quaid, Mark Helgenberger.

1189
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,160
Betty Gilpin, you know?

1190
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:57,040
That's a name I said on the tram a lot because we passed by the CSI stages.

1191
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:01,680
So I remember when I was kind of getting warmed up and doing my very enunciative tour guide

1192
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:06,240
voice that a good way to make sure that the pipes were polished was early in the tour.

1193
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,240
You get to say, and Marg Helgenberger.

1194
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,720
I always knew, do I have it or not?

1195
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,400
How much gusto can I put into this?

1196
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,200
Helgenberger.

1197
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:18,640
Did you ever really like, what would you remember ever toying with

1198
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,240
the lowest energy you could be?

1199
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,880
Just to see what would happen?

1200
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,400
Oh, not even as an experiment.

1201
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,080
You just had to some days.

1202
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:26,800
Oh, okay, sure.

1203
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,680
If it was hot as hell.

1204
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,520
Yeah, no, I knew how minimal I could do.

1205
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,400
How can I do it with almost all clips, saying almost nothing,

1206
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,000
acknowledging the crowd very little?

1207
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,920
I wonder if I ever, did I ever read a book while I was doing it?

1208
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,680
Certainly texts, dude.

1209
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,600
Probably, but I bet everybody texts.

1210
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,280
You could have booted up the Kindle app.

1211
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,080
It might have been too early on for that technology.

1212
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,800
I should have, I could read people part of a story.

1213
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,040
I'd switch things up.

1214
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:55,280
Sure.

1215
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,800
You don't expect to hear chapter 13 of a Franzen book.

1216
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,120
Yeah.

1217
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:03,200
When you're out looking at the Spartacus square.

1218
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:04,160
Right.

1219
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,640
Uh-oh, stay in your seats, folks.

1220
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,000
It's one of his famous uncomfortable sex scenes coming up.

1221
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,240
I'm glad you knew something about Franzen.

1222
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,360
I have no more to say.

1223
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,760
As if there's no further that reference could go with me.

1224
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:23,120
I know they're very thick and I somehow acquired a copy of the Corrections years ago,

1225
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,560
and it is sat in a box.

1226
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:30,800
But I know a lot of facts about his weird dealings and stuff.

1227
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:38,240
Oh man, there's some sort of crazy first person essay written by, I believe, his partner.

1228
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,040
I don't know if it's his long-time girlfriend or wife.

1229
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,640
And I don't know if they're still together, but she doesn't need,

1230
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:49,120
names her journey as a writer, and then she meets someone who's a little more successful

1231
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,800
and very slowly through it.

1232
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,720
I didn't know who it was about and I was like, oh my God, is it Franzen?

1233
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,600
And very quickly, like, oh my God, it's Franzen.

1234
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,720
Whoa, whoa.

1235
00:55:58,720 --> 00:55:59,680
It's a thrilling.

1236
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:04,640
A little secret, like the primary colors of, you know who it's about.

1237
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:11,600
Well, just the timing and the like, and then his book was selected for Oprah's Book Club,

1238
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,200
but he didn't want that.

1239
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,560
And it's like, oh no.

1240
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:16,560
What am I saying?

1241
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,040
Why am I going with primary colors such an old reference?

1242
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,120
It's really the, it's the all too well.

1243
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,400
This is the Taylor Swift.

1244
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,040
We know who all too well is about.

1245
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,600
Rat bastard.

1246
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,560
We know.

1247
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,840
We don't have to say it, but we know.

1248
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,040
I won't even, I won't say his name.

1249
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:33,600
I won't do it.

1250
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,120
I have everybody did it.

1251
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:35,920
Taylor.

1252
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:36,400
Yeah.

1253
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,840
Yeah, the Hawk from 310 to Yuma is a great credit.

1254
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:45,440
Obviously the Evan Almighty credit comes up a number of times.

1255
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,480
Dog's purpose.

1256
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:47,680
Lady Hawk.

1257
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,440
Do we very much miss Lady Hawk?

1258
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,720
That's a old movie.

1259
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,280
I'm like, I guess I know what Lady Hawk is.

1260
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,400
Oh, Safari.

1261
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,280
The one Hawk Safari from the Mummy Returns.

1262
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,240
So Hawks must live a long time.

1263
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:03,760
I guess.

1264
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,080
Yeah.

1265
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,000
How let me look up Hawk lifespan.

1266
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,320
Wingspan.

1267
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,600
What are all spans?

1268
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,240
Hawk life.

1269
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,480
The average Hawk's average lifespan is in the wild.

1270
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,840
In the wild is 20 years.

1271
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,040
So that's not crazy.

1272
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,400
That's not that long.

1273
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:16,640
Yeah.

1274
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,240
But Mummy Returns is too old.

1275
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:19,280
Yeah.

1276
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:20,880
2002.

1277
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:21,280
Yeah.

1278
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,760
To still be working in a 2019.

1279
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,160
Elderly Hawk is being forced to work.

1280
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,760
Maybe I'm reconsidering what we were talking about earlier.

1281
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,120
Let them retire.

1282
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,600
Enjoy its autumn years.

1283
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:38,240
Elderly animal actors really should be the name of the show if that's accurate.

1284
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,680
Dex from a Blue Buffalo commercial.

1285
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,680
When they name the commercials, that's very funny.

1286
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:50,880
Iris and Olympus the Owls who were in Harry Potter, Bones, CSI, and a Geico commercial.

1287
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,080
Oh, yes.

1288
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:53,440
Yeah.

1289
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,000
It's a big sequence in it now.

1290
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:03,920
The last time I saw it in person where they take these giant owls around and just sort of like,

1291
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:04,960
they don't really do tricks.

1292
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,240
You just get to see them.

1293
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,880
You feel the Harry Potter nature of them, the majestic nature of them,

1294
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,800
and the music is very magical.

1295
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,520
And they just are sort of walked up and down the aisles.

1296
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,840
Yes, they're very regal looking owls.

1297
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:18,340
Yeah.

1298
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:26,400
Is this maybe a good time to tell the story of my most recent visits to this show?

1299
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:26,900
Please.

1300
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,480
It involves the hawks and the owls.

1301
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,840
The story really is not just about seeing the show.

1302
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:40,400
It's about taking my son to Universal for the first time.

1303
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,640
So I had him solo.

1304
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,200
Mom was away.

1305
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,760
So I wanted to like, let's fill up the morning.

1306
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,800
Let's do something big and fun.

1307
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,920
I've been wanting to take him up there and we did it.

1308
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,720
Pretty successful in general.

1309
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,600
Now I've done it, but this was I think back in August.

1310
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,800
And now I've done it a number of times.

1311
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:03,520
He really likes it.

1312
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:10,320
He loves all the big Universal attractions like the hundred empty chairs that he can push around.

1313
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,520
Unthemed umbrellas that he can point at.

1314
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,040
The unthemed stanchions in the corner of Harry Potter land

1315
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,160
that don't even like look like an owl or something.

1316
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:26,960
It's just regular like line separators that he just pushes around.

1317
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,080
I could not tear him away from those.

1318
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,840
He's just ignoring like,

1319
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,080
like look, it's like snowcapped.

1320
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:38,160
So there's a train over that doesn't care shaking the line dividers around.

1321
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,240
I've really enjoyed.

1322
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,920
I've liked taking him up there due to the lack of pressure.

1323
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:50,240
I like Universal, but it's not like Disney where like, all right, now son, this is important.

1324
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,040
This is Walt's.

1325
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,640
This is you must appreciate this.

1326
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:53,600
There's the universal.

1327
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,240
All better off.

1328
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:55,360
Yes.

1329
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:55,760
Yeah.

1330
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,400
All right.

1331
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,280
Look at the lamp.

1332
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,240
Look at the, I know you don't know the word lamp,

1333
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:05,040
but you're going to stare at that thing because that represents the soul of the finest man.

1334
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,000
Whoever was right.

1335
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,500
Exactly.

1336
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,280
So anyways, yeah, you could, you know, it's a little sillier.

1337
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,320
I've, I've had a lot of fun.

1338
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,320
And so I'm feeling really good.

1339
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:22,080
Like I, all right, this is a successful just dad and son trip up to a theme park.

1340
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,440
We're having a blast.

1341
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,760
I got to, I got to get lunch in him soon, but not yet.

1342
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:28,960
Well, you know what's starting.

1343
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,200
Look what I'm passing by right now is the, is the animal actor show.

1344
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:38,720
And at this point in time, one of his favorite activities was pointing at a bird and saying,

1345
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:45,360
but so I figured, well, this is a great opportunity to point at birds and say, but this happens.

1346
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,680
There's a number of opportunities in the show.

1347
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:54,320
So I'm like, well, this is a little riskier because at this point in time, he's 16 months old,

1348
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,120
I think.

1349
01:00:55,120 --> 01:01:00,880
And just any parents out there picture your current 16 month old or what your child is

1350
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,320
like at 16 month old.

1351
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:06,960
These sitting still abilities are probably not the greatest, but I think, you know what?

1352
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,720
Any amount of this that he gets through is great.

1353
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,720
It's, it's, it's fine.

1354
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:17,360
And we'll just go in the back so that we can leave quietly and it won't be a problem

1355
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:21,520
because you sort of like enter through like under the bleachers basically,

1356
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,360
but we can just run out the back and it'll be fine.

1357
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,880
So we sit in the very back row.

1358
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:27,200
He's having fun.

1359
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,080
He's dancing around.

1360
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,040
He's ready for the show.

1361
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:36,400
And then the show is about to begin and a universal employee very kindly points down

1362
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,640
to the bottom, just like down there.

1363
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,880
And I'm like, oh yeah, wait, I guess so.

1364
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,200
There are a lot of much closer seats.

1365
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,720
I shouldn't make him be in the back.

1366
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,040
He should be up where the action is.

1367
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:47,680
That's great.

1368
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:48,640
So we get down there.

1369
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,600
I take all my stuff.

1370
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,480
I get him down there.

1371
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:55,200
And then I realized, well, I have lost the escape ability, but that's okay.

1372
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,520
This should still be fine.

1373
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,200
I think he's probably in a great mood.

1374
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,400
This is going to go fine.

1375
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:05,600
Then there is an announcement like the show is about to begin announcement

1376
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:11,200
where they say for the safety and comfort of our performers and our animals,

1377
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,880
please remain seated at all times.

1378
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:13,520
Uh-oh.

1379
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,960
And I think, well, it shouldn't be a problem.

1380
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,800
He's excited to be here.

1381
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:26,080
I can't imagine that he will start acting up at the precise second that the big

1382
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:31,120
dangerous birds start flying right over the audience.

1383
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,640
He took him.

1384
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,600
The hawk took him.

1385
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,320
That's the story.

1386
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:40,560
I know I've told recent stories about my son, but they're all made up.

1387
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:43,440
He's been in the land of the hawks for God knows how long.

1388
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:45,840
He took the hawk, took him.

1389
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:50,080
Then you stood up and another hawk took you to follow and chase after him.

1390
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:50,560
Get him.

1391
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:51,760
That's why you want to do.

1392
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:52,640
You know where he lives.

1393
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,560
You bastards work together.

1394
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:55,840
Take me to the mother nest.

1395
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:02,800
So after a thrilling sky adventure, uh, no, it's just, you know, hey, look, I think I just

1396
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:03,920
spoiled what the story is.

1397
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,200
He's enjoying the basic things.

1398
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,320
Those little animal hijinks, you know, the animals are getting ready for the show.

1399
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,040
That's all great.

1400
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,240
He kind of points at stuff.

1401
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,680
But then bird stuff starts happening.

1402
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:18,720
And of course, for the first time ever, he doesn't care about birds at the precise moment

1403
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,040
that there are exciting birds in front of him.

1404
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,120
He's chosen now to not give a shit.

1405
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:26,720
He is much more interested in the bleachers and the bleachers that are next to me that

1406
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,840
are the aisle.

1407
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:32,240
And he's really starts running around reaching for other people's bags, yelling, blah, blah,

1408
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:32,800
blah.

1409
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:38,640
I'm very lucky, by the way, that when he freaks out, it's not like whiny, but like he's really

1410
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:39,760
cute even in that.

1411
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,120
But this is still the wrong thing to be doing.

1412
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:48,400
And then I haven't seen the show recently, so I don't know about the owl parade.

1413
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:48,960
I don't know.

1414
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,160
Oh, yeah, the Harry Potter.

1415
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,680
He's in the aisles and then they're about to do a march.

1416
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:55,920
Oh, yeah.

1417
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,880
Precession where they, by the way, are wearing the like falconers gloves.

1418
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:01,680
Right.

1419
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:07,120
So you know that these birds mean business if they have the gloves that you can't get

1420
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:10,080
through because the talons could do some damage.

1421
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:14,560
So I'm like, I gotta yank him out of the aisles in time for the owl parade.

1422
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,400
And still he's just making a big fuss.

1423
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,240
I'm like, this is not good for the owls.

1424
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:22,800
This is not good for him or me or for the audience or the host up there.

1425
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,400
This is going to start getting real bad.

1426
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,280
I got to get out of here.

1427
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,160
It's time to get out of here.

1428
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,480
So I grab my bag and kind of like yank him.

1429
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:34,480
And then I run down the nearest aisle that I can see and I immediately see a big rope.

1430
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:40,640
And then right after that, the employee who kindly pointed to my new seat in the front

1431
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:44,080
goes, no, no, no, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1432
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,200
Don't stop.

1433
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,720
And I'm just frozen and like, oh, okay.

1434
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:52,720
And am I going to start getting the attention of the rest of the audience?

1435
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:53,760
Hopefully not.

1436
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,040
And I'm just like, what do I do?

1437
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:56,000
Do I go back to my seat?

1438
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Just I'm just pointing frantically.

1439
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,080
Where can I go then?

1440
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:03,440
And then she's like with a deep annoyed breath.

1441
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,120
Under, okay, go.

1442
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:08,960
And somebody lifts the rope for me and I kind of barrel out of there.

1443
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,240
I'm like, so now I'm moving with a pace because I'm stressed out.

1444
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,320
Because we've gotten attention.

1445
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,840
He's going a little crazy.

1446
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,360
So I'm like going fast.

1447
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,760
And then another person stops me.

1448
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,280
So now we're like under where the bleachers and where the audience enters.

1449
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:26,640
And with the speed that I'm moving, somebody puts out their hand.

1450
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:27,840
No, stop.

1451
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,600
And I freeze in my tracks.

1452
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:33,200
And then like I'm given just hand signals that are like calm.

1453
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,560
We have to be calm.

1454
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:41,200
And that is because I am now in this little confined dark space under the bleachers that are

1455
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:47,200
my baby and me and the Universal employee and the owls.

1456
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:52,400
We are now right in front of the owls.

1457
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,160
It is only us.

1458
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,800
So we are staring right at the owls.

1459
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:01,280
Now he cares about the owls because they're very close to him.

1460
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:02,960
Now he's pointing.

1461
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:03,920
Yes, very good.

1462
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,200
Those are owls.

1463
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:11,280
I am also noticing because I'm holding him and the owls are also kind of being held on the arms that

1464
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,800
with their relatively similar heights, the owls are much bigger than my son.

1465
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:17,680
Oh, man.

1466
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,200
It's like way more.

1467
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,480
And there's two of them.

1468
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,480
This fight does not go well.

1469
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,760
Oh, my God.

1470
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,680
If a fight goes down.

1471
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,920
So everybody just tries to convey calm.

1472
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:32,320
And it's this little like, you know, they're waiting for another animal thing to happen

1473
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:37,520
and keep the owls calm so that they can be returned to the wherever the owls go.

1474
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:38,720
So keep them calm.

1475
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,920
Babies should not be charging right into the owls.

1476
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,440
But everybody gets on the same page.

1477
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,640
We're all looking at each other.

1478
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:48,880
I apologize profusely as much as I can, as quietly as I can.

1479
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,080
And we're all just waiting.

1480
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:50,640
Tension.

1481
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,160
Please, owls, don't hurt my son.

1482
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,520
Okay, you may go.

1483
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:54,240
The owls go.

1484
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,800
And now I sprint the hell out of there.

1485
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:57,600
Oh, my God.

1486
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,400
I don't want to be seen at the animal actor stage again.

1487
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:07,520
And dad's trip to the theme park, which is supposed to be triumphant, now almost ended

1488
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,480
in an owl turf war.

1489
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:10,880
Wow.

1490
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,680
I got a couple of things.

1491
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:21,600
First off, when your son is older, he is at like 12 or 13 going to go like, hey, I had

1492
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:22,320
a dream last.

1493
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,720
Did I meet an owl when I was younger?

1494
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,560
Not that it will be negative.

1495
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:30,800
It'll just resurface like the image of like waving to a couple owls.

1496
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:35,920
Did I do a seven minutes in heaven with two owls bigger than me?

1497
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:38,480
That's nice.

1498
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:42,880
As long as it's not like a Val Kilmer Batman Forever deleted scene with a giant bat and

1499
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,720
he's got like a giant owl in his mind.

1500
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:48,880
And then he decides to take on the form of the owl to fight crime.

1501
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:49,200
Oh, jeez.

1502
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,440
This is his origin story to become owl man.

1503
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:51,840
Yeah.

1504
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,680
We're perfectly set up.

1505
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:54,000
Yeah.

1506
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:55,040
All right.

1507
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:59,360
So if all right listeners, if you're hearing this in the year, well, he's got to be old

1508
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:04,960
enough to, you know, so in the 2030s sometime, probably a suited owl guy running through

1509
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,880
the shadows could be my son.

1510
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:07,280
Yeah.

1511
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:12,560
The other thing is that this must be what they have hit upon as like this is the best

1512
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:19,200
option to take the owls up the aisles back here for a second and then back to do they

1513
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,480
live in a rookery?

1514
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:24,080
Is that where else I, but confidence makes me think yes.

1515
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:31,760
So it, uh, cause you can't be the first parent who's like, I gotta get, I gotta get this

1516
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:32,560
one out of here.

1517
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,200
Yeah.

1518
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,360
I think this must happen every show, right?

1519
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,240
Every show.

1520
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:42,720
And I feel like there, there should be an announcement of like, okay, there's one moment.

1521
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:43,920
Okay.

1522
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,840
Don't move during this one part.

1523
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:48,000
The other times the door is here.

1524
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,960
If you have to scoot away, the door is here and just watch for flying birds.

1525
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:57,440
That's a, I mean, it happens in theaters where it's easy, like in whatever Muppet Vision or,

1526
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:02,640
or anything like a fill our magic, whether they say, or the captain, you know,

1527
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,800
theater where they're like, yeah, this is where you leave.

1528
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:05,760
Yeah.

1529
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:08,240
If some, if you need to leave before the show's over.

1530
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:11,600
And obviously that's a simple, that's a smaller place, but yeah, they really should,

1531
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:17,520
if there's a chance that you're going to run headfirst into owls, you should know.

1532
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:22,160
Well, boy, do I appreciate you putting any of the blame, not on me

1533
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:28,560
for this situation where suddenly my son is face to face with owls that could demolish.

1534
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,960
You didn't run on stage.

1535
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,560
No, and you didn't get caught in the moment where the audience gets like

1536
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:39,840
buzzed by like a flock of birds fly still probably like six feet, 10 feet above the audience.

1537
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:40,640
Oh, that's right.

1538
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:40,880
Yeah.

1539
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,160
You get that little surprise.

1540
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:42,400
Yeah.

1541
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:43,760
They all fly out of that little door.

1542
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:45,600
Yeah.

1543
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,080
Yeah.

1544
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:50,240
I'm just like, you know, it, I felt very like

1545
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:57,840
Homer taking care of Maggie for the weekend, loses Maggie, his Maggie under the house.

1546
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:06,800
I just very happy to like have mom return home and the son was not reclaimed by,

1547
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,960
taken by owls in the one day that I had him.

1548
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,240
How was your day, Scott?

1549
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:13,040
No owls.

1550
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:14,560
No owls, Aaron.

1551
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:15,120
Oh, fine.

1552
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:15,600
Owl-less.

1553
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,560
Owl-less.

1554
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,240
Is how the day went for me.

1555
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:18,960
What did you say?

1556
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:20,800
Alice?

1557
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:21,920
Yes.

1558
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:22,400
Alice.

1559
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:22,720
Alice.

1560
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,000
Normal owl business.

1561
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:25,760
Oh, he's questions.

1562
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,240
Who, who, why are you keep saying who stops?

1563
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,200
Stop grilling me.

1564
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:29,760
What is this?

1565
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,440
Is this what, what band is this?

1566
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,240
Owl City?

1567
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,840
You never listened to Owl City.

1568
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,400
Three licks, but the world may never know.

1569
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,440
When can we do this?

1570
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:40,800
When can we do this again?

1571
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:41,520
When can we do this again?

1572
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,280
This guy, why are you doing this again?

1573
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:44,960
Who wants to know?

1574
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,120
I've always liked this band.

1575
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:47,920
What are you talking about?

1576
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:48,880
Pick out any bet.

1577
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:49,520
Fireflies.

1578
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:52,640
Always eat Tootsie Pops and listen to Owl City.

1579
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:55,520
So I made it.

1580
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:56,880
Narrow escape.

1581
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,720
You know, I, will I go to the show again?

1582
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:01,200
Sure.

1583
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,600
But today of a more appropriate age.

1584
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:04,100
Yeah.

1585
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:05,300
Right.

1586
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:07,440
Wow.

1587
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:08,640
I'm still fond of it.

1588
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,680
I'm fond of the gay.

1589
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:13,840
I, if we missed anything in terms of like the little, the little fun moments.

1590
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:14,640
Yeah.

1591
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,880
I mean, we, I mean, we talked a little bit about it.

1592
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:22,080
There's a whole long, like kind of sort of ramp up to the show where they're doing a lot of.

1593
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,400
Like a show busy things, like so and so to the set or.

1594
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:26,880
Oh yeah.

1595
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,000
Get in a wardrobe.

1596
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:28,500
Yeah.

1597
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,480
Like all the Hollywood stuff you would imagine you hear on a set.

1598
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:36,240
And then it's like, oh, someone sows mocha latte.

1599
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:40,560
And then it's like an animal walks around and that's like a fun little bit they do.

1600
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,160
They're not, you're not going to see a dog or a cat with like a latte in their hand.

1601
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:50,240
But yeah, there's a whole, it feels long also.

1602
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,240
It feels like it's three to five minutes.

1603
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:52,800
Maybe it's not.

1604
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:58,960
Well, a it's a very long time to be listening to a techno remix of the pink panther theme.

1605
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,240
That's also a good point as well.

1606
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,440
Makes time stretch.

1607
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:02,480
Is that the same?

1608
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:03,600
Is that always been the case?

1609
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:04,720
I don't know.

1610
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:05,220
I.

1611
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:08,000
The five year ago one was the pink panther theme.

1612
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:08,560
Yeah.

1613
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:09,120
Oh really?

1614
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:09,620
Yeah.

1615
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,120
I saw that a year ago.

1616
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,680
So I don't know at least it.

1617
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,280
When did techno get popular early 90s?

1618
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:20,080
The universe probably adopted it circa 2007.

1619
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:22,880
Yeah.

1620
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,640
But yeah, that makes it last a while.

1621
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:31,520
And then also this is true of the Jason, you described the sort of like everything goes haywire

1622
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:32,160
at the end.

1623
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:37,200
I think in any video you pull up, you end up with the awkward moment where the animals not quite

1624
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:38,800
doing the thing.

1625
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,880
And maybe they like, I was watching a little dog try to like grab a little

1626
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:47,200
sign connector rope with its mouth.

1627
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:47,440
Yeah.

1628
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:50,000
I think like seven attempts were made.

1629
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Still stays eager, keeps trying.

1630
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:52,800
I'm going to get it.

1631
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,240
Audience starts to cheer him up.

1632
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:58,080
But I like what that does for the pace where you're just like, boy, this is,

1633
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,480
this is basically a sequence that has five actions.

1634
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:02,880
Yeah.

1635
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,960
It is taking seven minutes.

1636
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:05,520
Yeah.

1637
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,040
And I have seen it work.

1638
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:11,840
I have seen every work, every, you know, every animal hit their mark perfectly.

1639
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:16,960
But yes, a lot of recording ones by chance are the ones where it's like, oh, he missed.

1640
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,960
The handlers are you see an arm like, no, go back.

1641
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:21,440
Do it again.

1642
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,160
Do it again.

1643
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:22,660
It's okay.

1644
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:23,760
Yeah.

1645
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:27,440
It's it's not the most precise thing.

1646
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:33,120
I was going to say this is really where like it would be, it would benefit them to have

1647
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,640
puppets and stuff.

1648
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,520
I guess maybe I'm getting ahead of myself here is that I really just want all the animals

1649
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,600
replaced by puppets and like robots.

1650
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:41,840
I don't want real animals anymore.

1651
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,240
But you know, if we're going to do the bit with Hollywood and animals and stuff, I want

1652
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:51,120
like a puppet drinking a latte and a cat puppet drinking a latte.

1653
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:54,080
I think that's better for me, at least as a viewer.

1654
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:58,480
I'll go back to that show a lot more if it's a puppet drinking coffee.

1655
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,320
A realistic puppet.

1656
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,440
Not even realistic.

1657
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:02,000
Oh, really?

1658
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:02,320
Okay.

1659
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:02,960
It could be.

1660
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:03,440
Oh, geez.

1661
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,040
And this is really easy for them.

1662
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:05,760
Yeah.

1663
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,960
But I get it why an average person might want to see this.

1664
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,160
But yeah, that's that's my personal preference.

1665
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:16,640
But yeah, the start of the show is there's a lot of fun showbiz nonsense.

1666
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:17,120
But yes.

1667
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,600
What do you think the hit rate is?

1668
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:24,800
50 percent perform performing like well or performing the task at hand?

1669
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:25,840
Oh, I think a little higher.

1670
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,440
I mean, 75 shows a day.

1671
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,640
Yeah, maybe 75.

1672
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:29,120
Yeah.

1673
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:29,680
Okay.

1674
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:32,640
But it's but they boy time has done a number to that.

1675
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:38,160
See like a little Hollywood in jokes because, you know, you end up with like like, all right.

1676
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,240
Where's the where's a champ?

1677
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:42,240
Mr. Ratner's waiting for you.

1678
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:49,920
Your costar, Mr. Spacey, has been on set for 15 minutes.

1679
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:54,640
There are moments I mentioned evergreen moments earlier.

1680
01:14:55,680 --> 01:15:01,200
The the one bit where they bring out two dogs and the one does the obstacle course again,

1681
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:04,400
hit rate not 100 percent pretty high 75 80.

1682
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:08,800
But then the other dog is trained to make it look like he's peeing on the kid volunteer.

1683
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:09,680
Right.

1684
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,040
That always gets a big laugh.

1685
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:11,920
Oh, yeah.

1686
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:12,560
Right.

1687
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:12,960
Yes.

1688
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:13,280
Yes.

1689
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:13,520
Yes.

1690
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,560
But the dog doesn't pee.

1691
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,640
He doesn't pee.

1692
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:19,600
No, he is trained to lift a leg.

1693
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,360
The universal symbol.

1694
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,880
That has to have gone wrong once.

1695
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:23,360
Surely.

1696
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:25,840
The leg is up.

1697
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:29,200
Like the dog is going to want to do its favorite once in a while.

1698
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,560
If it's got a full bladder.

1699
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:35,360
Also, the one who completes the obstacle course surely has at times gotten so excited.

1700
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,400
It just starts peeing.

1701
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,000
You never know with dogs.

1702
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,600
Sometimes they're scared.

1703
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,720
Sometimes they're cold.

1704
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:43,680
Sometimes they have to go.

1705
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:46,320
And sometimes they're just excited and don't know what else to do.

1706
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,680
There's 300 people looking at me.

1707
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:49,520
I got to show them something.

1708
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,120
Check this out, gang.

1709
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:51,920
Look what I can do.

1710
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:53,760
I have one talent.

1711
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,800
Yeah, that's again, that's where puppets would come in handy.

1712
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,320
Then the pee blast could be purposefully.

1713
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:01,600
Massive.

1714
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,400
And not pee.

1715
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,280
Something safe.

1716
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:03,780
Water.

1717
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:09,440
It can be that wine that the beetles drink and get back, which looks like urine.

1718
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:10,800
Yes, that's true.

1719
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,840
It either looks really urinary or really bright green.

1720
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,040
I'm always like, what is this?

1721
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:17,840
Beetle wine.

1722
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,040
Yeah, the beetle wine I do.

1723
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:19,920
Yeah, it looks gross.

1724
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:26,880
I mean, they're drinking just 24-7, smoking 24-7 from morning to night.

1725
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:31,600
I feel very validated as a white wine aficionado that white wine

1726
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,960
fuels some of the finest work of the century.

1727
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:35,440
Right.

1728
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,400
So yeah, no.

1729
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,200
What's grosser, beetle wine or dog piss?

1730
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,280
Dog piss.

1731
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:47,760
So yeah, you could blast off, get a full hose of that wine and.

1732
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:48,320
Beetle.

1733
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,120
Shoot it at a kid.

1734
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:55,120
Yeah, so yeah, there's got to be videos of the dog peeing at the animal actor show.

1735
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:55,920
Yeah.

1736
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:01,280
If anyone knows of a video of this show going awry in a fun, safe way.

1737
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:06,880
Oh, well, there was video from a couple of years ago where one of the dogs in kind of a mad,

1738
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:10,640
real mad cap way, one of the dogs got out.

1739
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:11,200
Oh, got it.

1740
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:11,680
Yeah, yeah.

1741
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:17,520
It was running around by the horror makeup show and they were like, come here, come here.

1742
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:20,480
And like guests are trying to help and it looks very cute.

1743
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,160
I mean, it looks very harmless.

1744
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,680
That's fun for everyone.

1745
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:28,720
Oh, you know, here's a little like dog hijinks thing.

1746
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:33,920
We were talking about this a while back, but the, you know, the bit where they bring up a kid,

1747
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:37,040
will you whisper an item of clothing to the dog?

1748
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:37,760
He'll go get it.

1749
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,480
And it ends up in the in the bra and the towel and all that.

1750
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:45,600
Now there's like, I'm going to learn this when I was a tour guide, because I think there was,

1751
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,840
there was a day where like, well, go do everything at Universal.

1752
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:51,920
And I think along, we saw the show and then people were asking like, well, how does this

1753
01:17:51,920 --> 01:18:00,640
thing work? Because the aim is that the dog, the first time I'm going to ruin the magic trick,

1754
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:10,480
by the way, magic exposed, the dog goes and gets a hat no matter what the kid says.

1755
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:17,920
And sometimes now they, if they can play it off as a mistake, if the dog doesn't get the hat,

1756
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,440
but the aim is that the kid does say hat.

1757
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:26,240
And then the dog goes and gets a hat and everybody's like, wow, he actually, this works.

1758
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:32,320
Like the dog understood and got a hat and somebody asked, well, how does, how do they do that?

1759
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,480
And like, well, it's a little like, it's, it's a cue.

1760
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,800
If you listen closely, they say hat.

1761
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:42,160
It's like the last thing that said so that the kid thinks a little kid training situation.

1762
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:42,720
Oh, right.

1763
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,600
So they say hat because they've heard hat.

1764
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:48,000
And I was curious how this worked in practice.

1765
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:55,120
And in the video that I watched of a recent show, the trainer is explaining all this like,

1766
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:59,440
okay, we've got our dog here and you can say any item of clothing, hats, shirts,

1767
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:02,800
shoes, pants, hats, anything. Hats is twice.

1768
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:08,320
That's a real Dale Carnegie, how to make friends and influence people like mind trick.

1769
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,720
Like you got your brain.

1770
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:16,320
If you want to show someone you're listening, you repeat like a handful of the words they

1771
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,360
just said to you.

1772
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:22,240
Like you, if they ask a question, you put a bunch of the question in your answer.

1773
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,800
And then they go like, oh, wow, he really took the initiative.

1774
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,960
Like he's just said words back at me.

1775
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:29,200
Yeah.

1776
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:33,680
But that's why if a, if they, if a trainer worked there and really needed to make it work,

1777
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:39,600
then they could just like anything you want, hat, shirt, hat, hoodie, hat, glasses, hat,

1778
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:44,800
watch, hat, hat, hat, hat, shoe, hat, any item of clothing.

1779
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,880
If you run with that, the audience is going to laugh.

1780
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,680
If you say a nut hat enough times.

1781
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:50,400
Oh, that's true.

1782
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,520
That's a good joke.

1783
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,240
Maybe that's what I would do if I was there.

1784
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:55,840
That's how I feel like I had my tour guide jokes.

1785
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,920
I was trying to like let you in a little bit.

1786
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:02,080
Like, you know, like I'm all exposed to the artifice, but not too much.

1787
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:06,880
It's still too much because the show, the outline of the show has a lot of madcap stuff.

1788
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,160
They have stuff going wrong.

1789
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:14,160
They've built themselves some wiggle room of like, well, if the animal really does like lie down

1790
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:15,440
and just want to go to sleep.

1791
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:16,560
I mean, there's play dead.

1792
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:19,760
There's a, there's a big play dead sequence sometimes.

1793
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:20,240
Oh yeah.

1794
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:20,560
Yeah.

1795
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:21,060
Uh-huh.

1796
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,600
Is it that the trainer keeps like looking up?

1797
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:27,520
Like do they, they're pretending they think the animal actually died,

1798
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:31,440
but then it's like the animal keeps moving right when like in panting and they're like,

1799
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,840
no lie down when the person, oh, okay.

1800
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:34,240
Okay.

1801
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:34,400
Yeah.

1802
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,040
That's cute.

1803
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,080
This is pretty cute.

1804
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:40,640
This is one of the cuter things I think in a theme park setting.

1805
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:42,000
Yeah.

1806
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,760
It's a little bit, bits that work for everybody except for 16 month olds.

1807
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,240
This is what I'm.

1808
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:46,400
Yeah.

1809
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:50,480
Well, you could have when he's, when he's older, you could actually have him sabotage it.

1810
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:53,040
You can get them up there and tell them like, don't say hat.

1811
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,200
Whatever they say, say like shoes.

1812
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:56,000
Say brah.

1813
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,280
Say brah.

1814
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,400
Oh, that would be the way.

1815
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:58,880
Yes.

1816
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,760
You ruin the show.

1817
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:00,800
You'd wreck the show.

1818
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,160
The whole thing would get shut down.

1819
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:04,160
They'd like shut the thing down immediately.

1820
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:08,400
And don't, and you have to yell it because if it's just a whisper, then the audience won't know.

1821
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,280
But like, maybe even don't even let the question get out.

1822
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:15,440
Just get up there and scream the word brah as soon as you get on stage.

1823
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:17,920
All right.

1824
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:18,720
Well, we'll have fun.

1825
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:21,520
This is a future father, son, fun outing.

1826
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,120
But I don't know what else about this thing.

1827
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:27,920
I mean, it's, it's, it's a bless.

1828
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,040
It's a lot of fun.

1829
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:32,960
We haven't mentioned the, when it was used,

1830
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,000
it was a real working production studio location.

1831
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,560
Yes.

1832
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:36,960
Yes.

1833
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:37,600
That's right.

1834
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:44,240
So the Florida one, you know, the set's a little nondescript in Hollywood.

1835
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:48,160
It's like kind of, you know, beige and flats and soundstage walls.

1836
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:52,000
And they, I really like how this, this to me was always like, oh, this is

1837
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,240
a way that they've, they've plused up everything.

1838
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:57,360
Like they've gone more epic in Orlando.

1839
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:01,840
That the set still is this amazing jungle ruins environment.

1840
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:08,400
And so these big statues and a lagoon and a water slide that animals could go down.

1841
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,720
But I assume you're talking about that.

1842
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:18,640
This was the set for several years worth of the ABC show, animal or animals, animals,

1843
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:21,040
funniest America's funniest people.

1844
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:21,440
Yes.

1845
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:22,000
Correct.

1846
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,480
Which I remember very excitedly watching.

1847
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:27,840
I feel like before Sunday night was Simpson's night for me to watch.

1848
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:31,120
I loved America's funniest home videos.

1849
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,840
And then when you have a spin-off America's funniest people

1850
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,120
hosted by fellow full house star, Dave Cool.

1851
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:37,680
Yay.

1852
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:39,680
Another full house or yes.

1853
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:44,480
As a little kid, I had been to universal Florida, saw the show.

1854
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,800
So when he would stand in there, I was like, that's the animal actor.

1855
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:50,080
Stay like, I definitely, I was looking at the time.

1856
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,840
Once upon a time in Hollywood, Jif.

1857
01:22:55,520 --> 01:23:00,560
I was like, did I see the show and then got excited when I went to see the theme park?

1858
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,600
And I was like, oh no, the timing would have worked out that I definitely would have been

1859
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:09,440
to the theme park first and then saw the seasons where they shot on this stage.

1860
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,640
Cause they switched it later.

1861
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:12,000
It was the second half.

1862
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,680
It was the Tawny Cotain era.

1863
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:16,720
Cause there was another host, another coast first.

1864
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:21,040
They let go and then like, we're coming back big for season three or whatever.

1865
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,960
It's Orlando and it's Tawny.

1866
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:24,640
All new.

1867
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:26,720
This is all new America's funniest people.

1868
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:26,960
Yeah.

1869
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:28,000
Yeah.

1870
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,880
And I, I mean, I bought all hook line and sinker as a kid that like Orlando,

1871
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:37,040
some stuff was filmed in Hollywood, but a lot of stuff is filmed in Orlando.

1872
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:40,560
You know, our studios, Florida and MGM studios, you know?

1873
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:40,960
Yeah.

1874
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:41,280
Yeah.

1875
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:44,080
They really needed to create the impression in the early 90s.

1876
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,440
A lot's happening here.

1877
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:49,200
You're going to want it as if, if you're in the business, you're going to want to come shoot

1878
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:52,880
here and if you're not, you're going to want to come see how we shoot stuff.

1879
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:53,120
Yeah.

1880
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:56,800
It worked on children and it drove a production member,

1881
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,480
production managers and second assistant directors out of their minds.

1882
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:02,480
Cause they're like, we have to stop shooting.

1883
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,040
Monsoon like rains have come in.

1884
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,040
Oh yeah.

1885
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:07,760
Right.

1886
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:08,000
Yeah.

1887
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,120
That's not, it doesn't work for many months of the year.

1888
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:11,440
Yeah.

1889
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:13,120
Weird show.

1890
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,520
I'm shocked that you liked the show.

1891
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,280
The show is like such a faint memory.

1892
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,560
Did you watch this Mike?

1893
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,280
The Cool Yet?

1894
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:19,520
Yeah.

1895
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:20,000
Yeah.

1896
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:20,400
Oh yeah.

1897
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,160
I was pretty famous than I remember.

1898
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:22,880
I mean, obviously it was.

1899
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,760
I have a pretty strong memory of it.

1900
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:26,000
Yeah.

1901
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,880
I would watch it a lot and I liked that it was, I may have liked it better than

1902
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,080
America's Funny Stomped videos.

1903
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:32,400
Oh really?

1904
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:36,240
Cause the idea of you don't know was like, it's still hosts doing a lot of like

1905
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:44,080
little, little pantry bits and then like, uh, watch this and then, and then it's not home videos,

1906
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:47,840
but rather like it's not people falling down or getting hurt or whatever.

1907
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:52,800
It's people like purposefully being funny, doing a weird, like making a weird face.

1908
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:57,200
Or, uh, uh, talent that they're a butt has or something.

1909
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:57,520
Right.

1910
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:02,000
When you describe it like that, it sounds worse than the original and it probably is

1911
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:09,200
cause it, you do, I used to feel like, I feel like maybe it was my mom or some parent who was like,

1912
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,600
I don't like the videos where they're trying.

1913
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:12,800
I like the accidents.

1914
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:16,400
That's a smart distinction to make.

1915
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:20,320
Not that it was like accidents, like somebody got really hurt, but oh, you know, a funny thing.

1916
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:26,080
You slipped a little bit or whatever and not the like on purpose videos seem always seemed less funny

1917
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,000
than the accidents.

1918
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,960
Um, but my memory, maybe it was just cause I liked Coolie.

1919
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,760
I was into Dave Coolie at the time.

1920
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:34,480
It helps.

1921
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:35,920
He gets to do his voices.

1922
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:36,640
Yeah.

1923
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,000
Little in little bits.

1924
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,520
He's the voice of the Jackalope.

1925
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:39,920
Of course.

1926
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:43,440
We're Jackalope with his stars in a lot of odd little short films.

1927
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:49,840
Um, I guess I liked this, but it's an ultimate like, boy, do we like this cause it was on

1928
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:50,880
or did we?

1929
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:53,440
Well, how many things did we just like cause it was on?

1930
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,320
Yeah, of course.

1931
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,280
Maybe all.

1932
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:55,920
So many things.

1933
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:56,480
Is the answer.

1934
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:57,200
Yeah.

1935
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:57,920
Yeah.

1936
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:02,960
But I, you know, I found an episode of it and just the sweeping shot of Universal Florida,

1937
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:06,880
helicopter shots, searchlights are going, the original gate.

1938
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:10,000
I think I liked the original gate more than the current one.

1939
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:10,400
Oh, right.

1940
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,840
A little more beige.

1941
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,320
I like the severe white one.

1942
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:14,640
Yeah.

1943
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:18,960
Ernie Anderson, Paul Thomas Anderson's dad, the voice of ABC and the announcer of the show.

1944
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:19,680
It's just like.

1945
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:20,640
Goularty.

1946
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:21,280
Goularty.

1947
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:22,240
Yeah.

1948
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:26,640
Kids horror shows, the host Goularty or local, maybe not kids, local.

1949
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:26,880
Yeah.

1950
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:27,120
Yeah.

1951
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:27,520
Local.

1952
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:29,200
Yeah.

1953
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,000
That's magic.

1954
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,480
That's that park overheads of that park.

1955
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:38,240
It's there is a standup special that I found in some obscure streaming service,

1956
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:45,040
a standup special of Michael Winslow, the voiceover or the voice effects guy from police academy.

1957
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:45,520
Yeah.

1958
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,600
That is shot maybe with the same footage, helicopter footage,

1959
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:54,720
and it's still it gets to me every time I'm like, boy, oh, they're taking me to the.

1960
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,120
Yeah.

1961
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:58,400
Ultimate place, the ultimate destination for fun.

1962
01:26:58,400 --> 01:26:59,200
Yeah.

1963
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:02,560
I wonder if you could, there's no way to ever really do a study.

1964
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:07,600
Oh, I guess you could do with kids, like show them a clip of like that type of like marketing

1965
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:12,640
and then show them like whatever how universal markets now and see,

1966
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:16,080
because it does feel like there's something extra exciting about that era of marketing,

1967
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:18,480
but also I was sick seven.

1968
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,840
So it's impossible to really know if it landed harder.

1969
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:25,520
This is the most dynamic way you could market a theme park to people,

1970
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,120
or it just felt like that at the time.

1971
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:28,160
Yeah.

1972
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:33,680
I mean, I, if I flip over to Nickelodeon nowadays, some of the marketing is still pretty similar.

1973
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:35,360
Some of the aesthetics, some of the marketing.

1974
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:35,920
Sure.

1975
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:37,440
Pretty commercials are kids.

1976
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:38,800
Commercials are very similar.

1977
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,720
His commercials are shockingly.

1978
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:43,200
Yeah. And cereal commercials and.

1979
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:43,440
Yeah.

1980
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,200
Yeah. So I don't know.

1981
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:51,680
I can't unsee the universal, the promo that was on the bag to the future three VHS,

1982
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:55,040
where it's just the word universal going by slowly.

1983
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:58,560
And in every letter, there's a different universal ride.

1984
01:27:58,560 --> 01:27:59,120
Yes.

1985
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:04,160
It's still like, like I have, I get like a pit in my stomach when I see it, like,

1986
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:08,560
yeah, I'm afraid of what's down there, but I know I have to go tackle it.

1987
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,440
Um, does that make sense?

1988
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,240
Like, I don't know.

1989
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:14,960
It was that, it just felt like, are you up for the challenge?

1990
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:20,080
Can you, this is this, it's the Jetsons in the letter a, can you,

1991
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:23,120
you think you can handle being there in person?

1992
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:28,640
This is like, you're going to be wise brave how going like, I have to rise to the challenge.

1993
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:30,080
I got to get that kid.

1994
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:33,920
I got to scoop up that weekly little kid.

1995
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,360
He ever comes back here.

1996
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:43,440
I'm remembering this face as opposed to any other 16 month olds face because I will eat the face.

1997
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:47,360
This is, I was just going to say, this is a, this is you in the retirement home,

1998
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:51,920
like kind of your brain is just slowly going, but like they just have like a loop,

1999
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,480
this tape on a loop to calm me down.

2000
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:59,520
When you get started getting riled up and they're like, just wheel, Mr.

2001
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:04,480
Gardner into the room and play him the universal tape from 1991.

2002
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:05,600
That is what I want.

2003
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,840
Yeah. I'll get my wishes out right now.

2004
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:11,440
I want that slow universal word going by and then the logo forming.

2005
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:17,680
And I want the general cinemas space candy opening.

2006
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:18,000
Yeah.

2007
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,560
Just those, those things over and over again.

2008
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:24,960
I'll be a very happy, mentally collapsing man.

2009
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:25,840
He's freaking out.

2010
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:26,800
In a couple of years.

2011
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:27,520
So I don't know.

2012
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:33,760
I thought you were going a much darker direction where the, the orderly would like the Irishman

2013
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,920
would be like, all those rides are gone.

2014
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:38,320
Scott, no one cares.

2015
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:39,600
No one's going to hurt you.

2016
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:40,800
It's all gone.

2017
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,800
Yeah. No, that's like Coco.

2018
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:46,320
There's a, like, there's a land of the dead for rides.

2019
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:49,840
And as soon as the last person doesn't remember the ride anymore,

2020
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:53,280
but you can still go all of them and they're all made of bones,

2021
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:58,880
but they, as soon as the last person remembers the ride, they all go to dust.

2022
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:03,120
They're like, they're like force ghosts of the rides.

2023
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:07,120
So like you see like a blue outline of the back to the future ride.

2024
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,160
You're like wave at it.

2025
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:13,120
He waived all the rides and logos and like fonts,

2026
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:16,240
the fonts that are gone that are now in blue force ghost form.

2027
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,280
Oh, he's waving to the ghosts again.

2028
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,120
Mr. Gardner is waving to the ghosts again.

2029
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:26,000
He thinks he sees the battle for galactica attraction that was in the

2030
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,640
spot that the bags of the future had was built in.

2031
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:29,520
He's calm now though.

2032
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:30,000
Let him go.

2033
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,240
Let him believe last person on earth who knows.

2034
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:34,000
People know what it is.

2035
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,200
He's the last person who cares.

2036
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:39,040
That's the rules of the bone of bone universal studios.

2037
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,200
Well, it's peaceful though.

2038
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:45,680
Yeah.

2039
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:46,160
Yeah.

2040
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:50,000
But that's what, you know, we help people remember with this podcast.

2041
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,200
We collect these memories.

2042
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:55,600
We tell you about them so that we make you as crazy as us.

2043
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:59,360
Dave Cool Yay was there Tony contained something called a jackalope.

2044
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:07,280
You're doing an impression of anybody describing an episode of this podcast to their significant

2045
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:09,280
other who doesn't listen to the podcast.

2046
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:13,120
There's a lot of get back stuff.

2047
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:13,600
Yeah.

2048
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:14,880
A lot of get back.

2049
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:17,840
The Irishman came up at the very remember the Irishman.

2050
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:20,560
Are you on episode two of get back?

2051
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:21,840
I'm in the middle of two.

2052
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:22,160
Okay.

2053
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:22,960
So you've got the camp.

2054
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,240
You've seen the cameo already.

2055
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:25,440
Oh yes.

2056
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:25,680
Yeah.

2057
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:26,240
Yeah.

2058
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:26,560
Yeah.

2059
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,080
Is that a spoiler?

2060
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:28,560
Maybe.

2061
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,880
This thing that happened in 1969.

2062
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:35,520
That's similar to yeah, that's similar to like Nick Fury showing up or something in

2063
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,440
the middle of a Marvel movie at this point.

2064
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:37,600
Yeah.

2065
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:42,640
But if Nick Fury showed up, looked around the room and was like, I don't think I want to.

2066
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:43,120
Yeah.

2067
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:45,760
I don't think I'm on the same wavelength as these Avengers.

2068
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:48,720
Wait, are you wait, are we talking about the same cameo?

2069
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:50,480
There's many cameos and get back.

2070
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,160
I'm talking about the actor who wants.

2071
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,800
No, no, I'm talking about the musician.

2072
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:57,600
Um, I don't maybe I don't know.

2073
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:58,480
Oh, well, I don't know.

2074
01:31:58,480 --> 01:31:59,440
I don't want to ruin it.

2075
01:31:59,440 --> 01:31:59,940
Okay.

2076
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:06,240
A lot of work to hide the identity of like a member of the wrecking crew or Harry Nielsen

2077
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:07,040
or something.

2078
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,880
You don't just mean Billy Preston, do you?

2079
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:09,520
No, no.

2080
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:09,840
Okay.

2081
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:10,720
Well, I mean, I don't know.

2082
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:10,880
Yeah.

2083
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,080
I don't know who's coming.

2084
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:12,720
Oh, wow.

2085
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:13,280
Okay.

2086
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:14,160
Are they okay?

2087
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:14,960
All right, folks.

2088
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:18,000
Well, in that case, check out get back on Disney Plus.

2089
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:22,960
If you want to know who walks into the room, uh, the cigarette and wine laden room.

2090
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:26,880
Uh, but as for us, you survived podcast, the ride.

2091
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,880
Um, and that was a blast.

2092
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:31,280
Nice memories of decades old jokes.

2093
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:39,440
Um, if you are a fan of Dave Coulier, you might want to return next week, uh, for next

2094
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:40,480
week's episode.

2095
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:40,960
Yeah, right.

2096
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:42,880
It might factor in again.

2097
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:47,920
Uh, you can find us on the socials at podcast, the ride, uh, merch is available in our tea

2098
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:48,640
public store.

2099
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:49,760
Jason, what'd you want to say about the merch?

2100
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:51,600
You got to order if you're already for Christmas.

2101
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,440
Well, they're shipping delays everywhere.

2102
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,360
We already got like a message from tea public.

2103
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:58,240
Biden is the crates.

2104
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,680
He's not letting the shirts out.

2105
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:01,120
Our shirts are all on the crates.

2106
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,160
All on the crates.

2107
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:02,960
They're all on the crates.

2108
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:08,400
Ever given and, and Biden's, he just won't stop talking about how his dad knew how to

2109
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:11,600
drive a car, but it's like, you got to dock the ship, Joe.

2110
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:14,160
We need those shirts.

2111
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:14,640
Yeah.

2112
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:15,520
We're trying to get them out.

2113
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:16,720
Podcasts, the ride shirts.

2114
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:18,480
They're all in the shipping, but we got to move them.

2115
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:19,920
We got to get them into the mainland.

2116
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,640
Folks for Christmas.

2117
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:24,240
They need to be there for Christmas.

2118
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:24,960
Under the tree.

2119
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:26,800
Under the tree.

2120
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,640
We've got to give him Santa room to land.

2121
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:30,880
Get the planes out of the sky.

2122
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:31,840
Give him Santa.

2123
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,280
We're landing all the planes.

2124
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,640
Give Santa free air.

2125
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:36,640
Drop the shirt from the plane and the chimney.

2126
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:39,680
The shirts need to go on the chimney.

2127
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:44,960
Drop a launch queen and a no launch queen.

2128
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,240
You don't know who lives there.

2129
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:47,120
Get both shirts.

2130
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:48,720
Put on the chimney from the plane.

2131
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:49,520
Every type of shirt.

2132
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:51,440
Santa's going to throw the shirts in the chimney.

2133
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:52,160
Folks.

2134
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,280
Our friends around the world.

2135
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,800
The European vacation shirts.

2136
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,160
Our friends around the world.

2137
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:57,680
Remember the good saga.

2138
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:58,880
It was another saga.

2139
01:33:58,880 --> 01:33:59,680
So many great sagas.

2140
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:00,640
Shorter though.

2141
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:01,840
Another shorter.

2142
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:02,800
Shorter saga.

2143
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,960
They're doing Jamba Week, folks.

2144
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,560
We're going to talk about Zeke and Zeb.

2145

Tennessee and Corn Pop.

2146
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:13,760
All the country bears.

2147
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,560
Driving a car.

2148
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:15,360
They drove too.

2149
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:16,880

there's no Patreon subscription stuck at a port.

2167
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:50,240
That's right.

2168
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:50,800
Yes.

2169
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:51,280
Yeah.

2170
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,520
When it's in the cloud, no,

2171
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:55,200
there's nothing.

2172
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:55,840
Can stop.

2173
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:57,440
Yeah, the cloud is fine.

2174
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:59,600
There's no nothing holding the cloud back.

2175
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:00,560
That's right.

2176
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:01,200
Yeah.

2177
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:02,160
Give a gift.

2178
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:04,320
Give your loved one a gift from the cloud.

2179
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,640
Reach into the cloud and grab a handful of us.

2180
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:09,040
We got to move the stuff from the water into the cloud.

2181
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,160
Why aren't we using the water more?

2182
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:13,120
When we put it up in the cloud.

2183
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:16,480
The cloud should be over getting our goods and services.

2184
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,000
What's that do, folks?

2185
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,680
Omicron don't stop the cloud.

2186
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:21,200
It can't be done.

2187
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:22,640
Omicron can't reach up that high.

2188
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:26,640
Folks, the Lakitu.

2189
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,000
We need help from the Lakitu.

2190
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:32,960
All right.

2191
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:33,680
