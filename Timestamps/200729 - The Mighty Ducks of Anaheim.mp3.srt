1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Quack, quack, quack, quack.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If you guys want to do it with me, feel free.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,840
Or just-

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,000
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,600
Yeah, all right.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,440
Welcome to the Podcasts that Ride the Second Gate.

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,560
I'm Scott Gairdner joined by ducks who fly together,

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,960
Mike Carlson.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,800
Yes, I am here.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,720
I fly together often.

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,840
I mean, all the grammar was weird,

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,200
but all of us collectively, I mean.

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,400
Right, yes.

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,840
Jason Sheridan.

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,080
I am being lowered by wires into my usual podcasting chair

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,720
as I am every recording session.

18
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,040
We can't hear it, but in your headphones,

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,120
Carmina Barana is playing.

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,960
Oh yeah.

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,360
There's a lot of songs.

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,920
There's a lot of songs we could have playing right now.

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,200
I think they'll really pump the audience up.

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,040
There is a ton.

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,240
There's a ton of music in what we're here to talk about,

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,840
which might require a little bit of explanation

27
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,660
at this point.

28
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,800
I think it's time for us to do a now classic

29
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,600
Podcasts that Ride, not this, not that.

30
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,600
Because the topic today is the Mighty Ducks,

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,760
not the film franchise with Emilio Estevez,

32
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,760
including D2 and D3, which is not D23,

33
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,760
not related to D23.

34
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,480
Right, and not the upcoming Disney Plus show reboot

35
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,960
of the Mighty Ducks, which is coming.

36
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,800
There is that.

37
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,640
Not a joke.

38
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,480
Really?

39
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,320
Okay.

40
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,040
Emilio is back, is what I've heard.

41
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,600
As Gordon Bombay.

42
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,280
But he's like a burnout,

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,000
and he's like a man, a hermit in the woods.

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,920
This might be real spoilery stuff.

45
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,400
This might be inside information that is not out there.

46
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,920
He's like a guy that is disheveled,

47
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,080
and they don't know where he's been,

48
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,020
and then he comes back to act as sort of a mentor

49
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,040
for the new team.

50
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,920
Anyway, that's a little...

51
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,400
And this is not a full examination

52
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,680
of the animated Mighty Ducks.

53
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,960
Yes, that was my other not this, not that.

54
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,200
Correct, it is not Mighty Ducks, the animated series.

55
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,000
Confusingly, because we have talked about doing that a lot,

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,080
that for sure has come up before,

57
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,680
and it is on Disney Plus already.

58
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,480
And so later when you're searching Mighty Ducks

59
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,560
on Disney Plus, when you're deciding,

60
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,320
is it the movie or the animated show

61
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,640
or the TV show reboot of the movie,

62
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,600
there's gonna be so many results for Mighty Ducks eventually.

63
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,480
Right, and we will do it.

64
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes, I'm excited for that one,

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,920
although I might, after Father of the Pride,

66
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,340
I might institute the policy

67
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,260
that we do not watch any more entire series.

68
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,300
I agree. I think the gist might be fine.

69
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,980
I agree.

70
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,380
I do wanna watch a lot.

71
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,260
I mean, this is like a kids action cartoon.

72
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:05,260
I think the expectations are a little more managed

73
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,780
than Father of the Pride had some very big names

74
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,460
attached to it.

75
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,820
Well, hey, so did the Mighty Ducks show.

76
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,900
Jim Belushi was Wild Wing,

77
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,060
a character who will factor into today's episode.

78
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,100
I think I have that right.

79
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,060
I always, we've said it before,

80
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,380
the ones I always go to, Jim Belushi was a voice

81
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,460
and Dennis Franz was a voice.

82
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,300
Okay.

83
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,460
But a lot of other ones too.

84
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,500
I mean, I won't Google it now.

85
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,620
We'll save that for the, let's just do that immediately.

86
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,460
We'll wait on it.

87
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,660
Yeah, yeah.

88
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,700
But no, in fact, this episode is about

89
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,700
the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, the real life hockey team,

90
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,900
the NHL franchise, the Mighty Ducks,

91
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,900
which from its founding in 1993 up until 2005

92
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,500
was owned by the Walt Disney Company

93
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,980
and overseen, especially as it was starting up,

94
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,540
quite specifically by our hero, our king, Michael Eisner.

95
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,220
Yes, he very ambitious.

96
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,980
Some might say too ambitious

97
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,340
in all of the different pursuits.

98
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,820
I mean, yeah, this is the era where he's doing everything.

99
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,860
This is like post fallout of Euro Disney

100
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,900
and he's still taking the time to start a hockey team.

101
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,100
Yeah, it feels like you could have maybe got anything,

102
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,500
like if you wanted him to launch like a new candy,

103
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,100
a Disney candy bar, like he would have been like,

104
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,220
we're doing it, we're doing it.

105
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,500
Yeah, we're going with anything you threw at him.

106
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,860
Disneylicious.

107
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,740
Disneylicious.

108
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,420
Disney's like maybe Disney has their own space program,

109
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,260
their own like SpaceX, he would have approved it.

110
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,500
Like I think anything goes during this era.

111
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,340
He's wild.

112
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,060
Before this was like after Frank Wells had passed away,

113
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,900
but it's not.

114
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,020
As I was watching this, I was like,

115
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,980
well, this must be just off the leash, Michael off the leash,

116
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,300
but no, Wells is still alive at this point.

117
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,500
They're licking their wounds a little, yes, from Euro Disney.

118
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,100
This isn't, and it's not quite the era

119
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,180
where they're overexpanding with all the weird,

120
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,300
the kids club and Disney Quest.

121
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,540
It's like, this is like the box office

122
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,380
of everything's doing great.

123
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,380
They're like the end of the big animated movies are out.

124
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,340
This is right post Beauty and the Beast,

125
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,100
which will also factor in.

126
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,460
And of course it is post Emilio Estevez Mighty Ducks,

127
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,100
a surprise hit movie, a $10 million budget movie

128
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,420
that grossed $50 million.

129
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,660
It all seems so low today, but even though movies

130
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,380
make more money, I feel like they don't usually

131
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,340
what quintuple their budgets.

132
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,860
So that created pause within the company.

133
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,100
It was kind of a surprise phenomenon.

134
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,180
People thought hockey might be more popular.

135
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,380
There was a surge in popularity for hockey as well.

136
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,220
But I think-

137
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,940
Yeah, they were kind of riding wave,

138
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,940
also sort of post Wayne Gretzky coming to the LA Kings,

139
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,660
which will factor is very much a part of the story.

140
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,740
Really, really quick, I want to preview at the top,

141
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,860
just as sort of a tease for where this episode goes,

142
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:16,100
just to explain kind of why we're doing this now.

143
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,740
It is mainly, I propose this to you guys

144
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,340
because in my endless search for YouTube inanities,

145
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,380
I ended up stumbling into the very first Mighty Ducks game

146
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,620
in 1993, which had an opening ceremony

147
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,460
that is one of the greatest things I've ever seen.

148
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,980
I am so excited about this opening ceremony.

149
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,980
So that's really, in case the listener was wondering,

150
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,540
is this suddenly, do I have to read up on statistics?

151
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,060
Do I have to go learn some positions?

152
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:51,060
Do I have to go learn who Fourth Iceman is?

153
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,180
I don't think I could name a,

154
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,580
I know a guy, I know Goalie

155
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,460
and there's probably some tenders, but I don't know.

156
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,940
Do you know a hockey position?

157
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,740
Look, my dad's a big hockey fan.

158
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,380
It never took with me.

159
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,380
I like watching it,

160
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,620
but I am not, I don't know almost,

161
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,180
I know nothing about the actual sport.

162
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,020
I know there's fights.

163
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,460
I know there's a goalie.

164
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,860
I know there's something called icing.

165
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,660
Which was, maybe I don't know what icing is.

166
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,420
Even if I said icing out loud just now,

167
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,420
I went, oh shit, what is it?

168
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,340
Jason knows what icing is.

169
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,740
Is that where you-

170
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,100
We're talking treats, baby.

171
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,340
When you decorate a cake.

172
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:36,340
In hockey, is that where you come to a sudden stop

173
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,940
and you shoot ice?

174
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,100
That's what I thought, but I was embarrassed to ask.

175
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,500
When you shoot ice?

176
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,340
Well, like, you know-

177
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,540
If you stop, suddenly ice shoots up from the ground.

178
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,140
It's sort of, it's like insulting,

179
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,180
it's like if you sort of spit on somebody.

180
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,620
It's a little glove slap to the face.

181
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,460
Yeah.

182
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,900
I know a little hockey from,

183
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,140
I mean, the Philadelphia Flyers,

184
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,700
there was a brief period where they were known

185
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,620
as the Broad Street Bullies,

186
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,100
because they would play so dirty.

187
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,420
They were so vicious.

188
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:12,700
And I feel like I did a lot of like Boy Scout or school,

189
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,780
you know, group outings to the Philadelphia Phantoms,

190
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,020
the minor league team.

191
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,900
Like after they built a new stadium

192
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,940
for a bunch of Philadelphia teams,

193
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,020
really saw a lot of Philadelphia Phantoms,

194
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,740
Philadelphia Kicks games.

195
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,380
That was the, I don't know if that was the MLS team,

196
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,780
or like the minor league soccer team.

197
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,620
So those were my-

198
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,300
The Kicks was the name?

199
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,300
The Kicks was the soccer team, yeah.

200
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,140
Okay.

201
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,580
This is so embarrassing for all of us.

202
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,540
In ice hockey, icing is an infraction

203
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,020
when a player shoots the puck over the center red line

204
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,940
and the opposing team's red goal line, in that order,

205
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,540
and the puck remains untouched without scoring a goal.

206
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,380
Yeah, see, Jason, I think you and I,

207
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,220
you're in my knee jerk was so far off.

208
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,180
That's how little-

209
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,420
So if that was the definition of icing,

210
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,300
that's what Snoopy did to us at Knott's Berry Farm

211
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,060
when he was skating so close to us.

212
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,420
He was icing us by shooting ice at us from his skate.

213
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,860
It can be a fun thing.

214
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,460
It's a nice thing.

215
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,860
Yeah, he iced the front row.

216
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,700
Snoopy iced the front row.

217
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,620
Taking the Amelia Bedelia definition,

218
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,220
we were just like, oh, well, icing,

219
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,100
it's probably when they shoot ice at each other

220
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,020
to taunt each other.

221
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:29,020
When they shoot, shooting ice is my favorite part of that.

222
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,740
Shooting ice.

223
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,660
It's awesome, by the way,

224
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,020
they should add an element to the game where you shoot ice.

225
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,860
Yeah.

226
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,700
Like Iceman or Mr. Freeze.

227
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,260
Well, like, you know that really good arcade game

228
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,860
where it's a Pac-Man table hockey,

229
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,420
where there's the big pucks,

230
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,780
but then a bunch of little pucks all explode

231
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,900
and it's such a frenzy?

232
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,780
That's what they should do in hockey.

233
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,740
There should be a sudden release of like 300 blocks of ice

234
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,140
and then they have to deal with them

235
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,620
and scramble to do so.

236
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,300
Now I'm more interested in the game

237
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,460
now that you've said that.

238
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,380
I'm a little bit more invested.

239
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,380
I will say, I did love The Mighty Ducks, the movie.

240
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,420
I was way into the movie.

241
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,580
Me too, and D2, I think this is a franchise

242
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,700
where two may have topped one.

243
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,180
It seems like people are pretty fond of two,

244
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,500
especially with the young Keen and Thompson

245
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,980
and why do people like it?

246
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,140
Keenan has like a trick he does in it, I believe,

247
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,980
where he stands a puck up on its side.

248
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,180
The knuckle puck?

249
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,020
The knuckle puck, there it is.

250
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,780
Is that what I believe you're talking about?

251
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,020
Yes, now that we know, we do know,

252
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,420
we don't know real hockey things.

253
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,980
We know made up hockey things from this one Disney movie

254
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,980
because we also know, or I know, the flying V.

255
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,820
Yes. Yes.

256
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,780
There's a little attack that they do in the movie,

257
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,260
which I was looking up, is that a real hockey thing?

258
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,780
And all the results are like, no, you cannot do that.

259
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,620
That doesn't work.

260
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,220
You would never, just legally,

261
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,060
I think you couldn't arrange it that way

262
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,020
that it would crumble immediately.

263
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,900
We played floor hockey in gym, which I really liked.

264
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,380
Yeah, I liked floor hockey.

265
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,900
I thought that was really fun.

266
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,060
What's floor hockey?

267
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,940
It's basically you're just on the gym floor,

268
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,700
you have sticks and it's a ball instead of a puck

269
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,420
because you're not a nice.

270
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:24,420
I'm not sure that I have held a hockey stick in my life.

271
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,460
Really?

272
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,500
I don't believe, I can't think of any reason

273
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,500
that I would have.

274
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,460
Do you like Casey Jones from the Ninja Turtles?

275
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,580
Yes, but I never like dressed up as him or anything.

276
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,380
I never demanded to have a stick to play him.

277
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,220
Right.

278
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,060
Yeah.

279
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,220
I'm not, I'm also, I'm not trying to be all, you know,

280
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,740
would the sports ball match?

281
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,700
I'm not trying to be that guy either.

282
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,940
I just, I did like, I mean, I didn't end up taking to,

283
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,580
I mainly saw a lot of basketball and baseball growing up,

284
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,500
but I am very fond of the trips I took with my dad

285
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:02,020
to see the Kings and of course, to see the Mighty Ducks.

286
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,300
This was so exciting for me that I'm an LA kid

287
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,140
and I love Disneyland.

288
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,340
And now near Disneyland,

289
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,540
there's a very Disney-fied hockey team

290
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:18,020
that has like Disney type stuff and logos and characters

291
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,540
in the arena.

292
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,540
I mean, that was wonderful for me.

293
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,180
Yeah, I was excited when this was announced

294
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,220
because especially, and we'll talk about it, I'm sure,

295
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:32,220
the logo is basically the same Disney-style duck,

296
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,620
but it's a hockey mask.

297
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,980
And I recognize that Disney drawing

298
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,380
because it's like Darkwing Duck's beak,

299
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,020
but it's a hockey mask.

300
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,300
There's such a Darkwing Duck vibe to the team,

301
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,980
which I think Eisner may have been specifically chasing

302
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,300
because it was such a big hit at the moment.

303
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,300
Yes, I was reading some oral history of the team

304
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,420
and he's like, he mentions they're working on Darkwing Duck

305
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,500
at the same time and it's part, like, it's like,

306
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,100
I don't know if it's feeding into each other.

307
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,340
I don't know what phrase he used.

308
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:09,340
And not unrelated color schemes, I feel, like not the same,

309
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:15,060
but I like what Darkwing Duck is very purple.

310
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,220
It's very purple, which again,

311
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,420
I guess is the reason why I like it.

312
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,340
Yeah. My favorite color.

313
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,780
Yeah, I think I had a hat.

314
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,620
I think I had a Mighty Ducks hat

315
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,740
because I liked the movies and the logo.

316
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,460
I did not like D3.

317
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,500
That was very off to me.

318
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,300
Like, well, they already beat the world.

319
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,820
Who cares if they're going to college?

320
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,700
Yeah, I felt the same way.

321
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,540
Yeah, like they broadcasted lower stakes to me

322
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,100
just in the description of the film.

323
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,220
Yeah, they should have competed

324
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,940
against some aliens or something.

325
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,980
Oh, they should have space jammed it.

326
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,940
Yeah, that's good.

327
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,780
Yeah.

328
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,100
Emilio in like two scenes in that movie.

329
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,940
I want it more Emilio.

330
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,780
Emilio in whatever, 95 or 96 is a D3

331
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,460
where Emilio Estevez is in two scenes

332
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,380
and nobody gives a shit.

333
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,540
Now they'll make an entire TV series

334
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,500
where Emilio is in two scenes

335
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,380
and the whole internet will be like epic much,

336
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,180
ah, retrogasm.

337
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,900
I would love a late career,

338
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,940
Emilio Estevez, Renasa,

339
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,220
like we've gotten from Michael Keaton

340
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,580
and other actors like that

341
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,940
who come back in like insane melodrama roles.

342
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,180
Well, Keaton is back as Batman

343
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,780
and Estevez is back as Gordon Bombay.

344
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,460
So you're getting it.

345
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,620
Sure.

346
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,260
I'm not gonna be happy till he's back as Free Jack.

347
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,260
And I'm aware that the character's name is not Free Jack,

348
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,740
but I also don't know what the character's name is.

349
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,180
So why not?

350
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,260
Why couldn't it be Free Jack?

351
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,700
I think they should reanimate his corpse

352
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,620
in the Mission Impossible franchise.

353
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,820
Yeah. Oh, right.

354
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,060
Wait a minute, with the first one?

355
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,900
Yeah, in the first one.

356
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,020
In the first one, Emilio, this is another,

357
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,740
this is a moment and I don't know if people around my age

358
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,180
have the same impression.

359
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,820
It happened in this movie and it happened in Mars Attacks.

360
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,420
And a movie would kill an actor that I liked a lot,

361
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,580
that I expected to be in the whole movie.

362
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,900
My brain would go nuts.

363
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,540
In the Mission Impossible, he gets killed

364
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,820
within the first 20 minutes of the movie.

365
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,660
Because John Voight is-

366
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,740
Crushed by an elevator, right?

367
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,020
Well, yeah, and there's like spikes come out

368
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,420
and like stick him in the head.

369
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,180
And I was just like, what, Emilio Estevez?

370
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,500
I love him, he's dead.

371
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,660
He's Gordon Bombay.

372
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,180
Gordon Bombay. Gordon Bombay.

373
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,300
The, wait, who in Mars Attacks was your, who I was saying?

374
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,100
Michael J. Fox gets killed early in Mars Attacks.

375
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,140
And that just, I was like, I didn't know you could do that.

376
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,060
I didn't know that was possible to kill a beloved character

377
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,140
or a beloved actor, like right at the start of the movie.

378
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,660
Mars Attacks is very satisfying in like,

379
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,140
who ends up surviving.

380
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,500
It's such a motley crew.

381
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,100
It's like, and do not at all who you think you're gonna get

382
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,180
when the movie's over.

383
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,380
It's like Lucas Haas, Jim Brown, Tom Jones.

384
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,060
Some birds.

385
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:09,900
Oh yeah.

386
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,900
Who's that, is it Pam Greer who's the actress?

387
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,260
Pam Greer, he's in that movie, I believe.

388
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,500
Think she might make it.

389
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:24,740
I, anyway, so the Mighty Ducks movie

390
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,020
very much did spur this film.

391
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,900
And of course the team is named after the movie,

392
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,860
which I remember, you know, even as a kid

393
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,980
thinking most of this was cool,

394
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,100
there was still part of me even as like an eight year old

395
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,700
that thought that's pretty stupid.

396
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,060
It is a pretty, like they're gonna be stuck with that

397
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:44,900
for a while.

398
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,060
And in fact, the ducks who are still around today

399
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,900
and still playing in Anaheim today

400
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,740
are not the Mighty Ducks anymore.

401
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,060
And because I think everyone maybe felt that way.

402
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,300
It was a tad goofy.

403
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,180
What is the current name?

404
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,780
The current name is also goofy.

405
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,340
Isn't it just the Anaheim ducks?

406
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,540
Is it the Anaheim ducks?

407
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,860
Cause the angels are the Los Angeles angels of Anaheim.

408
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,900
God, what a clusterfuck.

409
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,980
So it's very odd.

410
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,900
And they almost lost the angels.

411
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,900
I think they secured them,

412
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,660
but they almost like made a play to like move somewhere else.

413
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,500
Oh, sure.

414
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,220
I feel like that's always happening.

415
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,540
And part of all of this happened,

416
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,140
this team happening was in the shuffle

417
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,500
that's perennially occurring

418
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,060
and trying to get teams to Orange County.

419
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,700
I mean, not to jump around too much, but the stadium.

420
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,980
So it was kind of, you know,

421
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,740
it's a little two-part cutesy Disney thing.

422
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,260
It's the Mighty Ducks or the team named after the movie.

423
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,660
And then the arena at the time was the pond.

424
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,820
And I'll still forever call it the pond.

425
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,860
If something had a goofy name when it opened,

426
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,620
I will always still call it that.

427
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:58,260
I got to go to what I believe is Roger Center in Toronto,

428
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,460
but I cannot not call it the sky dome.

429
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,860
When you have a cool name, don't,

430
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,340
these sponsored names get out of here.

431
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,180
They suck.

432
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:11,100
I mean, the place I went to as a kid was,

433
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,940
well, now it's called the Allstate Arena,

434
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,020
but it used to be called the Rosemont Horizon.

435
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,060
Whoa, I didn't know that one.

436
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,900
Yeah.

437
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,980
The Horizon's really cool.

438
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,660
Rosemont Horizon is so much better than Allstate Arena.

439
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,500
Yeah.

440
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,740
Although even this was not purely the pond

441
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,380
because they still had to do the sponsorship thing.

442
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,940
So it did become the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim,

443
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,740
which didn't not make sense

444
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,860
because it feels like Lake Arrowhead, which is a lake.

445
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,020
And then there's the pond,

446
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,220
but still sort of a bizarre clunky phrase.

447
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,740
Though the name of the pond,

448
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,020
apparently from Jane Eisner, Michael Eisner's wife.

449
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,940
Oh, I didn't see that.

450
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,760
Really?

451
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,600
Evidently, who we discovered also named the,

452
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,720
or thought of the campaign,

453
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,200
I'm going to Disney World after the Super Bowl.

454
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,040
So all the sports,

455
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,280
all the good sports ideas came from Jane Eisner.

456
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,120
If we can't-

457
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,080
That's why I'm never a great man.

458
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,600
If we can't get him on the show,

459
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,680
maybe we should try to get Jane.

460
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,640
Come up one of these.

461
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,480
We will infiltrate the family.

462
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,040
There's no way it doesn't happen.

463
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,760
It has to happen in some way.

464
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,840
Relatedly to this also, some of the impetus for,

465
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,880
it's that the movie came out

466
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,840
and did really just shockingly well.

467
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,120
So Eisner's gears are turning.

468
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,040
He also grew up as a big New York Islanders fan,

469
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,760
but well, and going along with that,

470
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,200
he raised his kids to like hockey very much.

471
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,320
So once again,

472
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,440
Brick Eisner leads to millions and millions of dollars

473
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,960
spent by the Walt Disney Company.

474
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,800
Right.

475
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,640
Just because they were in the high,

476
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,200
like a youth hockey league.

477
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,040
Yeah, yeah.

478
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,880
I guess so.

479
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,720
He used to follow that.

480
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,360
You'd obviously watch the games.

481
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,240
He learned all the positions.

482
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,240
Could we add up the full sum total of amount of money

483
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,960
spent in order to please Brick Eisner?

484
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,000
Is it one billion dollars?

485
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,520
I bet it's close.

486
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,120
And if you think about it,

487
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,400
because the ones we always attribute to him

488
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,880
are off of the Tony Baxter stories,

489
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,080
our star tours and Splash Mountain,

490
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,000
both of which now forthcoming,

491
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,080
there will be a new Splash Mountain of some kind.

492
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,960
So if you count him causing that one too,

493
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,920
and the second star tours,

494
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,400
that's all still in the,

495
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,680
you still have to build all that to Brick.

496
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,080
Right, yes.

497
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,840
And then they've built multiple versions of them

498
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,000
across the world.

499
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,520
All over the world.

500
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,440
The global footprint of Brick Eisner.

501
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,280
Right.

502
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,200
Who knows?

503
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,000
I mean, it sounds like he was so influential.

504
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,600
I'm sure there's stuff we haven't heard about.

505
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,800
So I think you'd have to double,

506
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,720
whatever your estimate is, double it.

507
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,560
Which is what?

508
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,360
I mean, like killing dictators discreetly

509
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,360
with Disney's secret, Disney's internal CIA operation.

510
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,520
DIA, another project Eisner started in 92

511
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,360
because it was Brick's idea.

512
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,800
Brick, where do you think we should start a coup?

513
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,240
Let me, how many points just to some country overseas?

514
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,920
Wherever Rambo is set.

515
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,240
Rambo is cool.

516
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,760
Okay, got it.

517
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,760
Let's go. Well, dad,

518
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,880
there's a lot of disarray since the Soviet Union collapse.

519
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,160
So there's always opportunity and chaos, father.

520
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,680
Okay.

521
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,080
You're a bright boy, Brick.

522
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,760
You'll be president someday.

523
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,080
Not far off.

524
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,040
So that's all the impetus for why at this strange height

525
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,640
and beginning of the Disney decade

526
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,880
that they decide to start a hockey team.

527
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,000
But there is another side to this story

528
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,840
and it involves a white collar criminal.

529
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,160
And I'm pretty excited to share all this.

530
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,200
This is all, I think Mike,

531
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,320
you read the same article as me,

532
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,400
this like oral history of the team starting,

533
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,280
which had a section about a guy named Bruce McNall.

534
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,840
Bruce McNall, I recognize it because I've watched

535
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,760
the 30 for 30 about Wayne Gretzky coming to play in LA.

536
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,320
And Bruce McNall was the owner of the Kings

537
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,160
who convinced Wayne Gretzky to leave Edmonton

538
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,160
and come to the LA Kings,

539
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,840
which transformed the entire NHL.

540
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,400
Like now you've got the greatest player in the world

541
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,960
playing in this very, you know,

542
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,880
in a hot, sexy location, like Hollywood, baby.

543
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,880
And so now what used to be kind of an afterthought,

544
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,800
LA as a hockey team now is like this event,

545
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,480
you gotta be there, Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn

546
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,320
are at the games all the time.

547
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,760
The Goldie Hawns of the world is what Mike Leisner said.

548
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,240
As Mike Leisner said, yes, that was very odd.

549
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,080
And you know, the Goldie Hawns of the world started appearing.

550
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,080
So if there's big movie stars, Hobnobin,

551
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,400
you know who's gotta be there

552
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,360
is the head of the Walt Disney Company, Mike Leisner.

553
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,120
So he is hanging out at these big dinners

554
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,560
that Bruce McNall is throwing before every game

555
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,080
that are teaming with movie stars.

556
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,520
And he starts getting really endeared

557
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,000
to this Bruce McNall guy.

558
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,200
And then there's a part of this oral history

559
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,280
that really jumped out at me,

560
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,920
which is kind of red flag number one about Bruce McNall.

561
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,920
Okay, so Eisner, quote Eisner.

562
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,400
He'd have this big dinner before the game.

563
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,280
It was a fun era with Gretzky and all that.

564
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,200
Also, it's kind of interesting that this is before

565
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,960
we were indicated about his sidestepping of legal issues,

566
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,720
but bigger than life, bigger than life.

567
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,920
He would tell me about his coin collecting

568
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,760
and his coin dealing, all of that exotic,

569
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,480
romantic taking coins from Italy.

570
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,560
Never thought that was appropriate, says Michael.

571
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,680
Coins from Italy.

572
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,640
Yes, and now I've Googled it,

573
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,800
but I'm not enough of a fraudster to understand.

574
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,400
But it does seem like this guy built his fortune

575
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,640
collecting rare foreign coins,

576
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,840
somehow getting them out of the countries

577
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,560
that they are supposed to be in,

578
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,960
and then convincing extremely rich people

579
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,480
that they are worth more than they are.

580
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,000
This is a precursor to Hobby Lobby buying Iraqi artifacts

581
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,640
and smuggling them into the country.

582
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,480
Oh wait, that's right.

583
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,840
To sell as patio decorations.

584
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,640
This is a really odd Indiana Jones-esque component

585
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,280
to how these corporate people make their money.

586
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,920
People were still doing artifact stealing?

587
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:39,800
If you scratch the history of any sports franchise

588
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:45,160
or stadium being built or airplane naming scheme,

589
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,720
you will immediately find criminals of all levels.

590
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,160
McCarran International Airport, the Vegas airport,

591
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,720
McCarran was like a crook.

592
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,360
Vegas pretty much is what it is because of Bugsy Seat.

593
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,640
So a lot of crooks in Vegas,

594
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,800
but there needs to be,

595
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:08,000
God knows what'll come out after that new LA stadium is done.

596
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,680
God knows what will be,

597
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,760
the oral histories of that will be.

598
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,000
It's always the craziest worst people.

599
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,680
We just had an episode where we talked about

600
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,920
this awful owner of the Redskins

601
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,960
who has this many reasons to not like the guy,

602
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,320
but the main one that he was anti-Mr. Six.

603
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,440
But the way that list unfurled,

604
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,040
and it's similar with this Bruce McNall guy,

605
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,000
it's so great, like, I guess just the level of like,

606
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
super villain you have to be to own a sports team,

607
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,640
which an amazing act of super villainy here.

608
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,320
This is one of my favorite Eisner things I've ever heard.

609
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,280
So Eisner's hanging out,

610
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,080
he's getting wined and dined by Bruce McNall.

611
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,560
Aren't you having fun at the LA Kings game?

612
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,440
The thrill of hockey ownership,

613
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,240
and this could all be yours.

614
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,680
Why Michael, you might not know,

615
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,960
they're building in Anaheim,

616
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,760
they're building an arena right there

617
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,680
in Disneyland's backyard, but there is no team to fill it.

618
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,120
Why don't you purchase a hockey team, Michael?

619
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,400
And he thinks about all the things we said already,

620
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,280
well, Mighty Ducks did well and my kids,

621
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,040
and you know what, that's not a bad idea,

622
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,240
but isn't there a lot of red tape to start a hockey team?

623
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,760
And Bruce McNall says, no, no, no,

624
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,520
all you have to do is just give money,

625
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,200
submit a plan to the chairman of the NHL Board of Governors,

626
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,560
who is me, Bruce McNall.

627
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:34,560
So, which all seems like a conflict of interest,

628
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,560
but anyway, like any, but his whole,

629
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,240
he did this not only to Michael Eisner,

630
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,160
but also to the head of Blockbuster,

631
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,920
who purchased a team maybe in Tampa,

632
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,920
I could be getting it wrong,

633
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,840
but they're like, there's this whole concerted effort

634
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,600
to get billionaires to spend corporate money

635
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,440
on hockey teams.

636
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,200
So Eisner's convinced, sounds good to me, let's do it.

637
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,200
And what he had to do was pay a $50 million expansion fee.

638
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,560
And apparently the way the rules of sports work

639
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,760
is that if you're trying to enter a marketplace

640
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,380
that already has a team,

641
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,720
you have to pay a bunch of money

642
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,720
to the team that exists already.

643
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,360
So Michael Eisner and the Walt Disney Company

644
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,440
cut a $25 million check to the preexisting team,

645
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,640
the LA Kings, and specifically straight to its owner,

646
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,360
Bruce McNall.

647
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,200
So.

648
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,600
Seats about forward to me.

649
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,020
The whole thing.

650
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,200
No, go ahead Mike.

651
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,800
I don't want, this is, I don't want to get into a people get,

652
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,000
this is going to take a solvent tangent,

653
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,960
but like, I don't want to hear anyone complaining

654
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,120
about a target being looted.

655
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,680
What, I mean.

656
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,440
Well, hang on, don't Dave, our buddy Brian Cornell,

657
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,560
let's not code.

658
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,760
Yeah, that's fair.

659
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,600
But I'm just saying.

660
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,500
He's got a great song.

661
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,800
I don't know anything else about the guy,

662
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,320
but the song.

663
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,280
He was fine with it.

664
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,920
He was like, there's more important things going on right now.

665
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,240
He was kind of cool.

666
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,200
He said the right thing.

667
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,120
But just the amount,

668
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,880
it's hard to wrap your head around the corruption

669
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,600
because of the scope of it.

670
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,600
First of all, it's like Italian coins.

671
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,840
What is that?

672
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,160
Second of all, it's like these just big chunks.

673
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,480
Well, they must know that must just be standard.

674
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,800
That must just be standard operating procedure.

675
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,720
Here's $25 million that I orchestrated to get.

676
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,800
It's just, it's super villain level stuff.

677
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,640
He's the head of the,

678
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,400
he's the guy who approves new teams

679
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,400
and the owner of the team that you have to give money to.

680
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,840
It's yeah, it's like, but it is like super,

681
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,640
like it just doesn't compute with most people

682
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,160
because you glaze over it.

683
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,840
It doesn't like seem real.

684
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,480
And it's like a little too complicated.

685
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,040
Even I am not quite,

686
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,320
because I couldn't understand

687
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,480
how his coin stealing scheme worked.

688
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,400
But if I could just simplify,

689
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,880
I mean, I think what the story here is that

690
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,160
Michael Eisner perhaps partially well drunk

691
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:03,160
was swindled by an international coin thief.

692
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,800
Who was running the NHL.

693
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,680
So, you know, Eisner had his moments

694
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,800
and he had his failures.

695
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,040
He had his own coin tricks as well.

696
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,160
He's like, so this is you.

697
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,440
And he pulls up a coin and he's like,

698
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,560
and this is the NF, then NHL.

699
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,600
And he's like, if you, we double you.

700
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,520
And then in my eyes, I just got disoriented

701
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,560
and was like, all right, yeah, whatever you want.

702
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,880
Well, first of all,

703
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,200
who do I make the check?

704
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,760
Make the coin reappear

705
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,520
and I'll give you $25 million for the coin.

706
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,120
Next, I will call you $25 million check for the team.

707
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,240
Let me keep going with this a little.

708
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,000
Bruce McNall at this point needed

709
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
the $25 million so as to not default on

710
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,080
massive bank loans that he had taken out.

711
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,280
And you think that 25 million would do a pretty good dent,

712
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,400
but in fact, he owed banks like $70 million.

713
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,640
So he's like, okay, 25, that should start.

714
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,800
I think, you know, I'll keep it.

715
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,080
I'll scam a couple more billionaires and I should be fine.

716
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,440
But in fact, the next year,

717
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,040
the year after all of this shit happened,

718
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,640
he pleaded guilty to two counts of bank fraud

719
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,200
and conspiracy and wire fraud.

720
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,480
And he went to jail for 70 months.

721
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,640
And he's still in 2020 owes money to banks.

722
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,280
But he's out of jail.

723
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,240
He did, he got out of jail.

724
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,960
And not only that, despite all of this,

725
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,800
he's still so beloved by Wayne Gretzky

726
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,520
and by all the Luke Robitile,

727
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,680
all these other great LA Kings.

728
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:39,040
Wayne Gretzky refused to let his number be retired in LA

729
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,000
until Bruce McNall was out of jail

730
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,440
and could be there at the ceremony.

731
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,280
He loves Bruce McNall.

732
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,440
I think everybody, there's documentaries about him

733
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,280
and everybody's like the greatest, larger than life,

734
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,520
the most wonderful guy.

735
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,760
And in fact, he got a piece of advice

736
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,440
after all this went down and he got caught,

737
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,200
which a lot of these people don't.

738
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,080
He got a piece of advice from a friend of his.

739
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,480
And that was your problem is that you only stole

740
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,440
$70 million.

741
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,720
Your scam should have been for a billion dollars

742
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,280
because then you're too big to fail.

743
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:14,280
And that advice was given by president Donald J. Trump.

744
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,400
Great, fantastic.

745
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,400
Yes, the man and America's too big to fail, isn't it?

746
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,880
Oh God.

747
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,680
I love, I honestly, we need to get back to where like,

748
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,280
we're talking about some dumb Disney song parody

749
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,120
on the ice, but I would like to talk about

750
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,560
five different real world problems right now.

751
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,200
That are all oddly overlapping with this.

752
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,640
This seems like an innocent version

753
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,520
of what we're seeing a lot.

754
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,680
There's a slightly famous now deceased man

755
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,480
that people wonder, well, after he was arrested and let go,

756
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,080
how would these famous people still be talking to him

757
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,640
and why would they invite him to their wedding?

758
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,200
Yes, yes.

759
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,080
And it just seems like it doesn't matter.

760
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,440
Do these people go away for the crimes?

761
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,280
Who gives a shit?

762
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,520
We're rich, doesn't matter.

763
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,640
Are you talking about the one

764
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,520
who definitely killed themselves?

765
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,720
Yes, I might be talking about the one who definitely

766
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,640
for sure killed himself.

767
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,640
Oh, the aviation enthusiast.

768
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,480
Yes.

769
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,120
We're not, you know, just,

770
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,880
I don't like to say the dates necessarily,

771
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,480
but we're recording this early July.

772
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,880
This might come out later July.

773
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,800
So I just want to say that to all of you in late July,

774
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,560
I hope you're dealing well with the death

775
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,280
of Ghislaine Maxwell, RIP.

776
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,160
We'll miss you.

777
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,600
I just want to make sure that's out there now.

778
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,320
We don't want to sound like we're behind on the news.

779
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,720
We're insensitive because people will be mourning the loss.

780
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,440
We were really struggling at beginning July

781
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,440
because, you know, federal, local, state

782
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,960
have bungled the response to the coronavirus so badly.

783
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,920
There were no cookouts or parties or get togethers.

784
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,960
So all podcasters had to discuss the Ghislaine Maxwell arrest

785
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,320
in their group texts instead of in person at cookouts.

786
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,560
Yeah, that's true.

787
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,480
Everybody had to shift the usual topic

788
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,480
of their group texts, Quibi, over to Ghislaine Maxwell.

789
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,320
Yeah.

790
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,320
Let's, Quibi and its odd name actually might be a good way

791
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,240
to lead into the next point, which is that the pond,

792
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,560
the home of the ducks is newly relevant.

793
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,120
Maybe, maybe not.

794
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,360
I'll put a big question mark there.

795
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,200
Yeah, possibly.

796
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,000
And this is my Zoom background as you guys talk to me.

797
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,120
There has been an exciting, dynamic Anaheim,

798
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,480
changing the fabric of Anaheim plan announced

799
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,120
because right now, if you go to what is now the Honda Center

800
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,440
where the ducks play, what's there?

801
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,760
It's a big parking lot.

802
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,160
There's nothing exciting.

803
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:55,160
And soon enough, it will be an exciting multi-use living

804
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,560
and dining and shopping, if those are ever allowed again,

805
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,920
destination.

806
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:05,600
And the name of this place is OC Vibe.

807
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,440
OC Vibe.

808
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,920
And if you think that I'm done with what is stupid

809
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,960
about this, now allow me to spell OC Vibe.

810
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,120
OC, both lowercase.

811
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:26,120
Now put caps lock on, capital V, exclamation point B-E.

812
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,920
Yes.

813
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,720
What? I didn't know that.

814
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,160
Yeah, OC Vibe.

815
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,200
OC Vibe, a place where teens can just come to hang out

816
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,320
and be themselves.

817
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,520
So the vibe here in July, 2020,

818
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,920
the vibe of OC is off the hook.

819
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,320
Of course, they're killing it, baby.

820
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,360
If you go to the Honda Center right now

821
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,240
and look in the parking lot,

822
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,480
there is just one of these very overly designed

823
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,400
apartment buildings in the midst of a parking lot.

824
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,520
And that's where Disney and Convention Center

825
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,880
bus overflow pickup stations are.

826
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,480
And then right across the street,

827
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,960
there's like a Golden Road beer garden and brewery.

828
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,080
But it does feel very out of place.

829
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,440
They're like, well, live here.

830
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,240
Live in the parking lot of a baseball stadium.

831
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,280
And there is one restaurant.

832
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,400
There's a very similar little housing area

833
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,400
over nearby the stadium, the Angel Stadium,

834
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,120
that overlooks the really weird concert venue

835
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,840
that's just in the parking lot of the Anaheim State,

836
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,440
which I would also love to do an episode about.

837
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,520
I'm sure we've talked about this,

838
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,760
that it was a theme restaurant

839
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,120
started by Disney executive Jack Lindquist,

840
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,760
where you went, it was like,

841
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,880
it was a thing where you went to experience

842
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,880
a night of 1940s Hollywood glamor,

843
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,120
like you were going to an award show,

844
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,240
much like the Golden Mickeys on the cruise

845
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,920
that we just talked about.

846
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,400
And this was open for 10 months, I believe.

847
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,240
Great.

848
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,160
This was just immediate plummet failure.

849
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,760
But then it still looks like a 40s theater.

850
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,440
Yeah, I'd love to explore this thing.

851
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,680
Yeah, we got to do that.

852
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,520
Yeah.

853
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,360
Also, I'm realizing now I'm getting a call

854
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,640
from the keeper of the OC Vibe already.

855
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,520
And he's calling to me that he needs help.

856
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,960
He or she needs help

857
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,560
investigating the future stores and restaurants.

858
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,160
So is he, he's, so you're hearing him

859
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,040
just kind of like buzzing in your ear right now.

860
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,600
He or she is buzzing in your ear.

861
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,240
I'm getting sort of a telepathic communication.

862
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,200
Can you be, is it like an unborn situation?

863
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,320
Like, can you be the keeper of something

864
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,600
that doesn't exist yet?

865
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,720
Well, you know, it might be, that's a good question.

866
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,080
Am I getting a transmission from the spirit world,

867
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,160
or am I getting a transmission from the future?

868
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,160
I'm not actually sure.

869
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,360
It could be either or.

870
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,840
So yeah, I think-

871
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,120
Either way, you're keeping it together.

872
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,600
And I appreciate you continuing to talk on the podcast

873
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,520
because your eyes have turned white

874
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,320
and you are foaming at the mouth.

875
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,320
Yes, I am.

876
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,160
I am foaming.

877
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,440
Experiencing these celestial visions.

878
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,000
But yeah, I'm managing while I'm foaming.

879
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,600
Yeah, yeah, well, you're a broadcaster.

880
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,280
Just see there's a little dab on your right cheeks

881
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,560
and just wipe that off.

882
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,160
But otherwise- Doesn't bother me.

883
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,000
Thank you, Lewis.

884
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,840
I can't see that.

885
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,120
So OC Vibe, which was, who knows what will be in it.

886
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,840
And we can't cover it until we know what's in it.

887
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,880
Maybe we just don't cover it.

888
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,840
Maybe we just don't cover it at all.

889
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,320
That seems impossible though.

890
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,040
Yes, sorry.

891
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,440
Well, we've got four years at least to negotiate.

892
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,360
If not more.

893
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,320
An analog- I think we'll compromise.

894
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,280
I think you'll both be happy.

895
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,520
In the result will likely be it'll never get built.

896
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,520
I mean, you would have to think,

897
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,800
it seemed odd to me that at the height of this pandemic

898
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,520
that's hitting especially hard in the county

899
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,200
where they're announcing this,

900
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,120
like, guess what?

901
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,800
A new fucking mall.

902
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,280
Which was also not yet doing so well

903
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,920
as we probably talked a little bit about

904
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,240
on the episode about Anaheim politics.

905
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,520
The city needs some more money for problems.

906
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,680
How do you think so?

907
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,520
Yes.

908
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,600
I mean, it was just part of the thing of Disney.

909
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,960
Like, why are they just handing money over to Disney

910
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,440
to build a bridge?

911
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,880
When it's a very, Anaheim's a pretty messed up place.

912
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,080
But all the problems will be solved by OC Vibe,

913
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,360
which an Anaheim city council member

914
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,120
describes as LA live on steroids.

915
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,200
What?

916
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,200
An actual politician used the term LA live on steroids.

917
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,160
So LA live, I mean, LA live has like six restaurants.

918
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,120
So you're telling me this place is gonna have

919
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,880
nine restaurants?

920
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,960
It sounds like steroids to me.

921
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,680
Yes, it's an unnatural result.

922
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,600
Really.

923
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,920
That's really what that means.

924
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,000
So yeah, it'll seem ridiculous.

925
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,680
It'll just seem insane.

926
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,800
Then maybe it'll be two Tony Romas.

927
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,960
There'll be one at each end or two, or what's the other,

928
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,120
the Tom's Urban.

929
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,320
There'll be a Tom's Urban,

930
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,320
but it'll be a bigger Tom's Urban.

931
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,800
Oh, imagine a 10% bigger Tom's Urban.

932
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,800
No, I just, I watched these vloggers

933
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,320
that like covered the Vegas casinos.

934
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,000
And I remembered in the New York, New York casino,

935
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,760
like the outside area, there's like a Tom's Urban.

936
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,120
And I was like, what is Tom's Urban?

937
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:49,080
It sounds like an algorithm designed restaurant.

938
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,080
And now that I know there's also one at LA live,

939
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:56,520
it just reinforces my beliefs about this place.

940
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,400
It feels like a restaurant, like a temp name

941
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,400
that you come up with when you're making the art

942
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,880
of a new shopping center.

943
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,440
Like in the drawing that you do

944
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,480
to submit the plan to the city.

945
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,560
And it's like, well, we can't leave that space blank.

946
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,840
Let's just put random words in there.

947
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,560
How about Tom's Urban?

948
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,440
And then it actually inspired a real restaurant.

949
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,080
And the restaurant that I've been to twice is not good.

950
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,800
You've been to Tom's Urban twice?

951
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,880
It's outside the Staples Center

952
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,280
if anyone doesn't know what we're talking about in LA.

953
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,560
Yeah, are there any other,

954
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,840
wait, now I'm seeing it referred to as Tom's Watch Bar.

955
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,120
Did they change the name?

956
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,600
Has Tom's Urban been changed to Tom's Watch Bar?

957
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,000
Tom's Watch Bar.

958
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,840
A worse name, I would say.

959
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,000
It's a terrible name.

960
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,840
I think so.

961
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,560
I think the, wait, okay.

962
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,280
I'm now trying to figure out where all the other ones are.

963
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,880
There's one at Mohegan Sun Casino.

964
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,960
Maybe we gotta do a Tom's Urban episode.

965
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,920
I think we do.

966
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,200
Yeah, the website is now tomswatchbar.com.

967
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,040
Watch Bar?

968
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,600
What a shocking reveal mid episode.

969
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,480
Tom's Urban is the first we've ever mentioned

970
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,080
at Tom's Urban and immediately it doesn't exist anymore.

971
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,360
It's Tom's Watch Bar.

972
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,520
Gee whiz, that's shocking to me.

973
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,440
I would think that the keeper of LA Live

974
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,480
would have told us about that.

975
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,040
But I guess not.

976
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,200
Wait, no, you were talking to the keeper of OC Vibe,

977
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,040
I thought.

978
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,840
Oh, I was, but I was saying I'm also in contact

979
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,560
with the keeper of LA Live and I'm surprised that

980
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,160
he or she didn't tell me about this change to Tom's Urban.

981
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,000
Yeah, you also, you're on text threads

982
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,200
with all these mall spirits.

983
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,080
Yeah, yeah, I have texts.

984
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,640
There's 150 mall spirits on this text chain that I'm on.

985
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,600
The keeper of the park, which is like the shopping

986
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,440
and eating complex that leads up to the park

987
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,520
and Vegas off of the strip.

988
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,880
That's where the Vegas hockey team plays.

989
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,920
Oh, right.

990
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,880
I guess hockey, these guys are, it's all related.

991
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,760
Yeah, usually hockey is right next door.

992
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,520
There's so many, just Vegas.

993
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,720
Like your thread has to include like seven Vegas

994
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,040
mall spirits.

995
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,400
Yes, yeah, yeah, there's a variety.

996
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,800
Do you know the names off hand?

997
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,320
Cause I'm forgetting some of them,

998
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,000
but do you know the actual official names

999
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,680
of some of these Vegas malls?

1000
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,840
Is the park one called the park or is it,

1001
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,400
does it have its own?

1002
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,560
The park Vegas mall.

1003
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,640
The crystal shops at Aria.

1004
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,720
Yes, very good.

1005
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,560
Yeah, yeah.

1006
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,560
The park at the park Vegas.

1007
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,840
The fashion show mall, which is where Dive used to be.

1008
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,240
Another, the Facebook group reminded us of Dive.

1009
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,040
I think we really got to hit Dive, the submarine restaurant

1010
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,080
which had as an investor,

1011
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,000
Jeffrey Katzenberg of Quibi fame.

1012
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,920
What's the one at the, what's the planet Hollywood?

1013
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,240
Yeah, that's a good question.

1014
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,960
Planet Hollywood.

1015
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,680
Miracle Mile shops.

1016
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,440
Miracle Mile shops.

1017
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,360
The Caesar shops or?

1018
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,680
Caesar's Forum.

1019
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,520
The Forum, yeah.

1020
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,880
The shops at Caesar's Forum.

1021
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,800
Wait, is it an at or not?

1022
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,240
The Forum shops at Caesar's,

1023
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,200
which is not to be confused with the Colosseum,

1024
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,080
which is one of the venues at Caesar's.

1025
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,840
That's a con, no, the Colosseum is concerts.

1026
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,960
The Forum is shops.

1027
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,800
Get it right.

1028
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,360
The Forum shops at Caesar's, is that right?

1029
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,040
Forum shops at Caesar's,

1030
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,640
which is known as the shopping wonder of the world.

1031
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,480
Is it really?

1032
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,000
You know what?

1033
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,400
We're pretending, we're being snarky about these names.

1034
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,920
I miss all of these fucking places.

1035
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,600
I cannot wait to go back to the strip.

1036
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,640
No much.

1037
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,480
Yeah.

1038
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,280
I mean, you say you cannot wait.

1039
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,800
Of course all of us will wait.

1040
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,640
We have to wait.

1041
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,960
I don't want to wait.

1042
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,880
I want to be there.

1043
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,000
I'm not an idiot, but I'm,

1044
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,120
I miss these dumb places so much.

1045
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,720
I completely agree.

1046
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,960
I mean, we could go to them.

1047
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,920
We just might, you know, get sick.

1048
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,920
Die or murder others.

1049
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,760
Yeah.

1050
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,600
I do that.

1051
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,880
What do we know the mask policy at these shops?

1052
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,280
Every one of them is no.

1053
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,480
Yeah, okay, got it.

1054
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,080
I actually was following this.

1055
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,800
It was like recommended early on at the casinos and complexes.

1056
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,000
And then Nevada, like a number of states said,

1057
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,600
you gotta do the mass inside.

1058
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,440
Okay.

1059
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,280
Oh, they did?

1060
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,280
Yeah.

1061
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,440
All right, this will be my last joke.

1062
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,360
And then we got back to the ducks.

1063
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,320
I would, I'm surprised there's not like a contingent

1064
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,680
of anti-mask people who have some sort of funnel

1065
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,880
that they like, I'm going to breathe in more air

1066
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,760
to make a point.

1067
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,880
Like there's a, they have some sort of machine

1068
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,080
that gives them double the oxygen from the air.

1069
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,840
So they walk around restaurants and stores

1070
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,600
getting more in to prove.

1071
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,440
Yeah, how would that work?

1072
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,840
Maybe it's, it's supported by your head.

1073
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,040
It's on top of your head, like a big, like Doc Brown

1074
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,960
or Wayne Zelinski kind of hat.

1075
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,160
And it juts out at a bunch of points and it's a big fan.

1076
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,360
It's like you're a fan man, but instead of on your back,

1077
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,400
it's up on top of your head and it's funneling

1078
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,760
as much air as humanly possible.

1079
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,400
Right, so I'm going to breathe in four times the amount

1080
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,640
of COVID air to prove to you libs.

1081
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,080
That I'm, that this is a hoax.

1082
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,880
Cause I, I don't deny that it exists.

1083
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,760
I know that there is COVID, but, but I'm not a pussy.

1084
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,960
I can handle it.

1085
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,200
So I'm going to breathe it in and spit it right back out.

1086
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,960
I am so strong.

1087
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,400
I got American lungs.

1088
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,880
If you, if you want to survive this thing,

1089
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,160
you got to do lung pushups.

1090
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,840
There's only one way.

1091
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,200
If I was a conservative grifter, I would look into this.

1092
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,040
Yeah.

1093
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,720
If we have any conservative grifters that listen

1094
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,720
to the Patreon, if they're behind the paywall,

1095
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,320
I'll give that idea to you for free.

1096
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,040
The air amplifier.

1097
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:00,040
Like to prove that you are the toughest guy.

1098
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:05,520
The your baby just put us before us air, us amplifier.

1099
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,400
That's good.

1100
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,480
Yeah. US air.

1101
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,840
Oh, let anyone stop you from breathing American air.

1102
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,880
Sell them at your indoor standup shows that you're still

1103
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,120
doing for some reason.

1104
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,040
Where's doing standup?

1105
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,360
Like in Nashville, I think.

1106
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,000
He was doing standup and COVID-19.

1107
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,080
Don juniors girlfriend was doing

1108
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,400
sign up in a log cabin, I think

1109
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,160
And we'll edit any of this out.

1110
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,680
If any of these people pass away before this episode

1111
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,000
comes out, you won't know.

1112
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:42,880
There could have been 10 names.

1113
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,360
We just added it out.

1114
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,800
Standup comedians who want to go with it.

1115
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,040
All right.

1116
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,880
The mighty ducks of Anaheim.

1117
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,560
I think we're not that far away,

1118
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,400
I think for being able to just talk about

1119
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,880
this wonderful pre-show.

1120
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,560
The strange thing about this is how quickly

1121
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,320
it all came together.

1122
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,040
After Eisner got scammed by the coin thief,

1123
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,800
there was only a matter of months

1124
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,520
before the team was just playing.

1125
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,400
It was like, I don't know if I forget,

1126
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,880
but it was something like February to September.

1127
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:22,200
It was way faster than teams usually start up.

1128
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,680
I thought it was weird that Disney,

1129
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,040
I always thought Disney paid for the pond,

1130
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:26,880
but they didn't.

1131
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,120
That was being built anyway.

1132
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,640
And again, in weird plunder situation,

1133
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,240
the reason Anaheim just started building a stadium

1134
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,720
was so that Santa Ana wouldn't build a stadium.

1135
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,040
They just started and they were like,

1136
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,480
well, somebody is gonna come, the Clippers will move.

1137
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,360
And then they tried to get the Clippers to move

1138
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,720
with another shit head owner, Donald Sterling,

1139
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,280
one of the biggest monsters.

1140
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,320
And it was all set, like completely ready to go.

1141
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,640
The Clippers are going to play in Anaheim.

1142
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,000
And then he was just like,

1143
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,240
nah, I don't wanna do a commute.

1144
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,440
That's a little far to drive.

1145
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,080
It's too far.

1146
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,200
I can't do that.

1147
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,720
That's my memory of his voice.

1148
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:05,080
What kind of mileage do you think this car gets?

1149
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:05,960
It's too far.

1150
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,440
I get tired driving.

1151
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,360
Worst, the worst guy.

1152
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,280
And then that's all we can do.

1153
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,160
We can't quote anything else he ever said.

1154
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,000
Well, nothing else.

1155
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:14,840
Or we'll go to jail.

1156
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,880
No, yeah, yeah, that's true.

1157
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,920
Look at the testimony though.

1158
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:21,560
Look at the testimony where he goes on an insane tangent

1159
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,720
and the lawyer says, sir, the question was,

1160
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,520
is this your handwriting?

1161
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,760
It is one of the funniest things I've ever seen.

1162
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:30,800
It is legitimate.

1163
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,160
It is disgusting.

1164
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,080
It is the filthiest thing I've ever seen.

1165
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,200
But the punchline is really something.

1166
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,040
They just need to lock him in a room with Sumner Redstone

1167
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,200
and have them yell babble at each other

1168
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,840
until they both die.

1169
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,640
Next week.

1170
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,480
Oh my God.

1171
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,520
Let that at this out if that's what happens.

1172
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,400
I think it could.

1173
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,200
You gotta think of the families.

1174
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,160
You gotta think of the Sterlings and the Redstones.

1175
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,440
Poor Sherry Redstone.

1176
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,720
You gotta think of the.

1177
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,600
These are our best.

1178
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,200
They're our best people, folks.

1179
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,440
So they're building this arena.

1180
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,840
There was just no plan.

1181
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,920
There was nothing they were gonna do with it.

1182
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,600
So thank God Disney swooped in.

1183
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,600
And also Weisner is like,

1184
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,880
this will be wonderful for the city of Anaheim.

1185
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,920
And there's so much tie together that we can do.

1186
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,880
These people that are the players can come.

1187
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,520
They can do parades at Disneyland, which they did.

1188
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,520
There were big parades.

1189
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,080
Welcome the mighty ducks.

1190
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,480
Which Disneyland would have parades for,

1191
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,320
the people who won the Super Bowl.

1192
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,280
It was maybe a little odd,

1193
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,640
but like here's just a team.

1194
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,480
Here they come.

1195
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,640
They hadn't won anything.

1196
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,720
And in fact, there's this other thing.

1197
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,080
Let me do a screen share here.

1198
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,360
There's this wonderful interaction

1199
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:55,240
between the mighty ducks and Disneyland,

1200
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,760
which is this right here.

1201
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,760
There we go.

1202
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:03,840
I missed the share button.

1203
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,200
Do you guys see this pirate photo?

1204
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,200
Oh my God. Yes.

1205
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,880
Whoa.

1206
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,680
This is the full lineup

1207
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,880
of the inaugural season mighty ducks team.

1208
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:17,000
And it says mighty ducks set sail.

1209
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,600
And they are on board the deck of the Columbia

1210
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,360
on the rivers of America at Disneyland.

1211
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,640
There's another little thing that says pirates of the pond.

1212
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,760
And they are all dressed as pirates.

1213
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,680
All of these hockey players are dressed as pirates

1214
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:34,920
for some reason.

1215
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,080
Yeah. Is there any, I didn't, I missed this.

1216
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:41,520
Is there any explanation for why this exists?

1217
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,160
No, I don't believe so.

1218
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,720
Cause what do they have to, yeah.

1219
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,200
There's like, isn't there another team called the pirates

1220
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,040
or is that another sport?

1221
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,320
Well, there's another, yeah, another sport.

1222
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,880
Yeah. I don't, I don't know.

1223
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,320
Why are the ducks pirates?

1224
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,520
It doesn't make sense.

1225
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,960
Right. Why aren't they dressed as ducks?

1226
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,200
Why don't they all have thick seats?

1227
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,600
I would like that.

1228
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:06,560
All like in, as almost a nod to Belton John's famous.

1229
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,120
Yeah. That would be so good if they were all wearing

1230
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,640
like Donald duck style costumes

1231
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,480
and they were different members

1232
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,760
of the duck family from Disney.

1233
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,640
And by that point, wasn't Donald's boat open at,

1234
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,760
wait, yeah, wait a minute.

1235
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,200
Donald's boat was open at Toontown by this very point.

1236
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,000
Why didn't they go to the duck boat?

1237
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,880
It looks like a duck.

1238
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,360
Yeah. It looks like a duck.

1239
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,960
And then they obviously, it was a Disney duck logo.

1240
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:30,800
It's weird.

1241
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,640
Maybe there was a negotiation

1242
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,400
and they thought that that wasn't as good.

1243
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,480
That was too humiliating

1244
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,920
because I think the players were fairly humiliated

1245
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,560
by this photo from what I read, understandably.

1246
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,480
So, because these are not just to be clear

1247
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,200
the kind of pirates that they are dressed as.

1248
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,880
It's not quite pirates of the Caribbean,

1249
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:53,480
you know, beige and subdued.

1250
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,000
These are like, it's extremely medieval times

1251
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,560
pirates dinner adventure vibe.

1252
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,040
It's bright purples and pinks and teals.

1253
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,480
These are like background people

1254
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,280
in like a regional Peter Pan.

1255
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,040
Yes, a touring Peter Pan musical.

1256
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,920
This is not, these are not like cool looking pirates.

1257
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,600
These, yes, these people look like they're serving you

1258
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,440
chicken at medieval times.

1259
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,600
More Coke, sir.

1260
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,440
Yorg.

1261
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,240
Or Borbiet Mountain Dew you be seeking.

1262
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:28,760
Something is missing, your shrimp kebabs.

1263
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,400
One of those, one front and center with an eye patch

1264
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,960
and a skull and crossbone ad

1265
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,360
and then one next to him with a parrot on his shoulder.

1266
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,360
Great.

1267
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,200
This is a delight.

1268
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,720
And then they're like hanging up in the,

1269
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,520
what do you call when ships,

1270
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,640
what do you call ship nets?

1271
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,400
What are those goals?

1272
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,640
Oh, that's a good question.

1273
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,400
I'm not a ship guy.

1274
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,280
Not a hockey guys, not ship guys.

1275
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,680
Which I knew.

1276
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,240
I wonder if Eisner's behind this

1277
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,240
because there's another, there's photo ops.

1278
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,600
Eisner seems to like theme type photo ops.

1279
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,280
Because I don't know, you saw the,

1280
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,080
probably in that one article that he insisted

1281
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:09,120
on another photo op, not as impressive as this one, but.

1282
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,000
Was this here while I'm still screen sharing,

1283
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,360
I'll just move to the, yes.

1284
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,080
Yes, okay.

1285
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,840
What we're looking at here is the launch of,

1286
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,160
this was the announcement of the team name.

1287
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,880
This is Eisner proudly saying they will be

1288
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,840
the mighty ducks of Anaheim.

1289
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,680
He's wearing a Jersey from the original Mighty Ducks film.

1290
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,600
The green one with kind of a cartoon duck on it.

1291
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,840
And he is with, one of these guys is Bruce McNall,

1292
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,680
the coin thief.

1293
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,360
One of them is Jack Lindquist, the guy I mentioned,

1294
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,120
who started the weird Hollywood restaurant.

1295
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,640
I forget who the fourth one is,

1296
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,520
but they're all blowing into duck calls,

1297
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,480
which was the thing of the ducks.

1298
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,000
They all look like they're,

1299
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,200
it's in those little flutes that go,

1300
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,040
brr.

1301
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:57,360
And Eisner is wearing a duck's Jersey,

1302
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,160
and then a hat that looks like it was run over by a car.

1303
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,840
It's really crumpled, yeah.

1304
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,960
Which is one of the greatest things

1305
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,960
about all the pictures of him is just sometimes like,

1306
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,000
you just, you're so used to Eiger and it's like,

1307
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,880
you imagine like they steam his shirts

1308
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,680
before he comes out of the office.

1309
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,280
They steam his face, I think.

1310
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,480
Face, everything.

1311
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,000
It's like, he must have somebody following him around 24 seven,

1312
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,760
making sure he's like camera ready.

1313
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,440
Eisner just looks like he just woke up, rolled out of bed.

1314
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,240
So he like slept on this hat and put it on,

1315
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,280
and then went to this photo op.

1316
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,960
Not even sure it's their hat.

1317
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,080
I don't know, I can't quite see you, but.

1318
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,000
I can't, yeah, I don't think it is.

1319
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,600
It just says, it looks like an L on it, maybe.

1320
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,120
It looks like it just says LA.

1321
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,880
He bought this in Venice Pier.

1322
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,040
What a delight.

1323
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,200
He's the greatest.

1324
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,160
There's no,

1325
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,760
you know that an episode is a topic for us

1326
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,840
if there's a picture of Michael Eisner wearing something funny.

1327
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:59,280
There's just, we will get to it, guaranteed.

1328
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:04,920
So anyway, they pulled the team together shockingly quickly,

1329
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,720
and they're up and ready to go.

1330
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:11,040
They were excited about a draft pick, I recall.

1331
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,440
There's a great video you can watch

1332
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,560
that's like a kind of encapsulation of their inaugural season,

1333
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,840
and Eisner's there at the draft,

1334
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:22,040
like it's the movie Draft Day starring Grisham Newman.

1335
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,160
He's there.

1336
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,160
Yeah, they're taking the calls.

1337
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:29,200
Do we got Pau Gasol, I believe is the name today.

1338
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,320
Let me look that up to make sure I didn't.

1339
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,400
No, no, he's a basketball player.

1340
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,200
I'm a fucking idiot. Who's the.

1341
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:36,880
Wow.

1342
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:37,760
That is a name.

1343
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,680
I thought you were just asking, is that a name?

1344
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,800
It is a name.

1345
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,040
No, it is not. God, it's like, oh, it's Paul Korea.

1346
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,400
I'm way the hell off.

1347
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,000
I'm so sorry.

1348
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,160
This is why it's not really a sports episode.

1349
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,800
I thought that the ducks drafted Pau Gasol.

1350
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,440
Well, that would be a big deal.

1351
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,360
A name I'm also probably butchering.

1352
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,080
I'm so sorry, everyone.

1353
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:03,120
Guys, the ship rope ladders, I looked it up.

1354
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:06,880
Colloquially, those are what are known as Jacob's Ladder.

1355
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,000
That's what a Jacob's Ladder.

1356
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,160
Where the term comes from.

1357
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,680
Yeah, it's used for a lot of different ladders.

1358
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:16,840
Like, I don't know that there's an official term, but yeah, it seems.

1359
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,760
And then there is a pilot ladder,

1360
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,960
which I believe is for like climbing up the side of a ship.

1361
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,720
It seems like there's some wiggle room.

1362
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,600
Like a lot of stuff gets called it.

1363
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:29,040
Seems like there's a lot of meat on that ladder bone

1364
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,720
for an episode about ship ladders.

1365
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,280
Well, ship ladders and like the carnival, like at carnivals,

1366
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,800
you climb those ladders that swing you upside down to win a prize.

1367
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:43,880
What's that? Those are also referred to as Jacob's Ladder.

1368
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,960
Oh, man, those are impossible.

1369
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,560
And the toys, the wooden toys that are like wood blocks with cloth.

1370
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:57,960
Anyway, I so ladder themed ladders.

1371
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,240
Ladder talk is the episode.

1372
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,000
The ladders. Yeah, they're actually you know what?

1373
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,640
There is a ladder coming up later in this episode.

1374
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,200
I just realized. So this is good.

1375
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:15,720
I'm actually I'm glad we called out our ladder love already at this point.

1376
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:23,320
So obviously, with my deep fuck ups of basketball and hockey information,

1377
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,800
not qualified to talk about the games that they played or anything in that.

1378
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:30,280
But what we're really here to talk about is the way that they opened

1379
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,960
the inaugural game.

1380
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,760
I was so delighted to click on this and like, oh, I bet they did something

1381
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,480
with kind of a Disney touch. I bet they did something fun.

1382
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,320
It was so far beyond my expectation.

1383
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,040
So I was so excited.

1384
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:48,600
I think if you just look on YouTube for Mighty Ducks, inaugural game 1993,

1385
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:52,760
you'll you'll find it or for a intro first ever game.

1386
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:58,080
And this is the thing that does seem to live in the hearts of Ducks fans.

1387
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:03,200
I think this is kind of legendary to them for both both good reasons and bad.

1388
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:08,680
But the initial initial thoughts before we take you through it

1389
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,760
beat by beat, were you guys a fan?

1390
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,880
Were you guys fans of this?

1391
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,520
It's hard not to be a fan of this.

1392
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:20,760
It's I it went on forever, seemingly.

1393
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,120
It's so long. It's so long.

1394
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:26,720
It reminded me like, because obviously it's similar era to like

1395
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,600
the Indiana Jones halftime Super Bowl show.

1396
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,440
The Super Bowl halftime show. Absolutely. Very, very.

1397
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,120
But it was it was honestly it was like a little bit more Disney.

1398
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:43,320
I was actually surprised at how how direct Disney it was.

1399
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:47,520
I was thinking, yeah, I do try to separate and give it its own identity

1400
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,120
a little bit more.

1401
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,280
But no, absolutely not.

1402
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:54,040
This is a Disney property. There's a Disney team.

1403
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,600
I think it is.

1404
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,880
I think it was just done by the themed entertainment people at the parks.

1405
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,480
I think it was this is the phantasmic people putting this

1406
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,200
hockey team intro on. Right.

1407
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,400
And you can it shows.

1408
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:11,360
I mean, they they threw so much at this.

1409
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,960
And I thought just to keep it orderly, I just kind of number

1410
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:18,320
that the elements that I think make this thing really exciting.

1411
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,600
Number one, custom Disney animation.

1412
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,320
You know, there's animation at plenty of sports events,

1413
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:30,520
but it's, you know, a little often more like the the the animations

1414
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,000
when you get a strike in bowling.

1415
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,600
It's a little more rudimentary.

1416
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,840
It's meant to be played on a jumbo tour, especially in this era in the 90s.

1417
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,640
Or, you know, it's just it's basically

1418
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:45,360
big hands telling you to clap like, but but but but but but but but but let's go.

1419
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,400
This is Disney.

1420
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,080
The animation is not going to be crappy in Jumbotron.

1421
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,360
They did like quality peak

1422
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,480
Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin era animation for their intro,

1423
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,440
which is called Victory Through Duck Power.

1424
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,680
It's intense. Yeah.

1425
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,640
It's really intense.

1426
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,600
What is the piece of music that is done to the end?

1427
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,840
Done, done, done, done, done.

1428
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:14,240
That's what's playing, right?

1429
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,640
Is it run of the Valkyries?

1430
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:16,960
Flight of the Valkyries.

1431
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,600
I always thought it was flight, but then I looked it up

1432
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,400
and it said it was like run of the Valkyries.

1433
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,320
But I was looking at the wrong thing.

1434
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,240
Yet another thing we're getting wrong in this episode.

1435
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,480
Oh, it's no, it's flight.

1436
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,800
I was like, there's a ride of the Valkyries and then flight of the Valkyries.

1437
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,360
So I was confused. It's like different pieces.

1438
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:37,120
It is a little piece of animation where there is a flying V

1439
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:41,240
being formed by actual ducks in helmets.

1440
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,000
Very well produced.

1441
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,680
And they are all flying it.

1442
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,960
What is the what is the goalie like again?

1443
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,040
He's like a he's a big scary.

1444
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:54,200
He looks like the Huns in Mulan, just kind of like a you don't see his face.

1445
01:00:55,600 --> 01:01:00,760
Just like like very did they get the goalie is a Disney villain, essentially.

1446
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,520
Right. Just yes, very imposing.

1447
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:08,920
Yeah. And the name I found interesting that it's

1448
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:14,680
and the ducks make sounds like World War Two dive bombers, essentially.

1449
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:18,360
And the name Victory Through Duck Power is clearly a reference

1450
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,600
to victory through air power.

1451
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:27,040
The the actual Disney 1943 World War Two propaganda film.

1452
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:30,360
This is a genuine movie they made.

1453
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,760
I remember like I was I don't know a lot about it,

1454
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:37,360
but I was reading how like Roosevelt watched it and it made it made him.

1455
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:41,560
It inspired him to do some bombing that he maybe wasn't going to do.

1456
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,640
Sorry, Dresden.

1457
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,720
Roosevelt saw a cartoon.

1458
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:51,560
My understanding of the Disney company is that these movies

1459
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,480
like kept them in business.

1460
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:58,920
Oh, yeah. Oh, that's right, because they kind of gave the back lot over to

1461
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:04,080
to troops to like military housing or something or operations or that's

1462
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:08,400
they build bombs in the sound stages or I don't know about that, but I

1463
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,240
well, I think that too.

1464
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:14,280
And then, yeah, all the anime because they stopped making full.

1465
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,920
They you know, there was no more Bambi Dumbo.

1466
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,920
It became these odd little right this.

1467
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,000
Yeah, I mean, it was a brand.

1468
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,920
It was like a state of the art campus.

1469
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,280
So they're like, yeah, we can house troops here and you

1470
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:32,480
you can keep the lights on by making short propaganda movies

1471
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:35,400
while all of your animators are in the trenches.

1472
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:39,160
So that's right. People left. Oh, my God.

1473
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:43,360
So you got to admire their little not Disney animation history here.

1474
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:48,000
One of the things that I mainly remember about victory through air power

1475
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,160
is that I was I was really obsessed with the Disney.

1476
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,160
I mean, obviously, all these movies as a kid and we're growing up

1477
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,960
in that golden age of being the beast and Aladdin and Lion King.

1478
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,680
I remember. Do you remember how when growing up, they used to

1479
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:04,120
number the movies, they'd say, like the 26th Disney animated feature film.

1480
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,680
Yeah. And I was very numbers obsessed.

1481
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:08,120
Like, well, I got to know what the other ones were.

1482
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,680
OK, number two is Pinocchio.

1483
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:12,240
Number three is Fantasia or whatever that order is.

1484
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:15,920
And and then I and then I would get to like, so what's number 12?

1485
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,480
Victory through air power.

1486
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,760
What's that?

1487
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,680
Mom, can I rent victory through air power?

1488
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,920
I don't think you can, Scott.

1489
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,720
I don't think that was a blockbuster.

1490
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:30,680
That counts. They counted.

1491
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:34,520
Really? Three through air power is one of the Disney animated classics.

1492
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:38,160
I think they stopped the numbers because it's unclear, like, is bolt

1493
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:41,800
one of them is like what counts in the list anymore.

1494
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:47,880
Yeah. Is Planes Fire and Rescue the 76th Disney animated classic?

1495
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:51,360
Now, that is a topic, honestly, we should look into.

1496
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,120
Planes Fire and Rescue.

1497
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,480
I don't know the universe.

1498
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,760
The list is going through the list.

1499
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:57,720
Yeah. Yeah.

1500
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:00,720
I mean, making sure we because like there's so many odd.

1501
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,200
I still I can never remember.

1502
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:06,760
Have I seen Saludos Amigos or like, have I seen all of these?

1503
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:07,880
I don't know that I have.

1504
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,120
I haven't seen all of them, I'm sure.

1505
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:14,720
Maybe cumulatively, because so many of them are shorts compiled together

1506
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,600
to add up to a feature.

1507
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:21,240
So you may have seen the shorts without the context of the other shorts.

1508
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,440
Yeah. There's always those things like, oh, this is from that.

1509
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,160
Or this Ben Franklin Mouse cartoon is from one of these.

1510
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,280
I see. Yeah, that is what I.

1511
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,160
But where is it from?

1512
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,120
Was it its own thing or was it in a movie?

1513
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,080
That's a good question. I don't know.

1514
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,000
I don't recall.

1515
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:42,320
So anyways, you get a great car, great looking cartoon with dive bombing ducks.

1516
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:48,560
And then element number two that makes this pre show great Disney characters.

1517
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:53,360
And I and you guys know, but the listener, I bet if I gave you 100 chances,

1518
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:58,880
you would not guess which Disney character opens up this hockey game.

1519
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,440
You might think Darkwing Duck.

1520
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,240
You might think Donald Duck.

1521
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,880
Screw. Yes.

1522
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:05,480
May you be doing Louie.

1523
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:09,000
There are many ducks to choose from.

1524
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:12,160
But instead, and I will do a little screen share.

1525
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,520
Here is how the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim

1526
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,720
opened their their very first game.

1527
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,600
Steam hockey fans.

1528
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,560
It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure

1529
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:26,560
that we welcome you tonight to the pond.

1530
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:31,640
We invite you to relax and take your seat as the city of Anaheim,

1531
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,440
the National Hockey League and the Mighty Ducks

1532
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:38,440
celebrate a new era in sports entertainment.

1533
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,280
We are guests.

1534
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,680
We are guests.

1535
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,880
Yes, duck season has come.

1536
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,120
Yes, duck season has come.

1537
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,280
They chose.

1538
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,760
They chose the horny French candle

1539
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,440
to kick off the Anaheim.

1540
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:04,600
This hockey, the ice hockey game will be started by a candle.

1541
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,920
If a man with flames for hands, it's a nod

1542
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:13,160
to all the horny French Canadians that make up many hockey teams.

1543
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,840
It's it's it's a show of respect.

1544
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:22,800
Yes, any Montreal hockey game in this era would if the audience all like something,

1545
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,520
it would just be it'd be five thousand people all going, oh, oh.

1546
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:32,000
And if they don't like something, they go, oh, oh, oh.

1547
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:35,440
That's no, that's bad.

1548
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,720
That's a ha ha ha boo.

1549
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,360
You don't want that. Oh, God.

1550
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:42,120
Oh, I. Yeah, this is so crazy.

1551
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:45,280
And dip on the.

1552
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:48,680
And then these, you know, these girls start singing.

1553
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:52,840
And these are like French maids with feather dusters

1554
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,880
all skating around.

1555
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:59,280
And then Lumiere is also skating around.

1556
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,880
So he has skates on under his candle base.

1557
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,760
It's it's so delightful.

1558
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:11,160
But that leads immediately into a number three on my list

1559
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,720
of what makes this thing great.

1560
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:17,720
Sexy ladies, because sure, they're French maids already.

1561
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,800
The sexiest type of lady.

1562
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:23,160
Yes, there is.

1563
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:26,000
We all dream of hiring a French mate.

1564
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:29,400
I don't understand this fantasy just narratively.

1565
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,520
Like, where do you get French maids from?

1566
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,680
I don't know. I wouldn't know.

1567
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:34,280
I've never looked at it.

1568
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,760
I guess. Well, I see like ads on the street left out by shady trailers

1569
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,080
that explain to me how I could get a French maid over.

1570
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,200
But that's a power made.

1571
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:43,760
Oh, yes. Yeah. Different area.

1572
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:44,840
These are not topless.

1573
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,640
Let me be clear.

1574
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:49,400
The dancers at this Disney game are not topless.

1575
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,200
They're clothed. Yeah.

1576
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:55,800
But they do do some stripping because after doing a wheel

1577
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,040
and look at that frame,

1578
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,360
it was like a leering loom.

1579
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,120
Yeah. Yeah. Let me make sure I got it.

1580
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:05,640
OK, OK. Good.

1581
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:07,560
I'm going to make I made a screenshot sound.

1582
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:08,680
I don't know if you heard it on the zoom.

1583
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,760
So some dancing happens.

1584
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:16,600
But then it's not what you think, because guess what?

1585
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,200
They weren't French maids at all. Check it out.

1586
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:30,960
And they're throwing the Frenchman up.

1587
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,280
And now they are.

1588
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,280
Now they're ice dancers in the dark colors.

1589
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,840
I like the ball of dual Laker girls.

1590
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,720
And that was the music.

1591
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,440
But the decoys get you there.

1592
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:55,120
OK, here's here's a here's a point I'd like to make here.

1593
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:59,520
They treat the reveal that the French maids are not French maids at all.

1594
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,440
They're just the ice dancers that will probably be at the games,

1595
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,880
which is like their equivalent of cheerleaders.

1596
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,480
They treat it as if, oh, my God,

1597
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:11,480
a bunch of like skaters that were dressed as like 80 year old

1598
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:15,640
grandmas in housecoats through open their housecoats.

1599
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:18,120
Now they were wearing a French maid outfit.

1600
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,960
Like they just they're wearing a French maid outfit,

1601
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:25,560
and then they just take that off and they reveal they're wearing like skating outfits.

1602
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,920
They're a different kind of sexy.

1603
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,120
But they're like, it's a normal skating outfit.

1604
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,360
This is nothing. And then like the music turns into like it's

1605
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:36,680
it's like rat round and round or like a sunset strip.

1606
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,160
Poison. Yes.

1607
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:43,040
Poison. Well, let's not lose sight of the fact a poison ratified

1608
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:45,240
be our guest. Right.

1609
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,840
Yes. The Alvin Menken song.

1610
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:51,920
They treat it as if like now the girls are naked. Yeah.

1611
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,840
And it's like they're just they're wearing skating outfits.

1612
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:56,400
You like Olympic skaters wear these outfits and it's fine.

1613
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,840
Like what is the big reveal?

1614
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,120
Like leggings. It's still. Yeah.

1615
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:03,560
These are maybe four percent skimpier than what they already had.

1616
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:08,160
Regular skating outfits and what looks like men in jumpsuits like crash

1617
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,920
test dummies. Oh, yes.

1618
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,320
Helmets on. Yeah. What?

1619
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,800
I don't have a good descriptor for these.

1620
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,440
I mean, it's it's all very Starlight Express.

1621
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:21,240
They also kind of look like, you know, like sort of the I don't know

1622
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:26,720
the correct term, but like pawns in Tron, you know, like these are the guys

1623
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:30,040
who get defeated very easily in the light disc game.

1624
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:34,520
Yeah, they're they're soldiers for the master control program.

1625
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:38,960
But but in Duck Purple, they're yeah, they're meant to like kind of hide

1626
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:40,600
a little bit.

1627
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,520
I think, yeah, yeah.

1628
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,360
And yeah, well, they're they have they have no identity.

1629
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,000
It's a very like soldier.

1630
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,160
You can't see their faces,

1631
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,880
but then they're, you know, dancing with the girls.

1632
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:58,600
They're in spinning and doing kind of roller derby people.

1633
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:03,360
It's like big unitards basically, but like buff unitards,

1634
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:06,720
like fake muscles like Hans and Franz muscles.

1635
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,840
That's very good. Yes. Yeah.

1636
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:12,120
Very like clothy muscles,

1637
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,320
glossy muscles.

1638
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:17,120
Let me see where we're at in the song, because I just I don't want to miss

1639
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,120
the rock.

1640
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,040
We are guess Copperfield muscles.

1641
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,600
Yeah, he wears like a girdle or something.

1642
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:25,400
All right.

1643
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:31,240
Do the calls.

1644
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,120
Bad.

1645
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,120
You're on.

1646
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,120
Pass.

1647
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:50,120
There was some pyro in there, too, and I want to miss that, of course.

1648
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:51,440
And this all takes us.

1649
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,560
We're only two minutes in and all this has already happened.

1650
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:59,040
Be our guest is still a very fresh song in the Disney

1651
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,400
hist and it's like a what, two years out at this point of beauty

1652
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:04,400
and the beast coming out.

1653
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,240
Yeah, pretty recent. Yeah.

1654
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:10,240
And I it was so popular at the time and Oscar nominators,

1655
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:12,320
you know, the big showstopper from them.

1656
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:15,960
But is it popular with hockey fans?

1657
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:20,440
It's well, I think it was kind of popular with everyone.

1658
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:24,160
My my thing about this is that anytime hockey

1659
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:28,640
games are especially funny when they play like, you know, that sort of like

1660
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:35,680
gross, that the rat, the poison music, and they're like, check out these ladies

1661
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:40,560
because it's so it's colder compared to other sporting venues.

1662
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,640
So everyone's in like sweatshirts and jeans.

1663
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:47,760
Everyone is super covered up because it's so icy and cold in the arena.

1664
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:51,960
But then also whenever like in the rare events that I'm in an ice rink,

1665
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:55,960
I also like you get so sweaty quickly, too, because it's such physical.

1666
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,720
So it's this awful combo of super sweaty and it's super cold.

1667
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,360
Not not my favorite.

1668
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:07,720
I just remember friends who would play hockey would have to have this mass

1669
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,760
of large bags and equipment

1670
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:15,280
that were specifically left in like a garage

1671
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:20,360
or the mudroom entryway on the side of a house, because it's just disgusting.

1672
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,160
Yeah, it's just so sweaty and gross.

1673
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:26,520
And like you can only wash so many parts of it in a machine.

1674
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,760
You have to wash the other stuff by hand.

1675
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:34,400
I the the Lumiere costume after this must have been toxic.

1676
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,880
Oh, God. Yeah.

1677
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:38,440
Black sludge inside.

1678
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:43,240
I bet I bet they got the Lumiere from the Disney and I show whoever does that.

1679
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,680
Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's not a park.

1680
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:48,520
They didn't just cart over from Disneyland.

1681
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:51,680
I would guess that would be my because like you would have to really learn

1682
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:54,160
how to skate wearing a Lumiere costume.

1683
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:58,800
Yeah, maybe they must have had somebody who'd done it already, probably.

1684
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,440
Right. I would think that they didn't just like porcelain,

1685
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,280
like some poor eight dollar an hour employee.

1686
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:08,040
Hey, you over there, put your skates on your Lumiere.

1687
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:14,320
But they, you know, they did bring somebody over

1688
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,280
from the park.

1689
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:20,760
And that brings us probably into what the bulk of this is going to be about.

1690
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,760
Really quick, just let me cruise through like this isn't even the half of the

1691
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:28,040
the BR because then it kind of shifts from rock to now like you got a saxophone

1692
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,600
in the mix, it's kind of Cassio.

1693
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:35,200
Now it's you know, now they have day glow things

1694
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:41,920
like bounce for photography, bounce boards that are lit up green and purple.

1695
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:44,800
It's all like the snake sequence from Fantasmic.

1696
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,920
And at this point, and then they kind of skate in a line,

1697
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:51,600
they do all the things you can do in skating.

1698
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,360
It's very Broadway.

1699
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:57,800
This is where I ask the question, you know, I said,

1700
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,160
how do hockey fans feel about any of this?

1701
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:03,320
I want to point out at this point that this is the very first game.

1702
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:08,280
And the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim are facing the Detroit Red Red Wings.

1703
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:13,320
And the Red Wings are well known for when they are victorious,

1704
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:17,040
a dead octopus is thrown onto the rink.

1705
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,000
What? Yeah, they yes.

1706
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:24,080
They're just like someone I don't know if it's people in the crowd

1707
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:28,680
or the team does it, but somebody brings just a squid.

1708
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:34,280
Not as I mean, and just like it's like bloody and gooey and just throws it on ice.

1709
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,600
It's very, very bizarre.

1710
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:40,560
The very bizarre inhumane thing, you might say.

1711
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,800
I never knew that. I just didn't know that.

1712
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,600
This is like as I started reading about all this stuff

1713
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,480
and we said we were going to do this episode, I was like,

1714
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:52,960
oh, I was just assumed the ducks were already there and then Disney bought them.

1715
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:56,360
Like this is so many revelations this episode.

1716
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:00,360
Yeah, no, like, I mean, it was sort of, yeah, they formed incredibly quickly,

1717
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:01,320
as quickly as you could.

1718
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:05,680
And yeah, very designed by they even go out of their way to like Eisner says how,

1719
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:07,480
you know, it was such a small thing.

1720
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,120
I didn't want to put a massive team on it.

1721
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,640
So there, you know, there were four or five people all picking the colors

1722
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,800
and the logos and they just come meet in my office.

1723
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:16,080
We just kind of figured out and OK, I'll move on to the next thing.

1724
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,840
So it was so handpicked by Eisner.

1725
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,760
He really truly put it together.

1726
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:25,400
I want to say that the colors are the official colors are eggplant and jade,

1727
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:30,120
which as I Google eggplant and jade, it's a very popular combo for wedding

1728
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:33,320
seeming, like for tables and place settings as it should.

1729
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,640
I think it's a very appealing color combo.

1730
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,960
It's what the dancers here are wearing.

1731
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,400
But just all this to say a team from,

1732
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:45,480
I mean, that's like one of the rowdier sports cities, I'd have to think.

1733
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:47,720
And they throw octopuses around.

1734
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:52,400
And now so there's got to be some Detroit people at this game.

1735
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:56,760
And now they are watching a Broadway musical with a dancing candle

1736
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,640
and a saxophone rock be our guest.

1737
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,560
What are they thinking at this point?

1738
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,880
And the team already is called the Mighty Ducks.

1739
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:07,160
I just like imagine the perception of the team.

1740
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:10,680
If you like or imagine how about this, actually, if you're in a crowded

1741
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:16,280
Detroit sports bar in 1993 and you put on the game and this is what you see.

1742
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,560
Like you're throwing shit at the TV.

1743
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:24,880
You would think this would be a threat to traditional sports masculinity.

1744
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:29,360
I think it probably or just like it just made everybody go

1745
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,240
crush this fucking team.

1746
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:32,680
This sucks.

1747
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:36,520
But yeah, we're like my butt, my any ducks.

1748
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,440
I didn't watch this as a child.

1749
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:42,160
I never I've, you know, two days ago is when I saw it the first time.

1750
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:46,280
And I was if I saw this when I was a kid, I'd be like hockey is awesome.

1751
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,840
Yeah. Oh, and now that's where I'm at. Let me be clear.

1752
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:53,440
I was with my head and I put myself on like a Detroit dude at the time.

1753
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:56,200
Yeah, for me, I'm like, I guess I like hockey now.

1754
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,560
But you would assume a lot of those stupid.

1755
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,920
What the hell is this shit?

1756
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,440
And they're also like, like it is bizarre.

1757
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,680
It's a bizarre spectacle.

1758
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:10,720
Yeah, this mix of Broadway and ice and candles.

1759
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:14,720
But it is about to get more bizarre,

1760
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:17,640
if you can imagine that, because now we're

1761
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:23,200
almost four minutes into this thing and the dancers wrap up.

1762
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,880
And then you I don't want to get this.

1763
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,600
I think I remember where the sound cue plays.

1764
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,720
The dancers leave and out onto the ice rolls.

1765
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:38,080
What seems like very much like a star tours, a star speeder

1766
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:41,920
is so much like original star tours.

1767
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,400
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1768
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:44,360
A real capsule.

1769
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:48,040
And it's I at first thought it was like a Zambo, like a themed Zamboni.

1770
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,760
But I don't think it is.

1771
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:53,040
Well, I figured out that it is something from the park.

1772
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:58,120
They did. They had this prop in the park and and they just moved it over.

1773
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,360
So it was like used in tomorrow land.

1774
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,720
So this was ready to go.

1775
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,720
And thankfully, I is ready.

1776
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:10,520
So this thing wheels out with no narration, no explanation of what's going on

1777
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:15,000
until they land at center court or whatever rank.

1778
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,520
And and this happens.

1779
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:22,480
The mighty Iceman, the back pod opens up.

1780
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:31,120
Now, now we can't leave the listener hanging.

1781
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:33,880
Let's describe this.

1782
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:37,920
He this is the Iceman, the Iceman.

1783
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:41,400
And this is the Iceman.

1784
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,600
And this is the Iceman.

1785
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:46,440
The Iceman, the Iceman.

1786
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:51,000
The Iceman, I'll actually I'll steal a little bit from a just to keep it concise

1787
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,840
from a newspaper article because there were multiple newspaper

1788
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,760
articles about the Iceman.

1789
01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:01,960
He's wearing glitter and thick white face paint, dark sunglasses

1790
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:05,200
and a hat decorated with phony ice crystals.

1791
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:09,600
His jeans are bejeweled and so are his ice skates.

1792
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,840
He's also wearing red fingerless gloves.

1793
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:18,360
Just a watch, a regular watch, a red bandana.

1794
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,080
What's he carrying?

1795
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:23,000
Is it a guitar? Yeah, it's a guitar.

1796
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Headset microphone.

1797
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,040
Any other any any other ways?

1798
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:29,400
Yes, very nice to a style.

1799
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:32,240
Any other ways you would like to describe the Iceman?

1800
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:36,040
Yeah, the hat around the clasp of the cap.

1801
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,320
It says Iceman on it.

1802
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,560
Oh, yes. Yes.

1803
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:41,160
It says Iceman on the back.

1804
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:44,640
He looks a lot like original Mr.

1805
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:48,080
Freeze, not Arnold Schwarzenegger, mega budget Mr.

1806
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:51,600
Freeze, but like when it was who was the actor who played Mr.

1807
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,720
Freeze? There were three actors.

1808
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:55,360
Jesus. Otto Preminger.

1809
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,320
I'm going to Preminger.

1810
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,320
A famous one.

1811
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:58,320
Um, I know.

1812
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,960
Wait, the director, Otto Preminger.

1813
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,280
Yeah. Yeah.

1814
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:03,960
It was Mr.

1815
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,120
Freeze on Batman.

1816
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,120
Sometimes I don't.

1817
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,240
I can't think of the other two.

1818
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,360
I think I think it's two.

1819
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,360
It might be just one more.

1820
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:12,360
Very funny, because he was a maniac.

1821
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:14,680
So strange.

1822
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:15,680
Yes.

1823
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:16,680
Yeah.

1824
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:21,280
So he said that kind of Mr.

1825
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:26,960
Freeze where it's just caked on white makeup, except they also gave him a wig.

1826
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:30,960
That's also that's the same because it's like white as ice.

1827
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:35,360
I mean, so it's like Mr.

1828
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:39,120
Freeze is really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really,

1829
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:42,120
he's wearing a wig and a hat to cover up that he's bald.

1830
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:44,640
It's like a casual Mr.

1831
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:48,320
Freeze. The makeup kind of looks like he's doing he's like got a Halloween

1832
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,120
costume snowmizer face or something.

1833
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:52,480
Yeah.

1834
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:55,840
Snowmizer from the old stop motion.

1835
01:21:56,280 --> 01:22:01,000
He kind of looks like a like an Eisner, like a like a move with the headset,

1836
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,840
like a like a 90s movie executive.

1837
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:07,120
He looks like he could be on the phone in a car in the late shift

1838
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:13,600
TV movie, except he is completely white head to toe, not his hands, seemingly.

1839
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,360
They didn't get his hands.

1840
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:21,320
So let me keep playing some audio of of Iceman.

1841
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:30,600
Now he very hesitantly climbs up a ladder on the back of this odd

1842
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,840
star speeder. He's having a lot of trouble.

1843
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,320
Well, he needs to make sure he's steady.

1844
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,400
Somebody scream.

1845
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:44,080
And the listener might recognize this as the plaintive anthem of

1846
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:47,120
the hero of our decade, the Joker.

1847
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:52,400
But at the time, it was more of a sports thing.

1848
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,360
But a shitty version of it.

1849
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,960
He's not playing the guitar.

1850
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:01,680
No. Good point.

1851
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:04,640
He is just holding the guitar

1852
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:08,680
and really slowly traveling on the star speeder, the lights of which are flashing

1853
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:10,120
at the bottom.

1854
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:15,480
Hey, you are awesome.

1855
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:19,080
Most of what he said at this point is like, can you hear it?

1856
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:22,400
You're awesome. Oh, OK.

1857
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:26,120
Awesome. It's nice.

1858
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:29,160
I feel more awesome for having watched this

1859
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,360
once in a while on the show.

1860
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:38,280
We try to determine who is the worst character in the history of themed

1861
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:42,440
entertainment. Previous candidates have included the Vacation Club

1862
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:46,720
spokeswoman who lived at the Woodfield Mall, DVC.

1863
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,480
We have also talked about

1864
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:54,760
the man from the future in the Millennium Celeb or for the past,

1865
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:59,160
the man from the future past, Leonardo Columbus from Epcot's

1866
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,640
Millennium Celebration.

1867
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,200
We don't talk about him enough.

1868
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:07,120
I know I really miss I smile really big every time Leonardo Columbus

1869
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:09,440
comes up.

1870
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:13,480
Oh, wait, this came up because my baby had to wear a weird hat.

1871
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:14,760
Oh, yeah.

1872
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:18,600
I'm looking at a weird future man like Leonardo Columbus.

1873
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,920
And you said it was like a it was a prequel.

1874
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:22,120
It's it's Leo.

1875
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:23,920
Leo. Yeah, it's Leo.

1876
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,240
The young Leonardo Columbus Chronicles.

1877
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:30,400
While you're recording, you may as well make that show, Scott.

1878
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,840
I all I need is green fabric.

1879
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,800
He the baby likes to lie on fabrics already, and I have one.

1880
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:39,960
So if I just shoot him against that and that weird hat, I can make like a

1881
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:44,720
10 episode Hercules, Xena style mini series.

1882
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:47,040
You can only in our Columbus.

1883
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:50,040
You can get a some good news level deal

1884
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:53,120
during quarantine

1885
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:57,600
with the news that the part of Leonardo Columbus will be played by another baby.

1886
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:01,800
You will not go to series, but Gardner Jr.

1887
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:05,400
will be he will be a producer on the project to do it.

1888
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:08,160
He wanted four episodes and he was out.

1889
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,760
He didn't expect to sell it.

1890
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,840
He didn't want to sell it, but that just sort of came up.

1891
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:16,400
My baby's been pumping iron to be in a in a CIA baby show.

1892
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,080
CIA more of his attention.

1893
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,720
CIA babies.

1894
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:26,000
We got we got to try and find a an ice man pin

1895
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,040
so I can add it to my list.

1896
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:32,320
I've been watching DVC eBay auctions.

1897
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,760
There's not a lot of DVC merchandise.

1898
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:37,400
Wait, but there is any DVC merchandise.

1899
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:39,800
This is madness. Yeah, absolutely.

1900
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:44,120
Twenty and there and there was, as we discovered, Leonardo Columbus merch.

1901
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,480
Yes. Yeah, I think I have a watch on one of those two.

1902
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:50,200
I have bought in the stupidest shit during quarantine.

1903
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:53,880
Self-same. Well, I just bought off.

1904
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:56,600
But you know what credit to the Facebook group?

1905
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,880
I bought something off the Facebook group,

1906
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:03,720
which is they alerted me to that someone on eBay

1907
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:07,800
had a plush toy of one of my favorite characters in fiction.

1908
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:09,760
Nim glue.

1909
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:13,000
These Tyler voiced caterpillar question

1910
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,080
mark from the animated film epic.

1911
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:19,000
I'm Nim glue.

1912
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,360
My dream came true.

1913
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:21,720
I'm Nim glue.

1914
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:24,080
And now my me, Scott, my dream came true.

1915
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:27,320
I have I'm going to have Nim glue at home.

1916
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:30,000
You know, his name hasn't arrived yet.

1917
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,360
Nim has not arrived yet.

1918
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:32,360
I'm so excited.

1919
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:34,680
You know, I hope there's more on eBay because we're saying

1920
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:39,400
and I bought you for your birthday, Mike, a Funko of Steven Tyler.

1921
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,520
And you previously had a Simpson Steven Tyler, is that correct?

1922
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:45,160
That is correct. Here's. Oh, you got him.

1923
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:46,520
Just I have him right here.

1924
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:48,920
And he's right behind you.

1925
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:51,560
Yeah, behind you guys.

1926
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:53,480
Wow. He is right here.

1927
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:56,400
Oh, geez. Oh, it's so nice to see him in very.

1928
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:57,800
You can tell flaming mode.

1929
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:00,120
That's very clearly early 90s Steven Tyler.

1930
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:03,080
Darker hair. What makes it very good.

1931
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:07,080
So you got to get a Nim glue, too, so that we have we cover

1932
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,760
every Steven Tyler toy available.

1933
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,160
Oh, yeah, for sure.

1934
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,680
I will get a Nim glue.

1935
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:15,920
And if I have to do some more searching for more Steven Tyler toys,

1936
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:18,440
I have also bought a bunch of stupid things

1937
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,280
that I will probably sell once quarantine is over.

1938
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:22,880
One of the only things you can do.

1939
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,200
Do you have a stupid thing to list or are you prepared to?

1940
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:27,400
It's not as it's not as fun as yours.

1941
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:33,680
I bought 10 discounted Funko pops of the Fantastic Four that were four dollars each.

1942
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:36,280
Well, I have literally 10.

1943
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:40,280
I have like the whole set of the Fantastic Four sitting up here

1944
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:43,440
up above Rex in my my room here.

1945
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:44,880
That's pretty good.

1946
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:47,240
Pretty good. That's legit.

1947
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:50,080
It's not fun and it's taking up so much space.

1948
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:52,880
We got a petition for or at least, you know, if anybody out there,

1949
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:55,840
if anyone's an enterprising artist who could at least make like a Photoshop

1950
01:27:55,840 --> 01:28:01,040
approximation of these three characters as Funko's DVC,

1951
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:06,080
the DVC, the DVC, the DVC lady, Leonardo Columbus, the Millennium Man.

1952
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:12,880
And why didn't I use that before the Millennium Man and this guy Ice Man,

1953
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:17,120
who please, please, listener, look up Ice Man if you if you haven't already.

1954
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:20,640
I'm dying as I would love to see what a Funko of Ice Man looks like.

1955
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:23,040
Yeah, Ice Man is a maze.

1956
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,920
This is so weird and crappy.

1957
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:29,400
I hate. Oh, wait.

1958
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:31,000
You know what? I'm going to put this in my notes.

1959
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,440
I had a new idea for a final four, which is worst

1960
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,760
themed IP. Oh, yeah.

1961
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:40,000
And this could be called the fail for.

1962
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,960
I'll commit to that right now.

1963
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:49,440
We have to we have to think of what how many 13 more, but I'm sure we can.

1964
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:50,200
Oh, I'm sure.

1965
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:53,520
Send us your suggestions for the fail for this.

1966
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:57,160
This might be too far out there, but and it was canceled.

1967
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:01,280
But Marvel Comics, now a subsidiary of Disney,

1968
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:06,320
was going to put out a free comic book that encouraged young people

1969
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:11,200
to go in the STEM fields that was sponsored by weapons manufacturer Raytheon.

1970
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:15,520
She says, Eddie, God, it got canceled because everyone's like,

1971
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,560
this is gruesome. This is coolish.

1972
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:23,120
Wow. I think that can I don't know.

1973
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:25,080
We would have to expand it a little outside of theme parks.

1974
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:26,440
We'll see where the rules are.

1975
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:27,600
This is good, though.

1976
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,480
Worst themes, I character.

1977
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:31,480
This would be a lot of fun

1978
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:34,000
for right now, just because there's a little bit here.

1979
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:40,200
I my reaction to so that I just meant does this for like two to three minutes.

1980
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:41,840
It goes and goes.

1981
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:45,800
He rides the star speeder around, does not play the guitar,

1982
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:48,760
gets him to clap this. God, this goes and goes and goes.

1983
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:52,800
I'm I'm watching this and I'm like, whatever. Fine.

1984
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,480
This is not the best thing.

1985
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,400
This is pretty lame.

1986
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:57,480
But I can move on.

1987
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:00,640
I think it could take the the fail for. But whatever.

1988
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,440
Fans hated this.

1989
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:06,160
Fans were so mad.

1990
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:08,480
As I said, hockey fans are a little rowdier.

1991
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,200
There's some Detroit hockey fans here.

1992
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,480
They hate that they despise this.

1993
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:16,160
And the main thing that happens is the Iceman's appearance

1994
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:19,760
is not just in this opening ceremony for the entire game.

1995
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,920
Iceman is running around the stands and trying to pump up the crowd.

1996
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:26,200
Come on, guys. Go, guys.

1997
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:28,600
Here you do it. Say, go, guys.

1998
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:33,960
And as this is all unfolding, the Ducks are eating shit.

1999
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:35,320
This is their first game.

2000
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:37,680
We're so excited to see the Ducks. Duck pride.

2001
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:39,560
They are slaughtered.

2002
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:42,000
Detroit wins seven to two.

2003
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:44,000
They were never up.

2004
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,640
So after all this, they were describing the Ducks lose so hard.

2005
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:52,600
And after the second period, the head of entertainment,

2006
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:55,160
who coordinated this entire production we're talking about,

2007
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:57,760
went up to him and was like, nope, get out of here.

2008
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:00,600
Shut it down. Leave the arena. You're done.

2009
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:05,120
And to be clear, Iceman was like supposed to be a full season affair.

2010
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,240
This was their mascot.

2011
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:10,080
Iceman is going to be hanging out.

2012
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:13,840
And and they pulled it halfway through the game.

2013
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:19,360
This was so like people hated this so much.

2014
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:22,160
There was so much anger in the aftermath of all this

2015
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:26,640
that Disney wouldn't even reveal his name because the local press

2016
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:28,160
wrote articles about this.

2017
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:32,040
And to keep the guys safe, they would not say what his name was.

2018
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:35,920
This is like Steve Bartman, Bartman, catching the cub spell ball.

2019
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:41,440
Like for security reasons, we must not reveal the true identity of Iceman.

2020
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:45,880
Apparently, the sound system was terrible,

2021
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:48,080
so like he wasn't coming through most of the time.

2022
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:53,240
One local newspaper said he was a mascot who was more mass not.

2023
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:55,840
Oh, nice. Yeah.

2024
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:59,040
Always good. Those things.

2025
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:02,240
This man has since come forward to talk about his experience.

2026
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:04,560
I didn't write down his first name. His last name is McKelvey.

2027
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:08,520
And he was an entertainer in the Tomorrowland Terrace Band.

2028
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:11,600
This is like a Tomorrowland musician guy.

2029
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:15,400
And he worked at Disneyland before this, and he kept working at Disneyland after this.

2030
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,880
So that was part of it is like, I can't really talk about this or I don't want

2031
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,480
anybody harassing me because I don't want to lose the Disneyland job

2032
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:24,160
because I now have immediately lost this job.

2033
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:27,000
Like this could not have gone worse.

2034
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:30,840
After the game, he sat in his car and cried.

2035
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:31,720
Oh, my God.

2036
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:35,080
He says had not happened since he saw the movie E.T.

2037
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:39,920
And for several years, when he drove past the pond, he would flip it off.

2038
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:45,480
Wow. The sad story of Iceman.

2039
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,720
This Iceman did not deserve this.

2040
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:49,840
This was not that bad.

2041
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,720
No, it was not that bad.

2042
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:54,920
I think I think they should have put a little bit more

2043
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:59,800
the budget into Iceman's costume, but I don't know that that's that's not his fault.

2044
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:01,880
You're absolutely right.

2045
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:04,280
This is like with one trip to

2046
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:11,120
iguanas, is that the name of the Kooky thrift store in Hollywood and Hollywood?

2047
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:15,440
Yeah, you could easily you could if you spent a thousand dollars

2048
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:18,720
instead of three hundred dollars, you could easily top the costume.

2049
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:22,520
This feels like they were scrambling 12 hours before.

2050
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,240
Yeah, what's the excuse here?

2051
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:29,680
And then when the rest of it is so this full nice cause to nice

2052
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:32,840
sets of costumes for the decoys.

2053
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:36,160
And then this guy just gets a fucking sparkle vest and they just like

2054
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:39,200
cannon blast him with white face paint.

2055
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:41,840
I feel like they set him up to fail here.

2056
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:44,640
Absolutely. He did not have the tools he needed.

2057
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:48,120
And something else occurred to me about Iceman.

2058
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:52,440
I'm not always a person who likes to say Simpsons did it.

2059
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:56,840
But do you realize this is exactly dancing Homer?

2060
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:03,720
Yeah, the early Simpsons episode where there's the beloved, the more the more produced

2061
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:09,360
what way the goofball is he Shelby knows it's Springfield who's capital city.

2062
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:11,360
They have a city goofball.

2063
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:16,360
And then, you know, he's like a Homer's a charming mascot with kind of a homemade

2064
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:20,760
costume. And all he does is dance around and the fans immediately hate him.

2065
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:22,640
And he's never brought back past the first game.

2066
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:25,080
Wow, you're right. Exactly.

2067
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:26,880
Dancing Homer. It's the same.

2068
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:30,040
Yeah. Exact arc mixed with that.

2069
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:35,080
This guy is also kind of a poochy in that you were told that he is cool

2070
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:40,160
because he has a guitar and sunglasses and the fans immediately hate him

2071
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:42,920
and have to issue a statement saying he will never return.

2072
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:48,000
So does Wild Wing come after him or is at the same time?

2073
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:49,040
I don't understand.

2074
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:52,640
There is a costumed mascot, though.

2075
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:55,440
Jason, you're spoiling the big finale here.

2076
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:59,000
I apologize. I was legitimately confused.

2077
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:03,800
It's all. No, no, no. We are at the end of the we are at the end of the

2078
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,680
run about about Iceman.

2079
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:09,120
And we're actually one like one frame away even.

2080
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:11,440
So let me keep playing. OK, because you're absolutely correct.

2081
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:15,040
This is what's so confusing is if this isn't is this not enough?

2082
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:16,400
We already have the decoys.

2083
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:20,880
We already got Lumiere, then Iceman with his floating space ice ship.

2084
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:22,840
He's like he's set up to fail.

2085
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:26,840
And then like adding insults injury, there's a much better mascot

2086
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:28,600
right around the corner.

2087
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:30,640
Here comes Wild Wing.

2088
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:35,280
The lights go dim.

2089
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:37,360
There is no light in the pond.

2090
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:43,080
Carmina, Berana plays and down from wires comes

2091
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:47,520
a duck in a duck shaped hockey mask.

2092
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:54,480
Soaring through the pond like moving his arms like he's like

2093
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:58,080
like a sorcerer's apprentice and like summoning things.

2094
01:35:58,360 --> 01:36:00,000
He's God. Yes, he is.

2095
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,720
He is a newly a god. He just got god powers.

2096
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:05,640
This is this is so sinister.

2097
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:09,040
It's pretty I know it might be a wildling.

2098
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:13,560
Oh, and then behind him, a gigantic version of his hockey mask,

2099
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:16,840
which is also the duck's logo, which is flashing red light.

2100
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:18,520
A scary color.

2101
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:22,240
This is like, yes, like hell fire is hell has come to earth.

2102
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:26,600
Is that phrase people you like if you might hear them say Wild

2103
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:29,320
Wing, the original duck from hell.

2104
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:32,600
But this feels like he is from hell.

2105
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,360
Yeah, like Cerberus.

2106
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,120
Yeah, the dog.

2107
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:41,520
Just I saw both of these things and I just I guess my brain

2108
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:44,000
could not process that they came back to back.

2109
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,960
It's so weird.

2110
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:48,480
It's a lot. It's a lot.

2111
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:51,560
I mean, that it is all unfolded over the course of like 12 minutes,

2112
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:54,840
but it's taken us two hours to to process.

2113
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:59,120
And it's taken the city of Anaheim many decades to fully recover.

2114
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:02,400
They're getting there. They're figuring it out.

2115
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:07,200
I mean, I like now Wild Wing rule.

2116
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:09,360
This is great. This is this landing.

2117
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,120
Even though I'm afraid of them.

2118
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:14,120
He is a very aggressive mascot in general.

2119
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:19,880
Supposedly, this is what's truly bad is that they they they had the dancers

2120
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:21,240
and they had Wild Wing.

2121
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:25,600
And then they thought, you know, is this all a little goofy and Disney and cheesy?

2122
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:28,120
Do we maybe we need to add something for the guys?

2123
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:30,280
What if we had like a rock guitar guy?

2124
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:34,520
And that's why Iceman was drafted in.

2125
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:40,080
So ironically, Iceman was thrown in there for aggro hockey fans,

2126
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:44,080
the people who immediately, you know, threw cans and spit on him.

2127
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:47,840
It's what you were talking about, the people that were watching before.

2128
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:50,280
They were assuming they'd be like, this is stupid.

2129
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:53,320
Wait a minute. Who is this cool guy?

2130
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:58,880
I'm like, he likes rock music and he's a man with a penis like me.

2131
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:02,120
Yeah, hell yeah. We love the ducks now.

2132
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:04,600
The ducks rule. Iceman rules.

2133
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:07,120
Can you imagine having a beer with Iceman?

2134
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:12,040
Man, first question I'd ask Iceman, like, hey, so is your rod

2135
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:15,160
bright white, just like your face?

2136
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:18,640
Come on, does the carpet match the drapes, dude?

2137
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:21,360
Do you piss snow?

2138
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:24,520
Iceman, do you piss snow?

2139
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:32,880
Do you end up, is your pee ever so cold that it shoots out like an icicle

2140
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:35,800
and it's stuck in your peel?

2141
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:37,720
It is awesome.

2142
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:40,480
Cool. It rules to be Iceman.

2143
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:45,080
Are you a guitar strings icicles?

2144
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:47,040
Is that why you don't play them?

2145
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:49,320
Because if you touch them, they would break.

2146
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:52,240
Have you met Gary Glitter, Iceman?

2147
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:53,920
Be serious. Be serious.

2148
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:56,720
Is he cool? That guy seems awesome.

2149
01:38:56,920 --> 01:39:02,080
This being 1993, as far as I know, Gary Glitter is a solid earth

2150
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:04,720
awesome dude with nothing shady going on.

2151
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:07,760
I'd love these. This is number two. I'd like to have a beer with.

2152
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:11,520
I'd like to put a million dollars on nothing bad ever coming out about Gary

2153
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:13,680
Glitter right now.

2154
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,960
Good old boy. Just like me.

2155
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,440
A million dollars I got from selling coins to

2156
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:23,160
Italian coins to a man.

2157
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:26,760
Man, I would pay so many Italian coins for Gary Glitter

2158
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:29,040
to put out rock and roll part three.

2159
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:31,920
We're all waiting.

2160
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:40,400
Then then, by the way, is if just to stay in this machismo zone,

2161
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:45,840
he lands and they start introducing the players, the first of which is

2162
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:48,920
number 34, Ron Tugnut.

2163
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:53,280
One of the great names in history.

2164
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,400
And then I have to switch over to my other quick time window.

2165
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:02,520
Let me try to do this gracefully, because I have a better quality copy

2166
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:05,520
of what plays when Wildwing lands.

2167
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:09,280
This song. I love this.

2168
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:12,720
Great. Great. OK, wonderful.

2169
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:15,640
And here we go. The Mighty Dex theme.

2170
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:21,560
You'll see them challenging the odds.

2171
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:24,280
Don't beat them. Power, mystery, crime.

2172
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:27,160
Unleash this danger on the ice.

2173
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:29,920
Me see the

2174
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:34,720
the mighty dogs of America.

2175
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:35,960
Rock the pond.

2176
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:40,320
A scourge is going to a land that will die.

2177
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,320
Rock the pond.

2178
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:43,440
Do you know what those lyrics are?

2179
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:46,160
A surge of what? That never dies?

2180
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:48,760
Force? Oh, I think you're right.

2181
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:52,480
Yeah, I was like, I was like, it can't be a horse.

2182
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:54,960
It's not a horse. Oh, no, it's not.

2183
01:40:55,600 --> 01:41:00,440
But I also thought maybe it was bolts, a surge of bolts that never dies.

2184
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:03,760
I wouldn't I wouldn't bet all my Italian coins on it,

2185
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:05,920
but I think that I'm right.

2186
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:10,920
This song is really great.

2187
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:14,960
I I shared this with a friend of the show, Kyle Mooney,

2188
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:20,440
who described this genre as we will rock you core.

2189
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:25,320
If you look up the theme song of the animated series

2190
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:29,680
Pro Stars, which features with animated

2191
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:34,200
Bo Jackson and Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky not doing their own voices.

2192
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:37,680
That also is a very boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

2193
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:43,320
If it's got if it's got boom, boom, chat and chanting, it's we will rock you.

2194
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:45,960
Bucky O'Hare theme also very similar.

2195
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:48,600
Really? I don't know that theme.

2196
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:52,680
Yeah, it's it's it's very another dimension.

2197
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:54,160
Another time and space.

2198
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:56,960
It's like very like and then it gets a little faster,

2199
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:59,440
but it's a very like 80s ish.

2200
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:02,480
Pump up thing.

2201
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:07,440
I think a lot of you know, it's a lot like this also is the albums.

2202
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:09,760
Any music affiliated with Hulk Hogan?

2203
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:13,080
Like there's that main one American.

2204
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:14,000
No, what's his name?

2205
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,200
What's his Rick Derringer's America?

2206
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,240
Real American. I'm a real American.

2207
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:20,560
Yeah, I am.

2208
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:25,040
Yeah. But do you we also why have we not done?

2209
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:29,360
We really need to do an album about the Hulk rules by Hulk Hogan

2210
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:31,680
and the wrestling boot band.

2211
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,800
Oh, God.

2212
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:35,680
Have you got waited? We talked about Hulk rules before.

2213
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:37,760
Oh, not really on the show.

2214
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:40,160
We may have talked about the pasta restaurant.

2215
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:41,960
Oh, we got pasta mania.

2216
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:44,120
I mean, I'm sure I mentioned Hogan's Beach.

2217
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:46,760
Can we?

2218
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:50,240
Um, is there maybe just a Hulkamonth

2219
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:55,520
where we do Hulkamania and the album and then whatever?

2220
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:57,520
I mean, I'm a fan of Hogan knows best.

2221
01:42:59,000 --> 01:42:59,840
I'm missing.

2222
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:03,320
I mean, Mike, you could probably tell me, you know, 20 more things.

2223
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:06,000
The racist sex tape.

2224
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:08,680
Oh, that's right.

2225
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:10,720
Maybe we don't want to say maybe.

2226
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:11,920
Yeah, maybe.

2227
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:14,240
I think too much sushi.

2228
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:18,040
Yeah. Oh, yeah, we can.

2229
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:22,120
We can. We know we were talking about doing a topic that we could touch upon.

2230
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:26,880
Yeah, that's probably good in that other that episode we delayed.

2231
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:28,080
Wait, which one?

2232
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:30,120
What is it? Well, we I guess we don't want to ruin it.

2233
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:33,080
Yeah, we'll we were we were we were off the air.

2234
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:36,400
We were floating a different idea that we could touch upon, like Hogan's Beach

2235
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,080
and pasta mania and stuff.

2236
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:39,440
OK, wait, I don't remember.

2237
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:41,600
Well, OK, good tease.

2238
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:42,960
Yes, I have an item.

2239
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,720
I have. There was some other stuff, too.

2240
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:47,960
Yeah, I have a good we have a physical item.

2241
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:53,120
And then it got and lockdown happened like a week or two after I I picked this up.

2242
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:55,960
And we have a big guest for it, too. Yeah.

2243
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:58,600
Why don't I?

2244
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:01,680
This is funny to see if you can remember what we're talking about.

2245
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:03,040
Wait, the way.

2246
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:04,400
Oh, I think I know what you're.

2247
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:06,440
We were about to do it right before.

2248
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:08,520
We're about to do it with the guest in person.

2249
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:11,920
And then, yes. So that's a well, a movie star.

2250
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:13,680
Yes. Yeah, correct.

2251
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:14,960
Yeah, all right.

2252
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:16,280
Yeah, I got it. I got it.

2253
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:21,960
OK, so something adjacent to Hogan with a movie star.

2254
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:23,480
I know it would be nice if this happened.

2255
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:25,880
We won't celebrate Mr. Hogan for his

2256
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:29,560
racism. Hey, thanks for remembering.

2257
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:32,120
I almost forgot.

2258
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:35,440
OK, so this yeah, this song continues.

2259
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:38,040
It involves the made up word triumphal

2260
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:40,520
some point. Yeah.

2261
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:42,440
Triumphal.

2262
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:44,960
And then I got to play the end of the song.

2263
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,720
Here it is.

2264
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:48,040
Since when?

2265
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:49,440
I'm lucky and free.

2266
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:50,640
And lucky and free.

2267
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:51,840
It's the ball.

2268
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:54,960
Rock the ball.

2269
01:44:54,960 --> 01:45:00,200
Yes, I'm forced and never dies like the ball.

2270
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:04,520
Guys, rock the ball.

2271
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:06,880
Rock the pad.

2272
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:10,880
Now, that is all from a special you sent us.

2273
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:13,480
Yes. About the making of the Mighty Ducks.

2274
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:15,800
Yes, about their what the full inaugural season.

2275
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:18,960
And that's where you can see Michael Eisner at the draft table and everything.

2276
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:21,080
Yes. And that is one of the.

2277
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:23,960
The least.

2278
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:27,080
Did you use the term like no charisma?

2279
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:31,720
Like everyone seems a little logy in that special.

2280
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:36,480
Everyone seems a little like they just ate a big plate of whole Kogan's

2281
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:39,760
pasta media, like everyone's a little down.

2282
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:44,520
And it also features a lot of one of my least favorite looks in menswear,

2283
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:46,960
which is full suit with a baseball cap.

2284
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:50,760
Full suit with a baseball cap is is one of the dorkiest things.

2285
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:53,120
So I'm sorry, Mr. Eisner.

2286
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:57,040
You you are I guess you are allowed to do it because you are a powerful man.

2287
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:59,400
But it looks so corny.

2288
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:02,640
David Stern, the king of it, NBA commissioner David Stern.

2289
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:05,600
Yeah. But it was always pretty dumb.

2290
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:08,680
Yes. You know, I wasn't even planning to play this, but I should.

2291
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:11,280
But I think because it's introduced by a guy

2292
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:15,960
who's I think from a sponsor, some boring company, FHP.

2293
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:18,200
Oh, yeah. This is so much.

2294
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:21,720
If you if anyone seen my video sex offender shuffle from forever go,

2295
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:24,760
it's like intro by a guy who's like very sedate.

2296
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:26,680
And we made this video to tell you.

2297
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:30,280
And it's it's a lot like this guy from FHP.

2298
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:33,920
Also proud to be the sponsor of the Mighty Ducks inaugural video.

2299
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:37,720
Now sit back and enjoy Defenders of the Pond.

2300
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:42,960
And then he puts his hand on a lever and moves it up.

2301
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:45,600
And in a really unnatural way to like, yeah.

2302
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:50,760
FHP is a health care company.

2303
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:53,320
So I'm sure they're awesome.

2304
01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:55,640
Oh, I'm sure they've done good things.

2305
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:58,520
I'm sure if I don't, I think this was

2306
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:03,480
it seems like this went defunct in 1995.

2307
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:06,440
It's yes.

2308
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:09,000
All right. They were they worked in Guam.

2309
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:11,200
I'm sure they're doing good work and go.

2310
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:15,240
But then I think they FHM, FHP became Compracare.

2311
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:19,200
And none of these exist anymore. Compracare.

2312
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:24,120
Compracare, which became Remington, a division of Remington rifles.

2313
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:27,880
That was Philadelphia where the Flyers play.

2314
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:31,520
They had built this stadium in the mid 90s and it changed.

2315
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:37,120
It has changed names so many times because it is sponsored by a bank.

2316
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:40,920
So it was the core state center that became the first union center,

2317
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:46,680
which became the Wachovia Center, which is now the Wells Fargo Center.

2318
01:47:46,680 --> 01:47:49,200
So every time a bank would get

2319
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:54,840
absorbed by another bank, they would have to change the massive sign on the ice.

2320
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:57,560
It's to the dull at Wachovia.

2321
01:47:57,560 --> 01:47:59,120
God, these. Yeah.

2322
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:03,680
I think there's a number in like first civic center of.

2323
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:07,120
I so the dullest names. Yeah.

2324
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:11,200
I and the dullest man, I like that so much.

2325
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:15,480
I there's so much great and like ancillary.

2326
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:18,720
I don't want to talk about this too much because I'll just post the clip on Twitter

2327
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:20,640
because it'll play better there.

2328
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:24,840
But when you talk about very sedate guys, I also flipped through the.

2329
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:28,480
I was like, what did they do at intermission for this first Mighty Ducks game?

2330
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:32,640
And there's like a skit, if you can call it that, where two of the Mighty Ducks

2331
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,680
go have a relaxing day at Disneyland.

2332
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,000
And it is the most like dull, don't know where to look,

2333
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:44,360
decker acting type like, OK, so well, you know, boy, it's been

2334
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:47,680
it's been a rough and tumble season, doing all the training and doing weights.

2335
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:51,720
Now it's time to have a very relaxing day at Disneyland, a very relaxing ride.

2336
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:54,240
Teacups, that's we're going to go on now.

2337
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:57,520
And then they go on the teacups and like this was too much work,

2338
01:48:57,520 --> 01:48:59,880
actually had to turn teacups now feel sick.

2339
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:01,080
Now we got to do a different.

2340
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:04,840
Now we're going to go on a relaxing water ride.

2341
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:10,400
And then it cuts to them on the Matterhorn, which I guess says water at the end.

2342
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:11,760
Boy, I thought I was going to be relaxing.

2343
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:14,960
Water ride is end up being a scary roller coaster adventure.

2344
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:17,800
I wish we could do more relaxing.

2345
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:19,360
It's the dullest.

2346
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:23,000
I will post this entire film on Twitter.

2347
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:26,200
I am very delighted by it.

2348
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:30,240
Anyway, then they introduce all the players with so much pyro going on.

2349
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:32,960
And then the national anthem is performed by Melissa Etheridge.

2350
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:35,600
Wow. So much shit at this.

2351
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:39,560
This entire endeavor, this opening ceremony, I believe, cost half a million dollars.

2352
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,680
They really they super went all out.

2353
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:47,520
They wanted to make it a success and the results were mixed.

2354
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:50,520
Yeah, yeah.

2355
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:54,120
But, you know, a lot of things stuck around.

2356
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:57,160
Wild Wing, still the mascot to this day.

2357
01:49:57,160 --> 01:49:59,000
People love Wild Wing.

2358
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,400
Iceman didn't work out very well.

2359
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:03,560
But, you know, there was recently an oral history of the founding of the Ducks

2360
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:07,680
where they talked to Tim Ryan, the CEO of Honda Center,

2361
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:10,880
who was like a lower rung guy at the time, who says,

2362
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:13,360
I agree, this is what he said about Iceman.

2363
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:17,560
If you don't have a number of failed ideas, you're not trying hard enough.

2364
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:23,600
And I that I believe that in general, I think you got to throw shit at the wall

2365
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:25,680
and see what sticks.

2366
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:31,080
I think if the world and the entertainment industry would be as risky

2367
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:34,360
as the Mighty Ducks opening ceremony.

2368
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,040
I think that's right.

2369
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:39,320
I think they need to learn a lesson from the Mighty Ducks opening ceremony.

2370
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:43,520
I mean, I wish way more was like this.

2371
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:45,360
I truly.

2372
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:48,400
Yeah, I think we all speak for all three of us when I say

2373
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:51,040
I wish the world was always like this. Yeah.

2374
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:56,120
Everything, every aspect on a different varying budgets.

2375
01:50:56,160 --> 01:51:00,120
If you're opening up a retail store, I'd like some sort of long ceremony.

2376
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:02,480
I don't say they had one hundred dollars for it.

2377
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:06,000
What is that? What does the Iceman look like when the budget is slashed?

2378
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:08,840
If you even worse.

2379
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:11,560
Yes, we want to have white sunglasses, I guess.

2380
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,560
Right. He would just have those sunglasses and he says he's the Iceman

2381
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:18,120
and he's just pretending to play the guitar.

2382
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:18,760
And you're right.

2383
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:22,880
Every like the opening of a Marshall's should have original

2384
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:25,520
IP characters stunts.

2385
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:28,520
Hey, everybody, meet Mr. Marshall.

2386
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:31,800
Well, then you need like just to add conflict.

2387
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:36,600
Maybe you need a Hamburglar type villain like the demarcializer.

2388
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:40,200
Oh, do you start this shut down Marshall's?

2389
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:42,520
It's his nemesis, TJ Maxx.

2390
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:46,640
They actually name check the real

2391
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:51,240
seeing TJ Maxx and he's this like evil shock of hair.

2392
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:53,240
His fingers are lightning.

2393
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:56,560
He looks like the Maxx, the comic book character Jason. Yeah.

2394
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:00,560
From the old. Yeah, that was animated on liquid television.

2395
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:03,000
Just very gruesome.

2396
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:05,760
Aeon Aeon Flux style kind of art.

2397
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:10,960
Yeah. So he comes out and like bad news, your ex

2398
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:13,600
and puts his hands up in an X and that makes.

2399
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:16,720
I mean, I don't know how you do this practically.

2400
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:22,400
You know, maybe just like a then just like a bunch of streamers are thrown.

2401
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:25,880
From the expired Lindt truffles at him.

2402
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:33,520
And then the children who were there all need to say, we chant.

2403
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:35,680
We love Marshall's in order to

2404
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:39,360
D Maxxify TJ Maxx.

2405
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:41,840
Yeah, I've sent you a picture of the Maxx, Scott, if you want to take.

2406
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:43,560
Oh, yes. Let me see.

2407
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:46,400
Let me see if I approve this design as also being a DJ.

2408
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:50,880
Oh, damn, geez. This guy's terrifying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2409
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:56,360
And you need to be to represent the threat that TJ Maxx poses to clearly

2410
01:52:56,360 --> 01:53:00,240
the good store and the battle of good and evil stores.

2411
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:03,800
Marshall's. Yeah. Everything should be like this.

2412
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:06,360
Yeah. Yeah, please.

2413
01:53:06,360 --> 01:53:09,360
And I let me like

2414
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:12,320
let me add one more kind of crazy thing to all this.

2415
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:15,720
I think I have this photo around this.

2416
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:16,960
This is really weird.

2417
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:23,560
I independently of the like back in March a long time ago,

2418
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:27,600
I saw something on Twitter and I took a screenshot of it like that's cool

2419
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:29,600
because it was so up my 80s,

2420
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:33,960
you know, Tomorrowland Valley.

2421
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:37,360
And I OK.

2422
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:41,280
So it was a Twitter user named Attraction Faction.

2423
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:44,600
I'm having trouble finding it now, but

2424
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:49,080
I it was a photo of a

2425
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:53,280
Tomorrowland Space Band, not Halyx,

2426
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:56,440
different Tomorrowland Space Band.

2427
01:53:57,320 --> 01:54:00,800
Let me let me reprise how Halyx came up the first time a long time ago.

2428
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:04,800
Have you guys ever heard the word Transtar?

2429
01:54:05,800 --> 01:54:07,200
No, I will.

2430
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:08,920
I will leave you to just on your own.

2431
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:13,160
Just there might be like two results if you Google Disneyland Transtar.

2432
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:16,840
Actually, it's confusing because they just have a bus system now called Transtar.

2433
01:54:17,640 --> 01:54:20,800
But look up Disneyland Transtar music.

2434
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:26,400
And what you will find is a different Tomorrowland Space Band, not Halyx.

2435
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:30,200
And they are performing in front of the Star Speeder

2436
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:33,600
that brought Iceman out onto the ice at the inaugural game.

2437
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:38,840
Wow. I mean, this looks fucking awesome.

2438
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:41,080
I love Transtar.

2439
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:44,240
OK, I'm just getting pictures of trucks.

2440
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:46,480
Hold on.

2441
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:49,640
But one of the in one one of the results is a bus

2442
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:52,080
that is called a Transtar on fire. Yeah.

2443
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:53,360
Oh, yeah. Here they are.

2444
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:55,440
I was also going to say that

2445
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:59,560
the word Transtar would make those traditional sports fans uncomfortable, too.

2446
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:03,160
It's a little it's a sniffy word for them. Yes. Yeah.

2447
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:06,840
Oh, yeah. We go. Transtar. Yeah. You see them.

2448
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:12,280
Wow. Shit. I separately saw this on Twitter in March

2449
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:15,520
and like, oh, my God, what is this? I've never heard a Transtar.

2450
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:18,200
And then months later, I'm watching this opening ceremony.

2451
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:19,880
Oh, my God. It's the same Star Speeder.

2452
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:22,920
Wow. Do we have to have you heard any audio? Is that is there anything exists?

2453
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:27,560
I have not. And this is where I throw it to you.

2454
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:30,360
Listener, are you an enterprising documentarian

2455
01:55:30,360 --> 01:55:35,360
who can track down all of the audio of a different Tomorrowland space band

2456
01:55:35,640 --> 01:55:38,760
from the late 80s as opposed to the early 80s?

2457
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:40,880
We got a HALIX documentary going.

2458
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:42,920
It's time to get a Transtar documentary going.

2459
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:45,760
Wow. Transtar. That's crazy.

2460
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:47,840
Yeah. Yeah. It just goes and goes.

2461
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:52,720
And like more and Transtar, by the way, they are in silver jumpsuits.

2462
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:57,160
In some cases, one of them is playing like a future, like a sitar.

2463
01:55:57,480 --> 01:56:00,400
And the other one's just playing a Casio, just playing keyboard.

2464
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:03,560
Yeah. And then they've got like a Paul Abdul type dancer

2465
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:07,480
in like purple shorts, purple sparkly shorts.

2466
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:10,360
There's one photo that exists.

2467
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,920
And it's just on Pinterest, it looks like.

2468
01:56:13,240 --> 01:56:15,800
Are you seeing another one, Scott?

2469
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:18,520
I am not, although there is a

2470
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:22,560
a video results Disneyland December 1990 part two.

2471
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:24,280
It's somebody's home movies.

2472
01:56:24,280 --> 01:56:28,080
But they put Transtar in the tags, which makes me think that maybe

2473
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:29,800
they have footage of Transtar.

2474
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:32,920
That might be the only existing video footage thing.

2475
01:56:33,080 --> 01:56:35,960
Oh, my God. This video has a walk around Dick Tracy.

2476
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:39,080
What? It's a small world.

2477
01:56:39,080 --> 01:56:40,760
Somebody. Oh, my God.

2478
01:56:40,760 --> 01:56:43,040
And a walker at you guys, a walk around.

2479
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:46,920
Who's the it's not the Al Pacino villain.

2480
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:49,440
Let me let me just screen share.

2481
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:51,720
Face could be prune face here.

2482
01:56:51,720 --> 01:56:56,680
Let me let me show you what villain is this flat top.

2483
01:56:57,280 --> 01:56:59,160
Yeah, maybe flat top flat top.

2484
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:01,400
It's flat in the aesthetics.

2485
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:04,040
Yeah, we watched Dick Tracy a week ago.

2486
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:05,880
We I watched it during quarantine as well.

2487
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:07,120
What do you think?

2488
01:57:07,120 --> 01:57:08,840
I actually had never seen all of it.

2489
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:10,480
I never seen it.

2490
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:13,280
It's it's good. It's good.

2491
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:16,040
There's parts that bring me a lot of joy.

2492
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:18,360
Yeah, there's some really cool stuff.

2493
01:57:18,360 --> 01:57:20,600
And then there's some stuff where I go, well, that's like,

2494
01:57:20,600 --> 01:57:23,720
like when he's beating the guy up in the shed at the end or the start.

2495
01:57:23,720 --> 01:57:24,920
Excuse me.

2496
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:26,440
That's a very cool long shot.

2497
01:57:26,440 --> 01:57:28,280
And that's creative with the way the background is.

2498
01:57:28,280 --> 01:57:30,120
And then like there's other shots where you're like,

2499
01:57:30,120 --> 01:57:34,120
they just painted this wall red and yellow to make it look like a comic book.

2500
01:57:34,120 --> 01:57:36,280
And it feels lazy. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2501
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:39,840
It feels oddly cheap at times, but so much great Pacino scenery.

2502
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:41,720
Chewing Pacino is fantastic.

2503
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:43,160
Oh, so much fun.

2504
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:45,040
I want to charge.

2505
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:48,360
Um, guys, this is video footage of Trance.

2506
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:49,560
I think we can do this.

2507
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:51,200
This is all this into a new episode.

2508
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:52,320
We're just. Yeah, yeah, that's right.

2509
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:53,080
Yeah, you just keep.

2510
01:57:53,080 --> 01:57:56,560
All right. And now the Trance star episode begins.

2511
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:58,000
Welcome to the second gate here now.

2512
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,520
Trance star.

2513
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:06,960
They're playing Ghostbusters.

2514
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:08,520
Yes.

2515
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:12,440
What good results.

2516
01:58:12,440 --> 01:58:14,600
Now, what I'm wondering is, is this ice man?

2517
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:18,840
Because he's playing a guitar in his sunglasses and a hat.

2518
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:23,120
Oh, my God.

2519
01:58:25,080 --> 01:58:27,040
What is this sound?

2520
01:58:30,760 --> 01:58:33,280
It's like it's a space.

2521
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:34,440
Space.

2522
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:41,400
Sorry, sorry.

2523
01:58:41,400 --> 01:58:42,600
Let me take it.

2524
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:44,760
It's Christmas time at Disneyland.

2525
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:47,400
There's a party going on at the haunted man's Shan.

2526
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:50,080
We we just we got it.

2527
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:50,960
I know we got to.

2528
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:53,320
We're hitting two hours.

2529
01:58:53,320 --> 01:58:57,760
Yeah. But guys, I guys, it's the space band

2530
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:02,520
at Christmas doing Ghostbusters.

2531
01:59:02,840 --> 01:59:05,040
This is a 30 minute long video, too.

2532
01:59:05,800 --> 01:59:08,800
Well, no, it's just call it stops being part.

2533
01:59:09,680 --> 01:59:11,080
Should we cut and just go?

2534
01:59:11,080 --> 01:59:13,600
I mean, we're going to have to do it right now, but I feel like we got it.

2535
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:15,120
I think we got it. We got it.

2536
01:59:15,120 --> 01:59:16,960
We got this. Oh, my God.

2537
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:18,520
There's I can't see.

2538
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:22,040
Can you believe how much was here in the in the the opening ceremony

2539
01:59:22,040 --> 01:59:24,200
of the fucking hockey team?

2540
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:26,760
We ended up there's like

2541
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:29,880
I feel like we came up with seven episodes just within this one.

2542
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:32,320
This was a good harvest, gentlemen.

2543
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:33,600
Yeah, why?

2544
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:37,640
I even I knew a lot of information, but I didn't even realize it was so rich

2545
01:59:37,640 --> 01:59:39,960
until we're here. We're sitting here two hours in.

2546
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:42,520
Fuck, boy, that just I didn't either.

2547
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:43,520
I knew I had a lot.

2548
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:46,760
I knew I had coin thieves and Iceman, but right.

2549
01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:48,640
But an entire.

2550
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:49,640
Oh, boy.

2551
01:59:49,640 --> 01:59:53,240
Maybe what we should do is whenever they're done with that Halyx documentary,

2552
01:59:53,240 --> 01:59:56,200
we should kind of let's talk about Halyx a little longer

2553
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:58,480
and let's talk about Transtar. Sure.

2554
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:02,480
Yeah. Well, my question is, does Transtar have original songs?

2555
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:04,720
Yeah. And I don't know.

2556
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:05,840
I don't know the answer to that.

2557
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:09,320
It seems like they're free styling over popular songs,

2558
02:00:09,320 --> 02:00:11,640
which is pretty I'm very intrigued.

2559
02:00:11,960 --> 02:00:14,800
Yeah. Which which once again, I mean, that was a very bold

2560
02:00:15,400 --> 02:00:17,600
choice and solo over Ghostbusters.

2561
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:19,280
They really made it their own.

2562
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:22,440
Yes. So they're almost they're veering on original.

2563
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:24,720
Fuck, this is so good.

2564
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:28,400
So, well, hey, listeners, if you know anything about Transtar,

2565
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:32,560
if you know someone in Transtar and if you want to just start

2566
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:35,520
making your own documentary about Transtar, if you want to be the next

2567
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:38,080
Matt Serrano, then have at it.

2568
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:42,760
And or Matt, do it if you if you want to be yourself again.

2569
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:48,400
But otherwise, we have to move on because I am I am spent.

2570
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:50,800
This was this was a lot.

2571
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:57,600
Boy, I feel as low energy as the crowd that Iceman is attempting to pump up.

2572
02:00:59,720 --> 02:01:02,000
Can I throw one little fact that I thought was very funny?

2573
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,320
Real quickly. Yeah.

2574
02:01:03,320 --> 02:01:06,280
Yeah. The year after Disney sold the team,

2575
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:08,560
they won the whole they won the.

2576
02:01:13,080 --> 02:01:14,080
Perfect.

2577
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:16,600
It doesn't get better than that.

2578
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:21,240
Well, congratulations.

2579
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:25,560
And yeah, you know, I also can't not say the fact that

2580
02:01:26,160 --> 02:01:30,000
that Mighty Ducks, the mighty dogs of an Hime,

2581
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:35,000
that they that song was then repurposed in D2,

2582
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:39,320
the Mighty Ducks, but to broaden it out and because if you remember the story,

2583
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:42,840
they had gone to say like it would not be Olympics, but an Olympics type

2584
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:44,320
world event.

2585
02:01:44,320 --> 02:01:49,720
They changed the lyrics to the mighty, the mighty dogs of America.

2586
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:53,040
Great. Unbelievable.

2587
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:55,720
Like a true life team, America, America.

2588
02:01:55,720 --> 02:01:57,720
Fuck. Yeah. Yeah.

2589
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:01,120
Incredible. So great job, Disney.

2590
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:03,880
Great job, America.

2591
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:04,960
Great job, listeners.

2592
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:08,800
You survived podcast, the ride Super Size Mighty Ducks Edition.

2593
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:12,960
I maybe should I re queue up that last,

2594
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:16,440
maybe just one more taste of the song and we'll and we'll go out on that.

2595
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:20,080
Yeah, of course. All right. Let's let's do that.

2596
02:02:20,640 --> 02:02:25,120
You'll first see the dynamic logo of FHP Healthcare.

2597
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:29,440
But this was great. And I got to say, I feel really triumphal.

2598
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:31,480
Thanks, everyone, for listening.

2599
02:02:31,480 --> 02:02:33,440
Take us out. Anonymous singer.

2600
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:36,320
Fire in the rise.

2601
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:38,720
You'll see them challenging the odds.

2602
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:41,480
Don't beat them. Power is a crime.

2603
02:02:41,800 --> 02:02:44,320
Unleash this danger on the eyes.

2604
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:45,920
Me say.

2605
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:51,960
The mighty dogs of America.

2606
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:57,680
A surge of wolves that never die.

2607
02:02:58,760 --> 02:03:02,760
The mighty dogs of America.

2608
02:03:03,880 --> 02:03:08,560
A surge of wolves that never die.
