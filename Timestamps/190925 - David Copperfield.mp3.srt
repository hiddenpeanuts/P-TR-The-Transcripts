1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate magic edition.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,480
I don't know, I didn't prepare that.

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,480
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,720
My name is Mike Carlson.

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,720
Jason Sheridan is here.

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,720
Hi.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,720
And Scott Gairner.

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,720
Hi there.

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,880
This is an episode, this is another theme park adjacent episode because it's about a

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,040
show that happens in Las Vegas.

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,680
But as Jason Sheridan, who does not know anything about what Scott and I are going to be telling

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,880
him today, this has all the elements you would want from a theme park experience.

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,640
And I didn't know this going into seeing this show.

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,320
We're talking of course about David Copperfield's Las Vegas show at the MGM Grand.

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,320
MGM Grand.

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,000
And he's been performing there for a number of years, but this is the show that is currently

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,840
at the MGM Grand at the Hollywood Theater.

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,640
It might be the David Copperfield Theater now.

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,920
It is the David Copperfield Theater, yes.

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,160
Okay, sure.

22
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,440
And I think he's been doing this particular show since 2013.

23
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,080
And it is something.

24
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:27,680
If you're a longtime listener of podcast The Ride, you've heard me refer to it and

25
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,120
say recommend it as highly as possible and say go into it with no spoilers.

26
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,120
It's pretty crucial.

27
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,760
And I will say this, if you're listening to this and you think there's any odds of you

28
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,320
seeing this show, it is so much better without knowing the stuff that we're going to say.

29
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,280
And I almost feel guilt right now.

30
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:53,080
I feel like we should be recording this podcast in masks like the Fox's famed masked magician,

31
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,000
of course, because we're going to rip the lid off of some secrets.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,640
Although, except not because this is publicly available.

33
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,320
We're not going to say how he does his tricks.

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
No.

35
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
No illusions, rather.

36
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,520
Yes, but like a great magician, you two are going to make an episode appear because I

37
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,720
have purposely not done any research for this other than learning the show is billed as

38
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,800
an evening of grand illusion.

39
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,720
Then I started reading about the accommodations on the Copperfield Island.

40
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,400
Oh, complex.

41
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,760
OK, I have some of this too.

42
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,600
OK, so so so here, let me let me say that.

43
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,640
All right. I also have I am getting over a head cold.

44
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,400
The last couple of recordings, I have had a cold, so I'm a little out of it.

45
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,960
So I am prepared to be I'm ready to be dazzled.

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,160
Yeah, it seems like your brain could use a good dazzling and that's where we're going to.

47
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,040
So Mike and I have now seen the show and I haven't talked to Mike about it.

48
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,840
And I'm so excited.

49
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,520
Very little. Maybe texted.

50
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,280
Oh, you saw it. And then just the right the immediately after.

51
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,600
And then you talked about him for a year.

52
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
You have talked about this show for a while.

53
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,920
It's been a long time. Yeah, I think I saw it at the beginning of 2018.

54
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,800
I forget 2017 even a hundred percent credit to Jason Waller, our friend and guest of the show

55
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,920
from the Hard Rock Park episode, among other things.

56
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,640
He's the one who really like this.

57
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,840
You need to see this and you need to know nothing.

58
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:21,960
But Jason, Jason Sheridan seems like, you know, you're OK with us spoiling the secrets.

59
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:27,600
You know, I'm a guy I like to I'll read a few pages ahead in a book and flip back.

60
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,520
Like I even if I know the conclusion, I like like the journey.

61
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,080
I was a real magic kid growing up to I never did matter.

62
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,440
I got I think I had like one or two magic kits.

63
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,320
But like if there was a special on TV, I was making sure to watch it or tape it.

64
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,640
And if I missed it, I was sad.

65
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,520
And this David Copperfield show, a bit of an expensive ticket.

66
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,840
So chances are you're not going to end up seeing it.

67
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,760
I feel like I saw tickets not super expensive.

68
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,320
Well, if you compare it to artist residency, it was the most

69
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,480
expensive show we saw of the three. OK.

70
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,200
So, yeah. So I think it feels like it still is on the higher end of ticket.

71
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,880
I would say without like super bumping up a ton, we were in the front row.

72
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,840
Like for a was available.

73
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,320
It's with. Well, why not?

74
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,120
It was not like a massive price increase to do it,

75
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,720
which meant that at the end of the show, we got to high five him.

76
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,160
He well, he walked by us.

77
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,320
We were a little farther back.

78
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,760
He walked by us and I grinded him so wide

79
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,880
and I was hoping he would like fist bump or something.

80
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,840
And no, he just barreled through it.

81
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,120
He's been you say he's been doing this show for a while.

82
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,280
This was not one that ended and began like Chris Angel has done a couple shows.

83
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,400
Right. And he's moved venues a few times.

84
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,640
Yes. Chris Angel's still always involves him curing, curing

85
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,080
child childhood cancer. Right. OK. Yeah.

86
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,640
I just want to make sure I wasn't confused. Yeah.

87
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,000
I've also seen that.

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,640
Yes. So, yeah, you went to that. Yeah.

89
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,920
Pretty good. We're not going to talk about that.

90
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,160
This is this is I mean, that that thing is is fun.

91
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,280
But but you know, yeah, I don't think either of us

92
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,800
could have predicted the wonder in store.

93
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,880
I couldn't believe it.

94
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,400
I couldn't believe it.

95
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,800
I was grinning again.

96
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,600
I was grinning so wide when the thing happens in the middle of the show.

97
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,400
That happens. Yeah.

98
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,000
Because I couldn't I wouldn't have predicted it.

99
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,880
I thought it was along the lines maybe of the Chris Angel thing

100
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,560
where it's like he cures cancer or it's like just a crazy sort of like

101
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,480
silly pompous sort of trick or yeah, like just a crazy set up

102
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,720
or something like that or but what happens is there there is a story.

103
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,720
I think it's almost divided into thirds.

104
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,360
The first hour is a is a is a very good David Copperfield show.

105
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,360
And then the last third takes a turn and he take he weaves a tale

106
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,840
that you cannot believe.

107
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,600
But, you know, let me just as he saves the magic, the real magic for the end.

108
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,680
I don't want listeners to tune into this and be immediately told,

109
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,640
don't listen, go to the thing.

110
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,000
You're paying for this episode.

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,240
So you need to get a little bit of fun.

112
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,960
Even if you do intend on on on seeing Copperfield live the impossible.

113
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,520
So I think this is a good opportunity to talk about the other ways

114
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,360
that David Copperfield's interacts with the theme park world.

115
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,080
The main way being if you went to Disney MGM Studios

116
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,680
in the mid 90s is a little obscure, but you might remember it because this

117
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,920
these signs were in front of the park.

118
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,920
So a lot of people passed by him.

119
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,480
There was sort of a double billboard saying coming soon.

120
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,240
And on the right was Phantasmic, which, of course, did come to Disney MGM Studios.

121
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,080
And on the left was a sort of Gothic torch

122
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,520
laden logo for something called CMU Copperfield Magic Underground.

123
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,080
This was to be a magic themed restaurant

124
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,400
that sat outside Disney MGM Studios that maybe you could get in from,

125
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,240
you know, like Allah Rainforest Cafe in Animal Kingdom.

126
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,840
Yes, you could.

127
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,960
This is this is such a weird, reoccurring theme park rumor trope.

128
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,160
There will be a restaurant next to a park that you can enter

129
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,720
from outside the park or from inside the park.

130
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,600
And I think if you hear that,

131
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,120
it pretty much guarantees it will never come to pass.

132
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,800
Like the Great Hall restaurant at like

133
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,920
Universal Studios Hollywood, like the big dining room from the Harry Potter movies.

134
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,880
You could enter from in the park or from city walk.

135
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,480
And that never came to happen.

136
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,120
Oh, I didn't know there was that.

137
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,880
That was a rumor.

138
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,760
I mean, they never they never announced that.

139
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,440
They never announced that.

140
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,480
That was what we were seeing on the city boards for a long time.

141
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,200
Clearly announced. Yeah. Yes.

142
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:45,080
And the expansion pad is still unoccupied, I believe.

143
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,720
Oh, sure. Oh, they cleared land and there's just nothing there.

144
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,000
Nothing's ever been built there.

145
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,200
It's it's around that area of Phantasm.

146
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,720
It was like back that side of the park.

147
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,120
It was like part of that.

148
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,160
It was going to be right next to this whole new wing.

149
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,480
Right. Which meant like, what a good double.

150
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,800
Like Copperfield's come and and Phantasm.

151
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,240
Dinner and a show.

152
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,080
Yeah. Just to digress a little bit.

153
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,200
Can't you enter the Rainforest Cafe at Animal Kingdom?

154
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,720
That's what he said. Yeah.

155
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,320
So that one does exist.

156
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,800
It is. OK, sorry.

157
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,240
I was double checking while you said it.

158
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,040
Copperfield Magic Underground CMU, which by with those initials,

159
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,760
I'd just like to say I'm glad the restaurant wasn't called

160
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,080
Copperfield's Underground Magic.

161
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,280
I'm glad the CMU was not rearranged.

162
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,400
Yes, they sure they just think

163
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,320
those letters with torches come out of.

164
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,040
So at least they are.

165
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,880
So at least the order of the restaurant was good.

166
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,040
Not not much else worked out for this endeavor.

167
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,440
First things first.

168
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,640
OK, the only way is that this thing was and there was a sign outside

169
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,920
of Disney Studios, but also a truly delightful photo.

170
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:59,000
And I boy, I'm jealous of the audience members who haven't seen this picture.

171
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,080
There was a promotional photo.

172
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,640
There is a the Disney MGM Studios logo on the left.

173
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,720
There is a red magician's curtain.

174
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,520
David Copperfield is in a black turtleneck and he is waving his hands

175
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,720
and he's making rolled up blueprints float midair.

176
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:18,840
They say plans and top secrets and Copperfield Magic Underground.

177
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,200
And you can tell that it is floating of its own volition

178
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,560
because there is a ring being held up, showing that there's no strings inside.

179
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,120
And the ring is being held by Copperfield's assistant for the day,

180
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:38,160
Michael Eisner, who is in his weabiest pose, perhaps ever.

181
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,560
In evening in a tuxedo.

182
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,960
He's got a bow tie, like a spotted bow tie.

183
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,040
Is that what I'm well zoom way in?

184
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,880
Is it Mickey? It's Mickey.

185
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,680
It's a Mickey patterned bow tie that is like so crunching his neck

186
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,720
to where he has no neck.

187
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,600
Essentially, this photo is so delightful.

188
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,440
I remember just I remember seeing that sign in this picture and like, oh, my God.

189
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,360
Magic restaurant.

190
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,160
This is going to be nuts.

191
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,400
Copperfield dressed like Steve Jobs.

192
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,280
Yeah, like a black turtleneck jeans.

193
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,840
Yeah, absolutely.

194
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:18,400
I wonder if he requested like, hey, can I can Eisner look especially dorky

195
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,640
so that I look especially cool next to him?

196
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,640
When you sent you sent us that picture with no context.

197
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,720
And I think that's the shorthand we have of every now and then one of us

198
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,920
will find something that's just like pure catmip or it's like,

199
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,960
no explanation is required.

200
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah. And we'll like skip ahead like clear.

201
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,440
All right. I've been clearly down the research rabbit hole.

202
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Let me show you what I ended up at.

203
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,680
Do you guys know about this restaurant?

204
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,320
I did. Yeah.

205
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,040
This is the Times Square thing, too.

206
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,000
Yep. Yeah. Yep.

207
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,120
So we're going to do this.

208
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,640
And so you know some of that. Yeah. OK.

209
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,000
The reason that it did not happen, there was going to be one and two.

210
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,080
One was Times Square.

211
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,000
One was Disney World.

212
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And hopefully they were saying locations to follow in Anaheim, Paris,

213
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,600
and Schomburg Mall.

214
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,520
All of that. What? Yeah.

215
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,080
If only.

216
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,760
So they started building the Times Square one.

217
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,000
And this is like deep in the eyes on Broadway and 49th and around the street.

218
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,800
But they I had no idea how far this got.

219
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,200
It was 85 percent to completion. Oh, my God.

220
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,920
Yeah. They dumped so much money into this.

221
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,360
It was a it's a giant.

222
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,120
It's a four story, like massive indoor atrium that they cleared out.

223
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,800
They're they started building the I don't know how much of the outside

224
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,920
ended up going up.

225
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,840
But it was it was going to have a 40 foot tall copper field statue,

226
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,960
15 foot torches that lit up with flame constantly.

227
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,400
Huge neon signs that like all lit up and then went to black as if it disappeared

228
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,160
and then back on and back off.

229
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,440
All of this power just on the outside of the Times Square restaurant

230
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,960
was going to it was like it would have been as much power as an entire

231
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,040
average 40 foot skyscraper in New York generated.

232
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,560
Wow. Outside doesn't count the inside where there's many, many

233
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,120
copper field statues. They even refer to them as David's creepily.

234
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,080
There was full of David's every single hour.

235
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,560
A different restaurant patron would be selected to get cut up

236
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,720
by an ever revolving circular saw.

237
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,760
So like constant illusions everywhere.

238
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,360
And because of this, like, OK, it's it's an outside restaurant

239
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,440
group that I think started calling themselves late night magic.

240
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,600
And late night magic was financing this entire thing.

241
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,160
Copperfield did not put in one dime himself.

242
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,840
That's the smart play. So smart.

243
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,520
He had money to spend on buying Bahamas.

244
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,880
Yeah, I'm paying full Bahamas.

245
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,400
So, you know, he's because there's they want this to be a restaurant

246
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,440
where there's magic going around all around you and you can walk all the way around.

247
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,400
It's like it needs to be 360 degree illusions.

248
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,280
There can't be any sign of trickery going on anywhere.

249
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,440
So he's noting everything to death.

250
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,240
And rightfully so, because this is his art form, but his notes end up

251
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,400
involving like what he's suggesting means we have to repore the foundation.

252
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,880
Like we have to undo everything.

253
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:23,320
So cause our skyrocketing in the specific quarter

254
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,040
where he's doing so many shows, it's like it's around New Year's Eve.

255
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,480
He's doing a ton of shows they can't they can barely get a hold of him,

256
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,040
but he'll call it three in the morning and go, all right, here's notes

257
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,000
that change everything that you guys are doing there.

258
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,920
And in this quarter, the Planet Hollywood stock plummeted.

259
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,080
So it's becoming clear that the bottom is falling out on the theme restaurant craze.

260
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,480
So they the late night magic investors start thinking, all right,

261
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,640
we're building a great magic restaurant.

262
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,360
But with this copper film guy, we are sick of taking his notes and dealing with him.

263
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,800
What if we staged a coup?

264
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:01,840
What if we bailed on Copperfield and instead just plug and play Lance Burton,

265
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,040
his main rival, who played at the Monte Carlo for many years.

266
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,120
That's not even Coke to Pepsi.

267
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,480
That's Coke to like sub RC.

268
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,200
I like RC.

269
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,240
I don't even want to be salt them by comparing that like you as a kid.

270
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,120
You like to magic.

271
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,920
Oh, you were an anti Lance Burton kid.

272
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,960
I went out of Lance Burton in the context of now.

273
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,320
I'm like, oh, Lance Burton.

274
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,560
I had a Lance Burton magic kid as a kid.

275
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,280
Really? Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

276
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,200
So I wasn't so negative on Lance.

277
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:37,120
I watch it, but I know I'm imagining it's important to contextualize your younger

278
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,720
like David Copperfield.

279
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,000
I think it's safe to say one of the most famous people in America in the 90s.

280
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,960
Right. Yeah.

281
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,520
Which just literally Lance Burton was not.

282
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,360
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

283
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,000
Yeah. Cover this like just transcended the the genre so thoroughly.

284
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,760
Yeah. I think that's what I'm reacting.

285
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,880
I'm not saying Lance Burton is not a talented illusionist, but like that.

286
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,600
That down.

287
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,080
I think Patreon subscriber Lance Burton is going to be crying after he hears this.

288
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,160
Lance Burton doing a Vegas residency.

289
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,240
What does he do? I think you retired on.

290
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,680
Did he? I mean, that's fair.

291
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,880
Wrong. I know.

292
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,120
I wish I'm going to make Jason disappear.

293
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,160
It's fine. I will.

294
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,200
I will be murdered by Lance Burton.

295
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,240
Oh, you know what?

296
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,160
This is all this is bringing something back up in my brain.

297
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,120
Did I find a movie that Lance Burton produced a year ago?

298
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,960
And did I send it to you? Oh, yes.

299
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,200
That's right. Yes.

300
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,360
Oh, my God. I sent you maybe this might be two or three years ago.

301
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,680
Very like shot in Vegas.

302
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,320
She. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

303
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,160
Oh, no. We have to do that.

304
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,760
Episode two. Yep. Yep.

305
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,720
Yeah. That's right. He retired, but he has like made some movies since.

306
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,000
What shady other people are in this film that I totally forgot about that.

307
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,600
Yeah. It's like filmed in like unlit corners of Casino.

308
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,760
Oh, it's called Billy Toppett.

309
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh, my God.

310
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,720
Uh huh.

311
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,040
Billy Toppett, master magician.

312
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,040
Hold on. It's from 2015.

313
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,320
3.7 out of 10 on IMDB.

314
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,760
Lance Burton, Paul Draper.

315
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,560
Oh, I don't know any of these people.

316
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,680
There's no other recognizable name.

317
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,840
Not in Billy Toppett, at least.

318
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,840
Let's see. Lance Burton directed it.

319
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,920
Oh, my God. Self-directed.

320
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,200
Boy.

321
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,360
Oh, wow. OK.

322
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,760
If only else this makes me have to ask Chris Angel, why are you sleeping on?

323
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,120
Make a feature film.

324
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,800
Yes, please.

325
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,840
Imagine scored by Jonathan Davis of corn.

326
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,840
The sort of the sorting store he could get out of his body.

327
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,000
And when I saw Chris Angel, of course, Pitbull came on stage at the end of the show,

328
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,880
which was unbelievable.

329
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,480
I was so excited.

330
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,520
So getting so.

331
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,720
Yeah, he's he's buddies with everybody who's great.

332
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,400
Pitbull's acting in the thing.

333
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:58,720
Wow.

334
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,400
It's time. The angel film.

335
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,480
But I don't understand appearance.

336
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,960
Anyway, Billy Toppett coming soon.

337
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,520
Yeah. Yeah.

338
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,880
To Patreon.

339
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,960
Well, but so the fact that I don't think our listeners have heard of Billy Toppett.

340
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,920
It shows the draw that Lance Burton has maybe outside of

341
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,080
anything that isn't come see me do magic in a theater.

342
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,320
So they do attempt the coup.

343
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,840
They float by Disney.

344
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,520
Hey, we're having a little bit of trouble, David.

345
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,720
Hey, we were thinking about maybe switching after Lance Burton.

346
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,840
And Disney said, do you think we want to cross Copperfield?

347
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,120
Are you out of your minds?

348
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,960
They are against the coup.

349
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,040
They say we're not part of it if you do the coup.

350
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,520
They still went to Lance Burton's people who said,

351
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,560
do you think he's just he's just a copy?

352
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,720
Lance Burton is a copy of no one.

353
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,160
You're just going to take the thing you built for Copperfield and slap Lance on it.

354
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,120
You're out of your minds.

355
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,280
Not to mention you think we want to cross Copperfield.

356
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,800
That's the power that got real bad.

357
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,160
So the coup doesn't work.

358
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,520
Just like all that does is slow everything down and eventually the property is seized back,

359
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,520
having been built 85% out in the restaurant, never opens.

360
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,200
Now, this is this is a deep Jim Hill media find because he goes into all this and he

361
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,320
points out an incredible detail on the exterior of what was supposed to be

362
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,480
Copperfield Magic Underground and is today a sabaro.

363
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,120
That's all it became is a sabaro.

364
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,520
But if you look on the outside of the sabaro, it's like very like

365
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,520
back lot brownstone kind of vibe.

366
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:39,120
And there are cracks in the brownstone in a very Indiana Jones temple sort of where like

367
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,720
as if the power of magic is surging through the building and causing it to crack apart.

368
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:51,920
So this random sabaro has the theming still in 2019 meant for Copperfield restaurant.

369
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,560
Man, that's a magical sabaro.

370
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,280
Yeah, yeah.

371
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,840
There was a New York Times article that ripped the lid off of all of this and

372
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,920
an industry insider said, I can't think of another single restaurant entertainment

373
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,360
disaster of this magnitude.

374
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:06,880
Yeah.

375
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,520
Oh, and wait, and to that end, let me say the number.

376
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,280
None of this was Copperfield's money.

377
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,640
The investors all told lost 34 million dollars.

378
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,560
With no restaurant.

379
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,000
That's when you really like figure out that like there's no repercussions for like rich people.

380
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,760
Like how where does that go?

381
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,680
Thirty four million dollars gone.

382
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,800
Money is real.

383
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,120
Fine.

384
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,080
It's the money's not real.

385
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,280
When I looked them up, they're still they're on boards of their health care board of directors.

386
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:33,840
Oh, my God.

387
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,280
Yeah, yeah, they're gross.

388
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,080
They're doing fine.

389
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

390
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,520
It is wild.

391
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,400
Yeah.

392
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,360
Running out of money.

393
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,440
The 90s revitalization, late 80s, 90s revitalization of Times Square.

394
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,760
There was plenty of money there.

395
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,120
As soon as you started talking, I'm like, well, they definitely didn't run out of money, right?

396
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,720
Because there was so much money floating around at that time.

397
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,960
And of course, it's just insane egos, like insane requests and stuff.

398
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,560
Also, building anything is expensive.

399
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:12,560
Building in New York City in Times Square is the most expensive thing.

400
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,160
Yeah, they literally for this kicked out to adult theaters.

401
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,960
That's what was there.

402
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,160
This is so much the Giuliani era, Disney, FK, absolutely Times Square.

403
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:30,320
But yeah, I don't like and how is like even it's like we're in a weird corner now and it's like a sublet with Bucca di Beppo.

404
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,120
But still, how is Planet Hollywood in Times Square?

405
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:40,880
How is like this decaying brand with decaying carpet like the filthiest carpet in that in that times?

406
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,680
You're a Hollywood.

407
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,040
How is it?

408
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,840
How can it afford that?

409
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,320
How planet?

410
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,680
How many planet Hollywoods are left?

411
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,240
Six or something like that one in Disney Springs, Disney Springs, Times Square.

412
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,320
I just this year, Vegas.

413
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,080
Yeah, it's still in Caesar's.

414
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,720
It moved downgraded, downgraded in Times Square.

415
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,560
OK, I needed that Times Square one a couple of times.

416
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,880
A couple of times in the 2000s.

417
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,400
Yeah, I think Aaron had her or my wife had her 13th birthday there, I believe.

418
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,800
And we went and had champagne there on the night of our fifth wedding anniversary.

419
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,840
Very yes.

420
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,640
Yeah, we did not have our meal there.

421
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,680
Let me say that we're not that ironic.

422
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:28,160
Is there any connection to what we talked about this a little bit on our City Walk Saga,

423
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:35,920
Wizards restaurant, which is a magic themed restaurant, very what, three stories?

424
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,720
Four stories?

425
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,040
Yeah.

426
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,440
That seems very similar.

427
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,280
I wonder if there's any connection.

428
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,240
We could look into that.

429
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,600
Maybe not.

430
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,920
Obviously, just a great idea for a restaurant.

431
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,320
Yeah, like led the way.

432
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,160
But shouldn't that have been proving by that point that it wasn't going to work?

433
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,400
I don't think Wizards was thriving necessarily.

434
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,040
Ninety eight or whatever.

435
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,640
Yeah, I guess they thought, well, we have instead of just a generic,

436
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,640
because in Wizards, there was a level that was fantastical magic with a Merlin type.

437
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,200
Yes.

438
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,120
So they didn't have a star like Copperfield attached.

439
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,960
So they were like, well, they just have a generic Merlin.

440
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,560
Something to kick it over the edge.

441
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,480
And of course, if really at the end of the day, Wizards was a themed restaurant,

442
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,360
and a very well themed restaurant with good shows.

443
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,040
But what Copperfield wanted to build his quote was an interactive

444
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,760
entertainment experience from which you won't want to escape.

445
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,120
I think you're going to want to leave the restaurant at the end of the night.

446
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,840
You would think.

447
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,000
This feels like the spot to mention, you know, the Lions Gate property

448
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,280
that was supposed to go in Tide Square, of course, collapsed recently.

449
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
Guess what I just read last night.

450
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,040
Lions Gate to build production facility in Yonkers, New York.

451
00:22:53,040 --> 00:23:01,360
Right outside of New York City, Yonkers, where some of Hello Dolly takes place in Yonkers.

452
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,880
So they're building production.

453
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,400
They're building a back lot.

454
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,520
But they are saying there's going to be room for themed entertainment.

455
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,440
There is a universal studio.

456
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:13,920
Really?

457
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,880
Potentially.

458
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:15,760
Yeah.

459
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,160
Whoa.

460
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,440
In Yonkers.

461
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,600
Now, but I think it's working.

462
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,200
It's not working with the people who pulled out of the Tide Square one.

463
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,080
It's working.

464
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,840
I think it's going to try to just replicate the stuff they're opening in Asia.

465
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,400
Isn't there a Dubai?

466
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,480
It's part of something called Motion Gate.

467
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:32,980
Yeah.

468
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,840
The multi-story Lions Gate Park in Asia, I think, has opened.

469
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,000
So I think they're going to try to replicate some of that.

470
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,640
Interesting.

471
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,000
In Yonkers.

472
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,840
Is there anything like that in Yonker?

473
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,120
I don't know what's in Yonkers.

474
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,240
Is there even a Kooky themed bullshit there at all?

475
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,360
No, I think just a plot of land was available.

476
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:56,880
And.

477
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,380
Wow.

478
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,720
Where are like the sounds?

479
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,600
Because they shot 30 Rock on sound stages in New York.

480
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,640
That's Silver Cup.

481
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
Silver Cup in Queens, I think.

482
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,760
Silver Cup Studios.

483
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,160
Yeah.

484
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,720
So that's how far is that from Yonkers?

485
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:11,840
I don't know.

486
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:17,760
Well, Yonkers, they said like 30 minutes up the Hudson was the way the article described it to me.

487
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,320
And I'm like, well, that's not super helpful.

488
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,000
If concurrently they had been filming 30 Rock and then you could also go on in a themed experience

489
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,880
where you get to experience what it's like to have Alec Baldwin scream at you.

490
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:31,840
Yeah.

491
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:39,200
You go into a Dolby Surround Sound Theater to replicate the terror of Baldwin yell.

492
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,680
Yeah.

493
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,600
So I'll be keeping an eye on the Lions Gate Yonkers campus.

494
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,920
Please, if you can just major in this topic for us and update us whenever you can.

495
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,720
That's insanity.

496
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,680
You can set up a Google alert for multiple words.

497
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:59,440
Like I can I can quote the phrase Lions Gate Yonkers and it'll send me right.

498
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,920
Universal Studios Hollywood, Lions Gate Studio Yonkers.

499
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,160
Iconic themed entertainment names.

500
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,800
What if this starts the whole like how Disney started like,

501
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,600
well, supercharged the Orlando scene.

502
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,360
Like this is just the start of Yonkers being a destination for all the major companies

503
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,560
to build new parks.

504
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,280
Oh, sure.

505
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:25,120
And then like some other like, you know, nichey like, you know, like Tyler Perry's company

506
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,720
ends up building a competing.

507
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,160
Oh, my God.

508
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,680
A religious like a theme park slash chapel.

509
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,600
Disney will be like literally the opening of Wally starts with that Hello Dolly song

510
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,960
with Michael Crawford singing.

511
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,280
There is a world outside of Yonkers.

512
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,240
They're going to be like, like, how do we get him to stop saying Yonkers?

513
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,000
We got to mute that somehow.

514
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,240
They're going to remove it from all they're going to remove.

515
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,840
But leave in that when he says like the world outside this hick town, like he roasts Yonkers.

516
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,600
Like Yonkers.

517
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,120
Yeah.

518
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,520
Yonkers is kind of like a like a sub.

519
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,440
I think people might live there if they work in New York, but it's like kinetic.

520
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
It's like you live in Connecticut.

521
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,800
You go to New York to work.

522
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,760
You live in Yonkers.

523
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,800
You get to New York to work.

524
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,080
OK, sure, sure.

525
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:20,880
But it's also in like I feel like any old like, you know, college fight song, I feel

526
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,880
like involves the Yonkers in some way.

527
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,720
Like that is my association with the Yonkers.

528
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,560
Go to a spirited town.

529
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,560
Hey, there's a Lego Land Discovery Center in Yonkers.

530
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,280
So they do have bullshit.

531
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,200
Yeah, it's a Lego Land Discovery Center, Westchester, 39 Fitzgerald Street,

532
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,840
Yonkers, New York, the Lego Land Yonkers.

533
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,160
OK, so Westchester, New Orlando, and there's an Empire City.

534
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,360
There's a casino there.

535
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,160
Oh, there's a Hudson River Museum.

536
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,120
So this is a so maybe this is a city on the grow.

537
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,040
I guess the right ruling.

538
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,880
Keep your eyes on Yonkers.

539
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,280
Yonkers is the New Orleans, tired Orlando, wired Yonkers.

540
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:11,440
Inspired Dogpatch USA and whatever happens there.

541
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,640
The other thing, and Jason, you alluded to this.

542
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,880
Copperfield essentially has built an immersive themed experience.

543
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,280
And I'm talking about at his islands, Islands of Copperfield Bay,

544
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,400
aka I think Moosha Kay is the name of it.

545
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,960
Um, do you know anything about the it seems like you've looked into this a little bit?

546
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,760
I just clicked on like it's literally the corner of his website was like,

547
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,040
and check out these islands.

548
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:47,120
And I was like, what he advertises the islands because I knew he had at least one island.

549
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,280
Yeah, well, he has 11.

550
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,560
OK, it's the Exumas, not far for it.

551
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,720
The same stretch of island where the fire festival happened or didn't happen.

552
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,920
Want to do it?

553
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,760
Um, I didn't realize exactly that you could go there.

554
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,760
I was on my way out the door this morning and like, oh, no shit, more rabbit hole.

555
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,000
I'm almost glad I don't have more because we got to get to the show.

556
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,520
But, uh, you can go if you get you can get up to 24 friends together

557
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,920
and all this experience will cost you is, uh, I believe $35,000.

558
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,120
But you will have you'll be on a beautiful island.

559
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,640
You will have private lodging unless it's a weird lie like the fire festival.

560
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,120
And you will get to there are, if you go to the website for this thing,

561
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:37,440
experiences and attractions like there is a whole I saw I found all this from an article

562
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,560
about his sort of like reprisal of, you know, like, you know, he had kind of a rough,

563
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,920
you know, two thousands with various, you know, allegations and things.

564
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,080
But I'll got revealed is on the rise and he's doing this new show that we're going to get to

565
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,600
in a minute, but he's also making his resort, this tropical resort with all these amazing things.

566
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,600
And in this article, I don't know how much of this actually came true, but in 2013,

567
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,920
at least this was going to, or I guess it says it had it then this is the tropical

568
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,800
resort has a company of trained McCaws that clean up beach debris.

569
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,520
What?

570
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,160
Huh? The trash is picked up by McCaws or eaten by them.

571
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,640
Yes.

572
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,240
McCaws eating garbage.

573
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,840
McCaws will eat your cans.

574
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,200
Just throw your beer bottles on the ground and Armacaws will chew up the glass for you

575
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,080
and an outdoor movie theater that magically appears on the beach before moviegoers eyes.

576
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,640
Oh my God.

577
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,000
That's represented on the website.

578
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,400
It's called like David's drive in home.

579
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,680
Like a cookie 60s.

580
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,520
No, geez.

581
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,680
Copperfield and then, okay.

582
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:46,400
Copperfield is designing a James Bond inspired spy hunt for guests complete with a helicopter

583
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:51,360
that will be fitted with computer generated motion sensitive laser guns.

584
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,760
Computer generated.

585
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,920
The guns are generated.

586
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,120
Does he mean 3D printed?

587
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,240
What's that?

588
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,360
So what?

589
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,000
You get in a helicopter and he designed a hunt for you.

590
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,440
I don't know.

591
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,680
I honestly, I don't even know what to speculate on what that means.

592
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,880
I don't either.

593
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,240
What I want to know is how far away are these islands from little and big St.

594
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,920
James, the Epstein Islands?

595
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,400
Because Copperfield is on the flight logs.

596
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,240
He is, right?

597
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:20,720
Yeah, he is.

598
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,360
He definitely is.

599
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,520
Yeah, it might have been a tunnel from one to the other.

600
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,640
He could just avoid being on the flight logs more if he just like popped into that slide and like.

601
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,140
Yes.

602
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,000
Yeah, no, I'm sure all the islands, all the sex horrible sex islands,

603
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,600
the petify islands are all connected.

604
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,400
I'm sure I'm assuming.

605
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:36,800
Yeah.

606
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,040
Yeah.

607
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,080
Yeah.

608
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,640
So anyway.

609
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,440
So also just as fun and practice is flying though.

610
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,720
He's fine.

611
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,120
I don't know.

612
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,160
A little soft shoe.

613
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,240
Just a little bit of fun.

614
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,000
There's nothing strange going on with him.

615
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,400
You're right.

616
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:48,720
Yes.

617
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,200
He's great.

618
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,320
He's great.

619
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:50,960
There's nothing odd.

620
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,600
The most normal.

621
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,720
There's nothing odd.

622
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,400
Just practicing takeoffs.

623
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,560
When I think Josh, I think having a regular one, you know?

624
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,160
That's what I'm thinking.

625
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,440
A good old boy.

626
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,760
Just he's always the Danny Zuko.

627
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,880
He always was.

628
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,440
Yeah, that's right.

629
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,880
Nothing to see there.

630
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,120
So there is on his on this website for the islands a listing for whatever this is.

631
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,520
It's called the Treasure of Copperfield Bay.

632
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:18,960
Oh my God.

633
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:24,640
This adventure created, written and scored by David Copperfield and his creative team scored.

634
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,320
He did the music too.

635
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,760
It'll take you and your guests to exotic hidden destinations on Musha K Island.

636
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:36,960
There are live pirates who will guide you on your journey with clues filled with magic and wonder.

637
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,720
It's a three hour adventure.

638
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,320
And then there's stills that go by on the website,

639
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,520
including the most SpongeBob Tom Kenny wraparound pirate you've ever seen.

640
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,760
Look at this cheap shit.

641
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,040
Anyone done this?

642
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,560
I can't imagine.

643
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,040
Has anyone gone to his weird island?

644
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,680
And if you're a rich person, if you're a person with hundreds of millions of dollars,

645
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,600
you are probably not a weirdo like us who would want to do this.

646
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,680
This seems to be marketed.

647
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,960
This is the kind of thing that people would love to pay $30 to do.

648
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,280
Yeah.

649
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,360
Still, you'd be like, well, 30, a little steep.

650
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,480
Instead, this is a thing because it's a thing that he designed on a private island.

651
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,400
You pay the 30 grand to get your group there.

652
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,640
And then if you want to do this thing, which is optional,

653
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,240
and you want to get the pirates out to do the little show for you, extra 20 grand.

654
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,680
What?

655
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,000
Yes.

656
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,600
This is not complimentary.

657
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,320
Yeah, no.

658
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:28,960
30 grand.

659
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,800
The treasure of Copperfield Bay is going to set you back.

660
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,320
They're probably equity actors.

661
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:32,720
Yes.

662
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,640
We've discussed equity fees recently.

663
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:34,960
Yeah.

664
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,720
Is this just a trick to get you on his island so he can abuse you?

665
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:38,960
Bill Q.

666
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,000
The hunt is you.

667
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,200
You're being hunted.

668
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,080
Clearly.

669
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,480
Right.

670
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,120
I just saw Ready or Not, which is about that.

671
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,840
I haven't read it yet.

672
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,240
And this is just a version of Copperfield's Ready or Not, where he gets you to his island.

673
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,760
And you get hunted by this 62-year-old magician.

674
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:55,920
Weird man.

675
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,400
Anyone stupid enough to want to come meet pirates.

676
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,640
This is $55,000 to get hunted by a...

677
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,320
I can't even imagine what we're building to, what this show is.

678
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:04,880
I'm also...

679
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,360
Like, this is so...

680
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,320
I'm going to get to the show.

681
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,120
I'm going to blast through the rest because it fades from this Halloween store pirate.

682
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,120
A photo of...

683
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,080
He looks like an old soldier or general or something.

684
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,920
And on this flash website that is built, it pan...

685
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:26,320
It's slowly tilting up a photo and like, okay, so it's like a Civil War soldier guy or something.

686
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,520
And then it gets up to his face and he has no face.

687
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,320
Oh, no.

688
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,000
He is a clone stamped out faceless man.

689
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,880
So you get to learn about this, I guess, in your adventure.

690
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,400
And then...

691
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,200
Uh, oh, and oh, I'm sorry.

692
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,560
This is separate than the spy thing because there's a whole other section called Moosha Force.

693
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,840
Moosha being the name of the K, but then they still put periods in it like man from uncle.

694
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,280
M-U-S-H-A.

695
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,920
You and your guests will experience Moosha Force, the ultimate super spy island adventure.

696
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,200
You battle enemy agents.

697
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,640
You solve the code.

698
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,320
You save the world.

699
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,160
All of this is live with secret weapons, laser beams, helicopters.

700
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,840
Live the magic of the movies right on Copperfield Bay.

701
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,720
He built a theme park that no one knows about or could possibly afford.

702
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,280
Still might not be real.

703
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,560
Yeah, maybe not.

704
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,400
There's no proof and I bet it's like not photographable.

705
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:23,520
Right.

706
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,800
You have to surrender your phones when you get to his island, I'm sure.

707
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,880
I, yeah, for because of the other stuff.

708
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,600
Because you have to do stuff that they can't talk about on the website.

709
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,160
Right.

710
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,920
How did Moosha K hold up under Hurricane Dorian?

711
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,800
Who knows?

712
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,040
We could be talking about something that isn't there anymore.

713
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,840
That's true.

714
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,080
Yeah.

715
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,640
Yeah.

716
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,400
The whole island is an illusion.

717
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:42,640
Yes.

718
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,200
Which is if he has like evidence to burn, he's like, oh, few hurricane.

719
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,040
OK, that works out.

720
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,200
And one of these sweeps through every couple of years.

721
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,120
I can like lose quote unquote some shit.

722
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,040
The FBI was on Epstein's Island and they were like, he was like, oh, they're awfully close.

723
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,360
Jesus Christ.

724
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,720
How can I throw him off the trail?

725
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,280
Mirrors.

726
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,160
And computer generated weapons.

727
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,640
We were taking our copters to the island and it just flat out disappeared.

728
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,360
Disappeared.

729
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,440
And then just but then also like then I also read that there's some scuba diving adventure

730
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,440
where you end up at a statue.

731
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,120
He like got like a one like a famous sculptor to build a thing.

732
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,880
It's like a waterproof underground,

733
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,320
the underwater piano, they like dropped this off the coast of the island.

734
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,440
And there's a statue of a mermaid like leaning up against it,

735
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,840
beckoning you as if to play the piano.

736
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:40,480
And I don't know how this part plays out, but apparently this underwater statue

737
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,160
was custom scored by Will.

738
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,280
I am from the bucket.

739
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,000
Oh, my God.

740
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,040
Of course it was.

741
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,640
I only found one article that mentioned this.

742
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,840
I'm like, what does that mean?

743
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,080
If you're scuba diving, you can't be listening to music.

744
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,880
He scored.

745
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,480
He made music that's only for one scuba diving expedition.

746
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,840
What the shit?

747
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,560
I mean, I don't even know.

748
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,600
Yeah.

749
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,360
Of course, Will, I am that is the right person to have scored it.

750
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,640
A thousand percent.

751
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:06,880
Yes.

752
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,240
In between like, well, right.

753
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,200
You know, I'm pretty busy making the new entertainment tonight theme.

754
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,240
But for you, David.

755
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,320
And then one more thing.

756
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,760
There is a there is a little section on this website about where

757
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,880
descend to an underground tunnel and emerge into another world,

758
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,880
a world populated by the smartest, friendliest monkeys you've ever met.

759
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,600
Oh, my God.

760
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,240
Jesus.

761
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,440
If you win, they will hug and climb all over you.

762
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,120
I think whether you wish or not, they're going to do that.

763
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:45,520
So they will lovingly touch your eyeballs and if you wish, eat them.

764
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,360
And rip your genitalia off because that is what they do if they're angry.

765
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,360
Jesus Christ.

766
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,320
Remember, folks, the code word is Fidelio.

767
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:56,960
Fidelio.

768
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,440
Wait, and then well, what the fuck?

769
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,120
I didn't even get to read this.

770
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:08,160
Travel along hidden walkways in their jungle forest where the while the monkeys read your mind

771
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,600
and draw pictures of you.

772
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:16,320
What if you ever choose to leave this nature nirvana and if you're able to find the door

773
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,960
through which you came, huh?

774
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,840
So this is an inescapable monkey escape room.

775
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,880
Hey, yes, it's an escape room with full of live monkeys.

776
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,600
Where unlike most escape rooms, there isn't like the hour window.

777
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,080
You might have to live in the monkey Copperfield's Monkey Cave forever.

778
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,840
But the caveat to all of that is that you read that big description,

779
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,920
a very specific description about monkeys reading your mind and then it says coming soon.

780
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,360
And he was talking about this in 2013.

781
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,560
Let me just double check.

782
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,080
This is a real episode, right?

783
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:51,280
I didn't just take Dayquil and Nyquil too close together and my brain is going insane.

784
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,040
Having not really had a chance to like I'm refining this information and wait,

785
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,000
we haven't even gotten to what we're really here to talk about.

786
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:03,520
Yeah, this is I feel like he is a mad man.

787
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,240
He does.

788
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,480
I'm sure after hearing that, he should probably be he should be in prison for sure.

789
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,600
Like just if that's actually what he's doing to people on an island.

790
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,440
And like whispering, like love them, love the love the humans go.

791
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,000
Now, let me throw on top of all of this that this this bizarre,

792
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:32,640
like modern day tootin common, just like this bizarre figure, island owner, monkey trainer.

793
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,240
I've met this man.

794
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,360
I spent several hours with David Copperfield.

795
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,760
Let me show you and I'll post this on the Twitter.

796
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:45,360
Here's a photo of me and this fucking guy through funny or die in 2011.

797
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,720
You're not five in that picture.

798
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,720
That's no seven years ago.

799
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,120
Long ago, we filmed for some reason.

800
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,520
He suddenly wanted to make a video that's about how Harry Potter ripped him off.

801
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,120
Why?

802
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,520
I don't know.

803
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,640
And then he and his team went and found a bunch of weird similarities

804
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,400
between the Harry Potter world and his story, including the bizarre fact that

805
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,640
Daniel Radcliffe's first on screen role was as David Copperfield, Dickens, David Copperfield.

806
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,800
Bizarre coincidences.

807
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,120
He also probably saw Billy Toppett and he wanted to top it.

808
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,920
Yeah, I think so.

809
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,120
You want to?

810
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:23,280
That's why I'm enlisting producer Will Ferrell to take me to new cinematic guides.

811
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,200
But I spent and I was there was this bizarre where we like got on a plane and then landed

812
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,960
and we're like grabbing a Starbucks from a Henderson strip mall.

813
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,880
And then the producer is like, oh, uh huh.

814
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,520
Here, Scott, it's David.

815
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,160
What the fuck?

816
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,120
And it was just him like, hi, Scott, it's me, David.

817
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:44,160
And I'm like, we're like next to a target where we're like buying props and like,

818
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,440
this is so fucking weird.

819
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,560
And we got to go to his facility and his only rewrite on the script was like,

820
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,520
don't call it my warehouse, call it my consortium of wonder.

821
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,080
Solid punch up.

822
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,640
But then we're in this weird room that's full of like all of Harry Houdini's stuff.

823
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,600
Oh, mega Patrick Nagel of himself.

824
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,400
Those 80s paintings that I based Boon Biman like a giant like,

825
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,080
you know, like Florida ceiling Nagel of himself.

826
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,400
Wow.

827
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,280
Bizarre place to get to hang out for a little while.

828
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:20,640
So I've met this man, this man who Disney said, do you think we want to cross him?

829
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,840
This man who's been capturing monkeys worldwide.

830
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,040
Did you get a sense of his blood lust when you were with him?

831
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,440
Or did he just seem like an odd man?

832
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:37,360
I should mention that I spent the night in a, in a Houdini closet with him.

833
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:37,920
Yeah.

834
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,480
Yes.

835
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,280
We had a lovely night.

836
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,080
He was quite a gentleman and the monkeys were very tender with me as well.

837
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,480
Okay. Well, that's good. At least a wonderful trip.

838
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,200
Wow.

839
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,840
So let's, yeah, let's not disparage this gentleman anymore.

840
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,340
Okay.

841
00:40:51,200 --> 00:41:01,120
So with all that, the show and I, what I think is so insane is that no one's talking about this show.

842
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,440
No.

843
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,320
How are there not people screaming from the rafters?

844
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,560
Do you know what David Copperfield does every night at the FGM?

845
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:13,760
What the trailer quote unquote for the show, the promotional video on the website,

846
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,880
is the most generic kind of like come to a live show, sort of like you would probably say it,

847
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,960
if you're in a Vegas hotel room, 15 side, they just play a million of them back to back of like,

848
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,320
come to this musical, come to the show, come to the King Tut exhibit, you know?

849
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,920
Yeah. And it's like footage from his old specials.

850
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,360
From the old TV specials.

851
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,160
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

852
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:36,560
And, and, and one thing to say is that when you're there, you feel like you are in a taping of one

853
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,880
of those specials. There are broad, really sharp broadcast cameras. It's lit very well,

854
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:49,360
probably to keep him looking his best. It's just like, right? I mean, you feel like you're

855
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:53,040
just in like a high tech stage. It's such a slick, great presentation.

856
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:59,600
Yeah. It was honestly, it was a little, the Chris Angel show is in like a bigger theater

857
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,960
and it's kind of in what I, it seems like a newer theater, honestly. It was a little,

858
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,280
it was, it was just seemed like a little bit, the theater was something a little old,

859
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,920
like a little old. When the show started, I was much more impressive.

860
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,800
It's more intimate Vegas.

861
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,400
Yeah. I was, I was surprised by how small it was. But then in the lobby, it's like,

862
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,080
there's a little nod to what happens in the lobby. I'm just saying the whole presentation of like,

863
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:28,880
going in. The thing that we're building to, there is a little statue that is your clue.

864
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,200
Easy to miss. And do you have any idea, Jason, what we're, have you been there?

865
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,880
No, no. Okay. Okay.

866
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,080
No. I have been to Vegas.

867
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:40,160
When the reveal happened, I was like, oh, I, this is familiar to me. I have seen this

868
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,960
in passing because I've stayed in that hotel a lot.

869
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,120
I had not seen it. I was just so shocked. I didn't notice the little nod to it.

870
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,680
I was just, I want to say the lobby has this plaque.

871
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,400
Yes.

872
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,400
That is like a giant plaque. This is what you're talking about, right?

873
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,800
Yeah. And there's a giant picture of his head.

874
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,560
So much text in what you're showing me.

875
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,200
And yeah, there's, and it basically, it just says that, and there's talking about like the

876
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:08,800
society of American magicians, what they've declared for him. And they say that the,

877
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,280
basically society of American magicians hereby proclaims David Copperfield,

878
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,960
magician of the century here in forevermore to be known as the king of magic.

879
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,360
Okay.

880
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,760
Michael Jackson S he's the king of magic.

881
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,840
Yes. And there's this odd statue of him, a bust. You remember that you've

882
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,000
noble looking off, dreaming up more illusions.

883
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,640
And there's like the statue of liberties coming out of his lower half.

884
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,000
Right. Cause that was a big thing.

885
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,440
Exploding out of his heart.

886
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,800
Yeah. And more like him emerge his head emerging with his butterfly on his finger.

887
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,120
These are all free to see just in the lobby.

888
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:49,440
Yes.

889
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,520
That's the thing I love about all the Vegas casino. You can like, you know, you can like

890
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:57,760
swim in the bathwater of these shows without going to see them.

891
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,320
Yes. And like a great illusion, of course, in this photo, I of course now notice,

892
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,360
I will only show it to Scott, Jason look away.

893
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,080
There is our buddy.

894
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,040
Our buddy.

895
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,240
Oh no.

896
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,240
So now is the time, like truly, if you ever think you're going to see the show depart now,

897
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:20,240
I hope you enjoyed hearing about it. But I, but if not, let's spin a tale.

898
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,640
The show, the main show itself, I don't have a ton to say about. It's just a pretty good.

899
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:33,760
Yeah. So here's what I'll say. The show starts and you know, there's some illusions. I've

900
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,840
forgotten some of it. It's hard to remember everything, but the first illusion, and I know

901
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:42,400
he's changed the show. So we may have seen slightly different versions and I've seen things online

902
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,680
that say he's workshopped this over like since 2013 and there's different versions of it,

903
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:54,320
which is fascinating to me and they're not archived. So the show starts and again,

904
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,480
I didn't know anything. I've never seen him live. I would watch the specials in the 90s,

905
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,160
like everyone else, but I wasn't obsessed with him or anything. Of course I was more of a Lance

906
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:09,520
Burton kid. But he starts out and he appears in this, I'm assuming this is the same for you.

907
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,480
It's the box. The box is empty. It's a huge box and they turn it around, I think. And then

908
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:21,360
he appears on a motorcycle. Yes. Inside the box. Yes. And it is immediately clear to me,

909
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:29,280
oh, he's over this. He's overperforming. I'm not overperforming. He's overdoing the act of

910
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:35,120
performing. He's on the bike. I don't even kind of have a good sense before this of what he looks

911
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:42,160
like. He obviously has his died jet black carries in his sixties. He looks like he's wearing football

912
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:48,320
pads almost on the top part of him. He looks like real puffy up here. I don't know if he's working

913
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:54,080
out or he's wearing up like he's wearing a man suit. Yes. He's wearing like a wacky gender swap

914
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:59,520
comedy and somebody needed like to puff like like to go pretend to be a football player. Is it out

915
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,360
of the realm of possibilities wearing like the George Michael arrested development muscle suit

916
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,720
because it does. It looks odd. It doesn't look like he's just like a jacked 60 year old, which

917
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:15,440
I've seen. Look, I follow wrestling. I know what jack 60 year olds look like, but this looks odd

918
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:21,280
to me. Yeah, because he's still like little. He's still very little. Yeah. And oddly proportioned,

919
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:27,520
oddly proportioned. Yes. So I'm but very similar to one time I got to see Barry Manila walk through

920
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:34,400
a lobby in Vegas and sort of similarly just like perfect, like his head was just floating on air,

921
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:39,200
the best posture I've ever seen. So maybe there's just like, I don't know, maybe there's weird like

922
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:44,480
pre mummification techniques. All these Vegas guys are starting to install in themselves. Right.

923
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:52,800
Or he's just getting like pack injections and bicep injections and neck injections. So immediately

924
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:59,440
he gets off the motorcycle and he's going half speed through, you know, quarter speed for like

925
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,560
a performer. You can sense it from a performer and it immediately is clear. It doesn't reveal it

926
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,640
immediately. I go, I got so excited because I go, this is an extra element. I didn't even think

927
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:14,560
about. I go, Oh, and nobody even told me, Oh, he's sick of this shit. Yeah. Which I was immediately

928
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:21,200
delighted. The audience we had so checked out, didn't give a shit about the show. It was so weird

929
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:26,080
and like they were doing their best to rev everybody up, but they did not care, which I think

930
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:34,080
made him care even less. So I was in heaven immediately to see this, you know, legendary

931
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:40,720
magician, not be forced on all sides. And I was like, Oh gosh, this is already good. So I ready,

932
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:45,360
I was just like, okay, maybe this is what everyone was saying. We're here just to see this checked

933
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:50,240
out guy go through the motions with this tone. That's just extremely nothing. He's putting like

934
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,720
3% effort into it. Yeah. I always wanted to live the impossible and now I have the chance to every

935
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:59,920
night. Yes. And sort of, and the only things that he makes a point, he'll like, he will learn like,

936
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,680
what's your name, Jason? All right. Now Jason here is going to, and that's the only thing he's,

937
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,080
there's the blanks. He does have to remember the names of the people he brought up. Although

938
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:13,280
would never be you would be like a beautiful international woman. It's always Alessandra.

939
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,360
It's always a beautiful international woman. That's so they always go to that. It's a woman

940
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:21,680
who can't speak English very well. Cause it's such an easy joke. Cause they might not understand what

941
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:26,800
he's saying. There's also a kind of like, hello, hello, I'm over here. Right. He's very fun of

942
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,320
their lack of, yes, it's an easy magician. Yeah. It's weird. It's weird. Uh, and also I think

943
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:37,520
I was trying to figure out how many people are plants. Cause I suspect maybe there are more

944
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:43,120
plants in there than you would think. I think, uh, our friend Matt Mazzani, uh, was alluding to

945
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:48,400
your theory that like all was, was they all might be plants. Everyone is plants. Yes. I think there's

946
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,520
a decent, you're one of 12 legitimate audience members in the room. That's why they're not into

947
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:58,880
it. Cause they're there every night. It's honestly highly possible that like they make $700 a show

948
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:03,600
and that it's mostly plants. Cause cause what happens is when they do something with audience

949
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:08,400
participation, he like goes, and uh, and I'm going to throw the frisbee and the frisbee frisbee and

950
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,920
whoever catches a frisbee and then he'll throw it and he'd be like, we need a female. We need

951
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,840
a female. All right. We didn't. And then all of us for no reason, he'll just go, no, no, no. Okay.

952
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:20,000
Now you throw the frisbee again. And then they'll throw the frisbee and he'll do like three or four

953
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,320
times. And there doesn't seem to have much rhyme or reason, but maybe they're trying to get to

954
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:29,520
a plant. Oh, sure. Cause he was yelling. He's like, throw it again, throw it again. Yeah, come on.

955
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:34,560
And then he's like really exasperated and then he gets it to a different person and he keeps

956
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:39,200
changing how many times he needs you to throw it. And sometimes it's immediate where it's like,

957
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:44,320
that's the plant or that's the audience member I'm going to bring on stage. It was really weird.

958
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:50,080
Did he have a thing where he did a bit where he was like somebody whose sister had died?

959
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:56,560
No, I don't think so. Okay. He did this whole rap before about like, you know, this man wrote a

960
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,480
letter to me and he said, you know, he, he loved, he always wanted to perform a magic trick with me

961
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,880
and his sister had passed away and he throws all this at you so quickly cause he doesn't deliver

962
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,600
it clearly. And you're like, there's a dead sister and a guy wants to perform. And then he like makes

963
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:14,000
him disappear and appear somewhere else. Maybe all fake. Might be all, honestly, it might be all fake

964
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,520
cause there are a few things revealed for sure to be fake that he does in every performance.

965
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:25,680
Yeah. Yeah. There is a part where the camera cuts to an audience member and he's describing what he's

966
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:30,800
seeing on the Fia and like, and there's an asshole behind you. Yeah. That happens every two. There's

967
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:37,040
a plant who's a guy who's like a dweeb and big glasses and the dorky hat and that, that, that he's

968
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,560
always there. And there's a lot of scene, the show three times. So we've gotten to hear things

969
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,440
that like that always happens. That always happens. That always happens. He also thinks,

970
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,800
I think the plants that there's a lot of highly likely that every audience participation is a

971
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:54,400
plant and Jason, I will also attribute the theory that all of this is about him just trying to keep

972
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:00,960
the record of the highest. Yes. The magician who's done the most performances and currently most

973
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:06,000
performing. Oh, I see. So by doing 14 shows a week or whatever, he's the, like the number one,

974
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:10,160
like just sheer volume amount of show. Yeah. He's beating Chris angel who's,

975
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,160
you know, I think there may be number two performing us at the, at the moment, maybe.

976
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:19,760
So in order to keep this arbitrary record up and he's as he has everything he could ever want,

977
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:26,720
he's got exumas. Why does he need? He's a lunatic. Obviously, uh, he does three shows on Saturday.

978
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,600
Yeah. There's a four, a seven and a 10 or something like he does.

979
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:37,840
Oh my God. And it's so clear how much he is. It hates it, hates doing this. Yeah. Uh,

980
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:42,240
and it's just a compulsion, just some horrible compulsion in his brain to keep wanting to do

981
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:47,760
this. Yeah. Um, so yeah. And then there's also like, uh, there's a little hint to what's to come.

982
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:55,200
There's some, some, some playing with the timeline later in the show. And there's a reveal to be

983
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:59,600
somebody who you think is just going to the bathroom who like David mocks. Oh yeah. And

984
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:04,400
that's revealed to obviously be a plant. Uh huh. Okay. Um, but you might think, oh, he's just making

985
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,560
fun of a guy who has to go to the bathroom. Yeah. But no sort of lured me in initially. Um, you know

986
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:14,960
what helps you remember a little bit, the things that happen in the show, cause it's all a little

987
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:21,680
hazy, but what does help is that at the top of the show, uh, you give your email address and he sends

988
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:27,200
you an email and say, and that you check your inbox and like, do you have it? Okay. But don't open it

989
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:33,760
till after the show. And then the big thing at the end is that you get a letter that he's holding

990
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:40,000
up and then, and it, the text says everything that you experienced tonight, including with everybody's

991
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,680
name, you know, uh, Anastasia was there and a young man named Marcus blah, blah, blah, like all

992
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:51,280
of the specifics, which is why it's a, it has to be a plan. Everyone's a plant. Um, well, or I mean,

993
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:57,440
I think that photo thing is that like, that's some outside URL that's changed out that are refreshed

994
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,880
from within your email. Well, here's why I think it's not because on our list was a thing that

995
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:08,400
didn't happen. Okay. Yeah. There was a big reveal, big, like there's a big thing that happens in the

996
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,040
show from, I know you said it happens and Walner said it happens, did not happen when we saw it.

997
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,840
And it's still in our list. So if it was so easily changeable, right, wouldn't that come out?

998
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:22,640
Mm hmm. Yeah, I suppose so. Maybe delete. Cause it's a pretty big thing and it doesn't really

999
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:29,520
impact the rest of the show. So we can say, uh, he, he introduces a childhood toy T-Rex earlier

1000
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:34,720
in the show. And then at the end he makes it 30 feet tall and it's really cool. It appears out of

1001
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:41,280
nowhere does like roars and stomps around the stage. Uh, pretty incredible. But yeah, it didn't

1002
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,000
happen for you. Did not happen. It's like the plane and the water world stunt shows. Yeah.

1003
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:51,840
Sometimes too windy to fire that ball. So would hunk over the wall. He's still, uh, he's still

1004
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,520
talks about it early. He still talks. He even did the setup earlier in the show and then just

1005
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:04,320
didn't pay it off. Huh? So it like broke somehow during I guess. Yeah, maybe, maybe they had a call

1006
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:10,800
an audible. I'll show you just this. This is what it looks like. Mm hmm. That is exactly what I was

1007
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:17,600
picturing. Yeah. I was like, Oh, I bet it's a, it looks like this and then it can be just filled in.

1008
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:21,840
Yeah. It's very a plug and play. And then there's like, there's another thing like this where

1009
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:28,560
it's somebody has to say a name of an actor and then like all these words specifics from throughout

1010
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:32,960
the show are printed out on the actor's face. Did you still have that? It was Marilyn Monroe.

1011
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,760
Yes. Yeah. And it was Marilyn Monroe in that, in the recording. So right. That's what I'm saying.

1012
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:42,560
Like they're always picking Marilyn Monroe. It's like this person was chosen a random

1013
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:47,760
Marilyn Monroe. Right. So, all right. It's, I think it's mostly plants. I mean, oh man,

1014
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,240
I know he really, he fools you. Would you have your letter open? Yeah, I have my letter. Okay.

1015
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:57,920
Well here then maybe here let's, let's see if there's anything, uh, because you have wristbands.

1016
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,000
Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah. And then suddenly a word appears on your wristband,

1017
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,200
but they could maybe trade those out. Uh, inspires the word. Uh, minus faith. Okay. So,

1018
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:14,560
there's probably like a fan where, yeah, um, it's just a black light. Essentially you have a wristband

1019
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:19,120
on and then he's like inspire. And then what's the, in this, there's, is, do you have a zone about,

1020
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:24,960
we met the guy who's wearing blue boxers, the guy who hasn't been busy in 27 hours. Oh yeah. Yeah.

1021
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:30,960
That same thing. Is it blue boxers? Hold on. And 27 hours of that. I remember that from the show.

1022
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,720
Oh, wait, wait. You select. Oh yeah. We met the guy who's wearing white boxers, the guy who hasn't

1023
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:43,600
gotten busy in 28 hours. Okay. So it's a plant. This is like. It changes one little thing of it.

1024
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,520
Yeah. And it's a guy. And did you also have like a guy who have probably of Asian descent,

1025
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:51,200
who couldn't speak English very well? That sounds familiar. And it was like, oh, he couldn't,

1026
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,880
he didn't know. And like, he's like, when was the last time you got busy? When was the last time you

1027
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:59,440
got busy? You know, whatever. And the guy like doesn't understand. I don't know that I understand

1028
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:05,760
and then it's a big laugh. In my life, it's all strange person. If you refer to it,

1029
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:11,040
it has to be all plants that for sure. I guess so. So it's all these people. And they cycle out

1030
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,080
these numbers to be different enough so that when we cross check. But that's still too close.

1031
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:21,760
Yeah. Like you really would have to change it up. Just make 28. It's not the days. It's not. Just

1032
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:28,480
make 10, just make 10 different scenarios even like, Oh, hasn't gotten, you know, we met the guy

1033
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:34,480
who doesn't wear who goes commando and blah, blah, blah. But the, when the only

1034
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:40,000
things you can keep in your, well, all your brain is capable of holding is just 20

1035
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,600
specifics that you can change out. Otherwise it is exactly the same every night. I think as we build

1036
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:50,080
to the end of the show, this is essentially the same. I think, do we, do we start heading there?

1037
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,480
Yeah, I'm trying to think. Well, the only other thing I want to say about just magicians in

1038
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,160
general, cause I saw Chris Angel and this show, so I'm assuming it's most magicians, maybe not

1039
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:03,680
Penn and Teller. They are so goddamn insecure because the whole front part of both of these

1040
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:08,080
shows are about everyone told me I'd never be able to make it. That being a magician was crazy,

1041
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:12,160
that I shouldn't, I should give up or whatever, but I didn't give up. And that's both shows.

1042
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:18,080
Both shows are so much about them being children and people telling them they couldn't do this.

1043
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:21,760
You're like, you've made, you've been successful for so long. Like, why is it still the theme?

1044
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,800
People told me you should listen to music that isn't corn. I showed them, didn't I?

1045
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:32,480
He's at like the, what is it? The promise, the turn, the prestige. Is that just part of the

1046
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:37,760
promise? Is that like building a story sort of stuff? I guess, but why? You're missing the step,

1047
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:44,800
the revenge against your childhood enemies. Well, that's most, that's implicit in most entertainment.

1048
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:51,360
I mean, I. Showing them all. For this show, the Copperfield show specifically, I don't know why

1049
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:59,920
he needs that element. His father will come into play, of course. But the element of, the element

1050
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,960
of him, like, I guess it's always about like giving, don't give up on your dreams and stuff.

1051
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:11,760
Well, because they're such like larger than life figures now, can you even imagine that once I was

1052
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:20,240
a dumb little child, dumb little toilet person, like you, you idiot, I belonged in a cave with

1053
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:26,400
monkeys. That's so, that's how shitty I was. Now I own the cave with monkeys. Now I round up the

1054
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:34,480
monkeys. I tell them who's genitals to touch and who's to tear off. Uh, okay. Yeah. So that's the

1055
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:39,600
only thing. So they do a bunch of perfectly fine illusions, tricks, fun. What I like about it is

1056
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:44,800
you're getting just a good, it's like, it's pretty, it's legitimately good if you have like sleepwalks.

1057
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:51,040
Very lazy. I'm like the angel, Chris angel is still going for it. He's doing like, he's performing at

1058
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:59,120
full speed and like from the ceiling and spit like it's insane. Yeah. Like really nails or whatever.

1059
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:04,000
Yeah. He's doing it. Uh, I saw Penn and Teller when I was in high school at like one of the big

1060
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:10,320
theaters downtown in Philadelphia. And I just, I remember them, um, really giving it their all.

1061
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:18,320
And at the time, uh, I think they were on a tour, you know, I think going city to city, uh,

1062
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:22,880
people are excited. People paid money tonight out. Like I thought that I remember it being a very

1063
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:29,680
good show and then they also seem more like a human beings. Yeah. They seem like people you could

1064
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:36,480
talk to. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. It might be like not out of their minds. Um, but I don't know. I'm just

1065
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:41,840
guessing. This cover field is at that. I mean, like certainly within magic, he is the, he's the

1066
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:47,680
Michael Jackson equivalent. So he's hit that I don't know what's up, but is it, is there maybe like a

1067
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:53,520
being the most famous person in your field is pretty crazy. Are you like odd and piled up and

1068
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:58,000
are you, I don't know. I was, yeah, I was trying to figure that too. I was starting, excuse me,

1069
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,920
trying to figure that out too. Yeah. What is, I think it might just be like, um, there's levels

1070
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:08,800
of eccentricity. I mean, magicians by nature, I feel like are eccentric and the world around

1071
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:15,200
it are eccentric, but I remember seeing like some sort of TV show where like Penn brought people to

1072
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:20,320
his house and yes, it's a nice house, but it's still like, Oh, that's a house of person lives

1073
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:25,840
in, you know, it's like a weird modernist house, but it's still in Vegas. You could see the road

1074
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:30,640
out. You could see other houses around it, you know, not interactive monkey adventure, not an

1075
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:36,080
interactive, you know, yeah, no, I think live in a spy game. He has stories about eating like to

1076
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:41,840
lose massive amounts of weight. Like he ate only potatoes for a month. Like he had some sort of

1077
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:47,040
crazy crash die. I think he's got some sort of bizarre libertarian beliefs, but again, you can,

1078
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:53,840
you stuff makes, you can see how a person got there. Copperfield seems like an alien friend of

1079
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:59,680
a friend of the show. Andrew Grissom sent me a clip from like two days ago of, of Copperfield on

1080
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:05,760
Penn and Teller's Fool Us show. That was a short-lived show where they would have magicians

1081
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,640
try to fool them, but then they tried to fool Copperfield with a card trick. Oh, and they did.

1082
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:19,760
Yeah. Oh yeah. But he was like, he's, he's just like kind of stuck in that sort of odd, like on

1083
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:25,280
too intense. Like his eyes are always a little too open. So a little Tom Cruise ish, a little bit.

1084
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:30,240
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're like, he's always a perfect man. Vibrating on a different frequency

1085
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:35,520
from everyone. Like there's just, he's too intently folk. Okay. Well, I guess they,

1086
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,760
and he was like, you could tell he was really upset to have to admit that they fooled him on

1087
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,760
one element of the trick. He's like, well, I, I understood some of it. I understood a couple of

1088
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:51,280
the moves, but then there was one move I didn't. So I guess you fooled me or whatever. Like he admits

1089
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:57,280
to defeat, which I think he must've been punching the wall. Like that's the energy I get from him.

1090
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,760
He could. Made a fool of. Yeah. And then he never talked to them again. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1091
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,240
Soft the list. He killed. Take them to monkey Island. So the other thing I will set up from

1092
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:10,000
the early part of the show is he, it's a ballad about his father. He's talking about his father.

1093
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:16,000
And like he says, uh, he shows a clip. I think it is it, or am I misremembering? He shows the clip

1094
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:21,840
of his parents in the park from their younger days early in the show. Oh, really? I think that was,

1095
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:25,920
I think that's different than what I saw. Okay. Cause he, he shows it like the first and that last

1096
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:31,680
30 minutes when the turn happens. I perhaps I'm misremembering, but it's maybe smarter to do it

1097
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:36,960
earlier. I think he does it earlier. Cause I was, I was looking at reviews and since he's been doing

1098
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:43,920
it 2013, there are, I think vastly different versions of this show. Yeah. Lost to time now,

1099
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:49,600
because they're not documented online or anything. Yeah. And with like odd stray pieces, Jason was

1100
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:55,520
explaining that there's, there's a really odd part where a duck comes out to the song,

1101
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:01,120
shake your tail feather. Doesn't really connect to anything else. And that used to apparently be a

1102
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:05,840
much bigger part of the show and isn't anymore. And he is, I think he's on record saying, you know,

1103
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:12,160
sometimes it takes three, four, five, six years to get this right. Wow. So like he, he's, and it's,

1104
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:17,280
yeah. So he's been doing this thing since 2013. So it's still possible. He moved it a little earlier.

1105
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:22,240
Let me tell you the version that I saw. I will, I'll set the stage and, and, and feel free to

1106
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:27,680
jump in and tell me how yours was different, but things are, you know, a trick, a big, a big

1107
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,840
trick has been achieved successfully. And then he kind of like takes it down a little bit and gets

1108
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:38,240
a little bit more intimate and a little bit of music starts getting into the mix. And it's,

1109
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:43,600
with the music things start getting a little bit Amblin-y. We got a big old,

1110
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:50,400
they were going for Amblin. I'm starting to get nervous because you both have dropped some clues

1111
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:58,880
or words that I'm like, Oh, I'm concerned to go on. And I'm also going off of like, we, we have

1112
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:05,920
been smuggled a recording of this. We will not, but I would have forgotten everything without the,

1113
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:12,240
this, you know, secretly absconded the audio. Was this song nature boy by elephants?

1114
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:17,200
And for it as neck and coal. Oh, there's a two different. Oh yeah. You're right. Cause it's a,

1115
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:22,400
yeah. Yeah. So he has everybody. He says, I'm going to ask everyone to do something right now.

1116
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:27,600
Everybody make the, everybody make this sign and he makes a little symbol. Imagine if you're

1117
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:31,440
holding up the number three on both of your hands in a way that involves your thumbs,

1118
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:36,320
it's that side of your hands. And then you sort of like bring them together in a diamond shape,

1119
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:40,000
like your, your middle fingers meeting your thumbs meeting. I'll have you do that, Jason.

1120
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:48,160
That's very, yeah. It's similar to either the rock Rockefeller, JZ thing. And it's similar to

1121
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:54,880
diamond Alice pages, diamond color. Yeah. Yeah. So very much so. And then, and he's, he has

1122
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:01,840
already make that symbol and he says, now that that is not Illuminati that which are like,

1123
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:06,320
it's a laugh line. And yet he, but of course he's pretty bold being somebody in the only,

1124
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:11,600
for sure. And the Illuminati for sure is in there. Um, that's not, it's not Illuminati.

1125
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:17,360
That was my father's way of saying, I love you. What this is. And then nature boy by neck and

1126
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:22,400
coal kicks in there was a boy. Let me play a little of it really just to give you the mood.

1127
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:27,040
Or though now shoot, now we have an ad, now we have an ad on here. Hold on, hold on. I

1128
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:43,120
should have had a cute up. Okay. My apologies. Here we go.

1129
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:52,480
That was always my father's favorite song. He said it reminded me of him.

1130
01:05:52,640 --> 01:06:04,320
I was so stupid. He sent me a letter, but I didn't open it. And I always wondered what was inside.

1131
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:10,160
He passed away and I never got the chance to tell him that I loved him. And now I have nothing but

1132
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:15,600
regret. Sometimes I wonder if I could go back and change the past. How would things be different?

1133
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,200
That's the story that we tell tonight. A story with magic and illusions for everyone.

1134
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:30,000
Mrs. Someone they love. The applause line. And then, and over the course of the way,

1135
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,360
I wrote all of that out as well. Oh, okay. Yeah. I think we're both going to be going out here.

1136
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:38,400
Hey, take the wheel. I don't mean to be doing all no, no, no, no. That was great. I don't

1137
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,640
mean to be doing that plan that by the way, I don't want to take away the joy from you of speaking in

1138
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:49,520
that as, as lazy of an eloquence as you possibly can. And over the, as this is all happening,

1139
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:54,720
you're watching an old eight millimeter film of his dad and his mom. Jesus. So we're, yeah,

1140
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:59,200
we're reliving his, his childhood. Is he buying the camera? You don't really know what's happening,

1141
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:04,240
but you're, he's bringing you into his world and his, sort of his idyllic fifties upbringing. And

1142
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:10,960
then he reveals something major revealed, which is that his father, he was a military guy and he

1143
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,440
only recently learned that where his father was stationed for a while was Roswell. My father was

1144
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:20,560
stationed in Roswell, he says. And then there's the term for me.

1145
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:27,440
At least every in the, I'm sure all of it and all of our friends who've seen this thing, Eva and

1146
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:34,640
Jay, everybody's like, yeah, that is when the endorphin surge, that is when my adrenaline pumps

1147
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:41,120
in the theater and I get so excited. And then he says, you may have the, I, this might not be a

1148
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:45,760
full quote. He explains that the story, the story he's, what did you call it? Is he called a fairy

1149
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:52,720
tale? Maybe he just says, you know, that this, this will contain, this is about his father Roswell and

1150
01:07:52,720 --> 01:08:02,720
a little blue alien. Yes. You heard that right. A little blue alien. Yeah. And it goes, it plays

1151
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:07,200
in our theater, at least to pretty much silence. We were, we were next to a couple that were from,

1152
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,960
I forget which state they were in, but they were staying at the Flamingo was a party. They were

1153
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:15,440
like, that's the party hotel. And we were like, oh cool. Or whatever they are not. It just like,

1154
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:20,320
they're dumbfounded. I don't think that blue alien does anything for them, but are you, are you like,

1155
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:24,880
are you and Lindsay stifling like, well, I think Lindsay is who's right over there in the kitchen

1156
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:33,120
roll was rolling her eyes maybe. And I was just, I couldn't, I wanted to grip, come on, baby. Like

1157
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:43,200
this is, so is this the point where the set is revealed? Yes. Now we're in an Indiana Jones. It

1158
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:48,160
is, so this thing could not be more, he's going for Spielberg. We are now in an Indiana Jones

1159
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:55,520
as warehouse, but also very steampunkish. Yeah. A very steampunk like kind of lab warehouse setup.

1160
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:01,280
It's kind of yet sort of minimal and mysterious and like, yeah. And crates and tarps. So was he

1161
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:06,480
in front of a curtain before this or just an empty stage? I think there were things that I think big

1162
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:11,840
illusions were like getting set up behind there. It has been a curtain that they changed that set

1163
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:18,320
out. And he says, I guess this is after he says, my father left me keys to a secret warehouse

1164
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:22,640
with instructions not to open it until a specific day. Guess what that, guess what that day is.

1165
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:30,400
Today? You're pretty good. So then he opened, he tries to open a crate and then there's nothing

1166
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:36,160
in the crate. It looks like the joke's on me. Nothing. But then he somehow, I don't remember,

1167
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:40,800
fill in details if you can. It becomes like his father is going to send him something from the

1168
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:45,040
past. Yes. He's going to send me something from the past. Time travel isn't real. Everyone knows

1169
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:51,280
that time travel is not possible. It can't be done. And the box is spun around. It's like a goal set

1170
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:55,600
up to make it was, well, you, we did open, we saw there was nothing in the box and then the box is

1171
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:03,680
opened. And this is the moment where we meet. Was this on stage? Yeah. Cause we had a different

1172
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:11,200
reveal. Oh, hold on. Let me check with Lindsay. Lindsay, it was in the middle, right? Yeah. Yes.

1173
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:15,840
So it's a different, he changed it. Really? So he changed it. So you got it on the thing.

1174
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:22,400
I would just like to say the appearance of this, I was delighted. Yes, I was rolling my eyes.

1175
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:28,640
Okay. What's your heart opens to our little friend? Right. So he does, it's not the box.

1176
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:35,040
There was a box on stage, but in the middle of the theater, there's almost like a, I want to call it

1177
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:42,000
a containment, a Ghostbusters containment unit or something. And he sort of appears from the middle

1178
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:49,520
of it. He pulls him out. Yes. Oh yeah. It's very, it's extremely stitch. It looks like Stitch. Yes.

1179
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:53,920
Disney world. So he pulls them up in a thing of smoke in the middle of the theater. Yeah.

1180
01:10:54,560 --> 01:11:02,320
So, and at that point it's Jason, I have a photo. There's only a couple photos of him online.

1181
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:05,440
And I don't understand if you knew, it's fun to reveal this, but like,

1182
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:14,640
get the word out about Jason. Meet blue. Blue. Oh boy. Full name. Full name. Blue 32.

1183
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:22,400
So the show becomes about David's adventures with a little blue alien named blue. Now blue,

1184
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:26,720
there is a statue of blue in the lobby and he's labeled blue 32. So it's right there.

1185
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:32,720
Millions of people are passing by this. Don't notice. And aren't noticing blue. Yeah. So,

1186
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:43,040
and Jason, this is Disney quality animatronic. Really? It is amazing. And moveable. Yes. Because

1187
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:48,080
he does stuff in the middle of our theater and then he picks him up and moves him to the main stage.

1188
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:51,600
And there's times where he's standing. There's times where he's sitting. There's times where

1189
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:56,880
he's talking and David is holding him. This is this immersive, this is this totally interactive,

1190
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:03,040
incredible animatronic. This is like, uh, awesome. Oh, but 10 generations later. Yeah. Yeah.

1191
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:10,480
The movements you're describing. Very much so. Yeah. So he explains that blue was separated from

1192
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:17,600
his family in world war two. That's what he says. Yeah. Separated from his alien family, you know,

1193
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:24,080
an alien that got lost on earth and now is running around earth with us. Cause his family took off

1194
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:31,920
that story that only this does. And he has a great message for humanity, but today is his

1195
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:39,120
last day unless he gets back with his family. Yeah. Uh, so, and this is all said via like

1196
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:43,200
pretty much how you just said it. He had a message, but we didn't listen to him. And today's his last

1197
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:47,440
day on the planet. So he's going to die. Like he's basically saying he's going to die. He's going to

1198
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:55,200
ET rules, right? Like that's get ET back to his people. But like, why, why is it his last day?

1199
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:59,600
It's not, it's certainly not explained. No. Why it's his last day. And also, and the other thing

1200
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:03,520
that isn't explained is he came to deliver a message to us, uh, but we treated him poorly.

1201
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:08,800
We mocked him. We didn't listen to message. We didn't take it in. He was also at Christ where

1202
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:13,200
he's been like, he came to deliver a simple message that could save humanity, but we,

1203
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:19,440
we stoned him and we crucified him. Right. And, um, blue is Christ. So he explained this is right

1204
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:28,000
before that, uh, blue talks, of course. Yep. And you speak, you speak and he goes, sure I do his

1205
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:36,080
may have your father taught me English, David. So he sounds like rocket. His voice very easily

1206
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:41,120
identifiable. Uh, I haven't, I haven't seen confirmation of it. Even the goodest guy talking,

1207
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:47,120
but it's for sure. Rob Paulson, Rob Paulson, the voice of Yakko from Animaniacs. Oh my God.

1208
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:53,680
Raphael and the new Donatello. Pinky on pinky in the brain. Oh, legendary voice actor. One of the

1209
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:58,880
greats. And David. David. And he said, it's a, it's, it's a little bit Yakko. A little. I was

1210
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:02,800
trying to figure out how to do it. It's like a little bit of a softer Yak. It's like a, it's a

1211
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,080
Brooklyn. It's yeah. Yeah. It's a soft,

1212
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:14,320
this is so much. Why, why is his name blue? He was friends with his, uh, David Copperfield's

1213
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:19,600
father in world war II. What are you talking about? And why is he Brooklyn? Yeah. Why? It doesn't

1214
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:25,040
make any sense. They David, uh, and then he, he, one of the first things he does, what's that?

1215
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:31,920
Lindsay is interrupting in. It is that's, oh, I guess you're right. So if David's father

1216
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:36,640
taught him taught him English. Oh, thank you. You justify. Yeah. Yeah. Really? Yeah. He taught me

1217
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:42,480
Brooklyn English. Yeah. Broken English, Brooklyn English, Brooklyn English. Yeah. There's a friend

1218
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:46,560
that taught me all the capitals. Hey, let me sing about that. And then it, then it, then it, then

1219
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:55,120
the first, one of the first jokes, blue 32 has to drive a piano master around the deep south

1220
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:04,320
blue book, sequel to green book. Yes. Yeah. An unlikely friendship. I was going to say the first

1221
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:12,080
joke is that he hugs David and that he explains like that. This is how we check your credit

1222
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:19,280
rating on my planet. It's not a hug. It's how we check your credit rating. Really weird. And then

1223
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:24,160
he also, there's, we had a part where he says son of a, and then David covers his mouth and then he

1224
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:30,640
said, and then he opens it and then bitch. Yeah. So dad taught him to swear. Right. Now this is a

1225
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:35,360
thing. You're very, this is such a quick flurry. You're introduced to this character. You don't

1226
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:40,240
have time to stop and think about everything. And you're just, so just like he came, he came to

1227
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:44,480
deliver a message of peace and he came to save humanity, but he couldn't. And then when, once

1228
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:51,760
he's allowed to actually talk, he is profane and rude and weird and horny and pervy. Yeah. He,

1229
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:59,360
there's a woman, he sees a woman and he goes, she's hot. She's hot. She's hot. She's smoking.

1230
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:04,240
I had a barber Paulson, also the voice of the mask on the mask. Oh yeah. You should say smoking.

1231
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:10,240
I had, I had a girlfriend here on earth, a real wild cat. She showed me things I never knew were

1232
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:15,360
possible. And then it cuts to an old lady in the audience and then he says, Hey, what's,

1233
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:22,640
Hey, that's her. You still stripping that we had the same joke. Vegas humor. I guess. Yeah.

1234
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:27,120
I also, I'm realizing now that his outfit was different too. Is this the blue you saw?

1235
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:31,200
I'm not sure. It might not have been in a little robe. I think he, he had more of kind of like,

1236
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:38,000
of like, I'm going to say like when Jar Jar Binks is in the Senate and he has more of like a regal

1237
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,920
kind of outfit on, do we know what we're talking about? That's sort of what blue I think was dressed

1238
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:47,040
in. So that might've been an early blue. Anyway, sorry. You were saying, um, yeah,

1239
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:53,360
you're okay. You're yes. Your father's having English. Uh, and then at some point this Christ

1240
01:16:53,360 --> 01:17:02,000
figure, uh, does what any good Christ figure would do. And he farts. There is a fart. There's a pull

1241
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:09,440
my finger. He's like, your father taught me to do this. And then he pulls any, and then the audience

1242
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:15,840
like kind of laughs. And then a smell was released into the audience. Oh, oh yeah. So smell

1243
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:24,320
is the smell of root beer. And David, the David Copperfield says that's root beer. Do you all smell

1244
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:35,440
root beer? So blue farts, root beer. So the magician of the century doing his six year Vegas

1245
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:43,760
residency, six year long show still evolving and growing has essentially opted to have a great

1246
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:52,720
gazoo. Yes. A voluntary self-supplied. No one's asking him to save a show like the Flintstone.

1247
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:58,240
Wow. Elegantly put. Absolutely. Yes. I found the actual quote I was talking about before,

1248
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:02,800
and this is how Copperfield describes this section. It's sort of like an animated movie.

1249
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:07,920
Sometimes it takes three, four, five, even six years to get things right. So he's, he's seeing

1250
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:14,320
it as like his Flintstones or his like, yeah, he's seeing it like that. And to that end, uh,

1251
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:21,040
this character was not always called blue. At one point in time, this show ran for several years

1252
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,040
and his little alien friend was named Attila the hug.

1253
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:30,640
Before this earlier, we were talking about like inexplicable executive notes of where it's always

1254
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:36,000
like, it's not relatable enough for there's not enough, you know, it's not as, uh, too,

1255
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:42,800
too out there, but this just goes to show, like, if you have enough money, you can do

1256
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:50,080
whatever you want and get no notes. Yes. This is clearly an absolutely unnoted. Yeah. No feedback

1257
01:18:50,080 --> 01:19:00,400
ever as a, yeah, the switch from Attila. No, I don't think it's Attila the hug anymore. It's blue 32.

1258
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:04,640
What are these names? How do these fit together? So those aren't from the same, you know, Attila,

1259
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:09,680
he's named like the, the, the, the hun, the monster talking about, I don't know why he was Attila

1260
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:14,480
before. And then, uh, to your point, if someone were noting this, they might say, maybe you

1261
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:20,720
shouldn't follow up root beer farts immediately with the dialogue. You came here to deliver a

1262
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:24,480
message. We treated you poorly. We mocked you something he already said. We treated you poorly.

1263
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:31,120
We mocked you. What was the message? Love, love, love, David, love, love. I've said, I've seen this

1264
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:39,440
once a day now. Love, David, love, love, David, love, love. The message was love. My message was love, David.

1265
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:49,600
I will mutter it to myself with no one around. Love, love, love, David. The message is love.

1266
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:53,920
The message is love. He's definitely pulling from, I think Mike, what you called it recently,

1267
01:19:53,920 --> 01:20:01,600
the Disney playbook of like nine words and spire, faith, love. It's the thing I wrote. Love, David.

1268
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:07,280
Love is a great force of the center of existence. Love would solve all the problems of your world.

1269
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:14,400
If only you would let it. If only you would let it. It fell on deaf ears. My journey here was for

1270
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:20,800
nothing. I failed, David. I failed, David. It being David also creeps me out because David's

1271
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:29,760
like in the, it's like Prometheus and AI. Like David's always, you know, like origin Genesis

1272
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:35,680
kind of stories. Yes. Something about David. And it all reminds me of Teddy in AI. Yeah. Do you

1273
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:41,200
remember when you cut mommy's hair, David? And it also with the, with the, with the Brooklyn

1274
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:46,560
accent though, it also reminds me of Judd Hersh and Independence day. My David, it's my David.

1275
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,400
We gotta get into, we gotta get into town.

1276
01:20:53,360 --> 01:21:01,120
I can't see my David. My David knows what to do. The message was love, David. I failed.

1277
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:08,640
They love love. So weird. But right after Rupert farts, what the fuck? And then we know,

1278
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:12,880
why didn't, what, how would he mean you couldn't get the message out? Why not? Who didn't let you?

1279
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:18,960
The whole thing is bizarre because it's totally shoots wildly back and forth between like trying

1280
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:23,120
to be ultra sincere and important. And then all of a sudden he's just, you know, he's farting

1281
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:31,520
and hitting on women. So weird. I was, I saw on one of the reviews that in 2013, it was a lot more

1282
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:38,560
comedic. Yeah. So there was like more of that and less maybe of the sentimental in the show.

1283
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,800
Because other, yeah, the earnest parts are so earnest. And as I said, Amblinny and there's,

1284
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:46,480
there's cameras up on stage with them. So it's like, and the, it's such a photo realistic

1285
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:50,880
purpose. It's pushing in on him and pushing in on David. And at some point he later, he is like

1286
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:56,880
dying. He's like cradling. David Cotterfield is holding a dying alien in his arms. I failed.

1287
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:03,680
Your father would be proud of you. But elsewhere, like 10 minutes before it was like, like everybody

1288
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:10,800
up on stage. We're up all night to get lucky. It's so, and then like, Hey, dance, shake it.

1289
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:17,280
Boy, she's hot. Yeah, she's hot. When you said Amblinny earlier, I thought you meant like themes

1290
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:25,040
of family and all of this. Of course, but I didn't even think to take it literally of like small alien

1291
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:29,520
dying. Like, yeah, yep. Small. When you realize that, when you realize that we're, oh, we're

1292
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:34,720
settling into an ET ripoff. David Cotterfield has been starring in an ET ripoff play every night,

1293
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:41,920
multiple times. In the 2010s. He's in a cage. He's in his own monkey cage. Yes. He's getting,

1294
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:47,280
he's getting touched by, he's being lovingly touched by blue. The only creature that will

1295
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:53,360
love him as he has skewed his father. So he had to build a creature to love. He doesn't have a kid,

1296
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:58,400
does he? I don't think he, I think he's like constantly married and divorced and. Yeah,

1297
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:03,360
I don't think so. Blue is his child. He builds a child. There's also gotta be, if you're running

1298
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:10,640
two to three shows a day, there's a warehouse full of blues. There's not one. Well, I, I mean,

1299
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:15,680
I ran out of there going, where's the, where can I buy him? Can you buy blue? Can I get a blue?

1300
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:22,400
There's one piece of blue. One piece of blue. Yes. It's for charity supposedly. Yeah. And it

1301
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:29,360
doesn't really look like him, but it's a fanny pack, right? So it's a weird little like cloth

1302
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:36,240
pocket. Yeah. Not even a stuffed blue. Cause there was a stuff blue. I would be looking at it,

1303
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:41,280
right? Mike, there's a little blue statue outside the theater, but you can't buy it. Oh my God.

1304
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:45,360
That doesn't look like him at all. Yeah. This also, by the way, that one, that what you just showed

1305
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:50,240
the, the merch looks a little more Mack and me ish. Well, that has already been an ET ripoff.

1306
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:58,480
So we're, we're in another down the line, bizarre pseudo ET. I, yeah, I immediately, I did think

1307
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:03,760
Mack and me, I thought it was like a little blue Mack and me. Yeah. I wonder, I would love to see

1308
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:10,960
the evolution of the, the alien. Cause I'm sure if he's changing stuff as much as it sounds like

1309
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:13,840
there has to be, yeah. As you're saying, so many. Oh, wait a minute. Oh my God. This has been right in

1310
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:18,000
front of me the whole time. I just found an old photo. So they used to email you a picture of

1311
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:23,120
the celebrity you picked, which were they made be Brad Pitt for a long time, I guess. But in that

1312
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:28,240
email blue is in it. But I think this is when he was named Attila the hug because he is green.

1313
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:33,920
They changed his color. They've changed so much about him. Yeah. Interesting. I should mention

1314
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:40,320
also that he, David Carpfield revealed via an Instagram that because he congratulated the designer

1315
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:47,200
of blue on winning an Academy award. This guy is a sculptor and a makeup artist. Wow. Kazuhiro Tsuji

1316
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:57,760
who did the makeup on in darkest hour to transform Gary Oldman into into Churchill. Yeah. Wow. He was

1317
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:02,640
a protege of Rick Baker. He's the guy who turned a Joseph Gordon Levitt into Bruce Willis in looper.

1318
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:09,600
Wow. And he did all, he did the makeup that turned Tim Roth into the devious general fade

1319
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:18,480
new planet of the apes all hail fade. So this is major, major guy. So we signed blue. Is he just on

1320
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:24,160
like constant, like he's getting calls for the last five years. Like it's not right yet. Blue isn't

1321
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:28,720
right yet. You know what I want them to be? I want them to have bigger ears. Get away. Can you,

1322
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:32,560
you know, take your face out of Gary Oldman's ass for a minute and get back here and do what's

1323
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:42,000
important. Fly to Moosheke tonight. I will send a monkey driven plane. What the monkeys do with

1324
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,560
you with the wish. If you encounter any enemies on the way, there are computer generated guns.

1325
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:55,840
Boy, fire your lasers. And of course, if any of that doesn't work, just give the signal of love

1326
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:59,840
that my father gave me as a child. Don't forget to bring bananas for the pilot.

1327
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:06,880
That's the main way to guarantee he doesn't repute. That's your ticket. One of my favorite

1328
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:12,080
things is on TripAdvisor, the reviews of David Copperfield, this review just says an alien?

1329
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:18,160
Really? Two stars. The only references are people who hated it and they said, and somebody else is

1330
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:23,680
like, I like the show. But then he did this alien skit. I mean, WTF with that. How long does the

1331
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:29,600
alien thing go on for? 35. It's the last third of the piece. And then there's, there is some other,

1332
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:35,440
he does like prediction bits essentially that blue is around, but not really participating in just

1333
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:43,680
like get up on stage. Come on up. You look hot. Yeah. That's when he, yeah. So we should also say

1334
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:49,200
that when they're bouncing back and forth tonally, he's also set up and I, and now I'm

1335
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:54,800
misremembering a little bit. Oh yeah. He goes, blue goes, David look. And then David looks over and

1336
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:59,840
all of a sudden an hourglass appears and it's explained to the audience that once the sand

1337
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:05,120
run out, blue dies. He's going to die. They don't explain why they don't explain what

1338
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:09,040
force is behind this. But seemingly his family left him a long time ago. And you don't know why

1339
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:14,720
his family left. Why'd your family leave you? I don't know. Yeah. It's the guy tired of me.

1340
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:24,560
It doesn't, I don't know. Sorry, David. I can't help it. So they start the ticking clock of blue

1341
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:30,240
dying. And that's why, especially it's so bizarre when they just like play get lucky by daft punk

1342
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:37,760
and it's like, well, blue is going to die. Why are we, why are we in games? Yeah. I truly thought

1343
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:42,720
at some point he was going to make like time go backwards. He was going to break. Well,

1344
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:52,720
you see, in addition to, if there's, if these, if there weren't enough hats on hats on hats,

1345
01:27:53,280 --> 01:28:01,040
blue, the group you're farting alien from the forties also, does he just have them? Does he

1346
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:06,800
poop them? Why? What, where do they come from? He has time stone. He has access to time stone.

1347
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:12,320
I'm stone. So David, David sees the alien. He knows aliens exist. Now he accepts that reality,

1348
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:16,320
but David is still a bit of a skeptic. He tells people to, they can achieve the impossible,

1349
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:20,160
but time travel doesn't exist. It's impossible. There's no way time travel exists. Of course,

1350
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:25,600
that's, that's, there's no way. And blue explains that he has a time stone. He also explains,

1351
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:31,200
he shows David a P as a picture of him and David from the future, I believe.

1352
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:35,040
And he's like, what, this is a pic. He goes, that good Photoshop.

1353
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:42,080
No, no, no, David, this is a win. Yeah. And then real deal blue gives him a time stone,

1354
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:48,960
which is just like glowing, you know, rock or whatever. I wonder how long the time stone has

1355
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:53,920
been in. Yeah. Cause do we know when this recording hole, do we know when the recording is from?

1356
01:28:54,480 --> 01:29:00,160
I think it was two years ago, two years ago. Cause I was wondering, did he see Avengers infinity war?

1357
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:05,920
And then that's cause there's a time stone in that movie. Just verbatim. Good idea. The show has

1358
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:11,760
been, it's too Spielberg. It's time to make it more Russo. Although it could, because of course

1359
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:16,080
that's been in the comics for years. Obviously there's probably other media which used a time

1360
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:24,320
stone. That's such a lazy stone. Time stone. Time stone. I think the blue poops, the time stones.

1361
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:29,760
Yeah. That's the rigored. And that's why there's root beer farts is it's like a precursor to

1362
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,600
he's like the, he's there's a bowel movement and then plot time stone.

1363
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:42,080
Can I just ask? Yeah. I don't want to ruin your prestige.

1364
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:55,120
Does he use the, does he use time to make his father appear so he could say, I love you by doing the hand thing?

1365
01:29:55,120 --> 01:30:01,360
You're very close. You're really close. I'm in the ballpark. Yeah. Should we, should we keep getting there?

1366
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:05,840
Keep going. Keep going. You're really close though. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, somehow I don't know why this

1367
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:10,480
happened. He, he's, oh, uh, blue says I need everybody to give me the fingers.

1368
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:18,000
And then, and like what? Oh no, not that. Not that finger. The sign of love. And then, or this,

1369
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:24,800
and it turns out that the dad learned this hand symbol from blue. It's their species. It's the

1370
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:31,200
alien symbol of love. So everybody needs to make the symbol and then that makes the time stone.

1371
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:37,040
I don't know. I get confused in here. That's, I know it still makes any sense. I know my

1372
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:41,520
note either. Ask Desiree and it cuts to an audience. At some point also it cuts to an

1373
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:48,000
audience member. There's another root beer smell release and he goes, nah, it wasn't me. It was her.

1374
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,880
Right. And then it cuts to a woman in the audience who looks embarrassed. Then it zooms out a little

1375
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:59,520
bit and there's a big jug of root beer on her table. I don't know if we had that. Okay. Maybe

1376
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:06,400
it was cut because it is very confusing. Yeah. You drink root beer and then that's a familiar

1377
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:12,800
that is pure root beer. There is no food that where the fart smells exactly like the food smell.

1378
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:19,840
Or does the jug just smell that potent? Maybe. Yeah. Is it just that? Yeah. It's something about

1379
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:24,160
that. What's the Vegas atmosphere? It's being carrying right cigarette smoke. Maybe that's it.

1380
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:29,440
But then I brought this up to people who are like, no, no, no. The smell implies that the woman

1381
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:36,400
like drinks so much root beer. No, no, no. This is what the other, the other theory was that she

1382
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:43,840
smells like root beer because she sucked blues dick. Oh, whoa. Really? I don't know how that works

1383
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:47,440
either. But why would you have root beer then? No, it could have could. Do you not get this? How many

1384
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:54,080
people told you that? That's two people. Wow. Interesting. Yeah. No, she like sucked off blues.

1385
01:31:54,080 --> 01:32:00,320
So she smells like root beer now. But then there's a jug. This is more doesn't make sense.

1386
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:04,560
This is all letting me know. Notes are important. Maybe. Yeah. As I rant about

1387
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:09,120
network notes, somebody needed to come in and clarify is does she smell like root beer because

1388
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:14,560
she drank so much root beer or because she fucked blue. It would be really great if David would ask

1389
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:19,200
you for notes afterward because you've worked with him before. Hey, you're right. I did give him notes.

1390
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:24,880
Yeah. So yes, I'm a creative figure that he trusts. You know, you should email that email

1391
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:30,560
address back some notes. Oh, you're right. I have David's email. We all have David's email.

1392
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:39,280
This message has notes, David. My message is revised. My vest. My message is tighten up.

1393
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:46,480
Totally. He's really hot. I like what she's wearing. Tell us your I don't know. This is important.

1394
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:51,280
Somebody he learns what dancing is and then he dances a little bit and then David says,

1395
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:58,160
wow, it's like Bruno from Mars. Bruno from Mars. Bruno from Mars. No idea who that is.

1396
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:07,920
Some stage dancing to Daft Punk. Right. Why old song now? And still it's what they were still

1397
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:13,280
using. Right. Yeah. Daft Punk still in ours. Yeah. Right. Get lucky. No, it was her. OK. And then

1398
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:17,120
somehow it was but this dancing and he learns how to dance and root beer farts. But then back to

1399
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:21,520
love could have solved all the problems of your world, but nobody listened. And then he's dying

1400
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:30,320
and he'd like I'll never see my family again. It's OK. You're my family man. David is his new

1401
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:35,760
father. But then he remembers the time stone. Maybe you can go back. And then out of nowhere,

1402
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:45,200
he says, David, in this lighting, you look like George Clooney. Two lines after it's OK. You're

1403
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:51,600
my right now. And then that is still on the show. And you know that can't get cut. No, the compliment

1404
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:56,640
to the compliment of how handsome he is has to be in the show. Why does he say that when he's dying?

1405
01:33:56,640 --> 01:34:01,200
It doesn't make any. Yeah. I mean, that's obviously a good justification as he's losing his mind

1406
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:06,080
because it's being taken over by again, we don't know. Why are you dying? We don't know.

1407
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:12,960
Today's the day. He's been around since World War II. He's been alive since World War II.

1408
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:17,200
And it's not just like he's like he's very old and he's dying. He seems young and again,

1409
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:23,840
very vibrant. But I think he's not. Wait, or is he young? He's sent by the he sent with a time

1410
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:31,040
stone in a crate by Copperfield's father. I'm going to send my son, who I know, right. I know

1411
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:36,640
in the 40s that my son will be a big magician with his own theater in Las Vegas. Except, no,

1412
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:42,960
I think that's to be in the crate. OK, you're right. Your inception. Do you feel audience?

1413
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:48,560
Are you following this at all? You're right. But I guess I'm confused by the hourglass because like,

1414
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:55,840
why would today be the day if he time traveled? If you have access to time stones. Right. Because if

1415
01:34:55,840 --> 01:35:00,160
you because I guess my confusion was like, OK, I could see he was lost in World War II. And then

1416
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:05,920
today is obviously the day. But if he was time traveling, then like, why do they send? Why does

1417
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:11,040
father send him to the day when he's going to die? You know what I mean? That doesn't make sense.

1418
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:15,920
Yeah, he should have kept him in if he knew because Blue already knew this was the day he

1419
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:20,160
was going to die. It's probably more likely you could find his family back in the 40s where he's

1420
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:25,120
from. I think it just happened and he should have time traveled like a few days earlier.

1421
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:31,760
Was he just in the crate for like 70 years? Not sure. It's unclear. Again, he has a time stone.

1422
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:36,240
So I think he's and David says I'm getting a package from my father in the future.

1423
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:42,800
But is that like Back to the Future 2 where it's just been sitting at Western Union for 80 years?

1424
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:48,240
No, right. He's dying because he's suffocating in a crate. Let me out. Let me out.

1425
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:54,320
Subsisting on his own root beer farts for sustenance. Eating and re swallowing and regurgitating

1426
01:35:54,320 --> 01:36:01,360
the same time stone over and over. Poor Blue. That's all I have to say. So where are we at now?

1427
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:07,440
We're getting to the end. It's all happening at once. It's sort of like a good case for time being

1428
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:11,760
not real too because I sort of feel like it all happened at once and I didn't see it linearly.

1429
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:17,920
Time is a flat circle. Time is a flat circle. But I think this is the point. Well, also he keeps

1430
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:23,840
mentioning you have to get back to your family and to Lucy. Yes. Lucy. We've got to find Lucy.

1431
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:30,240
Is Lucy a member of his family, I guess? I'm not sure. We've got to find the family. How do we do

1432
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:37,600
it? Everybody makes the symbol, right? Yeah. The symbol of love. The lights go out and in the

1433
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:45,440
center of the room appears a massive hulking UFO. Jaw dropping. Incredible. Incredible. Yeah. Yeah.

1434
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:52,160
It's flying above us. It doesn't. Close enough to touch almost. You're seeing every detail on it.

1435
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:57,280
It seems dangerous. Yeah. Barely any clearance above your head. If you stood up, you'd bonk

1436
01:36:57,280 --> 01:37:02,640
your head on it. I couldn't see it, but there's obviously something coming from the stage that's

1437
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:06,640
holding it up, but it's hard to see it. You can't see it. You had a lot of lights getting blasted.

1438
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:12,080
That's part of it. But it's euphoria in the room at this point. Oh, they, if you weren't on board

1439
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:19,680
with any of this alien skit, now you are on board. You are weeping. It's amazing. I hate to go back,

1440
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:25,920
but before you do the symbol, we all do the symbol once and it doesn't work. Okay. And then he says,

1441
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:32,400
then Blue is really upset because he's mad at us because he says, they weren't focused. They

1442
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:38,000
weren't concentrating. So he's like mad that we didn't do a good enough job to summon that. They

1443
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,600
didn't really mean it. Yeah. They didn't really mean it. They were feeling idiots.

1444
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:48,720
So yeah, anyway, the UFO and then the UFO goes through back through like through the stage,

1445
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:55,680
essentially. Yeah. Which is again, very impressive. And I'm not sure cuts to a video where the

1446
01:37:56,400 --> 01:38:01,120
ship is hovering. It's in the room and blues in the room, but then it goes outside

1447
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:08,880
of the MGM grant. It's the actual hotel. It's grainy. It's grainy UFO ish looking like, you know,

1448
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:14,080
like the cell phone camera footage, which also doesn't make sense because it should just be

1449
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:20,240
like a good quality looking footage. That's like a go to Vegas trope. Cause remember the

1450
01:38:20,240 --> 01:38:26,000
Star Trek attraction, right? Yes. Flew over all the casinos. Um, the very bad New York,

1451
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:32,960
New York roller coaster. Yeah. CGI. When that had VR, you flew over everything. And then a spaceship

1452
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:38,640
landed only the casinos. They had the rights to show. Yes. Only the ones in their family.

1453
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:45,200
Um, yeah. So you're at, so you know, and then also when the ship is revealed, blue yells Lucy.

1454
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:49,760
And then cover field over all the euphoria. Lucy was the name of the share.

1455
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:59,280
Oh, okay. Bring her outside. His delivery gets really odd.

1456
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:08,480
And then there's the footage of the, of the UFO over the MGM grand. And then it's kind of like

1457
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:15,760
a little bit in silhouette. You see the inside of it and you see blue reuniting with,

1458
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:21,920
I forget, is it one alien? I don't remember. It's for sure. At least one, it might be two,

1459
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:28,320
but they like kind of reunite because it like zooms in on the UFO. And it's just,

1460
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:36,240
it's unbelievable. And so insane. And I'm, and he says he gives, there's a hug or something. Is

1461
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:40,320
it a hug before he leaves? And then, and then the reprisal of that's not a hug. I was just

1462
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:45,120
checking your credit score. Yeah. I think it's right before he leaves. Um, and,

1463
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:51,920
God, I'm getting, I'm so, we've been talking for three hours about this. I know. Uh,

1464
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:57,600
at some point over the course of this, he says, David, your, your father would be so proud

1465
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:03,280
because he made the ship appear. Uh huh. Father would be proud of you. Just put the, then it,

1466
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:08,640
it becomes all about resolving the dad thing and putting words into his dad's mouth. Who's in real

1467
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:16,320
life is deceased, I guess. Well, it's, I hate to digress one more time. Uh, so he's dying in David's

1468
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:25,760
arms. Yeah. And it's like the, cause the hourglass ran out and then this is before the UFO and stuff.

1469
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:30,080
And then it's explained just like the time stone and they go back in time and he's alive. And then

1470
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:34,800
all that stuff happens. Oh yeah. I think I'm out of order. Yeah. The time stones. It's my last one.

1471
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:40,960
Yeah. So more stuff. So like, but it doesn't explain like how they fixed it or whatever.

1472
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:45,760
He just gets the time stone. They go back in time and then Lucy, the UFO appears,

1473
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:50,960
but then doesn't aren't they, don't my brain is breaking. Don't they use the time stone to

1474
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:55,120
make the dad thing? Yes. No, that's where to get. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. They do that too. I mean,

1475
01:40:55,120 --> 01:41:02,400
maybe he, maybe he uses two time stones, one to go back in time to save blue and then one to

1476
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:08,240
meet his father. I only have four times. There's only four. I'll shit a few more out later, David,

1477
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:19,360
but for right now I only made four. So David reads a letter from his father that's narrated

1478
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:25,920
by a ghostly voice of his father. Uh, David, I've been a little upset lately. I felt like

1479
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:31,440
you forgot about your dad when you went to live your dream. All I want was for you to find your

1480
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:38,480
passion. You're not just living your dream. You're living my dream too. David, I love you. I'm proud

1481
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:44,080
of you. And this is where I have to credit Jason Walliner for giving me the perspective of the,

1482
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:51,840
this man has trapped himself in a box where every night he has, is living out fan fiction

1483
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:56,080
that he's writing about his own father, telling him that he loves him and he's proud of him.

1484
01:41:56,080 --> 01:42:00,960
And it's okay that he focused on magic and stopped seeing him, which for sure means

1485
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:07,200
that never happened. Right? Like that for sure means that like his dad didn't accept him as a

1486
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:13,520
magician. And that hence all of the early, nobody believed in me. Right. And like doing a scene,

1487
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:19,840
a play. I believe, I always believed in you. When I said, don't do magic, I was too scared to say,

1488
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:25,040
I really want you to do it. Right. So very handsome and you look like George Clooney. Love you son.

1489
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:29,120
So you're, you think this had less impact than when Optimus Prime says,

1490
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:35,040
you did a good job to evac and you want to transfer. You're comparing me and evac to David

1491
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:41,200
and his fake father. Yeah. Or like, I excitedly texted you the other day that like you see in

1492
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:45,680
that new X-Men comic, Professor X told Cyclops he was proud of him. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

1493
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:52,400
Favorite trope. Proud of you. I'm proud of you. Yeah. Getting that, having it happen two to three

1494
01:42:52,400 --> 01:43:00,320
times a day. I mean, I guess on Transformers it happens every five minutes, but still the ickiness

1495
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:05,120
of. Yeah. Well, what's all of this? Jason also described it as between Blue and David,

1496
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:13,280
there are two robots who've lost their free will doing a play to each other. This is the, I mean,

1497
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:17,760
I shouldn't say this is the part where I started to think maybe the story wasn't true that he told,

1498
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:26,720
but this part is when he, so he does that. And I did think the footage of his parents in the olden

1499
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:35,280
days might be real to start. When David appears in the footage after traveling back in time,

1500
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:43,280
I realized, of course it's not real. And this is just an actor he's hired to play his mother and

1501
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:52,800
father. You hear the neo of ghostly Blue disappearing. David, find your heaven.

1502
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:59,200
And then he uses a time stone to appear in the footage that you saw way earlier. It's his mom

1503
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:06,080
and dad in the fifties. And then suddenly he is filmed on eight millimeter film and he is waving

1504
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:14,240
to his father who smiles knowingly and they get to have one last moment together. Except who's this?

1505
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:20,800
Some guy. And what a weird way to have a final connection with your dad.

1506
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:29,760
If you suddenly, let's see, if one of us ends up having children and right now in the door

1507
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:38,400
walks a grown man, how would we know it was not an intruder, but our grown adult son from the future?

1508
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:44,960
I like how would you know? How does this guy, maybe a father would know. I'll give them the credit.

1509
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:50,800
Oh, of course. That's my grown, except David has had a lot of work done. That muddies the waters.

1510
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:59,440
He's got a weird upper tort upper body. My son's abs. If they did a reboot of the wonder years

1511
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:06,960
now with all the home video, the home movie footage from the old credits, it'd be like if they use that

1512
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:13,600
same footage, but like Fred Savage fresh from the set of that just happened, wandered into

1513
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:21,120
that footage. Like it's just, yeah, it's just an intruder looking at children and middle age people.

1514
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:28,160
I'm trying to figure out a park like hello. Yeah. Hello. Just a grown stranger at a park.

1515
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:33,440
Like anytime that happens in like looper or something, it's always like there's always a

1516
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:38,320
weird glitch of someone go like either like flinching, like some, I feel something feels

1517
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:44,480
wrong or a character going, don't freak out. Don't freak out. I'm you like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1518
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:49,600
It has to be explained, but no, they know. And the score is so amblyny, so majestic triumphant,

1519
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:58,320
the biggest moments you could ever imagine. Is it possible? Is it pot love, David love,

1520
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:05,680
is it possible Blue is known to him at this point in his timeline, the father? Yeah, it could be.

1521
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:12,320
So maybe Blue, he kind of knows that his friend Blue, who he taught how to hug people and hit on

1522
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:19,200
chicks, he knows that there's a possibility that like family members will time travel.

1523
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:25,920
So you're saying he just is seeing a plan come together. Sure. Yeah. Not like a guy walk into

1524
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:31,440
a yard because he maybe he sent Blue. Well, they're in a park. Are there enough? Excuse me.

1525
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:37,280
Yeah. So Blue, because he sent Blue into the future. So presumably he knows something might

1526
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:48,480
come back. Another hole in the logic is that he sent Blue into the future 50, 60 years. Yeah.

1527
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:54,320
Long, long time. So the family members are all aliens. They're either like very old or dead.

1528
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:59,360
If they're like live in a similar way to humans. Yeah, maybe that timeline is different, though.

1529
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:04,480
So why would he send him into the future to find the family? Now he's going to see them all 60

1530
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:09,440
years later. Doesn't make any sense. This is the kind of thing that where you need a wrap up show,

1531
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:15,760
like Fred Savage is what just happens to explain what just happened. David's of future past.

1532
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:26,160
I so this moment I cannot tell you when David Garfield on in fake old film with a shiv eating

1533
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:33,360
grin like love your dad is this is the most deliriously stupid. You've bid goodbye to an

1534
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:41,040
alien ship has just appeared in the room and I imagine in both of our cases you are drunk and

1535
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:48,800
it is just I was not so drunk, but I was buzzed. So how long is this show? Hour and a half shorter

1536
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:54,000
than very short. Really? That all fits in an hour and a half. He's got to do it three times.

1537
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:59,840
Got to do it three times a day. Go no intermission. Yeah. No, no, he doesn't take a break because

1538
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:05,680
he's got to be pounding through. Let's get it done. It is. Yeah. And he doesn't even wait.

1539
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:12,160
So Rob Paulson is not there live. It's a like clips. Yeah. It's clips of blue talking. And so

1540
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:17,600
when you're saying cut, like go like ask me a question is blue or whatever. And I'll do like

1541
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:23,360
how David interacts with blue. What's going on? Things are going on. And then this is like he,

1542
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:27,760
he barely lets him finish the sentence before he goes. We treated him poorly. We didn't let him

1543
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:33,600
get the message out. So like he knows he can't lose five minutes out of this show. He's got a,

1544
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:38,160
he barely lets blue finish. If you were enjoying it, the show might go 20 minutes longer, but yeah,

1545
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:43,200
it's like bang, bang, bang. I'm glad I'm still under a wet, a little under the weather or else

1546
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:49,520
I would probably be hopping in my car to drive to see this with my own. Here's the thing is

1547
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:52,880
Copperfield, the guy we should be probably supporting with money. Probably not. That being

1548
01:48:52,880 --> 01:49:00,400
said, I need to see this again. Yeah. Claps in between. I thought, yeah, need to see. I,

1549
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:05,120
uh, yeah, I thought about it last time. It's been Vegas. Definitely thought about it. Uh, I don't

1550
01:49:05,120 --> 01:49:08,800
know. And this all makes me want to do it again. And just see it from the perspective, like the

1551
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:14,240
twists are ruined now, but, and if you go see this, having listened to all this rambling, I still think

1552
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:20,960
you're going to, the surprise will be gone. However, the seeing blue in person and you don't know how it

1553
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:26,240
works. It's incredible. How is it able to stand and sit? It's got floppy legs. It's got stiff legs.

1554
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:31,120
It's an amazing animatronic. Wait, is it in that front row? I mean, anywhere in the theater looks

1555
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:37,040
great, but like, I'm like, holy shit, I'm like six feet away. There's a person in there. No,

1556
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:42,720
no, it's so small. It's like a foot tall. Oh, okay. Uh, it's would like, what would happen if you

1557
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:53,440
size of a big hog. It's like a baby that stands. They, uh, Jason, I'm tiny and I'm small. Jason.

1558
01:49:57,120 --> 01:50:02,880
This is good. What have you, like, I was so interested, like, what if he truly ever was

1559
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:06,480
thrown off in the show? Cause I realized now, of course, everything that was like throwing him off,

1560
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:11,120
quote unquote, was all plants. But like, what if we sat in the front row with blue shirts on or

1561
01:50:11,120 --> 01:50:16,880
something? Would he even acknowledge it? Will we get thrown out with those blue pockets we can buy?

1562
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:23,360
Oh yeah. If we wore the fanny packs. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah, maybe. Yeah. Like cause he,

1563
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:28,800
we've got some troublemakers here. You gotta get out of here to the monkey minds.

1564
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:38,240
No refunds. Slave them, force them to play pirates once every three years when someone cops up

1565
01:50:38,240 --> 01:50:45,840
$20,000. Oh man. You would go us both at gun point. Like in the back of the Vegas, like in the back

1566
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:52,560
of the MGM grand, there's just some heavies with guns. Like, well, Jason has been escorted out of

1567
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:58,960
magic shows before, right? I believe he got escorted out of Chris. Oh, really? In Vegas?

1568
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:07,840
Well, we won't do that. Yeah. But like, if we were too enthusiastic about blue,

1569
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:13,040
maybe, or like, we were like, it's a, there's an alien. It's going to be an alien. He's going to

1570
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:18,880
say, or like, we were shouting the lines out before he did them. Yeah. I well, as Disney said long

1571
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:23,760
ago, do you think we want to cross David Copperfield? No, we don't want to cross blue.

1572
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:29,520
We certainly don't. That might be one of the places in Vegas where it is still like casino or like

1573
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:36,400
to put you in the back room and start beating you with the. Yeah. Like the big, well that of

1574
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:42,640
course turned out to be a friend of his, of Danny Oceans beating him up. No, I meant the Scorsese

1575
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:48,480
casino. Blue. Oh yeah. They're going to drag you onto the desert, like peshy, bury you alive.

1576
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:56,240
Yeah. But bury him alive. Blue water boards us with root beer. Stubs, stuff,

1577
01:51:56,240 --> 01:52:00,480
I'm going to find chips in our mouth. Just Scott, I'm going to find your mouth until you wish you

1578
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:08,320
were dead. Don't you ever try to disrupt David and I shows. Sweet rootbeers. No, we have a show here.

1579
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:12,800
We have a show here and it goes perfectly or else you're going to feel the repercussions.

1580
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:19,920
Smacks me with his little hand. Trust me, this ain't just checking your credit score.

1581
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:29,280
Well, he is a slime bat. He is like a peshy little greaser guy. Yeah. What if, yeah, what if he gets

1582
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:34,560
like David eventually gets him so he's like sentient. David, like we have to perfect this.

1583
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:37,600
We have to perfect it. And then he becomes sentient. Then they have a falling out.

1584
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:40,160
And then David has to get rid of blue.

1585
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:47,600
Send the monkeys. Disappears him on his island. And that is the movie.

1586
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:51,120
The full prestige style magician. Oh my God, what a movie that is.

1587
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:52,960
But it's David Copperfield and Blue.

1588
01:52:55,200 --> 01:53:00,480
He was my protege and his powers grew above mine. Tesla. Now you and I, the audience tonight,

1589
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:04,800
we have to go kill him. Make this sign with your hands. We'll use it to strangle him, his tiny neck.

1590
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:10,160
Elon Musk stands in for Tesla. His assistant is Grimes.

1591
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:14,480
Or Blue. There was a package.

1592
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:19,040
We'll use his boring company tunnels to take Blue around the world.

1593
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:27,120
And all the way to Mushikei. Could he? He's toured. David has also toured before. Is there a chance

1594
01:53:27,120 --> 01:53:32,720
he does another five years of this and then tours this? Oh God, I hope. Once he's perfected it.

1595
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:35,520
In an arena. I want to see this at the Staples Center.

1596
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:39,120
I mean, he has it must have a compound in Vegas, right? Because residents.

1597
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:43,600
He has his consortium of wonder. Oh, the consortium one. I don't know if he lives there.

1598
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:46,960
I don't think he lives there, does he? I'm not sure. But if you had a bunch of

1599
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:53,200
weird hidden Houdini beds. Do some people live in the casino that they do the residency at?

1600
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:58,400
I think everybody has like really fancy suites. Like an apartment just to rest in between shows.

1601
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:04,320
Yeah. Or how Michael Jackson rented a whole floor of the Mandalay Bay despite not doing a show.

1602
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:08,400
But he just rented the whole floor and rode a little trike around and filled it with statues

1603
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:15,440
of the little green giant. Cool. From the food? Yeah. He that's a part of the Living with Michael

1604
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:20,400
Jackson special. He explains to reporter. I don't remember that part. What the little green giant

1605
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:26,160
is. It's one of the strangest things. They say it was an American commercial ran for many years.

1606
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:31,760
He taught children how to eat peas. He'd say ho ho ho. Jesus. So that's a lot of fun and that's

1607
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:35,120
why I have it here. So wait a minute. It's not the jolly green giant. It's that little version. The

1608
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:40,560
little kid. Little green giant. There's a statue of the jolly green giant. But there were two

1609
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:44,960
green giants, I believe. I believe jolly green giant had a little green giant. What really?

1610
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:50,880
I think there were two. Oh. Huh. Boy, here we're talking about the little blue giant.

1611
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:58,480
And we've found more giants. Well, and that, remember, Kraft told us, the Kraft father told

1612
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:04,800
the story about him and Tony Baxter meeting with Michael Jackson on an entire read it out floor of

1613
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:11,440
the universal Sheraton. Oh, right. So I guess he just, the way you would rent a hotel room when

1614
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:16,800
you go to a hotel, he gets a whole floor. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This I found, I pulled up a picture.

1615
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:20,800
There's a jolly green giant and then the little green giant. Oh, I sat on his shoulder. Yeah. So

1616
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:25,200
that was Michael. Michael had a statue of the big one. Oh, it was, it was the jolly green giant.

1617
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:28,960
Yeah. It was not little green. Yeah. Wow. But he had a blue. It was interesting. Yeah.

1618
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:40,560
A green. It's green. It's my green. Um, yeah. So yeah, I don't know what else to say. Go see.

1619
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:45,840
I don't, as much as that was all a line by line spoiler, you have to see it to believe. I'd still

1620
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:51,520
tell you, Jason, if you go to Vegas. Yeah. You gotta go. It's unbelievable. And I forgive us for,

1621
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:56,000
I hope nobody's mad about us spoiling all of this, but it's, it's out there. It's I, I, what I don't

1622
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:02,320
understand is why blue isn't easily Google a bowl. Right. But you can, I think he wants this to be,

1623
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:06,720
he wanted blue to be an icon. Well, Vegas is it's all the merch. If you didn't, Vegas is its own

1624
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:11,760
bio dome. Like Vegas is its own thing. That's what you hear people. I had this experience when I went

1625
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:17,200
to Vegas for the first time of like, who is Danny Gans and Danny Gans. And he passed away a few years

1626
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:24,480
ago, but he was like the one of the most famous people in Vegas. Yeah. And anonymous. Well, I

1627
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:29,200
in much of the rest of the country, unless you would seen Danny Gans. I sent you a picture of a

1628
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:34,960
guy who performs or that I don't know anything about other than his name tape face. Tape face.

1629
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:40,560
I remember tape face. What is it? I forget which casino he's at. He's a guy who does, she wraps tape

1630
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:46,800
around his face tape on his face. I assume there's more to the act than that. But yeah, exactly.

1631
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:53,040
But it's a, he's got a show. I saw it. I've been to Vegas two times this year. He's it's a,

1632
01:56:54,560 --> 01:57:03,600
he performs in the house of tape theater. What the fuck are you saying? This is all the masking tape,

1633
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:09,920
right? I am I on time stones here. It's the, I believe it's the Harris casino. And there he is.

1634
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:16,240
Can you see that? Yeah. Swing, swing it over here. Tape face. We're going to get the show right.

1635
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:20,960
No, that's electrical tape. We've got newcomers like tape face, nipping up my heels. I mean,

1636
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:27,280
there's a show tape face. Building with giant Jabberwockies. Like one of the casinos has the

1637
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:31,360
big Jabberwockies. That's MGM Grand too. I think they might perform in the Copperfield theater. Yeah.

1638
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:36,800
Right across. You can see blue and then take like a hundred steps and see a giant Jabberwocky mask.

1639
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:41,760
Yeah. Yeah. It's a, I've been to Vegas. Magic. Wonderful. And by the way, all this,

1640
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:46,160
where there used to be a fucking theme park too. We haven't, I can't believe we haven't done MGM

1641
01:57:46,160 --> 01:57:52,000
Grand adventures. That's got to be. It seems like theme park ghosts have infused this casino between

1642
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:56,800
Copperfield and Jabberwockies. Mike and I, by the way, years ago did an improv show with like the

1643
01:57:56,800 --> 01:58:04,320
$1 version of those masks on. And it's still a very, a very unpleasant, like I think my whole face was

1644
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:08,880
covered in sweat by the end. Like not a good idea. And the audience members were like, well,

1645
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:15,200
we could kind of hear you. And it's like, oh right. The audio dampening. It was Halloween.

1646
01:58:15,200 --> 01:58:18,880
It was Halloween. I did a sketch at Brad and Nick's Atlantic city where I had like a black

1647
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:23,280
matte, like the, the skin tight mask and then Jabberwockies mask above that. And there was a

1648
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:28,080
part where I like pretended to drink water and just splashed it into my face. And it was like

1649
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:31,760
the funny enough beat of the thing. But then I felt like I was getting waterboarded. You just got

1650
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:36,080
waterboarded. I had to like, I like pause. If you watched video of it, I like,

1651
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:44,080
like I was like choking. I almost died on stage at UCB Franklin in a Jabberwockies mask. I actually

1652
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:49,600
almost like, like fell to the ground. I'm scared. Even you actually, when you said Jabberwockies

1653
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:55,200
mask, I just, I did have like, like stress flashbacks. Jabberwockies give me PTSD.

1654
01:58:55,200 --> 01:59:04,560
So be careful putting on those masks. You can cut the nose and the mask. You can cut it a little

1655
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:09,840
bigger. That's what I did. How have we all had this specific scenario? So remember if you're

1656
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:16,320
playing a Jabberwocky, cut the nostril holes bigger. That's so weird. Yeah, we did that. We had to cut

1657
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:21,040
it. Cause yeah, it was like really like sucking air out of it. Yeah. Did you buy, we bought it

1658
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:25,600
from party city. There's all the different colors on the wall. You can buy. I also then noted in the

1659
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:31,360
Jabberwocky store there, the Jabberwocky's masks cost like $27. Are they the same quality? Yeah.

1660
01:59:32,720 --> 01:59:38,560
They aren't even branded. It sucks. Anyway, you had it on for three to four minutes. We had it on

1661
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:46,320
for a full Harold, a comedic form. You can't really abandon. No. Oh my God. And once you start,

1662
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:51,440
yeah, you can't like maybe find that curtain and take a breath. Well, let that be a lesson.

1663
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:57,040
Why are we all trying so hard with all of these shows? Look what we did. We did that live show

1664
01:59:57,040 --> 02:00:01,840
and we made a limo and there's masks and all this shit. We're all putting in all this effort.

1665
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:06,480
We each need to take a page from the Copperfield playbook sleep walk through the same show

1666
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:12,640
over and over again for years. Now granted that does have million dollar illusions going on

1667
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:19,040
constantly, but you know, putting Copperfield effort. Yeah. I mean, all I'll say to sum up is

1668
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:25,200
that the thing is we are obviously our live shows have the same message as Copperfield's and as of

1669
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:32,800
course blue gives love, love, love, make the symbol, make the symbol. It's our symbol of what's the PTR

1670
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:41,600
symbol of love PTR symbol of love. Jason, love, love. Jason, love, love, Jason. Thank you for

1671
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:49,040
teaching me about love, gentlemen. You think blue. Thank you. Thank you, blue. Thank you for not

1672
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:57,280
mocking my message. You survived podcast, the ride. Fuck man. I need a cigarette. I need a big

1673
02:00:57,280 --> 02:01:02,480
jugger. If in one episode you could just do the show as Jason and we could both be blue, that would

1674
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:09,920
be really satisfying to me. But that's just about it's just a regular topic. Yeah. Normal episode,

1675
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:16,560
mind train. Yeah. And then blue is also blues show. We're touring. We've got some live shows

1676
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:20,880
coming up and like, oh, we don't want to do a whole we'll be traveling. We don't want to do,

1677
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:27,360
we can't do the limo that kind of props everything. But the pizzazz of you guys being blue for a live

1678
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:31,360
audience. Scott is two blues. Yeah, that'll that'll pay off. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1679
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:37,760
Travels man, there's 30s. I'm Jason Sheridan joined as always by blue love and love.

1680
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:45,040
All right, let's be let's beam out of here. Let's go back to our family. He's a time stone.

1681
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:49,040
Goodbye. Bye.
