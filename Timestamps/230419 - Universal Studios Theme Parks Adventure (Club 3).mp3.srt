1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,580
Nice to meet ya.

2
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:34,940
Okay, let's pick ourselves up and remove the shrapnel from our bodies after a grueling, violent Club 3.

3
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,260
Yes.

4
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:43,180
What a season it has been. Mike, Jason, and me, Scott, we're just, we're still reeling this ringing in our ears.

5
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:51,260
Yeah, no, I, I, uh, we've seen a melee, I guess, really what it is, but like a long melee.

6
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:51,820
Yeah.

7
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,500
Not a quick one.

8
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,260
Factions, tribalism within our own audience.

9
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:55,820
That's right.

10
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,380
And it just goes to show sometimes violence is the answer.

11
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,940
Well, I can only assume there must have been violence at some point because there was essentially a coup.

12
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,420
This is what I feel happened.

13
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:07,700
Oh yeah.

14
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,060
Yeah.

15
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:19,140
Uh, this, this, uh, particular Club 3 month, this is the results of what we set up last month, which is, was good boys of the galaxy topic rewind.

16
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:25,980
And the idea is this was our chance to put some of the older topics that lost the polls, but we think they'd still be great episodes.

17
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,300
Let's put them together.

18
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,500
And things got crazy.

19
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,020
I mean, it became just a, a dogfight between the two that I picked.

20
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:41,340
Just a melee between the ones that I chose and not you guys.

21
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,540
Yeah, that's, that's true.

22
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,220
You know, you're right.

23
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,740
Uh, and as you pointed out last time, mine always get last.

24
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:59,980
No, mine were pretty bad this time because I also think people were trying to troll me after what I said in the last Club 3, which was to try to get your, you like internally politic did.

25
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:05,860
And you said, well, I, the last one is there a, my, whatever comes in last goes to hell, cannot be talked about on the show.

26
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,220
Right.

27
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,180
You chose escape from tomorrow.

28
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:13,540
The miserable film secretly made in Disney world, but also Disneyland because no one will notice.

29
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:13,820
Right.

30
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,100
Yes.

31
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,900
Everyone noticed.

32
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,180
Yeah.

33
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,900
You wanted that to go to hell and never be talked about.

34
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,740
I did.

35
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,940
Sincerely, I did.

36
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,140
And then, yes, I think some people voted just to try to punish me or us.

37
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,860
I agree, but not as many as I thought.

38
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:32,300
And I think actually that votes were stolen from the, I, I, here's what I think.

39
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,500
I don't know where it was happening.

40
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,980
I've never been in our discourse.

41
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:42,660
I don't know what's going on in there, but I think that there was like a Senate style, uh, jockeying for votes.

42
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,060
I think that there was like a Kevin McCarthy type.

43
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,180
Okay.

44
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,940
We didn't have the votes this time, but we're going to run it again.

45
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,420
We'll see if we can flip them and them and them.

46
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:55,300
I think there may be, I think we can get, I think we can get them to switch from escape from tomorrow over to universal game cube.

47
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:03,940
I think yeah, it was like, uh, what's the, what's, what are those folksy like, uh, like, uh, primaries during straw polls or something?

48
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,460
It's like, ah, everybody gets together and you like try to talk each other into something.

49
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,860
It's very, it's casual.

50
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,260
Maybe this is actually the club three pole more aggressive than the thing I'm talking about.

51
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:12,780
I think it might've been.

52
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,300
That's what I'm wondering.

53
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,700
I'm wondering if there was, if not literal violence and the threat of violence.

54
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:22,860
Uh, it's very possible because I really got the sense that people had very strong opinions about this.

55
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,780
Extremely, extremely strong.

56
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,580
They weighed in.

57
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,700
It was, it was pretty clear throughout.

58
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:35,740
And what happened was, uh, uh, bar rescue, the taff or so was off to an early, seemingly insurmountable lead.

59
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,340
And then slowly you saw votes trickle over.

60
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:39,700
Yeah.

61
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,260
It was, you know, what it was like was the, the, the Biden Bernie where ultimately like who's going to,

62
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,060
everybody, different people are winning different states.

63
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,020
And then the president gotten involved and said, everyone else dropped out.

64
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,220
Here's what we're doing.

65
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:53,460
Okay.

66
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,980
You guys stand down our only chance to take down.

67
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,620
Right.

68
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,420
I mean, I was about to, I guess, yeah.

69
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,100
Taffer is Sanders here, which is a bizarre metaphor.

70
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:08,460
Doesn't make sense politically, but for this metaphor of what actually just physically dynamic.

71
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:08,900
Yeah.

72
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,580
I know I don't know, but in a way it makes sense.

73
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,580
Cause I like them both.

74
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,700
A friend did message me and go like, Hey, taffers does this taffers not go to hell.

75
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,100
Right.

76
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,260
And I'm like, I don't think so.

77
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,700
I don't think that's what we said.

78
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,460
I think it, I believe it was one of my, I think it's the Google dark ride.

79
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,340
This is what happened.

80
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:26,420
Yeah.

81
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,740
Google assistant dark ride from CES 2019 goes to hell.

82
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,180
Is there anything you'd like to say?

83
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,900
No, uh, literally my thought process.

84
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,700
I, yeah, I think Mike was maybe gaming at a little.

85
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,020
My thought process on both my choices were, Oh, that would probably be interesting to

86
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,780
talk about.

87
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,260
Like, uh, uh, you weren't galaxy braining it.

88
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,220
Like I was, I was not galaxy brain again.

89
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,380
Although I didn't, it didn't work.

90
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,940
What I was trying to do did not work.

91
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,620
Well, what you'll it, it's not going to pay off for you until we do this again and

92
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:04,500
see if I, cause I know your entire methodology there was to protect your Grogu style

93
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:04,860
top.

94
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,260
I have to protect Don knots at the word we're saying wrong.

95
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,540
Apparently we key watch.

96
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,340
She's I don't know how to say it.

97
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,700
Uh, um, who, I don't know what this is.

98
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,260
It seemed to just, I'm for it.

99
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,220
I would do this episode, but you, you really, you fell on your sword to save

100
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:20,940
you on yachts.

101
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,620
Cause I'm going to, I'm going to have to force that in somewhere else because I

102
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,500
know that's not winning a poll, but, but you know, like legends grow, I think by

103
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,020
us talking about here, maybe it'll come in hotter whenever it's true, but that

104
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,820
requires you to pick it next time.

105
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,860
You're going to have to do it differently or pick one that one that you want or

106
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,140
one that you hate.

107
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:38,540
Okay.

108
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,700
Well I'll think about, I'll think about it next time and then we'll see if I, I

109
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,180
tried a galaxy brand or I just go from the heart, just pick what was interesting.

110
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:46,780
Sure.

111
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,020
Cause I, you know, I am a look, I'm afraid of being hurt.

112
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:50,780
Okay.

113
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,420
And that's really what this is about.

114
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,060
Speaking of, you know, what is the thread that we let go is the idea that it's,

115
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,980
it's some point maybe in a club three or wherever you want it to be.

116
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,260
Yes.

117
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,460
You would tell the story about getting hurt.

118
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,100
Yes.

119
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,500
By a girl, by a situation involving a girl.

120
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,260
Everything is really my fault in this situation.

121
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,780
And it's very, I honestly, it's very in a quaint, innocent.

122
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,340
Um, I don't think I'm ready today though.

123
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,140
I just, I just, we didn't check in on that through line last time.

124
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,220
So I thought you were going to bring up that I proposed that we could like add

125
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,460
something to the PTR constitution on club three.

126
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,180
I mean, certainly that.

127
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,460
I don't have an idea for that yet.

128
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,020
Well, clearly things are getting crazy.

129
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,540
You did do it last episode, I suppose that the, the, um, the one that came in

130
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,260
last was going to hell.

131
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,060
I softened it instead of a year, but instead Google assistant goes to hell forever.

132
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,660
I tacked an amendment onto it that it goes to hell if it gets in last place.

133
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,780
Oh, I thought it was going to hell for one year.

134
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,060
No, I argued no.

135
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,900
No, it turned into it's forever now.

136
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,460
Okay.

137
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:50,860
You know what?

138
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,220
Let's do our official vote though right now.

139
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,260
Cause I don't know, maybe Scott actually has decided the other way.

140
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,220
Do we, let's vote.

141
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:03,180
Do we think when we do something like a, a, would the rewind poll, excuse me.

142
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,820
I forgot the name of the rewind.

143
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,780
Topic rewind.

144
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,780
Do we believe that the last place, uh, vote getter should never be talked about,

145
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,260
never get an episode on podcast.

146
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:12,700
Right.

147
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,860
I will vote first.

148
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,340
I will vote.

149
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:14,940
Yes.

150
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,660
Yay.

151
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,100
All right.

152
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,740
Well, that's what's going to vote.

153
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,820
No, cause I don't feel that strongly about that.

154
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:28,060
I mean, my, my, my lazy fair, like my, my usual go to is for like a

155
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,300
topic, so either like, oh, I think that'd be really interesting to delve into or

156
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,860
it's like, well, this seems very silly.

157
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,820
That seems like a lot of goofy fun.

158
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,460
Uh, today, uh, turned out to be kind of both.

159
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,540
I think so.

160
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,300
Look, I'm happy with the result.

161
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:43,580
I know.

162
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,060
I think something started forming where it was like the, like the boys,

163
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,300
where we got to take Taffer away.

164
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:50,620
Yeah.

165
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,060
I don't know.

166
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,340
I saw this too.

167
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,860
I felt like it was like, we were pushing John Taffer like, Oh, we need to do John

168
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,700
Taffer.

169
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,860
It was the, there were some verbs used for what we were doing strong arming.

170
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:02,540
What?

171
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,740
I don't, I don't know.

172
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:10,300
I also sent a lot of like, we are, uh, you know, Taffer is, is, is right wing

173
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:15,100
and he's toxic and he's been, and I'm like, you know, we don't like him.

174
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:15,460
Right.

175
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:16,580
I know.

176
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,380
I just said, you know, we're going to do show is fun to watch.

177
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:25,540
Most of our guys are like the most chemical people in a bit, like the most

178
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,060
obnoxious.

179
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,300
Well, these influenced things in a negative way more than John Taffer.

180
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:31,780
Yeah.

181
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:37,860
Uh, Taffer, Taffer does get weirder as time goes on and that show gets less

182
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,140
entertaining, the more polished it gets.

183
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,140
I think season eight, season eight, I don't know the difference between the

184
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,300
seasons whatsoever.

185
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:51,180
Well, this is what we have to figure out when we do the Taffer showed on the

186
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,860
second day.

187
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,820
It just told the second day.

188
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,020
Yeah.

189
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,500
Whatever.

190
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,740
We have the same, by the way, a lot of support still ultimately and, oh, and

191
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,980
just to say it became those two came down to, we've never had this before.

192
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,700
Exactly the same amount of votes.

193
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,100
And there had to be a runoff.

194
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,860
Not even one.

195
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,980
And I don't want to be, I don't want to get into Trump territory here, but it

196
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,460
felt rigged a little bit to me.

197
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,460
That felt like too, too much of a coincidence.

198
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,340
Do we know this?

199
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,820
Some listener knows someone at Patreon.

200
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,540
I just think we should be able to, people should look into it.

201
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,100
Yeah.

202
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,740
Because how was it so perfect?

203
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,420
How was, how did it happen?

204
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,340
That's pretty crazy.

205
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,380
It is crazy.

206
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:35,020
So, so that seems really, yeah, seems, it shows you every vote counts for now,

207
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:40,100
unless we start kind of gerrymandering or kicking people out for our own

208
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,620
benefit, but we're not going to do this.

209
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,700
It is will of the people, the runoff handily won by today's topic, Universal

210
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,060
Studios, Theme Park's Adventure.

211
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,500
Yes.

212
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,020
And I think we should say for sure though, that the Taffer is not going to hell

213
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,180
because of the runoff.

214
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,820
I saw some people, I think in the comments there.

215
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,220
Oh, cause that is a last place.

216
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,420
That's the Google ride that's that went to hell and we will are not

217
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,540
allowed to talk about it ever.

218
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,780
We're not allowed to do an episode.

219
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,860
We even said the name too much.

220
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,180
We should be, we should really be like, bleep, like the, it's the people.

221
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:09,820
Oh, I'll bleep it out.

222
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,100
Yeah.

223
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:10,460
Yeah.

224
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,100
From beep EES.

225
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,220
After this we'll bleep it out.

226
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,420
29 beep.

227
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:14,900
Yeah.

228
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,060
Yeah.

229
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,180
Like moves like Burt.

230
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,620
We'll put over it when that happens.

231
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,780
So, so yeah, no, it's fast.

232
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,100
It's fascinating to see.

233
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,100
This is my dream of what could happen in audience voted episode.

234
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,620
This was very exciting.

235
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,580
It was like changed by the day.

236
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,020
I was checking every day.

237
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,540
I was so fascinated.

238
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,980
I was just seeing it go up and down.

239
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,380
I love people's passion.

240
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,940
I love the excitement for it.

241
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:44,420
And the end, the topic that ended up winning, uh, I had the react as I was

242
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:50,660
learning about it, I had the feeling of like, I can't believe we didn't get to

243
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,940
this sooner because it's that funny.

244
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,860
Like that's it.

245
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,700
Look, while we are doing like, are we disappointed taffer?

246
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,860
The taffer said lost.

247
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,020
Yes, but we know we can do it on the second gate and we will.

248
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:07,140
Your voice was heard, taffer heads, but the never taffers one ultimately.

249
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,180
And we got to this, which is great.

250
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,220
It is a really good, that's a great topic.

251
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,140
That's the right topic.

252
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,380
So I'm psyched about that really quick before we get to it.

253
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,060
Uh, um, next month things get back to normal.

254
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,460
So we need your topic ideas in the Patreon comments.

255
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,540
The incumbent is Disneyland smoking areas that got skipped over.

256
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,980
That was the runner up last time.

257
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,460
So it goes into next month's poll and we need four new ones.

258
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,900
So get thinking and we'll see what the next vicious dogfight becomes.

259
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,660
But, uh, with that we get to, oh, here they, you know what?

260
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,620
Let me introduce it with the, the many months ago, I had to go deep into the

261
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,660
comments to find who suggested it.

262
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,340
Ryan O'Reilly, your day has come.

263
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,780
And here is his exact wording.

264
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:54,460
I'd love to see you guys cover the awful 2001, 2002 game cube game, universal

265
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,940
studios, theme park adventure, where you play mini games based on universal rides

266
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:05,660
with abysmal controls, answer trivia, shake characters, hands, and most

267
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,540
importantly, pick up trash.

268
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,900
Such a good suggestion.

269
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,860
This one was up in the Garfield eats month.

270
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:16,300
So that was, so this is a perfect thing to get another chance here.

271
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,300
Yes.

272
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,180
Very exciting.

273
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,340
I'm sure we're going to get into it.

274
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:26,740
Um, I, I just, just an initial reaction thing that I realized when I was

275
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:32,020
watching some of the videos of this on YouTube, um, I just, I, I usually like

276
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,500
find a bunch of videos and throw it in my watch later so I can like go back to them

277
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,220
or revisit their rochin order.

278
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:44,460
And I found a long play of this and it was an hour and 13 minutes long.

279
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,740
And I'm like, Oh, this must only be part of the game.

280
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:52,500
And then, uh, I quickly realized someone had managed to do the whole

281
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,460
game in an hour, 13 minutes.

282
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,540
And that was too long.

283
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:03,020
And I did watch it all, but this, this was, this was rough watching this.

284
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,540
Oh God, absolutely.

285
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:04,900
Yeah.

286
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:04,940
Yeah.

287
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,540
This is, this is one where Aaron was out.

288
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,540
I will not watch clips of this.

289
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,020
This is too unpleasant to look at.

290
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,540
Um, now yeah, sure.

291
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:18,780
That implies like a, uh, an easy game or an unflashed out game that you could do

292
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,020
it in such a short amount of time.

293
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,780
But I feel like whoever posted that was a pro because I played this game.

294
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,780
That's part of why I was really excited about this one.

295
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,460
I did.

296
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,780
I like right after college, I lived with somebody who still had the game cube,

297
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,740
Brian Roe and he, uh, well, we, we had this game.

298
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,500
I was delighted that this existed and you start playing it and like, Oh, this

299
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,980
stick, it is a hot, I think you could easily have a many hours version of this,

300
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,340
but because as Ryan said, the controls are horrible.

301
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,180
Especially like that w not to jump around too much, but like there's an ET game

302
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,260
and you got to be on a bike and balance on a bike.

303
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,540
And I think this is harder than learning how to ride an actual bike.

304
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,060
Yeah.

305
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:05,660
And this kid, uh, whichever of the six avatars you pick, which are all boys,

306
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,340
kind of weird.

307
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,260
Uh,

308
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,540
you cannot play as a female in 2001.

309
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,340
Excuse me.

310
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:13,780
2001.

311
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,780
Uh, this kid gets, uh, messed up a lot in this game.

312
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:24,620
Like either exploding back to his fires or just eating it on the bicycle.

313
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,900
Or, I mean, look, this kid, this on the box, it should be advertised that you can

314
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,700
play as a child firefighter.

315
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:35,380
That it was really quite something in a burning building with a little bit of

316
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,500
water on his back and up in a tank.

317
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,980
The most fleshed out of the games there is I'd see how you could just call

318
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,900
kitty firefighter, little boy firefighter of the game.

319
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,740
And yet he manages to smile throughout the whole thing.

320
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,300
Ball.

321
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,580
There are people in danger of burning alive.

322
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,020
And this child is a big smile on his face as he runs around putting out fires.

323
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:01,420
He's blasted by walls of fire, but like that would like torture your soul.

324
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,540
If you had to think about later surviving it, you would, uh, there's PTSD

325
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,860
big barrels blowing up into the ceiling and he's getting knocked down and like

326
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,380
going invisible for a second, but he does not mind.

327
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,100
He is loving every moment.

328
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,220
This is, uh, and that's, and we'll, we'll figure out if we had the same

329
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,380
reaction while maybe not playing, but watching basics here.

330
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:28,420
Um, the, I, I hate to correct Ryan who suggested this, but there was a, there

331
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,220
was a typo and it's very important.

332
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,540
Of course it is not the universal studios theme park adventure.

333
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,780
It's universal studios theme parks adventure.

334
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:41,100
It is of course theme parks, plural, even though the game involves

335
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,900
precisely one theme park.

336
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,140
Yes.

337
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,100
Why?

338
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,100
Why is it

339
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:53,380
universal studios, Japan, this came out in December of 2001.

340
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,020
That is the same year that universal Japan opens.

341
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,780
Oh, this came out one month after the game cube came out.

342
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,260
So this is like an early release title.

343
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:03,780
Okay.

344
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,220
Oh wow.

345
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,220
One of the, one of the first game cubes.

346
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:11,060
So I imagine paying full price for this.

347
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,820
Uh, yeah, Jesus.

348
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,580
Oh my God.

349
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,180
Uh, um, could have been $60, I guess.

350
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,300
Yeah, probably.

351
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:24,060
Um, I remember thinking, you know, I was less my, I speak sometimes of the dark

352
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,100
era around college where my theme park hyper knowledge lapsed.

353
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,940
I have a lot of regrets about this time and I've made amends for it, but I remember

354
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,660
playing this and going, sorry, where are we?

355
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,140
Like I know universal studio.

356
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,380
I worked at universal studios when I played this the first time and like,

357
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,660
I've been to Florida.

358
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,060
What is it?

359
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,260
I don't think I even knew there was Japan and that it was that new.

360
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,900
So that's an interesting thing is you start is like, okay, I don't know this

361
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,540
layout, but I get, but you would know it if you'd been to universal Japan.

362
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,580
And apparently that is one thing that it gets, right.

363
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,580
It gets the details of those buildings and the layout.

364
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:04,180
It is like, there's a novelty to running through a 3d version of this park in Japan.

365
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:09,220
And, and this era, uh, it looks like a very interesting park, uh, from an

366
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:13,100
American perspective, cause like, oh, this is like half universal Orlando and half

367
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,500
universal Hollywood design wise.

368
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,180
Yes.

369
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:16,460
Yeah.

370
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:16,780
Yeah.

371
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,660
Uh, an interesting meld where you get a little bit of islands of adventure out of

372
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:27,340
the, the islands context, um, and, and some like odd original stuff.

373
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:27,940
Yeah.

374
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:33,420
And now in current times, I looked at the map of universal Japan and it's, it's

375
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:39,260
kind of crazy to see like Amity butts up against the forest from Harry Potter.

376
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:39,820
Yeah.

377
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,180
Yeah.

378
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:45,500
His park is in the back part of the, the area, you know, and Snoopy's there.

379
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,660
Like why is there, it's Snoopy.

380
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,380
So weird.

381
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,260
Nintendo is adjacent to the water world arena.

382
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,500
Our bar most towering cultural influences.

383
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,340
Our main IPs right next to each other.

384
00:17:59,340 --> 00:17:59,940
That's what you get.

385
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:06,500
The most, um, uh, you know, kind of joked about movie and a very beloved, like

386
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:13,020
theme park stunt show, like very popular, always rated very highly, multiple places

387
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,500
around the world at this point.

388
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,540
Well, there's a new one.

389
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,660
We've just talked about this whole land.

390
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,220
Yeah.

391
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:18,660
Yeah.

392
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,300
Um, I, I was just saying, I was wondering if that is a good, should we watch the

393
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,420
movie I've never, I've never seen.

394
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,180
I've never seen either.

395
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,340
I have watched it.

396
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,700
I watched it on like one of those, I don't know if it was network or cable, but

397
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,860
like a special broadcast where it's like, that was the whole night commercial

398
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,660
water, no commercials.

399
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,660
So water world is a long movie and then broken up by commercials.

400
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,100
Wow.

401
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:49,540
That's a, that's a, as harrowing of an adventure as the smokers go on.

402
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,020
That's what I kind of want to get it straight.

403
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,700
You know, like, let's understand this mythology.

404
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,020
Yeah.

405
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,500
Let's see the atolls and in context.

406
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:57,900
Right.

407
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,060
And then, yeah, we can, we can, maybe it's a movie, but then we also have to go

408
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,500
watch the show again in person and see if it resonates.

409
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:04,900
Yeah.

410
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,860
So it's sort of a catch up with water world stunt show as well.

411
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,300
Sure.

412
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:08,700
Yeah.

413
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,940
Just as we enter, you know, not well that it just opened in Beijing.

414
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,580
It shows you that they've doubled down the future of universal is minions and

415
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,300
it's water world more still, of course.

416
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:21,620
Yeah.

417
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,900
So, um, yeah.

418
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,860
Um, but this, you know, you don't get a lot of the odd Japan only stuff here.

419
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:34,140
This is like, you know, the, it's, it's a bunch of mini games that are all based

420
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:38,740
on the big properties, it's Jurassic park, it's jaws, it's the stuff they own.

421
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:45,180
Uh, and we'll get into all of those, but maybe the, the, the big, broad stuff to

422
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:52,380
talk about is, is the game play, um, which where to begin, I mean, you,

423
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:56,340
well, Hey, I know where to begin the first shot of the game itself.

424
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,700
And I mean, the first part where you're in control, you're looking at the,

425
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,580
the iconic studio gate and kind of right before you take control, your player

426
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:12,020
takes control, there's just a bunch of balloons just ominously floating slowly

427
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:17,140
up into the air, like 40 balloons without obvious owners because there's no crowd

428
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:22,100
underneath and, but it's, it's a shot that looks, if you like, then panned down

429
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:27,420
from that to 40 massacred bodies that would make sense.

430
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:27,660
Yeah.

431
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:27,900
Yeah.

432
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,060
Yeah.

433
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,100
There's something very eerie and still about the untethered balloons.

434
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:32,540
Yeah.

435
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,820
So we start off on a great note that start off with a bang.

436
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,260
Uh, can I go back even further?

437
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:37,820
Please.

438
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:43,020
Uh, one of the first things you see when you load it up and, and Jane caught

439
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,260
this on one of the videos, she's like, you have to go back and look at that.

440
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,740
Uh, the disclaimer notice with the universal studios logo top.

441
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,820
Notice this game is not a true representation of universal studios,

442
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,220
theme parks, but an interactive game based on universal studios, theme parks.

443
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,340
And some of the characters featured are not associated with the park.

444
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:08,140
Oh, so they're already like, they're already giving their distance.

445
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,780
Yeah.

446
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,380
Wow.

447
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:14,300
So sorry, my son can't fight real fires when we go there.

448
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:19,460
There's no mention of like children should not, uh, operate old West six

449
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,100
shooters, children should not fight.

450
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,540
That's fine.

451
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,300
That's fine.

452
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,660
Yeah.

453
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:30,460
Um, do not run from the police on a bicycle, which would be a good, like,

454
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,500
yeah, that's, that's probably a good idea.

455
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,220
You're not going to get very far.

456
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:35,580
Yeah.

457
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:35,860
Yeah.

458
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,220
Uh, that's their car.

459
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,100
The car is broken.

460
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,540
Um, all right.

461
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,420
So it's, it's warnings.

462
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,820
It's eerie balloons.

463
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:51,060
And then you choose one of the characters, all males in backpacks and you

464
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:56,140
are at the opening or, you know, kind of the entrance area of the park.

465
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:01,060
And I feel like before you do anything, you have to go talk to Woody Woodpecker.

466
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,740
And again, we've said it, we've been saying it so much lately.

467
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:09,180
Uh, Woody, the Mickey of universal, and he gets so much play in this.

468
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,060
He's never more associated with the brand than here.

469
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,300
Yeah.

470
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:16,740
He's the closest thing you have to like a guide essentially in the, in the game.

471
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,660
And, uh, I mean, I was kind of holding off on getting too deep into the

472
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,260
Woody Woodpecker universe.

473
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:28,100
And as we learned in this game family, uh, but, uh, that you had a lot of him

474
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,140
in this game and there was way too much Woody and he sounds like he's dying.

475
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,300
Yeah.

476
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,060
He sounds really odd.

477
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:40,660
Yeah.

478
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,060
Yeah.

479
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,180
And I don't even do, you don't sense the mischief.

480
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,260
He feels very like robbed of his personality.

481
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:47,540
Yeah.

482
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,860
His annoying personality.

483
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,940
Telling you stuff.

484
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:50,820
Yeah.

485
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,260
He's, Hey, he's got like this.

486
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:54,420
Yeah.

487
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,300
He's got like, I don't even know.

488
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:00,380
Like Woody Woodpecker's real voice is just like very high pitched and like,

489
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,900
he's got a ton of energy in this, this Woody Woodpecker feels depressed.

490
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:05,820
Yeah.

491
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,100
He just got, got capped in the knees.

492
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,300
Something is wrong with him.

493
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:09,540
Yeah.

494
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:09,860
Yeah.

495
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,620
Like he's got some bad news behind the scenes and we don't know what it is, but

496
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,900
he's pushing through it because he has to host this video game.

497
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,660
I am an entertainer.

498
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,380
I do.

499
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,900
I have a job to do.

500
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,660
There's a public waiting for me.

501
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,820
They want to hear the ha ha ha ha ha.

502
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,100
And I'm going to give it to them.

503
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,620
I'm going to give it to them.

504
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:28,940
Fine.

505
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,220
I can do this.

506
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:30,780
They want to hear.

507
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,140
Let me go out there.

508
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,500
And they want to hear what you say.

509
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,780
There's too many people and you don't have the right hat.

510
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,740
I have to go tell people the right to crown it.

511
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:48,420
I have to tell them that there is a stamp collection game in the park today.

512
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,500
That's what this is important.

513
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,860
Like today we're doing a stamp thing.

514
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:58,540
It's a stamp collecting contest, which I know because I rewound it a lot of times

515
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,780
because that long player was really trying to get through those.

516
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,300
I had to rewind a couple of times.

517
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:04,700
Yeah.

518
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,100
Yeah.

519
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:09,020
The openings before the mini games, he does not, which I wish I, I didn't

520
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,340
ever get to see the full thing because it'll start with something so enticing,

521
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,500
like, oh no, tragic news.

522
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,460
I forget what he said.

523
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,260
It's something like that before jaws.

524
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,420
Like something horrifying has happened.

525
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:29,860
The worst, the worst, not even mini game like task is at some point you find his

526
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:33,180
phone and he's like, hey, can you bring me my phone?

527
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,580
Is it him?

528
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,940
I thought it was him.

529
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,100
I've been confused about that ever.

530
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,660
I didn't know.

531
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,180
I thought maybe that was some new character.

532
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,180
I thought I could be wrong.

533
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,660
Uh, I, I, I'm confused.

534
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,980
What he lost his phone, phone, phone, phone.

535
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,740
And then he, he says like, bring it to me by the water world arena.

536
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,460
And then at some point it goes like, I'm actually by the old West arena.

537
00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:00,180
And at least in the version I watched a little bit of a second one too.

538
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,500
It's like, that does not pay off at all.

539
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:06,300
Well, it doesn't pay off probably because the player was like, fuck no.

540
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,460
If I don't need it to finish the game, it is not happening.

541
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,100
Um, so, okay.

542
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,780
So there's stamp collecting contests.

543
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:18,740
You, you play the mini games and when you beat them, you get stamps.

544
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,300
No, no, no, wait, no, wait, no.

545
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:22,740
Yeah, you're right.

546
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,380
Those are stamps.

547
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:23,900
I'm sorry.

548
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:28,140
I was then what are the letters of universal studios?

549
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,860
Letters.

550
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,260
Yeah, that's what I was getting to.

551
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:30,700
Stamps.

552
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,380
Letters are not stamps.

553
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,060
So you have to find letters that spell out universal studios.

554
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:40,220
And when you spell out that full phrase, then you get a stamp for that.

555
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,500
Oh, that's a, that all culminates in one stamp.

556
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,900
That the, the rides are stamps.

557
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,220
Yeah.

558
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,460
Each ride is a stamp.

559
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,620
Each ride is a stamp.

560
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,340
The universal studios letters give you a stamp.

561
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,540
And then there's a quiz game that also gives you a stamp.

562
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,900
There is a text based quiz.

563
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,260
You have to answer as well.

564
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,460
Can I ask a question though?

565
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,860
Cause maybe I did watch, I think the same one you watched.

566
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:09,700
And I thought the letters were like lighting up, but you're saying you gained the letters.

567
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,580
Well, they, he just found the letters walking around like they are just in each.

568
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,900
You find them on the ground like trash.

569
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,260
Oh, okay.

570
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,260
You might find a balled up piece of paper or you might find an I or an S.

571
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:22,980
Right.

572
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,620
So he would find letters and then they would light up on that board on the bottom.

573
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,460
Or in one case, Woody Woodpecker's cell phone.

574
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,780
These are the things you can find.

575
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,500
Uh-huh.

576
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,020
Okay.

577
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,780
Got it now.

578
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,100
Sorry.

579
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,820
I was confused.

580
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,100
No, it's pretty, pretty clean.

581
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,020
Once you think about it.

582
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,100
Uh, yeah, it's pretty crazy.

583
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,300
So you're, we got stamps, you got letters.

584
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,300
Um, and like, what order even?

585
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,140
Well, okay.

586
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:53,020
Let me take it through a little when I played the game and I didn't know any of this stuff.

587
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:53,860
Okay.

588
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,860
I consulted with Woody at the front of the park by the globe.

589
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,540
I got it.

590
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:03,460
I know how this works and I have sensed from the cover that I can go see Jurassic park

591
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,620
or get on the DeLorean.

592
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:04,900
Great.

593
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,660
I'm going to go find one of those.

594
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,540
So I am off and I start going and left to right.

595
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,460
I am going.

596
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,660
And then there is a slow fade.

597
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:18,820
And now you are looking at a new frame of a place that you are unfamiliar with.

598
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:25,660
And now your character is going from right and in the back to left and towards you.

599
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,460
And then the same thing happens again.

600
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,700
And now your character is, you can't see them.

601
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,540
Where am I?

602
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,740
And now you're going from all the way in the back to straight towards the camera.

603
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,700
And that, like, I'm sure to the listener, this makes no sense.

604
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:44,740
But what I'm telling you is don't imagine Mario where you're behind the character the

605
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,420
whole time.

606
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:45,660
Right.

607
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,740
It is still locked off shots.

608
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,820
This is filmed like an old Western.

609
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:51,580
Yeah.

610
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:59,180
And your, your character is not tracked along with, with the camera and it changes.

611
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,900
The direction changes every time.

612
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:05,740
So every time there's a fade, you have to readjust to what direction am I moving?

613
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,140
Where is my character?

614
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,540
This is maddening.

615
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,140
It is so headache inducing to play this.

616
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,420
It's the term in video games is fixed camera.

617
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:20,420
OK, so in some of the mini games, you can toggle the camera like Jaws gives you a

618
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,140
little more flexibility.

619
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,540
Yeah.

620
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:22,740
Yeah.

621
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,500
I generally move it around.

622
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,020
They saved that ability for the mini games.

623
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,580
Yes.

624
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:34,100
And here it's just you got a camera on a tripod that is way down with lots of sandbags

625
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,740
and cement, and that's not going anywhere, no matter where you go.

626
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,580
It's just so crazy.

627
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:45,140
It's like that that filmmaking thing, the 180 rule you have to cut so that eye lines

628
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,940
are consistent.

629
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,660
This thing is nuts.

630
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:52,180
Wait, I moved off the right of the frame and now I'm all the way in the back behind a

631
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,100
trash can.

632
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,060
Yeah, I can't see myself.

633
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,940
I assume it's done and there's some way it's saving time and money because you don't

634
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,540
have to render.

635
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,140
You don't have to be able to render the environments as you approach them from

636
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,020
different angles.

637
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:09,380
Yes, I remember seeing this and I'm sure I'm wrong, but the first time in Zelda 64

638
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:13,060
in Ocarina of Time, there's a couple of times when you get out of the main big

639
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,580
field where you had a normal camera following you and then Link would enter a

640
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:20,860
village or something or a castle and he'd run through a courtyard, but the camera

641
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:25,020
was fixed and it looked different and it was OK.

642
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:29,460
But it was obviously not as satisfying as being able to really like see what you're

643
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,060
doing.

644
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:30,860
Oh, really?

645
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:34,220
I mean, because you're post, you know, Mario Kart at this point.

646
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:40,620
Now you're like used to being able to even in 16 bit games to stay behind the

647
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,180
character.

648
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:48,140
Well, Mike, you said I saw N64 mentioned a lot of like this is like sub par N64

649
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,420
grant like this is a GameCube.

650
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:56,700
My brother had a GameCube and I remember a good amount of games like pretty fondly

651
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,500
and the graphics pretty fondly.

652
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,660
Yeah, they weren't inherently.

653
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,420
Yeah, there's great GameCube games.

654
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,220
Yeah, of course.

655
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,780
I but man, this is rough.

656
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,740
Like it's not compelling.

657
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:12,180
It's hard to play the graphics for the most.

658
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:17,820
There's like one or two of the like locations or sets when you're walking around

659
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,980
like, oh, that looks OK.

660
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,980
But then I kept to remind myself, wait, this was GameCube.

661
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,820
Yeah, should be a step up.

662
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:30,220
Yeah, I've seen which I will get into it later.

663
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:34,100
The reboot that came along after this.

664
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:39,260
But that the another version of this game came out on PlayStation 2, which was

665
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,860
released a year before GameCube.

666
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,260
And it looks like night and day.

667
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,100
It looks so much better.

668
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:45,340
Yeah.

669
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:50,220
Yeah. And I know PlayStation usually PlayStation at the stronger computer than the

670
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,860
GameCube. That's usually the case.

671
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,940
Nintendo. Yes.

672
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,660
As the weaker powered system.

673
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,100
So but still, this looks rough.

674
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,900
Yeah. Yeah.

675
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,420
It's really like muddy.

676
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,660
I think for very low resolution, the colors are muddy.

677
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:12,580
And you know, they also it just to the aesthetic madness that you do hear real

678
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,740
Jurassic Park music.

679
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,820
You do hear real Back to the Future music, but you also hear just a lot of

680
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:25,100
like that. That the general theme parky music gets really maddening.

681
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:30,260
Yeah. And it feels like whatever they play just on the whenever you're not in a

682
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:33,780
specific area, Universal, like obviously is much better than this.

683
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,700
Beeping and like whatever this music you would call this music.

684
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,260
I don't know why they didn't use that unless this is what they play in Universal

685
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,780
Japan. But I doubt it.

686
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:46,340
Yeah. It sounds like weird, like generic GameCube music.

687
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:52,500
Yeah. That that adds to the unreality issues where it's like that is the official

688
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,180
E.T. Jurassic Park Back to the Future kind of music.

689
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,460
Sure. I kind of wish I'll say this.

690
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,300
I wish it was fake music with all of it.

691
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,940
It would be better. It would fit better.

692
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,300
I wish it was a rip off Back to the Future song.

693
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:12,900
Well, so a lot of that, a lot of the scenes of the mini game, it is just music you

694
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,580
don't know. They'll pad it out.

695
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

696
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,060
Yeah. Let's put our music next to these iconic.

697
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,540
Yes. And you do.

698
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,980
Those will line up. But even the main theme, I wish it was just like a little like

699
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,100
a couple notes off.

700
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,060
It would just be Back to the Future.

701
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,020
Like just a little wrong.

702
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,860
Just skirting. Yeah.

703
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,940
Just even though we own this, we don't have to pay ourselves anything because it's

704
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,420
not technically that music.

705
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,180
We just didn't think the game deserved.

706
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,380
Right. Which would be correct.

707
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:46,300
Like Zemeckis caught wind that we were using the theme and was like, what the fuck?

708
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,660
Get this out of here.

709
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,540
This is crap.

710
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:56,380
So let me again narrate when I first played this game and I didn't know the lay of

711
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:01,700
the land. I'm sure my first stop, if I could find it through the confusing layout,

712
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,620
was the Back to the Future ride.

713
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,540
I mean, I do no matter what, no matter how bad this game is, I want to see how they

714
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,740
handled Back to the Future.

715
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:14,420
So I run up there and there's a bunch of people waiting outside and Woody

716
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:18,740
Woodpecker tells you that it's too crowded and you can't come in.

717
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,180
And I am, huh?

718
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,100
That's the first. I'm sorry.

719
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,780
This is what you're telling me in this video game with my favorite movies and rides.

720
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:34,740
And I don't even remember how I figured out initially that, no, no, no, you need,

721
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,700
you can't get on a ride until you have the proper hat.

722
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:45,700
You need a hat that matches the ride, which in some cases is instinctual, but in

723
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,540
other cases you have to take a little step.

724
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,500
Like what kind of hat would you need?

725
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:54,020
In this case, luckily, I think then you find out you need the BTTF hat.

726
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,020
Okay, got it.

727
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,180
How do I get that?

728
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,060
I believe what I did was go all the way.

729
00:33:59,380 --> 00:33:59,820
I don't know.

730
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:04,140
I think I just wandered around lost for a while and then realized maybe Woody

731
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,740
Woodpecker knows that to help me.

732
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:09,980
And I went and found him all the way at the front of the park and hoping that he

733
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,340
would say, here's your hat.

734
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,620
And what he says is you need points to get your hat.

735
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,220
How do you get points?

736
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,660
Pick up trash.

737
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:26,140
So you can't, you need a hat to get on a ride, but you need to pick up trash.

738
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,860
To get a hat.

739
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,500
Yes.

740
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:33,140
But also I found one of the blakers.

741
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:39,980
Someone found if you talk to an employee early on, they'll say, Oh, you can get a

742
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,460
map.

743
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,300
It's back at the beginning.

744
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,300
Find someone to give you a map.

745
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:52,180
And then that helps you navigate the park, which it really doesn't seem to know.

746
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:55,660
Not when you're like, you don't know if you're left or right or up or down every

747
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,140
time the camera cuts.

748
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:02,460
Also in his opening spiel at the beginning, Woody says, don't get lost.

749
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,460
It's big park.

750
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,900
And then you quickly find you have to go all the way back to him constantly.

751
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:12,860
Many reasons in this huge park to go find him, even though he's all over the place.

752
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:17,900
He's in front of every ride, but it's not the him that gives you hats.

753
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,820
All the Woody the hat salesman is only the front Woody.

754
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:26,660
Yeah, selling selling hats outside the scumbag bootlegger.

755
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:33,260
I think Jane went out like, is he selling those like under the table?

756
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,180
Is he doing that?

757
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,300
He's like a counterfeit salesman outside the venue.

758
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:44,500
It's very hard to see with the perspectives and the graphics, because lots of characters

759
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,140
are constantly glitching between stuff.

760
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:54,340
But I think sometimes that's either meant to be Winnie Woodpecker, his girlfriend,

761
00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:00,460
or not head his nephew or splinter his niece.

762
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,900
What are these?

763
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,820
I am hearing this for the first time.

764
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,340
Winnie Woodpecker is his wife or his girlfriend.

765
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,340
His girlfriend.

766
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,540
They're not a commitment.

767
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,140
Are they? Yeah. Are they like kind of casual, you think?

768
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,100
Or is there an opening there?

769
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,340
Like in the way that Mickey and Minnie never get married.

770
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,260
So they got an open thing.

771
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,300
Yeah, they got their Polly.

772
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,700
It's different.

773
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,380
I also learned I can't like Winnie down.

774
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:32,500
She's got so much energy to get out with every every partner she can find.

775
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,540
This this also led to, you know, one of the other

776
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,260
beloved characters that shows up in this is

777
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,660
Chilly Willie, the penguin.

778
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,660
OK, hold on. I got to stop you. I'm so sorry.

779
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,900
Go back to the other two that you introduced because I don't know his name either.

780
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,540
We got a cover. Nothead is one of them.

781
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,740
Splinter is the niece and nothead.

782
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,740
Like a knot in wood is like that, like the big survey.

783
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,500
Oh yeah. K-N-O-T. Nothead.

784
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:02,100
According to the Woody Woodpecker fandom, Nothead is the name of his nephew.

785
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,780
So nothead and I forgot the other one already. Splinter.

786
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,100
Splinter, thank you, are his nephew and his niece.

787
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,860
So that means who or Woody? Who's his brother or sister?

788
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,860
I don't know.

789
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,900
There is some off camera brother or sister who has produced offspring.

790
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,540
Right. But we don't know. They're not his kids.

791
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,580
Yeah, no.

792
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,140
But Woody. Jason. Huh? Jason.

793
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,260
Well, I looked at here.

794
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,260
I just looked it up. Who is Woody Woodpecker's sister?

795
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,780
And it says Winnie.

796
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:36,580
Wait, I know I saw Winnie listed on the fandom page as the girlfriend.

797
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,620
Is this a Meg White White Stripe situation?

798
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,620
Is this the original?

799
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,500
Rumors have spread with her sister and brother, but they're married or something.

800
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,100
You want to keep guessing. It's part of the mythology.

801
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,980
Why am I getting this?

802
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,220
Oh, this is confusing.

803
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,260
I will get to the grand finale.

804
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:56,980
But the moment of that, we were watching it and I was writing something down at that moment.

805
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,140
James, like, why is there a penguin watching the fireworks?

806
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:05,460
And I went back and I looked at it and really excitedly yelled, that's Chilly Willie.

807
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,380
I believe you call them iconic a little bit ago.

808
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,980
I could say it's Chilly Willie.

809
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,860
I filed that away to comment on and question.

810
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:18,540
I'm still trying to figure out Winnie Woodpecker and Jason wants to talk about Chilly Willie.

811
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,660
And I want to talk about Chilly Willie.

812
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,300
He is iconic. He's the correct.

813
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,980
Because eventually I learned in one version, I think a newer cartoon,

814
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,220
Chilly Willie's girlfriend is Chilly Lily.

815
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,180
Oh, really? Yeah, that's very cute.

816
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,700
We're getting bombarded here.

817
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,940
OK, I know.

818
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:41,500
So we've got to process Chilly Willie and Winnie, a possible girlfriend, but a possible sister.

819
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,780
I guess she is the girlfriend.

820
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,140
Most things say girlfriend, but there isn't one source that says sister.

821
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:50,420
So I wonder if that was changed or if that person or that person who posted it is just wrong.

822
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:55,180
And there's a big debate on Twitter that's really annoying about whether Winnie

823
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,140
could keep a beat in terms of woodpecking or not.

824
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,540
Right. Which I think is crazy.

825
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,620
Winnie Woodpecker is iconic. Right.

826
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,740
How are we arguing this?

827
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,740
Not as I kind of willy boy.

828
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,620
There's nothing going on on Twitter today.

829
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,420
Yeah, exactly.

830
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,340
I yeah. Look, these are icons.

831
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,860
Winnie Winnie.

832
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,660
Is it Winnie? Winnie.

833
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,460
Splinter. Not no, not Winnie.

834
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:20,140
Other you know, there's also the specific on the splint on the.

835
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,860
Oh, this is on Walter Lance fandom, by the way.

836
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,460
So the Walter Walter Lance wiki,

837
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:31,140
the specific that not head was nuthead and splinter was a boy.

838
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,420
This is in the comic.

839
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,980
Changed it. Yeah.

840
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,620
So so not a word is changing our characters.

841
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,100
Our heritage is being changed.

842
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,660
You should write in front of our eyes.

843
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,220
Well, they made Woody totally sexless.

844
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,500
He doesn't have children, just had niece and nephew.

845
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,980
Woody can't be horny again.

846
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,940
Actually, I'll say I want Woody to be horny.

847
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,180
I would like to be horny again.

848
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,140
I mean, look, they call the Woody Woodpecker fans.

849
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:00,740
Pecker would seems like, you know, a dad is not sure.

850
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:04,260
I guess I found apparently there's a song by Danny Kane,

851
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,340
the Andrews sisters called Woody Woodpecker.

852
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,260
Well, is this the Woody Woodpecker song?

853
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,660
Isn't it? Maybe that's what it is.

854
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,020
I think I think that was kind of a hit.

855
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,660
Right. Jason's favorite song when he was 10, it just come out.

856
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,580
It was a new song.

857
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:25,100
Splinter. So anyway, not head was nuthead splinter.

858
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,900
Woodpecker is not splinter.

859
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,100
Ninja Turtles. Right.

860
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,100
And Winnie is girlfriend, not sister.

861
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:37,780
And Chilly Lily is Chilly Willie's girlfriend, not wife, not wife, not sister.

862
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,060
These everybody still got openings.

863
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,460
OK, for these Chilly Lily.

864
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:46,660
So so well, you know, Woody Woodpecker eventually coming soon.

865
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,540
Episode, I think we're still calling shots in April.

866
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,660
That's all years, almost half over.

867
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:57,740
So, yeah. So Chilly Willie appears in the you saw him in the game

868
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,940
because I missed Chilly Willie.

869
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:02,940
OK, so Chilly Willie is both watching the show and at some point

870
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:09,300
on the in one of the first screens, you shake hands with him.

871
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,540
You can shake hands with them.

872
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,500
Right. That's an optional thing is to shake hands with characters.

873
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,820
Yes, that gets you points that really remind you.

874
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,380
There's a Connor O'Malley sketch where it's a fake.

875
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,380
It's Hudson Yards, the video game like this unpleasant.

876
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:28,980
Mixed use apartment building art installation in New York City.

877
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:34,860
And you in that sketch, he gets hello points by just walking around going, Hi.

878
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,100
Hello there. And it is hello points.

879
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,740
Wow. Wow. In this precedent for this.

880
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:45,540
Yeah, no, this is the precedent that sketches only a few years.

881
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,500
Yeah. Yeah.

882
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:53,260
The and then and then in all caps, it'll say shook hands with Chilly Willie.

883
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:58,180
Yes. Yeah. Which what a phrase to put in like, you know, like when you think about

884
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:03,060
like a just imagine that in a like, you know, America is at war.

885
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,660
Shook hands with Chilly Willie.

886
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,740
That that raised spirits that raised morale.

887
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:15,500
We hope that our boys survive and get to come back and shake hands with Chilly Willie.

888
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:19,660
That's what Chilly Willie, by the way, that that is very graphically difficult to see.

889
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,940
You were very far away when that happens.

890
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:26,820
There is a closer view when you shake hands with the grotesque Frankenstein.

891
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,060
Yeah. Yeah. And weird Frankenstein.

892
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,380
Yeah. Yeah. He looks weird.

893
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,100
He doesn't look like the universal walk around Frankenstein.

894
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,420
No, you also get there's an E.T.

895
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,940
and I don't think there was ever an E.T.

896
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,940
walk around in universal.

897
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:44,460
So it's just like it's the realistic from the movie Little Squishy E.T.

898
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,820
Yes. And I think he's standing in front of back draft.

899
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,860
I don't think he's in front of it.

900
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,420
His wife is in it.

901
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,420
You know, isn't he there? Yeah.

902
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,380
I guess, hey, he lives.

903
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,380
He can explore wherever he wants.

904
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,860
We've also missed an aspect of this hand shaking,

905
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:03,580
which is that this used technology that was, I think, maybe new to the GameCube,

906
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,060
which is the haptic, the shake.

907
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,460
Well, the technology that Rumble was in the controller

908
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,700
because they introduced that first in the Nintendo 64.

909
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,780
Oh, there wasn't 64.

910
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,460
It was a rumble pack.

911
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,300
You have to put it.

912
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,060
You bought it separately and it plugged it or no came with.

913
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,100
Shoot it. Come with Star Fox.

914
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,700
Yeah, it came with something.

915
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,580
It was so yeah, it used to be an add on.

916
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,180
Then they built it in the GameCube.

917
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:31,740
In this game, there is an employee holding like a placard

918
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:35,660
who just says on the sign says on or off.

919
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:39,060
And that tells you whether you have the rumble set to on and off,

920
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:43,740
which if you forget this rumble situation and you're just watching a walkthrough

921
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:48,140
and you just like, why have I run by a woman with a big sign,

922
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,740
a big red sign that says off?

923
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,380
Yeah, there is.

924
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,980
There is an expedition theme park video about this.

925
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,980
It sums up a lot of this in a good way, but you can see

926
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,340
Sam, the guy behind the chat.

927
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,540
You can kind of see him slowly breaking down

928
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,180
as he's playing this game.

929
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,420
This would be where a breakdown would occur.

930
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:16,020
But the you know, the rumble is used for for impacts and crashes

931
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:20,300
and for, you know, big kind of exciting or violent moments in games.

932
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,500
And here it is used for handshakes for handshakes.

933
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:29,100
Yeah. And I look the PS5 has very sophisticated haptic feedback.

934
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,500
So like and I know I haven't played a ton of PS5, but it's got like

935
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,260
there's a game called or it's on.

936
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,860
I guess it's a game. Astros play room.

937
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,980
Is that what it's called?

938
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,140
It's this little fun character Astro.

939
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,700
And there's like when he's in the rain, there's this different type of feedback

940
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,420
you're feeling on the controller. It's really weird.

941
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,700
It's cool.

942
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,460
I don't believe it was that sophisticated with GameCube,

943
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,380
where it would feel like a handshake.

944
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,340
So you probably just felt like a jolt.

945
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:56,260
Yeah. It's like an electric buzzer handshake.

946
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,540
Yeah. Prank handshake.

947
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:01,780
Yeah. But that is, yes, the the excitement of a handshake.

948
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,020
I mean, to us, I'll say this.

949
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:07,540
If Jason shook hands with Chilly Willie, I do believe he would sense haptic

950
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:10,940
natural human haptic feedback in his body.

951
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,060
Where is this? Am I having a heart attack?

952
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,820
It's like when me? No, that's just that's me.

953
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,100
Feeling love.

954
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,940
Yeah. Gives me a smooch during a buffet.

955
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,860
I did feel haptic feedback in my body.

956
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,860
Oh, no. No, it's not sexual.

957
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:27,340
It's just, you know, you have a feeling, you kind of like you're vibrating on a level.

958
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,500
I mean, if illumination, if Universal's happy with the way

959
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:34,860
illumination handled Super Mario Brothers, I think all the Dr.

960
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,340
Seuss animated movies were big hits.

961
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:41,980
I maybe give them the crack at Chilly Willie, give them a crack at Woody Woodpecker.

962
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,020
You know, sure.

963
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,740
And then Jason would go to the theater and feel haptic feedback.

964
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:46,940
I don't feel it.

965
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:49,700
But Universal could always use more walk around the characters.

966
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,780
I mean, they they bought illumination at this point.

967
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,380
They brought Dreamworks animation.

968
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:57,780
So I guess they have characters, but the people want, you know,

969
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:03,540
the the people, me, one of the people in this room wants a new Chilly Willie.

970
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,620
Yeah. You want a new Chilly Willie?

971
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:08,660
Yeah. I could let them do the million.

972
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:09,660
Would you hold on?

973
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,580
The Winkle and Rocky.

974
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:15,060
Would you rather have a new Chilly Willie or would you rather have a new hot stuff?

975
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,140
The little devil.

976
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,060
Huh? Let's be honest.

977
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,820
Or new baby Huey.

978
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:23,380
Oh, well, that's a good you're getting into the Harvey characters.

979
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:26,060
That's true. I'm just saying these are kind of all they I lump some of these

980
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:28,820
characters sort of together because they're a little bit old time.

981
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:29,740
Yeah. Yeah.

982
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:34,060
Um, I think Chilly Willie really is the cutest.

983
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:36,820
I think I think I think he's the one I've seen them.

984
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:40,740
I feel like Chilly Willie stuff and Woody Woodpecker stuff in early

985
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:45,980
80s, mid 80s and 90s syndication when they were just throwing any cartoon

986
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:49,700
they could on TV, I've probably seen more of Woody Woodpecker and Chilly Willie.

987
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,300
Check out some of Chilly Willie's 80s stuff.

988
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,500
Some of the bad like they don't talk about it a lot.

989
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,300
Yeah. Yeah. It's like the replacement.

990
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:00,060
You know, you know, they really I know you were a big Chilly Willie guy.

991
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,940
I just think he's cute.

992
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,180
I agree with you. He's cute.

993
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,260
I just didn't know he was one of your guys.

994
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,540
This is one that's really been memory.

995
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,620
Hold. Do you remember the 10 years ago?

996
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:15,820
Like one of the first, I think, early Netflix originals was like a kids

997
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:17,700
sitcom version of Richie Rich.

998
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,820
I certainly do. He had like a weird like robot girl.

999
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,180
Oh, man. It was really strange.

1000
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:28,420
Yeah. And it was like part of an agreement about the Harvey.

1001
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:31,260
I forget who owns the Harvey characters now, but.

1002
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,660
So, OK. Well, Chilly Willie

1003
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,940
one of Jason's guys and maybe that's come up on the show.

1004
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:37,820
I just don't remember it.

1005
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:41,540
Mm hmm. I like I'm not going to say I don't I don't find this to be shocking.

1006
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,620
And I just think I would certainly add to me.

1007
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:47,020
Yes, I know he likes wimpy and Popeye.

1008
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:48,020
I know there's others characters.

1009
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:51,140
I just know he really likes and I guess I just didn't realize Chilly Willie

1010
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,340
was one of his main guys.

1011
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:55,980
I mean, I think I'll probably brush up against some Chilly Willie stuff

1012
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:59,180
when we go go real deep on Woody Woodpecker.

1013
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:01,140
I feel like Chilly Willie is going to come back.

1014
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,140
Something we've got to have in his own episode.

1015
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:07,020
We're going to brush up on Chilly Willie when we go deep on Woody.

1016
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,700
When you feel the haptic feedback in your tongue from.

1017
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:15,380
That's when we make everyone feel heart vibration. Yeah.

1018
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,500
Organic haptic feedback.

1019
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:23,380
So we like then the Woody and Chilly of this game is a success

1020
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:24,420
is what we're saying.

1021
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:28,260
Yeah, I'm just saying I'm not trying to be delusional, but I can fix them.

1022
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,100
Hollywood, I can fix.

1023
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,540
It sounds like you like Woody, too, though.

1024
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:36,340
I'm because Scott and I are sort of negative on Woody.

1025
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:40,340
Woody, I want to see the source material.

1026
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:41,980
This is a pretty rough Woody.

1027
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,300
This is pretty bad. Certainly not in this game.

1028
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,700
But I feel like in general, in my whole history, I've never been a big Woody guy.

1029
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,540
But it sounds like you were a Woody kid.

1030
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:54,420
Yeah, I think I would probably I like seeing him from a distance

1031
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,820
walking around Universal Studios Hollywood.

1032
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,540
But cartoons?

1033
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:03,020
I've seen some Woody cartoons, but I really can't remember them specifically.

1034
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,020
This isn't a Senate hearing or anything.

1035
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,340
I just like if you liked Woody, you like Woody.

1036
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:10,620
Tell me to go shove it because you liked Woody and I'm an asshole for not liking him.

1037
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:14,540
I will not weigh judgment until we go deep.

1038
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,180
You know, all right, fine.

1039
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:18,140
No weighing judgment until we go deep.

1040
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:21,420
And I call the opposite shot to the deep dive.

1041
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,020
And you pull a shot away.

1042
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,500
All right. So now we're all right.

1043
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:34,140
We're shaking hands and we're picking up trash so that we can get hats when you.

1044
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:38,020
And it's really just like a scenario walking the streets you already walked

1045
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:42,100
and you're picking up, but like balled up paper one at a time.

1046
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,940
And then when you do so, you get that all caps again and it says picked up garbage.

1047
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:50,060
Yeah. Which is also something you could say if you went to the store and bought this game.

1048
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,780
Uh huh. But grabbing garbage,

1049
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,980
getting those points up and eventually it's unclear how many.

1050
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:02,700
It's like an odd amount to grab to end up to get a hat

1051
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,860
and you probably can only afford one.

1052
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:08,860
And you're like, oh my God, it's I have to come back here to get every single hat.

1053
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:12,860
Luckily, you get points when you successfully win a game

1054
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,060
and the games are going to be fun, right?

1055
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,580
So that's going to be he must.

1056
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:21,180
That's a sure they say really all of the fun.

1057
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:26,860
It's honestly that the rest is so boring means that the games have to be.

1058
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,740
Yeah, they spend all their time on the games because those are the fun things.

1059
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:33,500
Absolutely. So maybe you get

1060
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:38,900
let's just let's just go in the order of let me let's start small.

1061
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:42,300
I don't have a lot to say about when you get your cowboy hat

1062
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,220
in which you honestly I'm looking at like, what's this? Oh, right.

1063
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:46,860
I guess there is a West thing.

1064
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:49,940
There's like the wild, wild, wild West stunt show.

1065
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,860
And it's like it's a shooting gallery.

1066
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:55,740
Makes sense. Perfectly plausible video game.

1067
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:59,220
Not a ton to say about that.

1068
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:02,180
What? Let's see.

1069
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,180
Back to the future. Let's go back to the future.

1070
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:07,940
And then I then I achieve my goal.

1071
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,260
I get to I don't remember what is it the Marty future cap?

1072
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:12,900
I don't even know what I'm thinking like that.

1073
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,220
I will say about the wild, wild West one.

1074
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:19,860
That is, I think the term I looked it up.

1075
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,140
Forgive me if I'm using it wrong.

1076
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:24,100
Rail shooter.

1077
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:28,380
The that was in arcades when there would be like a giant plastic gun,

1078
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,260
like bolted in and you can't change your view.

1079
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:38,660
The original Nintendo system had a lot of games where you would use the light gun.

1080
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,380
So the thing about rail shooters is

1081
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:45,860
they're kind of a pain in the ass to play with a controller.

1082
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:50,940
So of course, there's going to be multiple rail shooters in these many games.

1083
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,580
There's a few of them.

1084
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:55,220
So that that's the wild west thing.

1085
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:59,220
Like I was like, OK, this would probably be in fury.

1086
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:02,020
And that's one of the shorter many games I feel like.

1087
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:06,820
Yeah, one of the more doable because some of these can take forever

1088
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:10,020
if it's not initially easy.

1089
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,860
Yeah. So back to the future.

1090
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:13,780
Back to the future.

1091
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:19,940
So I was just comparing it in my head to like, OK, the back to the future

1092
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,980
ride. What is the story here?

1093
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:26,020
Well, you're in the you're in the Institute of Future Technology

1094
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:29,740
and you're going to try out a new type of DeLorean that time travel inventor

1095
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,700
Doc Brown is built.

1096
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:34,420
But something goes awry while you're on your little tour.

1097
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:38,620
And Biff has stowed away and he's going to steal a DeLorean.

1098
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:43,140
And even if you don't know the movies, you can discern from the pre-ride

1099
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:46,580
materials that he's like a time travel troublemaker.

1100
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:49,420
And the system of bumping is set up that you can send

1101
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:52,260
both vehicles back in time and get them back where he's supposed to be,

1102
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:55,060
even if he's off on a on a goose chase.

1103
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:58,300
So that's where that's what you start the ride with.

1104
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:01,740
This one you start with a DeLorean unloaded

1105
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,180
out of a truck. Woody Woodpecker is there.

1106
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,820
He says there's Biff.

1107
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:08,900
Get it, go.

1108
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,940
No, if you don't know the movies, the ride, you have no frame of reference

1109
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:14,540
of what Biff is, why you need to get him.

1110
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:15,900
What if Biff is good?

1111
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,740
What if it's better than me or you?

1112
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,020
We don't see him. You don't see what he looks like.

1113
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:25,180
No, you technically hear him, but you really need to be told.

1114
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,940
You have to take it on faith that this is Biff because it's just

1115
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:30,260
generic male voice. Number one.

1116
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:34,380
Oh, my God, the voice. Hey, hey, what are you doing?

1117
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:36,900
Hey, what's what's up?

1118
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:39,820
Are you OK? Oh, my God.

1119
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,100
What's up? Hey.

1120
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,700
And then I swear he one time he goes, who? Ha.

1121
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:47,780
The one I watched, he went, who?

1122
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:51,580
Ha. At a certain point, he's being rammed by he's in a DeLorean.

1123
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,460
He's getting rammed by your DeLorean.

1124
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:56,620
But just like annoyed, you're like just annoying him by ramming him.

1125
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,660
What? No. What do you pay?

1126
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:01,540
Hey, what are you doing?

1127
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:02,620
And it's over and over again.

1128
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:05,340
A lot of these are you reused. Come on.

1129
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,780
This is happen even if he isn't getting hit.

1130
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:11,820
A masterful voice acting class compared to Woody Woodpecker.

1131
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:16,500
Oh, if you're a witty set the bar so low, I was like, well,

1132
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:21,020
as far as a listenable voice, I would say yes, but not imitating.

1133
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:25,900
Yeah, then it is not what it's not as a voice directing class

1134
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:29,980
because somebody should have said he's got like, just say attitude.

1135
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:33,500
And then maybe you would have done it with like, hey, yeah, are you OK?

1136
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,020
Bully voice. That's closer.

1137
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:38,380
This is just hey, what? Hey, what's up?

1138
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,780
Come on.

1139
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,100
Hey, the one.

1140
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:42,900
Hey, what's up?

1141
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,260
It's just like he's like, he's like, hey, man, what are you doing?

1142
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:48,100
And you feel bad for him in some of these line reads, honestly,

1143
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,300
because he's supposed to be the bad guy, but he's like not.

1144
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,940
He's not like, I'll kill you if you bump me again.

1145
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:55,580
He's just like, hey, hey, come on, man, what are you doing?

1146
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:57,700
He does not call you butthead.

1147
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,180
No, none of that.

1148
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:01,340
None of his classic jokes. He gets wrong.

1149
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,900
He says who? He says Al Pacino's line. Yeah.

1150
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,780
Oh, ha, ha. You can't handle the truth.

1151
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:10,020
And I didn't see. I swing.

1152
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,380
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.

1153
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:19,140
I'm ready for my close up.

1154
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:24,780
I did see it mentioned that, like, OK, at least some of these scenes

1155
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:29,420
are kind of like moments from the rock, like the bar is so low.

1156
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:31,020
It does follow.

1157
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,460
Yeah. And look, I always like when there's something, you know,

1158
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:36,580
I like that Disneyland Adventures NES game

1159
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:39,500
where it's kind of like you're going on Haunted Mansion or Pirates.

1160
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:43,700
So I appreciate it on that level that, oh, it's a thing I can do at home

1161
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:46,300
where it's the same order of events.

1162
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:50,340
I'm in Hill Valley in the future and then I'm in the Ice Age

1163
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:53,260
and then I'm in the lava age. Yes.

1164
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:55,140
I don't think any dinosaurs factor in.

1165
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,380
You're pretty much just in endless tunnels.

1166
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,580
Visually, this is not the worst.

1167
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:02,300
I would say Biff's voice is what weighs this one down.

1168
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:04,060
Yeah, it's not the worst.

1169
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:08,260
It's clear that, like, they just it's clear not a ton of work

1170
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:11,460
went into the backgrounds on this, but that's OK.

1171
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:13,860
It's better than some of the other games.

1172
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:18,220
Yeah. But like a lot of the games takes forever.

1173
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:22,220
Yeah, because you have to bump him not once, but many times.

1174
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:23,780
50 times. Yeah.

1175
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:27,900
Get the bar, get his health bar all the way down and then the mini game ends.

1176
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:31,820
Kill him. And there's nothing that changes or like it's harder about it.

1177
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:35,020
I don't like it's just the same thing over and over again.

1178
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,580
And you never really gain on him.

1179
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:39,540
You know, bumping him from behind.

1180
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:43,100
Just so you catch up kind of at the same degree every time.

1181
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:46,100
Yeah, it's really it's not. Yeah, you're not having a race with him.

1182
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,660
You're just stuck behind him, bumping him.

1183
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:52,580
It is just yeah, it's like being stuck in traffic.

1184
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,100
I can't get around this guy.

1185
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:58,100
And you're no matter how many times I hit him, he won't get off the road.

1186
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:01,580
It's really like it's a simulator for you being a dick in traffic.

1187
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,420
Yeah. Just bumping the car in front of you because you're mad.

1188
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,420
It won't get out of the way. Hey, hey.

1189
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:09,820
And that's when he's having a genuine reaction to that.

1190
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:12,420
Well, what a regular person. Come on.

1191
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,220
Justified. Yeah. Yeah. What?

1192
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,460
What are you doing? Don't.

1193
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:18,740
Yeah, it's something.

1194
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:24,020
But then at the end, he gets back to his time and he is promptly swarmed

1195
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,420
by six police cars.

1196
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:30,300
The police arrested him immediately upon getting back.

1197
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:33,260
It's really funny. All the cars swarm.

1198
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:36,340
How do you do it? Like for them to have been ready.

1199
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:40,620
It's like Woody had to like, like, OK, time traveler left.

1200
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:44,340
I'm going to call the cops and hopefully he comes back to now.

1201
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:46,940
Yeah. So we could be ready to arrest him.

1202
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:48,660
Sorry. What seems to be the problem?

1203
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:51,380
Time crimes. I don't have time to explain it.

1204
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:53,620
He did time crimes. Get back here.

1205
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:57,780
He's in the year. Lava, eight lava year.

1206
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,340
And he's messing with it.

1207
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:00,780
He's in the lava.

1208
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,740
He's going to mess up the lava age.

1209
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:05,780
He's going to turn all the lava to ice, maybe.

1210
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:08,220
Yeah. Now you got to arrest him when he gets back.

1211
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:11,700
The lava here is going to be all messed up in the future.

1212
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,900
If we don't get the lava safe in the past.

1213
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,740
I mean, well, sir.

1214
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,940
And sorry, are you your last name?

1215
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:21,580
Woodpecker. OK, Mr. Woodpecker.

1216
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:26,420
If we're even having this conversation, it seems to me that there was not

1217
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,100
any sort of lava disruption.

1218
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:29,580
No, no, you got it.

1219
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:32,620
No, you're not thinking you're not galaxy brain in this office.

1220
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:34,020
Just get over here.

1221
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:37,820
I give you assholes enough kickbacks for my hat selling business.

1222
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:39,900
Don't you trust me?

1223
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,580
I wasn't I one of your guys when you were little?

1224
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,380
Doesn't this sound familiar?

1225
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:50,540
And you want to you want to hook up with my girlfriend?

1226
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:52,380
We're not exclusive.

1227
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,940
She's also my sister.

1228
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,900
Look, I got that bumper sticker.

1229
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,100
I got the police benevolent association card in my wallet.

1230
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:02,460
You got to get over here and do what I say.

1231
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,660
So come on, lock this fucker up.

1232
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:08,660
Lock this guy up as soon as he lands in the future and the time the present.

1233
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:11,420
I mean, sorry, all the time machine.

1234
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:14,940
There is time machine and you a big woodpecker or a way.

1235
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:16,500
Yeah, I'll explain it.

1236
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,340
Don't tell anybody.

1237
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,500
Come on, the public couldn't handle it.

1238
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,780
You will. Yeah, you chilly.

1239
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:23,060
Willie was your guy, wasn't he?

1240
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,900
That's why you're not listening to me.

1241
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,540
It's because he's cuter.

1242
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:28,540
You can go to hell.

1243
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:31,980
So that happens.

1244
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:33,580
That's how it works.

1245
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:39,180
In it, I'm again like trying to go kind of what's the what are the crazier ones?

1246
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:41,300
I'm going to bring up E.T.

1247
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,820
Oh, yeah. Isn't that nuts?

1248
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:47,260
But as said, you're so sorry to go back to the future.

1249
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:47,900
Well, no, please.

1250
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:52,260
One of the funniest parts is the DeLorean door opens up and then you

1251
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:54,540
remember the child driving it.

1252
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:55,980
No, that's right. Yeah.

1253
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:58,020
Yeah, it is like a 13 year old.

1254
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:59,940
Yeah. Ten year old like big smile.

1255
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,980
And he's behind the wheel of this car that flies.

1256
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:04,260
And you're like, oh, yeah, that's not.

1257
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,260
Oh, that's probably not a good idea.

1258
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:07,700
But he did fine. He did well.

1259
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,420
So it doesn't matter.

1260
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,460
He rescued the he saved the lava.

1261
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:13,660
Yeah. So, yeah, E.T.

1262
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:16,300
Is this this is a lot like paperboy.

1263
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,180
Oh, yeah.

1264
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,860
And a lot of it is.

1265
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:20,100
So you're on.

1266
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:24,980
I will say this. I think they really nailed the wobbliness of a bike.

1267
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:28,540
You don't know. It really does feel like riding a bike and you don't quite know how.

1268
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:31,260
Yes, you are. And you have to keep it so straight,

1269
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,660
which is hard because it's moving left to right.

1270
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:39,300
So like which which way do I go with this multi directional controller?

1271
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:44,620
And you fall like the watch through the watch through is it does it's not

1272
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:47,860
illustrated. I fell so much when I played this.

1273
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:49,820
I'm not sure I finished the E.T. level.

1274
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:53,380
The animation of him falling is so funny because he's completely splats

1275
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:56,380
on the concrete for like his hands go down.

1276
01:00:56,580 --> 01:01:00,220
It looks like his face plants a little bit and like he would he would really

1277
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:03,980
get hurt in this scenario of how he wiped out on a bike and E.T.

1278
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:06,700
in his front basket also would get pretty hurt.

1279
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:09,060
Yeah. Falling this much.

1280
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:11,460
Because he's helpless and he's fragile.

1281
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,740
I know he's like in the narrative of the movie.

1282
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:17,340
He's kind of got his power back a little bit here, but still he's bruised.

1283
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,420
He's going to get bruised from falling this much.

1284
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:22,940
He's not at 100 percent when he's in the basket for sure.

1285
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:27,660
Yeah. So so the amount of times that your Elliot boy

1286
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:31,140
or falls here is really funny in that context.

1287
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:32,260
Oof. Yeah.

1288
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,700
He gets this kid gets the shit kicked out of him.

1289
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:37,300
Probably in this game more than any other one.

1290
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:40,060
Yeah. Well, you know, back draft.

1291
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,260
This is an argument. Yeah.

1292
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:43,100
But he loves fires.

1293
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:49,100
It does seem like they put more time into the falling mechanic

1294
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:52,420
than the actual playability of this game.

1295
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:56,540
We have to make sure that we're accurately hurting this 10 year old.

1296
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:58,860
Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, that happens.

1297
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:00,500
And there's like little ramps and stuff.

1298
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,780
He has to jump over. It's also like doesn't quite.

1299
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:05,380
There's like Mario Kart.

1300
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:08,620
I don't forget even what they're called, like speed, like speed.

1301
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:11,580
Whatever you run over, whatever you would call it.

1302
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:13,580
And like you accelerate and then there's ramps and stuff

1303
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:14,900
that you're supposed to jump.

1304
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:17,460
But look, if I'm Elliot and I'm trying to get or this kid,

1305
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:20,620
I'm trying to get E.T., I'm going to avoid the ramps just straight.

1306
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,180
Go straight to the ship.

1307
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:24,580
You have no room for error if you mess up one of those ramps

1308
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:25,740
and probably you will.

1309
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:26,860
Of course you'll. Yes.

1310
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:30,700
Because your bike is weighed down by this massive alien in the front of it.

1311
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:35,660
Is it not a street where just a lot of people have nicely put planks of wood

1312
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:38,340
up towards the roof of their car?

1313
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:40,260
Yeah, that's what I'm recalling. Right.

1314
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:41,860
So that's that's nice.

1315
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:44,900
Yeah, I guess there was a construction project in the neighborhood.

1316
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:47,740
And everybody had two beams lying around.

1317
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:49,860
They didn't need yet. Of course.

1318
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:54,260
Then also towards the end, the earth starts collapsing under you.

1319
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:58,140
There are big chunks of road that just drop out

1320
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:01,620
like like catastrophic.

1321
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:03,540
Yeah, like the mudslide. Yeah.

1322
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:06,740
Yeah. The apocalypse is near is kind of what it feels like.

1323
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:09,180
Like, oh, yeah, the earth is imploding.

1324
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:11,180
I'm trying to drag the back to hell.

1325
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:13,260
The devil is trying to get E.T.

1326
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:14,940
That's right. That's where he came from.

1327
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:16,500
Right. From the planet hell.

1328
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:17,900
You will take anyone out.

1329
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:22,580
You really can associate Universal Japan with a lot of suffering

1330
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:25,060
if you if you played this game first.

1331
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:29,460
Like, yeah, so far, just like the fender benders,

1332
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:33,740
bumping cars, collapse of the earth, filled with trash.

1333
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:38,980
So much trash, so much so that they need people there to do it.

1334
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:41,260
And not because they don't even have the custodial staff

1335
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:43,260
to keep up with the amount of trash.

1336
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:45,660
Yeah. Has to be collected by the patrons.

1337
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:49,100
By the way, ironically, the opposite of I didn't go to Universal Japan.

1338
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:52,380
But based on Disney, it's the cleanest parks on earth. Absolutely. Yes.

1339
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:56,620
I was thinking to go back to the trash for a second, how it is.

1340
01:03:57,220 --> 01:04:01,700
It is kind of amazing that we made it out of the era of Bob Chapek

1341
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:04,300
and that he didn't start thinking,

1342
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,580
how bad do you want to go on Rise of the Resistance?

1343
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:08,700
Bad enough to pick up some trash.

1344
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:11,180
Yeah. The points for trash system.

1345
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:14,220
He was just ready to green light it, I bet. Yeah.

1346
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:17,300
It was on his desk with some cutesy.

1347
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,940
Who's a character who's like helpful?

1348
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:22,500
Oh, interesting. I like.

1349
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,460
I can't think of what it would be.

1350
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:27,500
I guess he'd have to be on land.

1351
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,180
But what about like Fix It Felix?

1352
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:34,780
Like like now, now you can pay $30 and be a Fix It Felix and Fix It.

1353
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:37,180
Felix likes to make the world better around him.

1354
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:40,540
So all you have to do is pick up 30 pieces of trash,

1355
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:46,180
show them at the entrance of Rise of the Resistance or the web slingers.

1356
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:48,740
Yeah. And and that's all you had to.

1357
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:51,220
And it was and it's like a fun scavenger hunt.

1358
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,860
It's different every day.

1359
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:54,900
Yeah. And you get it. Maybe you get a stamp.

1360
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:57,100
Maybe you don't get on a ride even. You just get a stamp.

1361
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:59,020
Maybe there's something like that.

1362
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,660
You save right. If your kids really want to stamp,

1363
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:03,580
you can all be they can sign up to be Fix It.

1364
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:06,340
There's just there's a $30 entrance fee.

1365
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,980
That's like, you know, certain jobs you buy into.

1366
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:11,900
You need to buy your own uniform.

1367
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:12,780
Sure. Yeah. Sure.

1368
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:14,740
Unreasonable as and on your way out of the park,

1369
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:16,660
if you want to just open up one of the garage,

1370
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:19,780
a garage, garbage cans and just pull a trash out and take it home

1371
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:21,020
and throw it away there. Yeah.

1372
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:23,620
Feel free. Or just any dumpster you drive by.

1373
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:25,220
People love that.

1374
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:30,340
I did write down the beleaguered guard who teaches you about trash says

1375
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,180
people should throw garbage and garbage cans.

1376
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:36,100
That's pure common sense.

1377
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,140
Like, it's like, what?

1378
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:38,980
Why don't you pick up some trash, pal?

1379
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:39,860
You're just standing here.

1380
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:44,820
Why don't you and the rumble guy pitch in, you know, the time job?

1381
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:49,220
If that sign goes down for one second, people will all.

1382
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:52,540
Everyone in the park won't know if their internal rumble is working.

1383
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:53,660
Yeah. Yeah.

1384
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:56,580
So it'll learn those two things from employees.

1385
01:05:56,580 --> 01:06:00,180
But then a random guest says, like, you can get a map back at the entrance.

1386
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:05,060
When you're standing in front of fake digital stores, which in real life

1387
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:10,020
for just everyone has a map at the cash register that piles the maps, you know.

1388
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:15,260
I is all of the trash because all of the maps have been thrown on the ground.

1389
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:19,460
Is that why there's no like, nobody knows where to get some get maps anymore?

1390
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:22,780
Yeah, maybe that might be the narrative reason.

1391
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:26,180
These rude people, all these rude visitors of this park.

1392
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:28,340
Yeah, it's just common sense.

1393
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:34,380
I think I have the order right of weirdness of these things.

1394
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:36,660
I'm going to go to Jaws.

1395
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:39,300
There is a Jaws minigame.

1396
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:46,540
And this is a little interesting in a way because you

1397
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:52,180
just as a video game, it's unique that it's like the the finale of Jaws.

1398
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:55,660
And you're on the boat and you've got the barrels

1399
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:59,580
and Jaws is coming at you and trying to attack the boat.

1400
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:02,900
And you have to throw the barrels right in time.

1401
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:05,820
Like in theory, on paper, pretty good.

1402
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:10,460
And I feel like it's been other Jaws video games, but for a mini one,

1403
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:12,340
sure, that's the essence.

1404
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:16,100
It kind of takes away that you need it for the gameplay.

1405
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:19,020
But the fact that you get a little red dot that shows you that Jaws

1406
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:22,340
is coming from this way kind of ruins the surprise.

1407
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:27,700
I feel a little bit of being able to like, yeah, because because Jaws is shocking.

1408
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:32,180
I feel when he comes up out of the water, you kind of it's kind of like a puzzle game.

1409
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:36,180
It's like Simon, you know, you have to situate yourself

1410
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:39,900
on the right side of the boat, pick up a barrel and then throw it

1411
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:44,020
when he's like not at the boat, but like a little before that.

1412
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:45,900
I must be frustrated.

1413
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:50,340
I don't recall playing it, but I bet getting that sync up right is kind of hard.

1414
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:53,620
I would not be surprised if they didn't have that there.

1415
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:56,140
And then they started playing it and they're like, oh, this doesn't work

1416
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:57,740
unless you know where he's coming from.

1417
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:00,420
Yes. And they were like, well, what do we do? Do we change the game?

1418
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:01,940
No, we don't have any time or money.

1419
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:04,900
OK, well, let's let them know ahead of time.

1420
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:06,380
Red dots. We have dots.

1421
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:08,020
Red dots. I guess you need that.

1422
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:12,380
But I mean, in terms of the weirdness of it, again, it's that

1423
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:16,900
if you're playing this poorly, Jaws is successfully

1424
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:20,460
snatching up big chunks of boats.

1425
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:25,380
They maybe leave you like hanging off the edge and kicking, flailing for your life.

1426
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:29,940
But you'll get a shot of your character doing that with the widest smile on his face.

1427
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:35,180
Yes. Again, he's love his little boy is loving every second of this.

1428
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:39,260
He is in terrible danger every time, every time.

1429
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:41,500
And he loves that listener.

1430
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,820
By the way, if you got to this point and you're like,

1431
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:46,820
I kind of want to see this playability for myself.

1432
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:51,060
You can find this game on eBay for under twenty dollars.

1433
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:55,980
You might not get the case, but you can find the disk for really cheap.

1434
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:58,020
Well, under 15.

1435
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:01,340
Yeah, I looked a little bit around Burbank because there's a couple of retro gaming shops.

1436
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:03,260
I did not see it for some reason.

1437
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:05,980
That's maybe not the most in demand game.

1438
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:08,180
Well, and if you have it, you're not going to give it up.

1439
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:10,300
Yeah, because, yeah, of course.

1440
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:12,980
And then I went I was like, I went to the Burbank mall to look for it.

1441
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:15,260
And that retro gaming store is closed.

1442
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:17,300
What? Oh, yeah.

1443
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:20,660
So oh, well, that was another one felt like a fake store, though.

1444
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,900
So there's many of those things do.

1445
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:25,340
Yes. In this era of mall.

1446
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:28,580
Then you got where do we go from here?

1447
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:32,340
Let's do what am I forgetting?

1448
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:36,100
Oh, let's talk Jurassic Park. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1449
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:39,060
Yeah. Jurassic Park is pretty nuts.

1450
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:43,780
And in this one, you are in the back of a Jeep.

1451
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:46,420
And I don't even want to beat around the bush.

1452
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:48,060
You're shooting dinosaurs.

1453
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:51,620
You are there are you're killing dinosaurs with missiles.

1454
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:53,820
You get a kill count at the end.

1455
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:57,780
You're killing dinosaurs that don't even look like they're a threat to you.

1456
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:01,020
Yes, some of them maybe are, but there's like triceratops

1457
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:03,660
like just running around and you're like murdering all of them.

1458
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:05,580
That you're far away from.

1459
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:09,180
They are not the direction you are going.

1460
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:11,220
And then bang, bang, bang.

1461
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:13,020
Three triceratops go down.

1462
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:14,380
You are shocking.

1463
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:17,540
Blasting them with a with a gatling.

1464
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,020
You're blasting them.

1465
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:20,060
Multiple weapons.

1466
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:20,980
Multiple weapons.

1467
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:23,140
There's a homing missile kind of thing.

1468
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:25,860
And then there's just a rapid fire gun.

1469
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:29,540
And this is interminable.

1470
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:33,300
I like this goes on for so long.

1471
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:37,420
You remember this is a 10 year old who is operating these weapons

1472
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:41,540
and killing dinosaurs while like having Ellie Sadler

1473
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:45,420
stand in drives is driving and says, get out there.

1474
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:47,220
Coming. Get on the gun.

1475
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:49,420
Like, get on the 10 year old.

1476
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:50,620
Get on the gun.

1477
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:55,260
You shoot and kill anything you see, anything with a pulse.

1478
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:57,860
You kill it dead.

1479
01:10:57,860 --> 01:10:59,020
That's what the instruction is.

1480
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:02,140
And this 10 year old, if you would see him, I'm sure they giant smile

1481
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:04,660
on his face the whole time because he's a psychopath.

1482
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:06,260
That's what I think we're realizing.

1483
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:08,220
This child feels nothing.

1484
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:12,060
The person playing it got really good at the homing missiles.

1485
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:14,860
And you can tell at one point they dawned on them like,

1486
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:18,340
I think this will be over faster if I just use the rapid fire.

1487
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:22,660
If I just shoot him, like if I just do like, hold the button down.

1488
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:27,100
Enough rounds into every dinosaur to kill them 10 times.

1489
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:29,860
Yes, it is so funny to watch this

1490
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:33,380
because it is a relentless dinosaur bloodbath.

1491
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:37,300
Yeah. And yeah, there's no there.

1492
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:38,660
Yeah. Like dinosaurs just approaching.

1493
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:41,860
They could be approaching just to like, say hello or sniff.

1494
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:47,220
And no, no, they're getting high level, like high tech missiles, homing missiles.

1495
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:49,340
Yeah, that's not even do.

1496
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:51,940
Was there a homing missile in a Jurassic Park movie? Maybe.

1497
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:54,020
I lose track at a certain point.

1498
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:58,820
But there was that one game that you kind of went inside and sat on the bench

1499
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:00,620
and had guns. That's a different. Yeah, the game.

1500
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:03,740
Yes, there's another game where you're just murdering dinosaurs.

1501
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:06,100
Yeah. Very. That is a better game.

1502
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:08,660
I'm trying to remember how it went in the movie.

1503
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:14,140
Like Dr. Grant is with the kids and it was such a difficult night,

1504
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:17,940
but they have a moment of peace and they wake up and it is really beautiful here.

1505
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:20,380
And then, yeah, and then a little like nussling,

1506
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:25,340
nessling at the where they're sleeping and, oh, my gosh, a giant brontosaurus.

1507
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:30,020
And they kind of take in the majesty of it and then just fire round after round.

1508
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:33,420
Should like like jam bombs into its eyeballs.

1509
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:36,900
How many ways can we kill this thing? Yeah.

1510
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:39,940
And the kids like climb into the guts of it and are like, oh,

1511
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:43,380
they're like celebrating with big smiles on their face like we did it again.

1512
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:48,100
And like this body, one of them still alive and they pull out the long intestine

1513
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,620
and start choking.

1514
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,740
Just barely breathing brontosaurus.

1515
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:54,100
Just choke the life out of it with a big smile on their face.

1516
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:58,340
They rip. They rip one brontosaurus neck off and use it to go choke

1517
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:00,460
one of the other brontosaurus. Yes, exactly.

1518
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,820
And that's a wonderful scene from the first movie.

1519
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:04,700
Yeah. Mealy whippin.

1520
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:08,580
And the first the Sega Genesis Jurassic Park game was very fun

1521
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:12,260
because you either play as a raptor or you play as Dr.

1522
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:14,380
Grant with a gun.

1523
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:18,300
But at least they went out of the way of like it shoots tranquilizer darts

1524
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,700
or it shoots electricity.

1525
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:26,340
I guess in theory, these could be round after round of tranquilizer bullets.

1526
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:32,420
In theory, in theory, there may be a homing missile filled with Nyquil

1527
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:34,660
that just puts the dinosaurs to sleep.

1528
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:35,780
OK, yes. OK.

1529
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:39,940
And this thought exercise, the missile also explodes as a firework

1530
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:41,740
attached to it as well.

1531
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:45,100
So to tranquilizer full of Nyquil, but there's also a separate firework

1532
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:47,460
that makes it look like something has blown up.

1533
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:51,300
Yeah. To give you that like we want to give this 10 year old

1534
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:54,660
the sensation of making a triceratops bleed.

1535
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:57,020
Yeah. But we don't want to do it for real.

1536
01:13:57,020 --> 01:14:00,060
Exactly. There's a little capsule that's possible.

1537
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:02,860
The T-Rex chases you the most.

1538
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:07,140
And like by the end, that T-Rex has like a thousand tranquilizers in it.

1539
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:12,980
Yeah, there are so many bullets in this T-Rex by the end.

1540
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:14,260
Yeah. Yeah.

1541
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:17,060
It's just it would look in real life.

1542
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:19,100
It would be just disgusting.

1543
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:21,420
Like you could you could spell your own name out.

1544
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:23,100
And oh, my God. Yes.

1545
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:26,820
Can is this time to bring up that they decided to like other than maybe?

1546
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:30,460
Well, I guess JAWS sort of in the future, some of these aren't like the ride.

1547
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:33,620
Oh, yeah, I'd say most most of them are not like the ride.

1548
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:36,700
And this one is another. It's not a river adventure.

1549
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:40,140
And ET is I mean, you're on a bike, at least in that one.

1550
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:43,420
But you don't, of course, go to the green planet like it's not.

1551
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:47,100
Now, which is the majority of that's more than half. Right. Yeah.

1552
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:51,580
So this one, your Jeep eventually goes up the back of a brownisaurus.

1553
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:56,380
Does it rides up it and like like jumps off?

1554
01:14:56,460 --> 01:15:00,740
Yeah, like like you do a reverse red red red Flintstone.

1555
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:01,340
Yeah. Stopped.

1556
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:05,100
If you can imagine that I sometimes stopped looking at the screen. Yeah.

1557
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:08,100
There. Yeah, this is another one where I did watch all an hour.

1558
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,140
But there's things you've said where I go.

1559
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:14,140
I miss that. And I was in one brain and out the other.

1560
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:16,780
Pretty intently. I wasn't even like there was a baby around,

1561
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:21,180
but I was watching TV, so I must have like darted away or dozed off or something.

1562
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:22,420
I don't know. Mm hmm.

1563
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:24,140
So you hear anything?

1564
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:29,980
Is this an example of you trying to like, can I combo baby care and podcast research?

1565
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:31,300
OK, let's put this on.

1566
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:32,140
Boobaboo.

1567
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:32,860
Boobaboo.

1568
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:33,460
Roar.

1569
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:34,300
Screech.

1570
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:35,660
Roar.

1571
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:38,300
I had had killed 100 dinosaurs.

1572
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,060
I had headphones on. OK.

1573
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:42,820
So that kept the baby from watching the screen,

1574
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:44,500
which was good.

1575
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:47,780
One of her first memories being dinosaur blood.

1576
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:49,100
Yeah, no, I don't want her.

1577
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:52,100
I don't want her to have to see that, although she ends up watching wrestling here

1578
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,420
and there just because it's on. OK.

1579
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:57,660
But still, I feel like it's making her violent eventually.

1580
01:15:57,660 --> 01:15:58,580
Like it will.

1581
01:15:58,580 --> 01:16:01,180
Like when she like throws a forearm in my chest,

1582
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:04,820
which happens sometimes when she's upset, I go, did I teach her that?

1583
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:08,380
Mm hmm. Did I did she learn a move from the TV?

1584
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:10,500
I don't think so, but it's possible.

1585
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,460
But she's not strong style.

1586
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:17,140
You don't you don't want her like first words to be like, you don't have the right hat.

1587
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:22,380
Then, you know, you've really had to.

1588
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:23,140
Yeah.

1589
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:28,660
Let's get into I do believe that the most insane one is back draft.

1590
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:29,780
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1591
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:33,820
Just that it's there at all that now we're now we're

1592
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:38,340
on about 10 years past the movie, an odd property in general,

1593
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:42,380
always in the parks. And it is funny that in 2001 they built a brand

1594
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:44,740
new back draft for Japan.

1595
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:50,740
And now finally, you're in the world of back drafts with all your back draft

1596
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:57,220
pals. But mainly, yeah, you are a child in a kind of real.

1597
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:59,260
They nailed it here, I will say.

1598
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:02,260
This is the most realistic action and environment.

1599
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:06,540
And I think the fire they do a good job with for them.

1600
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:08,980
You know, like this one they spent the most time on.

1601
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:10,820
Yeah, definitely. Yeah.

1602
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:14,460
And you there is a countdown clock that is 15 minutes.

1603
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:17,700
So this thing could take 15 minutes if you want it to. Yeah.

1604
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:20,340
Yeah. You have to rescue people.

1605
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:22,580
And when you find them, they disappear.

1606
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:24,180
And they're like, thank you.

1607
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:26,340
And then but you also you.

1608
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:29,620
That's very upsetting to me, by the way, that you you it's like you're

1609
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:33,100
because you know, I understand that you collect items in a video game

1610
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:35,580
and then they end up in your little tool belt or whatever.

1611
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:39,860
But it's really weird that you bump into a person and then they disappear.

1612
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:40,900
They disappear.

1613
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:42,140
Feel like you save them.

1614
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:44,820
I feel like heaven, let's be honest.

1615
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:47,220
Yeah. You freed my spirit.

1616
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:49,260
You were meant to die in this building. Right.

1617
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:51,820
Goodbye. Better life awaits.

1618
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:55,820
I faintly remember a firefighting game or two.

1619
01:17:56,540 --> 01:17:59,700
And usually if you found someone, that was the end of the.

1620
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:05,180
You had to get to someone to rescue and you would get points for putting out fires.

1621
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:08,740
This you pretty much just put out fires to get through the level.

1622
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:13,980
And there are also sometimes they explode at you.

1623
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:17,260
Yes, a lot, a lot, I would say.

1624
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:19,540
And again, the smile never breaks.

1625
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:22,940
You are just plowing through walls of flame.

1626
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:25,140
Yeah. As if you're having a sunshine.

1627
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:26,420
Kids having a ball doing it.

1628
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:29,780
It would almost make more sense that he's running around a building, setting fires

1629
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:32,940
from what we've seen of what he likes to do in this game.

1630
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:35,700
And we haven't there could be a missing scene.

1631
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:37,260
Yeah, this very well could be.

1632
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:38,220
How does he wait?

1633
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:40,860
How does he know the the building so well?

1634
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:43,180
Doesn't seem like isn't that one of the toughest things

1635
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:45,100
and you're fighting a fire to know where people?

1636
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:48,620
Yeah. Where do you go and what's load bearing and where can people be?

1637
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:52,500
It seems to me he knows this blueprint a little too well.

1638
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:54,260
Yeah, I agree.

1639
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:56,180
I think I know there's there.

1640
01:18:56,180 --> 01:18:58,060
You're never given a cause of the fire either.

1641
01:18:58,060 --> 01:19:02,020
No, this kid wants mayhem and bloodshed like back drafts.

1642
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:06,060
Maybe the person setting the fires is a little too close to putting them out.

1643
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:11,820
Oh, well, well, well, then this is probably the most accurate to the film, isn't it?

1644
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:12,780
That's right. Yeah.

1645
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,940
So that's got to be what it is.

1646
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:17,060
Wow. Well, so it's good.

1647
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:19,420
So we all agree back draft is good.

1648
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:23,220
I and then then I mean,

1649
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:27,260
I think the most to me, the like legendary

1650
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:31,060
one of the attractions that are simulated in this

1651
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:36,300
in this game, like the the the most epic one to me.

1652
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:38,180
Waterworld. Oh, man.

1653
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:40,180
This is so great.

1654
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:41,820
This is mercifully short.

1655
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:44,540
Hey, I guess the closest one to the ride.

1656
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:46,500
Yes. Yeah, the right.

1657
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:48,340
I literally so right.

1658
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:52,380
So you might be wondering if you haven't played this.

1659
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:53,780
What are we doing in this?

1660
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:57,100
Because in Jurassic World, you're on the run from the dinos murdering them.

1661
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:00,860
And in back draft, you're trying to put out a fire that you started.

1662
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:06,740
And in Waterworld, am I off jet skiing into the atoll with the smokers?

1663
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:12,740
Yeah. No. What you are doing here is watching the very end of the Waterworld

1664
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:18,780
show where the plane lands and splashes and then there's a big firework burst.

1665
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:24,100
Yes. And here I have the exact copy that comes up with Woody on screen.

1666
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:27,300
You can see the demonstration of the climax here.

1667
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:29,940
Choose your seat to see the demonstration.

1668
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:34,180
It starts the climax scene when you are seated, which is a creepy.

1669
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:35,700
That's sort of akin to it.

1670
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:37,740
It puts the lotion in the basket.

1671
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:42,020
Yeah. And then you are given

1672
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:48,980
an overhead schematic of the Waterworld stunt arena and you are given your choice of five seats.

1673
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:53,340
This is kind of it's kind of a simulator of picking a seat in a movie theater.

1674
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:57,020
This is the closest thing to what I actually might want from this game.

1675
01:20:57,300 --> 01:21:01,660
Yeah. Which is more of a simulation of being in Universal Studios.

1676
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:03,180
That's the thing they pull off the best.

1677
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:06,060
We just run around the streets except the layout's horrible.

1678
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:07,980
But yeah, I don't want some.

1679
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:10,620
You were just complaining. It's not like the rights.

1680
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:15,820
This is literally what happens at the end of the Sea War spectacular.

1681
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:19,780
Right. And you watch it from four different angles to complete the midi game.

1682
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:21,980
Five. Is it five? It is five.

1683
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:24,140
Oh, man. Yep. You could do front and center.

1684
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:28,020
You could do off the left and the right and then kind of a midpoint.

1685
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:31,220
Some of the seats have obstructed you.

1686
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:35,140
Imagine a video game where anything's possible,

1687
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:39,300
such as pylons that get in the way of you seeing a stunt.

1688
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:40,660
That's realism.

1689
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:43,980
This should be so much more of a simulator where you're trying to get on all the rides

1690
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:45,900
by the end of the day and sometimes they're closed.

1691
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:47,220
Sometimes something breaks down.

1692
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:51,740
Like this is the realism I crave if we're doing a universal game.

1693
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:55,980
I hadn't thought about this that for here, I am complaining about the tedium

1694
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:58,820
and you have to pick up trash and you got to go way to the front.

1695
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:02,580
Yeah. Deal with this for you and what you like in theme park world.

1696
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:05,860
This is kind of getting to your it's all the only thing it's missing is checking.

1697
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:07,860
Well, exactly. So I yes.

1698
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:11,580
Like with the Woody Woodpecker having to go back to the start

1699
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:16,380
and find the right one and all that, it should it should just take that tedium

1700
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:19,740
and apply it to the real life tedium of going to a theme park.

1701
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:23,660
Yeah, I wrote this down to there should just be three to five minute sections

1702
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:27,900
where you just have to wait in line because it's like you kind of change

1703
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:31,220
the angle. You see the people shuffling in front of you.

1704
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:33,740
So it gets distracted and holds the line up.

1705
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:36,820
It can't be made up tedium like collecting trash.

1706
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:41,140
They they're inventing things now that don't exist in a regular theme park day.

1707
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:44,060
And they're trying they're trying to do too much.

1708
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:47,900
They could have gotten a lot more out of the actual realistic tedium

1709
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:49,540
of doing a day.

1710
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:53,660
And then you can select different waiting in line actions like, yes.

1711
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:56,460
It wouldn't have been get on your phone at this point.

1712
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:59,180
But is it like bend down tie your shoe?

1713
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:03,300
Is it touch the the the top of the stanchions and maybe even like act

1714
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:06,100
like your hand is a little plane as you walk along?

1715
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:09,460
Yes. Is it trying to sit on one of them for a second?

1716
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:12,620
Right. You think that it can bear the load of your body?

1717
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:15,660
And you get you can see there's an employee that doesn't want you doing it.

1718
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:17,980
And you have to kind of sit when they're not looking at you.

1719
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:24,740
Oh, and is that more exciting than the just like it's so almost random

1720
01:23:24,740 --> 01:23:29,060
and untethered, the idea that you're trying to stop jaws from.

1721
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:31,020
Let's get into some real world enemy.

1722
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:34,540
Yes. And you're in the DeLorean on the actual just ride and then you get spray.

1723
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:39,060
Universal does its trademark water spray and it like gets your shorts really wet.

1724
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:41,900
And you go into the gift shop and you're like, how am I going to really pay

1725
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:44,620
fifty dollars for Universal Studios shorts?

1726
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:48,060
And they're like, but I got to because my shorts are wet and makes it harder to walk.

1727
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:50,740
So you're finding they're getting haptic feedback as you're walking

1728
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:54,940
because your shorts are soaked. Oh, from splishing and then you consult with Woody.

1729
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:56,620
Like, seems like you got soaked.

1730
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:58,980
Yeah, your shorts are really wet.

1731
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:00,140
What are you going to do about it?

1732
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:03,180
Yeah, I guess you should wear sandals next time you come.

1733
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:04,740
Then you don't have to worry about socks.

1734
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:06,980
Why are you wearing corduroy pants?

1735
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:10,180
Corduroy shorts. Sorry.

1736
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:12,540
Now, are you here for the software conference?

1737
01:24:14,180 --> 01:24:16,580
This is why it's in Universal shorts.

1738
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:19,140
Sorry, you don't have enough hats to buy shorts.

1739
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:23,180
Yes, there's all these really good things they could have done.

1740
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:27,340
And yeah, they invented tedium and they tried to make the rides

1741
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:30,260
like you living the ride and they missed the point.

1742
01:24:30,260 --> 01:24:31,780
They missed the complete point of this.

1743
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:34,100
But they kind of they nailed it with Waterworld.

1744
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:35,900
They nailed it with Waterworld.

1745
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:39,300
You get to sit and watch something happen at a reasonable distance.

1746
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:44,140
Yeah. And then they should have had you get like your little shorts get soaked

1747
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:46,860
and you have to figure out what to do, how to dry them off.

1748
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:50,220
And maybe there's little secrets like there's a real sunny part of the park.

1749
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:53,540
And if you just sit there for 10 minutes, your shorts will get dry.

1750
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:56,220
Or you can. There's many options.

1751
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:57,340
Choose your own adventure.

1752
01:24:57,340 --> 01:25:00,900
They could have one of those drying stations, but then you got to spend points

1753
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:04,260
or money or stand.

1754
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:05,340
You have to get that.

1755
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:08,700
Oddly, the drying stations cost two stamps.

1756
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:12,500
So those you pay in stamps, not money or hats or points.

1757
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:15,980
And then that makes you have to go back and do the rides again, which

1758
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:19,140
which you don't get on those unless you have enough trash.

1759
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:23,580
Yes. Now you're combining your combining ideas, which is fine.

1760
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:24,860
You know, this is a blue sky thing.

1761
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:27,860
But yes, all of these things are on the table.

1762
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:31,380
And I feel like I feel like the people who made this didn't know universe.

1763
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:34,540
They don't actually know what the experiences.

1764
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:36,700
But they were. But you're.

1765
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:41,380
But I think there's they got a no, they did get they did get the tedium.

1766
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:42,100
You know what they got.

1767
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:47,460
You know what I think they got about universal is the often the lack of magic.

1768
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:52,100
Those moments, you know, so where you're just like, I'd rather be at home than here.

1769
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:54,900
There is nothing inherently wonderful.

1770
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:55,660
You know what I mean?

1771
01:25:55,820 --> 01:26:00,660
Because at Universal Hollywood, especially lately, it's there's been sort like

1772
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:05,820
you're looking at wait times like, OK, either Simpsons is 15 or it's 85.

1773
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:08,060
And there is nothing in between. Right.

1774
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:10,620
And when you're in an 85 zone, you're like,

1775
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:13,780
I bet I sit in my car with air conditioning.

1776
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:16,300
Yeah. Yeah. That's better than being here.

1777
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:20,940
Let's not forget the last stamp, the movie trivia game.

1778
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:23,940
Oh, of course. Where you you get the answer.

1779
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:26,860
Conclusion to this video game.

1780
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:30,820
First off, this is administered by Winnie Woodpecker.

1781
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:33,940
She says, I'm Winnie Woodpecker.

1782
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:35,700
Or catchphrase.

1783
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:38,340
And she she has two questions like

1784
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:40,660
this is the funniest thing.

1785
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:42,780
Who chased the bone collector?

1786
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:48,820
What was the name of Patch Adams love interest?

1787
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:54,540
What was Helen's occupation in Waterworld?

1788
01:26:54,620 --> 01:27:01,260
Helen's occupation in Waterworld and by the and you're like smoker atoller.

1789
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:04,140
No, no. We mean before it was Waterworld.

1790
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:07,180
What did Helen do in the before times?

1791
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:08,460
The character Helen.

1792
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:10,940
Everyone picture Helen in your mind from Waterworld.

1793
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:12,820
And now think about her job.

1794
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:15,860
Yeah. Think about hey, think about Patch Adams.

1795
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:17,780
And now we have some questions about it.

1796
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:23,060
Yeah. One video I saw there, like there are so many potential questions.

1797
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:27,820
So if you get it wrong, I think you only get three wrong before the game ends.

1798
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:30,420
You have to hide the game.

1799
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:34,700
It's all fairly like a mission impossible, like mission where the disk will self

1800
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:36,340
destruct if you get the questions wrong.

1801
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:41,100
It restarts and you're not guaranteed to get the same questions again.

1802
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:45,100
So if you you should know your universe, the history,

1803
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:49,780
I believe Patch Adams love interest is named Karen C.A.R.I.

1804
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:55,020
I don't even know the answer to the bone collector question.

1805
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,020
Karen, right?

1806
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:59,420
That's not a spell, Karen.

1807
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:01,100
You said Karen K.

1808
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:06,020
You have to watch the universal library, the whole thousands of films

1809
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:07,700
to know how to beat this game.

1810
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:08,420
This was Rich.

1811
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:10,780
Jay was like, why are they talking about the bone collector?

1812
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:12,700
Are they talking about Patch Adams?

1813
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:14,620
Chase the bone collector?

1814
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:17,740
The bone wanter?

1815
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:20,700
That much?

1816
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:23,900
I was like, they're just universal releases, I guess.

1817
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:26,860
A skeleton? Yeah.

1818
01:28:26,860 --> 01:28:28,740
Yeah, why are these questions?

1819
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:31,100
I thought they were going to be just about the movies with the rides

1820
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:32,420
you went on at the very least.

1821
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:33,620
Some of them are.

1822
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:36,420
There's a few about backdraft. Right.

1823
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:41,900
What did Adcox call the hero in the opening scene of backdraft?

1824
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:44,740
That wasn't addressed in the game.

1825
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:46,900
No, these are not questions you learned.

1826
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:50,220
No, you're just a freewheeling 10 year old arsonist.

1827
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:55,620
You don't deal with Adcox or the answer, which seems to be baby McCaffrey.

1828
01:28:56,820 --> 01:29:00,260
Not many McCaffrey, not chicken McCaffrey.

1829
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:01,620
But it's 2001.

1830
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:04,740
I mean, I know the Internet exists, but you're supposed to Google it.

1831
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:07,660
Well, and also I love where it lands

1832
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:13,500
when you lose and the judgment that Winnie Woodpecker makes on you

1833
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:18,100
for getting this ad, this easy base hit

1834
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:22,220
backdraft adcox question wrong.

1835
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:27,060
She says, you got to watch more movies.

1836
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:34,140
Be generous, like, you know, not like universal releases

1837
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:35,660
over the last eight years.

1838
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:39,620
You mean because it seems to me there's a common bond between all of these

1839
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:43,100
questions, but no, I guess I'm just no cinephile.

1840
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:46,060
We're going to Winnie Woodpecker,

1841
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:50,780
who, by the way, is on top of the answer box

1842
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:54,820
posed in the most seductive manner.

1843
01:29:54,820 --> 01:29:55,660
Oh, right, right, right.

1844
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:59,380
Like, you know, like chest down.

1845
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:02,860
Look, I'm just going to say chest down, ass up.

1846
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:07,540
Look, this is very flirty, flashing eyelashes.

1847
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:09,900
Well, Jason, is this come up and see me sometime?

1848
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:15,780
Is Winnie Woodpecker like a Jessica Rabbit type pre-coat pre-chunch coat?

1849
01:30:15,820 --> 01:30:16,980
I don't know.

1850
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:23,060
I think she's a few different pin strikes different from what he would pack her.

1851
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:25,180
I think that's what noticed what is noticed.

1852
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:27,220
This occurred to me, too.

1853
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:28,220
I was going to bring this up.

1854
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:31,700
This might be an uncomfortable area, but I think we have to.

1855
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:38,140
The OK, like Mickey and Minnie, I think we like I think that we think

1856
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:40,900
that Minnie is pretty, right?

1857
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:43,020
Minnie Mouse is pretty.

1858
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:45,140
But Mike, I know we know the answer for me.

1859
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:51,340
But is not Minnie essentially Mickey with eyelashes and a bow?

1860
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:52,740
Yeah, yes.

1861
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:55,060
Like, basically, that's what we're dealing with.

1862
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:57,260
And yet it does it does work.

1863
01:30:57,340 --> 01:31:01,380
You know, you aren't always thinking that's just Mickey with eyelashes and a bow.

1864
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:02,980
No, yeah, that's true.

1865
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:08,780
But this just is Woody Woodpecker with eyelashes completely.

1866
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:11,100
Sure. They really did.

1867
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:14,180
And that's why I don't mean to take away from anyone being attracted to Woody

1868
01:31:14,180 --> 01:31:16,180
Woodpecker. You can be.

1869
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:18,740
But you're saying it may be a little bit of lazy on the design.

1870
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:19,820
I think so. Yeah.

1871
01:31:19,820 --> 01:31:23,860
And it just makes this makes me disturbed by this flirty pose.

1872
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:27,460
Right. Because you're just you're just you're Woody.

1873
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:29,860
I'm not attracted to Woody Woodpecker.

1874
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:34,060
And you making you being in this position is just makes me uncomfortable.

1875
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:35,700
I see. Well, maybe.

1876
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:39,460
Yeah. Well, look, when we get into the the Winnie Woodpecker episode,

1877
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:42,060
the solo one that's different from the Woody Woodpecker episode,

1878
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:45,340
we will figure out exactly like the different designs over the years

1879
01:31:45,340 --> 01:31:48,820
and exactly what's going on, because, yeah, I see what you're saying.

1880
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:50,780
It's like exactly the same design.

1881
01:31:50,780 --> 01:31:55,020
Yeah. Well, there is one addition, which is little yellow shorts.

1882
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:56,460
Mm hmm. OK.

1883
01:31:56,460 --> 01:31:59,620
So I'm that standard issue for Winnie Woodpecker.

1884
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:01,340
I don't know. You got to ask Jason.

1885
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:04,620
And it seems like he's a little bit confused about his Winnie Woodpecker

1886
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:05,940
history as well.

1887
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:07,940
So I don't know about her little yellow shorts.

1888
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:12,020
We know about little red shorts on this show because of Mickey.

1889
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:15,140
But as far as little yellow shorts, I don't know, Jason.

1890
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:19,580
Well, I just got a little thrown because I was looking at the nieces

1891
01:32:19,580 --> 01:32:24,300
and nephews again, just to see Splinter and Knotthead.

1892
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:26,500
OK, except Splinter.

1893
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:31,260
There's a photo of her on this Fanta page and it's captioned Spleen.

1894
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:34,020
What? What? I don't know.

1895
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:36,980
I don't. And that's one of the reasons that Splinter Spleen.

1896
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:39,140
Splinter is the niece.

1897
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:40,820
Splinter. Yes, Splinter is the niece.

1898
01:32:40,820 --> 01:32:43,220
And she has a little skirt and a little bow on.

1899
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:46,140
OK, why is the word Spleen there?

1900
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:48,220
I don't know.

1901
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:49,740
That's strange.

1902
01:32:49,740 --> 01:32:52,980
I'm going to have a hard and when you Google it, you just you discover

1903
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:56,300
just like medical websites about taking care of the Spleens

1904
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:58,100
of actual woodpeckers.

1905
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:02,900
Could it be that someone abandoned this page 15 years ago and left the typo?

1906
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:05,340
Maybe going on, it says it twice.

1907
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:07,660
And then right.

1908
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:10,020
But the title says Splinter.

1909
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:11,900
All right. So let's read the article.

1910
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:14,300
Splinter Spleen is Woody's niece.

1911
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:16,100
What? Huh?

1912
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:18,780
Spleen. Is it short for something?

1913
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:20,500
Is it autocorrect?

1914
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:22,100
I don't know. That's interesting.

1915
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:23,860
Spleen. Spleen.

1916
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:25,700
Why is Splinter Spleen?

1917
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:28,100
I think there's no other documentation we have to look up.

1918
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:31,300
We have to get we have to get into the inner sanctum of the Woody.

1919
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:31,940
Oh, yeah.

1920
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:35,460
Wiki Winnie Woodpecker has an identical little skirt on.

1921
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:37,060
Oh, you're right. You know what?

1922
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:38,180
You're right. It's not.

1923
01:33:38,180 --> 01:33:40,060
Oh, it's not. It's not little shorts.

1924
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:41,540
It's a little skirt. Oh, OK.

1925
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:44,060
That Spleen also wears.

1926
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:46,900
OK, here on the niece wears.

1927
01:33:47,140 --> 01:33:50,140
Can I I can't I have to say a couple more questions.

1928
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:51,740
Oh, yeah, please. This one.

1929
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:54,900
This is just one of the strangest sentences I've ever looked at.

1930
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:58,300
This is basically what the question should be is

1931
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:01,860
like what?

1932
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:04,580
Never mind. OK.

1933
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:08,180
The question is, which of the following vampire

1934
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:11,660
Baines did not appear in Dracula in 1931?

1935
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:13,940
Vampire Baines.

1936
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:16,740
I mean, I get it in content, but what a weird.

1937
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:18,540
I've just never seen that.

1938
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:21,300
That's as weird as Spleen next to a little woodpecker.

1939
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:24,300
Vampire Baines, vampire Baine, which Baine?

1940
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:26,980
And that's and the answer is garlic.

1941
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:31,020
But isn't that just got to be another way to put that vampire Baine

1942
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:33,140
weaknesses is what I would have said.

1943
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:34,980
Seems a little more clear.

1944
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:37,900
I guess Baine would come on, I guess, Tray and maybe bad.

1945
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:40,220
Translation was bad, possibly.

1946
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:43,940
Yeah. Of your existence is I I mean, I guess that would be a Baine

1947
01:34:43,940 --> 01:34:47,260
of their existence. Dracula, which is your least favorite Baine?

1948
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:50,580
Yeah. Hey, rank the Baines, my man.

1949
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:53,100
Jason, what are your top Baines?

1950
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:55,460
Oh, gosh.

1951
01:34:57,100 --> 01:34:59,220
Dollar a dollar more for a dollar more.

1952
01:34:59,220 --> 01:35:02,940
While inflation, inflation, price, he doesn't approve.

1953
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:04,940
Night sleep.

1954
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:06,620
Well, yeah, all of us can.

1955
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:09,140
I want to read one of my favorite of the questions.

1956
01:35:09,460 --> 01:35:12,420
Which outdoor sport was featured in the River Wild?

1957
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:16,740
Thawing, water, karate, weightlifting or baseball?

1958
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:19,980
Wait, it's not it's not one of those.

1959
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:22,660
It's a raft, a white water rafting.

1960
01:35:23,220 --> 01:35:24,700
Well, for some reason, it's our weight.

1961
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:25,540
Maybe they selected it.

1962
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:28,660
But when they selected it, it like purples out disappears.

1963
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:31,140
OK, I think I found that with other ones of the.

1964
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:32,140
Oh, that must be what happened.

1965
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:35,620
So raf rafting that river while is not about karate.

1966
01:35:35,740 --> 01:35:37,740
That would be a mislead of a title.

1967
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:39,580
So I was like, maybe it's about karate.

1968
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:43,380
Well, I guess also if maybe you're on a white water raft

1969
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:46,660
or you're just like, you know, you get lost in a river

1970
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:48,900
and then you end up in a place that is full of bears

1971
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:51,020
and you have to use karate against them.

1972
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:52,900
Yeah. The climax of the River

1973
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:56,140
Wild is about fighting karate, fighting bears with karate.

1974
01:35:56,180 --> 01:35:58,340
I didn't like it until the bear karate.

1975
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:02,100
Oh, man.

1976
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:06,300
I who adjusted the clothing of the hero of backdraft

1977
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:08,380
while riding in the fire engine.

1978
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:12,860
This requires recent knowledge of backdraft.

1979
01:36:12,860 --> 01:36:15,140
You have to have watched it the day before.

1980
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:18,380
This would only work if it was like a memory exercise.

1981
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:20,820
You know, those things in like in the S.A.T.

1982
01:36:20,820 --> 01:36:23,860
where you read a story and then you have to say stuff about the story.

1983
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:26,260
You just that's the only way this would be right.

1984
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:28,860
People are not watching backdraft every day.

1985
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:31,340
I'm sorry, Winnie Woodpecker.

1986
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:33,020
Stop looking at me like that.

1987
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:35,460
I'm not into it. I know it's an open relationship.

1988
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:36,860
You don't have to tell me.

1989
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:39,220
Stop quizzing me.

1990
01:36:39,220 --> 01:36:41,260
You need to watch more movies, big boy.

1991
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:47,420
Maybe we can make a movie again.

1992
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:52,100
This is this is again, this is the climax of the game.

1993
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:57,020
Well, no, no, this is all to get the another stamp,

1994
01:36:57,460 --> 01:37:01,620
which is all in service of activating the fireworks show.

1995
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:03,940
So you think the fireworks is the climax?

1996
01:37:03,940 --> 01:37:05,020
That is what it is.

1997
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:06,820
Fireworks, Hollywood magic.

1998
01:37:06,820 --> 01:37:08,860
I guess. But I feel like that was more of like the code.

1999
01:37:08,860 --> 01:37:10,260
That's like the end. That's the nice end.

2000
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:12,540
Yeah. You view this as the what it all.

2001
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:13,740
This is the real climax.

2002
01:37:13,740 --> 01:37:15,060
This is the stressful thing.

2003
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:16,060
Final Jeopardy.

2004
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:18,660
It's the hardest thing in the whole.

2005
01:37:18,660 --> 01:37:19,940
It is the hardest.

2006
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:23,860
Some of these, if you rerouted these to be Jeopardy

2007
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:26,820
answers, everybody's getting wiped out.

2008
01:37:26,820 --> 01:37:28,300
That ends all the winning streaks.

2009
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:29,340
Ken Jennings is out.

2010
01:37:29,340 --> 01:37:31,100
He can't answer a question about ad cocks.

2011
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:32,380
No way. Yeah.

2012
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:34,260
So I think I'm right.

2013
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:38,980
So you have to go, I believe, all the way back to the beginning, Woody.

2014
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:43,580
And after you have all the stamps and all the letters, which give you a stamp,

2015
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:48,220
when you have all the stamps, Woody will ask you, do you want to watch Hollywood

2016
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:53,260
magic? By the way, you get enough stamps and he just opens his hands.

2017
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:57,700
All right, then.

2018
01:37:57,700 --> 01:38:02,100
And if you have enough stamps, the park becomes nighttime at some point.

2019
01:38:02,380 --> 01:38:04,500
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Reversible nighttime.

2020
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:05,820
You're reversible.

2021
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:08,060
There is a did you catch at night?

2022
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:12,100
There's a shot at night of a place next to Bactrafft.

2023
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:14,980
Do you know what I'm talking about?

2024
01:38:14,980 --> 01:38:19,020
Very prominently displayed, and I guess maybe it is like this in the actual park.

2025
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:21,460
But I was pretty shocked that it is featured here.

2026
01:38:21,460 --> 01:38:22,420
I guess you guys don't know I'm talking about.

2027
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:25,620
This is yet another Bactrafft trivia question I can't answer.

2028
01:38:25,660 --> 01:38:29,660
It's not Mel's or the makeup show because those fronts are in it,

2029
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:31,940
but you don't do anything to them. Right.

2030
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:33,020
But it's a different front.

2031
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:35,300
And maybe you saw it and I'll show it to you right now.

2032
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:37,660
Gear Deli.

2033
01:38:37,660 --> 01:38:40,100
Oh, yeah. Gear the Gear Deli.

2034
01:38:40,660 --> 01:38:42,740
It's featured in this game.

2035
01:38:42,740 --> 01:38:45,740
Now, from what I can tell, there's nothing they don't do anything with it.

2036
01:38:45,740 --> 01:38:47,780
There's no ice cream component.

2037
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:50,460
But it is interesting to me that it made it in there.

2038
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:53,580
No, that is it's kind of a brand, I guess.

2039
01:38:54,380 --> 01:38:57,420
Everybody stopped on the is it not Gear Deli?

2040
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:58,220
What did I call it?

2041
01:38:58,220 --> 01:39:01,100
Both of both of you were like in lockstep about.

2042
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:02,780
Yeah. Gear Deli.

2043
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:04,660
Oh, did I call it? Yeah, there's two hours in there.

2044
01:39:04,660 --> 01:39:07,060
Yeah. You got an A in there. Yeah.

2045
01:39:07,060 --> 01:39:08,900
No, you're right. I thought maybe I was wrong.

2046
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:09,580
No, no, I think you're right.

2047
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:12,180
Maybe they put it as Gear Gear Deli.

2048
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:13,180
Do you think I know it?

2049
01:39:13,180 --> 01:39:17,180
Copyright of Gear Weiss, the perfumer from Epcot.

2050
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:18,500
That's what I'm hearing.

2051
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:19,500
That's it.

2052
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:21,140
Oh, come on.

2053
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:22,820
I slept like five hours, you guys.

2054
01:39:22,820 --> 01:39:26,780
You got a little bit more perfumers from Norway.

2055
01:39:27,140 --> 01:39:29,660
Do you think I know Gear Deli better?

2056
01:39:29,660 --> 01:39:32,540
How much of their product I've consumed over the years.

2057
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:35,660
You got any more chocolate?

2058
01:39:35,660 --> 01:39:36,380
Me, really?

2059
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:37,460
And I it's your fault.

2060
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:38,460
Probably.

2061
01:39:39,620 --> 01:39:41,060
Yeah, it's Jason's fault.

2062
01:39:41,060 --> 01:39:42,860
I think you said it first, Mike.

2063
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:45,020
Today I did. But in real life, I'm saying.

2064
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:47,460
Oh, he planted Gear Deli in your head.

2065
01:39:47,460 --> 01:39:48,380
Yes, I think so.

2066
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:51,140
I don't know if this is one of these sherbet kind of like.

2067
01:39:51,340 --> 01:39:53,180
Well, he says sherbert, which is wrong.

2068
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:54,220
Mm hmm. Yeah.

2069
01:39:54,220 --> 01:39:56,300
And sherbet. That was a different thing.

2070
01:39:56,300 --> 01:39:57,460
Everyone I grew up with.

2071
01:39:57,460 --> 01:39:59,020
Yeah. Sure. Obviously a common one.

2072
01:39:59,020 --> 01:40:01,260
I still. Sherbet annoys me for it.

2073
01:40:01,260 --> 01:40:03,460
I don't say sherbet because I don't like it.

2074
01:40:03,460 --> 01:40:05,620
Oh, I sure people drives me nuts.

2075
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:09,020
Really? One of the only ones like that that drive me absolutely crazy.

2076
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:10,580
Well, this is a future episode.

2077
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:15,140
Let's just both say the word that we prefer and see who snaps first.

2078
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:16,460
Oh, with a little taste.

2079
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:17,900
Welcome to podcast the ride.

2080
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:20,100
Sherbert, sherbert, sherbert.

2081
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:21,900
You yell sherbet at me.

2082
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:23,060
And then I'm just trying.

2083
01:40:23,060 --> 01:40:24,820
Oh, that lime one's pretty good.

2084
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:27,300
Oh, I like the rainbow one best.

2085
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:28,340
Of course.

2086
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:30,260
Jason's reviewing.

2087
01:40:30,260 --> 01:40:32,060
Yeah, he doesn't care what they're called.

2088
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:33,220
He cares how they taste.

2089
01:40:33,220 --> 01:40:37,380
So the Hollywood magic is Woody Woodpecker conducting

2090
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:42,620
a pretty bad polygon like fireworks show

2091
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:45,980
and watching the show are a bunch of generic

2092
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:50,660
guests, plus you and a bunch of generic guests.

2093
01:40:51,380 --> 01:40:53,740
Woody Woodpecker's family,

2094
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:58,060
chilly, willy and grotesque versions of the creature from the Black Lagoon.

2095
01:40:58,340 --> 01:41:00,780
Wolfman and Frankenstein.

2096
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:04,380
I don't know if there's a hundred hundred percent complete version

2097
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:06,340
where you shake hands with all of them.

2098
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:13,180
The play through the long plays I watched, they were like just trying to get

2099
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:15,540
because you you you can.

2100
01:41:15,540 --> 01:41:19,300
Yeah, you can get enough points from playing mini games that you buy more hats.

2101
01:41:19,620 --> 01:41:21,260
So you shake hands.

2102
01:41:21,260 --> 01:41:23,020
That's when they come and watch the fireworks with you.

2103
01:41:23,020 --> 01:41:23,660
Is that no, no.

2104
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:27,220
Just when the fireworks show starts, that's who's like watching.

2105
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:29,180
Right. But you don't think it's because you're not.

2106
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:31,700
You can't like entice people to come watch with you.

2107
01:41:31,700 --> 01:41:34,100
They're just they just kind of walk on screen.

2108
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:36,740
Oh, and you know who else is in the crowd?

2109
01:41:36,740 --> 01:41:40,780
Are the sprites of all the characters you didn't pick to play?

2110
01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:43,740
Yeah, I think there's six little boy options.

2111
01:41:43,740 --> 01:41:48,660
Yeah. So all the all six little boys are watching the show at the end.

2112
01:41:48,700 --> 01:41:52,180
So that's one night so that it works no matter which one you played as.

2113
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:55,980
And each one is more psychotic than the last one is more blood.

2114
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:59,940
There is the craziest little assholes you'll ever meet.

2115
01:42:00,660 --> 01:42:05,060
They all watch the fireworks and wistfully recount how many triceratops

2116
01:42:05,060 --> 01:42:07,300
they murdered blew up with fireworks.

2117
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:12,860
Yeah. And then the final image of the game is Woody Woodpecker

2118
01:42:13,060 --> 01:42:15,340
creepily, slowly winking at you

2119
01:42:16,580 --> 01:42:21,340
as if to give one final reminder that he is in an open, possibly

2120
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:25,420
incestual relationship and doors open if you want.

2121
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:26,980
Doors open if you want it.

2122
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:29,260
That's the whole point of the game.

2123
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:33,340
OK, but the epilogue is that in 2003,

2124
01:42:33,900 --> 01:42:37,140
the game was released for PlayStation two only in Japan called

2125
01:42:37,140 --> 01:42:44,180
Welcome to Universal Studios Japan, which seems infinitely better to play.

2126
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:47,900
Your avatars walking around the park looks better.

2127
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:49,580
Your avatars are cuter.

2128
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:51,820
The hats are just little things you can do.

2129
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:53,980
You don't have to get that all the hats.

2130
01:42:53,980 --> 01:42:55,260
The hats are just for fun.

2131
01:42:55,260 --> 01:42:56,420
Yeah, they're just for fun.

2132
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:58,100
You can actually walk the streets.

2133
01:42:58,100 --> 01:42:59,340
You can't run.

2134
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:01,940
You are. You are stuck at one mile an hour.

2135
01:43:01,940 --> 01:43:02,900
But besides that.

2136
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:05,580
But it looks infinitely more playable.

2137
01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:08,220
The like the water world scene.

2138
01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:09,740
You're actually a cartoony.

2139
01:43:09,740 --> 01:43:14,700
You're the mariner on a jet ski going through like levels.

2140
01:43:14,700 --> 01:43:17,020
And I don't like that as much.

2141
01:43:17,020 --> 01:43:19,740
But it's in the stands a little too a little too inventive.

2142
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:23,580
Yeah. As an executive once told me on a show I was working on,

2143
01:43:23,580 --> 01:43:26,060
you're being a little too creative.

2144
01:43:26,060 --> 01:43:26,980
Oh, awesome.

2145
01:43:26,980 --> 01:43:29,100
Actual things said, I believe.

2146
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:32,260
Can you imagine how much better the show got after that?

2147
01:43:32,700 --> 01:43:35,980
No, was given pulled it back as an inspiring note to give.

2148
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:38,380
Yeah, sure. Great.

2149
01:43:38,380 --> 01:43:39,740
But it's very funny.

2150
01:43:39,740 --> 01:43:40,940
They they remade this.

2151
01:43:40,940 --> 01:43:45,180
So all of the mechanics seem better, but they didn't have the songs.

2152
01:43:45,180 --> 01:43:47,660
They didn't have the licenses for the music.

2153
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:51,220
Really? It's just like, yeah.

2154
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:53,660
Generic is what I said earlier that I wanted.

2155
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:55,340
So I like that aspect.

2156
01:43:55,340 --> 01:43:56,420
You like you like that.

2157
01:43:56,420 --> 01:43:59,140
It doesn't have music that you have nice feelings about.

2158
01:43:59,140 --> 01:44:00,380
Right. You don't like that.

2159
01:44:00,380 --> 01:44:02,220
You get to do fun things.

2160
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:05,060
Yes. So, yeah, a little, little good, little bad.

2161
01:44:05,540 --> 01:44:06,620
Do let me ask you this.

2162
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:10,780
Does it another thing I would have wanted is to be able to shake hands with Lucille Ball.

2163
01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:13,300
Do you think that the newer version had?

2164
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:14,660
Oh, I don't think so.

2165
01:44:14,660 --> 01:44:18,180
Is there any depiction of Lucille Ball in the video game?

2166
01:44:18,660 --> 01:44:19,860
Oh, in. Oh, in any video?

2167
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:21,980
Was there like an N.E.S. I love Lucy game?

2168
01:44:22,540 --> 01:44:23,820
Feel like there must have been.

2169
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:25,620
Oh, where you wrapped the chocolate.

2170
01:44:25,620 --> 01:44:28,780
So but maybe I don't think so, though.

2171
01:44:29,140 --> 01:44:32,140
Was there a Here's Lucy game for like the first Atari

2172
01:44:32,860 --> 01:44:36,620
like Overlapped Here's Lucy was on the air when Atari came out or something.

2173
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:38,380
Stone Pillow Challenge.

2174
01:44:38,380 --> 01:44:42,820
Well, Stone Pillow video game is a CD rom of Stone Pillow.

2175
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:48,620
Honestly, a good mission in that game could have been to pick up trash.

2176
01:44:48,860 --> 01:44:51,740
Yeah, that would have been you could have reskinned this game.

2177
01:44:52,220 --> 01:44:56,700
I didn't see I got an ad for reskinned Stone Pillow.

2178
01:44:56,700 --> 01:44:59,100
We we called our shot with Stone Pillow, right?

2179
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:01,700
Not specifically.

2180
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:03,980
OK, that'll be a barn burner.

2181
01:45:04,660 --> 01:45:06,020
Stone Pillow.

2182
01:45:06,020 --> 01:45:08,180
People don't know.

2183
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:10,140
They're going to be mad about Lucille Balls.

2184
01:45:10,140 --> 01:45:12,020
I don't know.

2185
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:15,220
I think the people were mad about ever would really embrace.

2186
01:45:15,220 --> 01:45:18,540
I don't know the TV movie stone stone bill.

2187
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:20,980
Oh, is that the one where she's like a homeless person?

2188
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:22,620
Yeah, OK.

2189
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:26,260
And she's like she was older and you're supposed to feel bad for her.

2190
01:45:26,260 --> 01:45:29,820
And it's a drama, even though she looks it looks like a character.

2191
01:45:29,820 --> 01:45:32,100
She would have played in a sketch on I Love Lucy.

2192
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:36,540
Yeah, the realism isn't really I want to be in this stone pillow sketch.

2193
01:45:37,980 --> 01:45:40,820
So I know we'll see a ball video.

2194
01:45:40,820 --> 01:45:41,900
Are you just I am.

2195
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:45,660
I'm reading about that one was announced.

2196
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:49,940
But look at the dates on Lucy Lounge dot com.

2197
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:53,660
This was April 1st, 2018.

2198
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:55,420
I got suckered.

2199
01:45:55,420 --> 01:45:57,860
This is why date stamps are important.

2200
01:45:58,100 --> 01:46:01,740
So I was getting excited there, especially because I'm reading it

2201
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:03,780
and it's not that crazy of a description.

2202
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:05,740
It does just kind of sound like a good game.

2203
01:46:05,740 --> 01:46:09,500
Honestly, a better game that could imagine like stomping on grapes,

2204
01:46:09,740 --> 01:46:15,260
stomping on grapes today as it with however they're going to do it

2205
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:18,100
with twenty twenty three technology is assuredly going to be better

2206
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:20,140
than picking up trash at Universal Studios.

2207
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:21,860
Oh, yeah, I think that's completely right.

2208
01:46:21,860 --> 01:46:23,700
You know what? I just found a Milton Bradley,

2209
01:46:23,700 --> 01:46:27,500
nineteen seventy five Lucille Ball body language board game.

2210
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:30,220
All right. I don't know what this is.

2211
01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:31,300
It's body language.

2212
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:35,060
It's called body language and it's the party pantomime word game.

2213
01:46:35,300 --> 01:46:38,180
Oh, and I guess, OK, it's not a there is.

2214
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:41,380
It's not a board game, but there is like a little piece of plastic

2215
01:46:41,380 --> 01:46:44,180
that almost looks like Hungry Hungry Hippos or something.

2216
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:47,820
And if you guys can see this, Lucy is on the box.

2217
01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:49,820
This is it's not I love Lucy.

2218
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:54,700
It's a Lucille ball game where she shows you different positions

2219
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:57,180
that you could hit like in a charades kind of.

2220
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:59,780
Yes. So there's a picture of Lucy and she's got like kind of

2221
01:46:59,780 --> 01:47:02,020
biting her fingernails and it says nervous.

2222
01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:04,660
There's one with her hands over her head and it says scare.

2223
01:47:04,940 --> 01:47:07,220
There's one where she's dancing that says ballet.

2224
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:10,220
There's the there's the body language game.

2225
01:47:10,580 --> 01:47:11,900
I've never seen this before.

2226
01:47:11,900 --> 01:47:14,780
I don't I don't think they've made a new version of this.

2227
01:47:14,820 --> 01:47:18,940
Mm hmm. So I'm going to.

2228
01:47:19,540 --> 01:47:21,140
This is dependent on my wife.

2229
01:47:21,140 --> 01:47:23,500
I working out here. Let's just audition this live.

2230
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:26,860
I believe what I have found is a television commercial

2231
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:31,260
for body language, but with Lucille Ball from Milton Bradley.

2232
01:47:31,460 --> 01:47:33,340
Let's just discover this together. All right.

2233
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:37,260
Oh, fly bird, right?

2234
01:47:37,620 --> 01:47:39,260
Everything has body language.

2235
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:42,220
Ah, let me load some choice words and play.

2236
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:45,780
OK, go body language. OK, go.

2237
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:49,980
How about each word scores points for each player?

2238
01:47:53,020 --> 01:47:55,300
Oh, Mary Jane, right.

2239
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:57,420
100 for us and zero for you.

2240
01:47:57,420 --> 01:47:59,500
Yes, we got the last word.

2241
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:01,500
Body language from Milton Bradley.

2242
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:02,900
Who's the hip?

2243
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:05,620
We want kids playing a fun, active game.

2244
01:48:05,620 --> 01:48:09,140
Who's the hippest celebrity we could think of in seventy five?

2245
01:48:09,340 --> 01:48:13,340
Headache. OK, kids, play this game where either you're a hobo

2246
01:48:13,340 --> 01:48:15,860
or you have a headache.

2247
01:48:16,780 --> 01:48:20,620
Did anyone else? OK, I found a page on Fandome

2248
01:48:20,620 --> 01:48:24,220
for Universal Studios theme park adventures to.

2249
01:48:25,060 --> 01:48:28,100
Hmm. That said, it was a twenty nineteen game.

2250
01:48:28,820 --> 01:48:31,140
I think this is a prank.

2251
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:34,540
I have found no record of this anywhere else.

2252
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:37,820
I don't know what kind of fandom fandom dot com.

2253
01:48:37,860 --> 01:48:42,380
But what within that video game fan on that?

2254
01:48:42,380 --> 01:48:43,940
And what? Yes, yes.

2255
01:48:43,940 --> 01:48:47,220
That's when they that's when they're making it up themselves.

2256
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:51,860
OK, yeah, because it talks about like Despicable Me and Jimmy Fallon.

2257
01:48:51,860 --> 01:48:55,660
And like there's infinite more characters you shake hands up.

2258
01:48:55,660 --> 01:48:58,500
Jason, this is a Lucille ball talk with a prank.

2259
01:48:58,540 --> 01:49:00,180
This is a bit had information.

2260
01:49:00,180 --> 01:49:01,340
It would at least it would have been worth it.

2261
01:49:01,340 --> 01:49:03,980
But I just think it would have been very funny.

2262
01:49:03,980 --> 01:49:07,500
Third, third quarter, fourth quarter discussion on this episode.

2263
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:09,260
The loose ball and the board game.

2264
01:49:09,260 --> 01:49:11,940
This post game show, the most of both shows.

2265
01:49:12,180 --> 01:49:14,380
And now a prank has derailed this talk.

2266
01:49:14,420 --> 01:49:17,420
I know. I say something about Lucy's friend, Mary Jane Croft,

2267
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:19,140
who's in that commercial with her.

2268
01:49:19,140 --> 01:49:22,860
You recognize the friend and she played Betty Ramsey.

2269
01:49:23,740 --> 01:49:26,220
And then I was going to say that that guy is clearly should have been

2270
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:28,300
Frank Nelson, but it wasn't.

2271
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:29,620
They couldn't get Frank.

2272
01:49:29,620 --> 01:49:31,860
You once again, you're doing the Mike Carlson.

2273
01:49:31,860 --> 01:49:35,140
This is the iconic body movement, which is aggressive points

2274
01:49:35,140 --> 01:49:37,740
about something obscure from before you were born.

2275
01:49:37,740 --> 01:49:40,740
Yeah, Frank Nelson and a big point that woke me up.

2276
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:43,180
I was a little tired and then I saw Lucille ball commercial.

2277
01:49:43,180 --> 01:49:46,140
I never see very reminiscent of like the last time

2278
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:49,500
every people really talk about body languages was during very

2279
01:49:49,700 --> 01:49:51,100
various elections.

2280
01:49:51,100 --> 01:49:52,700
And it's like, look at the way.

2281
01:49:52,700 --> 01:49:55,180
Oh, that would be like Bernie Sanders leans.

2282
01:49:55,220 --> 01:49:57,220
Like, look at the way he's doing that.

2283
01:49:57,220 --> 01:49:59,340
You're talking about general body language.

2284
01:49:59,340 --> 01:50:02,700
Now people know there was like, so I started it, I think.

2285
01:50:02,700 --> 01:50:03,940
Is that where it came from?

2286
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:06,820
On his show used to have like a body language expert and they do like

2287
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:09,260
watch a debate and this person would just pull shit out of their.

2288
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:13,140
Like, yeah, this means they're lying here because they scratched

2289
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:16,180
their temple three times and to be like, oh, really?

2290
01:50:16,180 --> 01:50:17,380
OK, interesting. OK.

2291
01:50:17,380 --> 01:50:19,340
And then they've done this now on like CNN.

2292
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:22,860
Like, yeah, for some reason, people think this is a legitimate way.

2293
01:50:23,340 --> 01:50:25,820
Oh, this is it. This is a tell this person's lying here.

2294
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:28,460
Yeah, whatever. It's like a poker player or something.

2295
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:31,380
We take you now to a body language expert

2296
01:50:31,860 --> 01:50:35,500
involved in the creation of the beloved game body language.

2297
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:37,620
Lucille Ball from 1975.

2298
01:50:37,620 --> 01:50:39,020
Here's the ad in full.

2299
01:50:39,020 --> 01:50:41,860
See if you recognize any of Lucy's friends in it. Yeah.

2300
01:50:42,860 --> 01:50:45,540
They all they were like, oh, Frank Nelson going to be there.

2301
01:50:45,540 --> 01:50:47,220
He was having a tooth pulled.

2302
01:50:47,220 --> 01:50:51,180
And he said, I prefer that to this one day gig.

2303
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:53,860
All right. Let's get out of here.

2304
01:50:53,860 --> 01:50:54,500
Let's get out of here.

2305
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:56,500
I have one more little thing to show you guys. Oh, great.

2306
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:59,380
Well, then you survived podcast the ride.

2307
01:50:59,380 --> 01:51:00,980
Thanks for this suggestion.

2308
01:51:00,980 --> 01:51:04,140
Very great to do and more fun than picking up garbage.

2309
01:51:04,620 --> 01:51:07,700
And thanks for subscribing to Club Three, your bravery saved the podcast.

2310
01:51:07,700 --> 01:51:09,460
Well done. Freedom fighters.

2311
01:51:09,460 --> 01:51:13,180
Topics in the comments below, please.

2312
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:15,980
And wait, Mike, you're showing us something now or when the episode is done.

2313
01:51:16,060 --> 01:51:19,740
OK, I mean, sir, it's not a gift for you guys.

2314
01:51:19,740 --> 01:51:20,580
It's a gift for me.

2315
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:23,300
But I have to show it to you because it just literally came in the mail

2316
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:25,180
a minute before leaving the house.

2317
01:51:25,180 --> 01:51:28,500
And it's very exciting because it's finally here.

2318
01:51:29,180 --> 01:51:32,940
NECA's Daniel Roebuck, Grandpa Munster figure. Wow.

2319
01:51:32,940 --> 01:51:34,620
He's here. It's in my possession.

2320
01:51:34,620 --> 01:51:37,140
I want to show you the painted art of the box, which is great.

2321
01:51:37,140 --> 01:51:38,660
They're from the movie we all hate.

2322
01:51:38,660 --> 01:51:40,100
We hate this movie.

2323
01:51:40,100 --> 01:51:41,940
It's a terrible movie.

2324
01:51:41,940 --> 01:51:45,220
But I needed to have it because of it's Daniel Roebuck.

2325
01:51:45,220 --> 01:51:47,220
The detail is incredible.

2326
01:51:47,220 --> 01:51:47,620
Oh, my God.

2327
01:51:47,620 --> 01:51:49,620
These are the greatest figures on earth.

2328
01:51:49,620 --> 01:51:51,740
Here he is. Wow. Take a look.

2329
01:51:51,740 --> 01:51:54,460
Well, yeah, these are these very realistic

2330
01:51:55,340 --> 01:51:59,300
figures with different interchangeable heads.

2331
01:51:59,620 --> 01:52:02,500
And my only note would be if they're going to make Roebuck's body.

2332
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:04,300
Well, right. Make a J head.

2333
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:07,540
Well, you know what we could probably do is the very talented people

2334
01:52:07,540 --> 01:52:10,820
in our audience are not even in our audience that can do customizations.

2335
01:52:11,220 --> 01:52:14,020
So I feel like I could send one of these heads to somebody

2336
01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:19,580
and they could customize a Leno head for him, a Roebuck Leno head.

2337
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:23,540
So we could get someone to I could commission someone to do it.

2338
01:52:23,540 --> 01:52:26,620
So at the very least, obviously, it would be great to have a full Leno figure.

2339
01:52:26,780 --> 01:52:27,780
Maybe we could just do that, too.

2340
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:30,980
But at the very least, just having the Roebuck Leno head on Grandpa

2341
01:52:30,980 --> 01:52:33,100
Munster would be pretty good. Mm hmm.

2342
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:35,220
So it's got to be the same body.

2343
01:52:35,220 --> 01:52:38,580
We do not want a full Roebuck Leno figure.

2344
01:52:38,940 --> 01:52:42,580
Why not keep the iconic body shape of actor Daniel Roebuck?

2345
01:52:42,860 --> 01:52:44,460
I completely agree with you.

2346
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:47,700
So this who who would have thought this a year ago?

2347
01:52:47,700 --> 01:52:49,700
This would have been possible

2348
01:52:49,700 --> 01:52:53,060
when this came together, whatever, when we learned about it last year.

2349
01:52:53,260 --> 01:52:54,780
I mean, what a dream.

2350
01:52:54,780 --> 01:52:58,380
Daniel Roebuck probably thinking he's in the sunset of his career

2351
01:52:58,380 --> 01:53:00,620
and he will never have an action figure. Right.

2352
01:53:00,620 --> 01:53:03,860
If it didn't happen for a late shift, why would it happen now? Right.

2353
01:53:04,100 --> 01:53:07,180
But no, he's got it and he's signing him at cons. He's going everywhere.

2354
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:10,060
I mean, he's trying to stay away from the woke police, from what I understand.

2355
01:53:10,060 --> 01:53:12,060
But that's a different story.

2356
01:53:12,620 --> 01:53:15,420
Well, look, this is what I'm saying about taffers,

2357
01:53:15,420 --> 01:53:18,700
that if we start applying that judgment to whoever we talk about.

2358
01:53:18,860 --> 01:53:23,220
Sorry, but 75 percent of our episodes are toast. That's true.

2359
01:53:24,220 --> 01:53:27,740
So, you know, it is what it is.

2360
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:29,340
It is what it is.

2361
01:53:29,340 --> 01:53:33,740
A Daniel Roebuck action in a macula Daniel Roebuck action figure.

2362
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:36,420
Congratulations on this addition to your family.

2363
01:53:36,460 --> 01:53:38,100
Thank you very much.

2364
01:53:38,100 --> 01:53:40,900
The baby's not allowed to play with these,

2365
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:44,500
not because of the small parts, but because I cherish them too much.

2366
01:53:45,700 --> 01:53:48,100
So, all right, the photo of this.

2367
01:53:48,260 --> 01:53:49,300
Thanks for listening.

2368
01:53:49,300 --> 01:53:52,860
And hey, go kill a couple dozen dinosaurs.
