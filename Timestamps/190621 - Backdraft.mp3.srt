1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,080
Warning, the following podcast may contain

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,840
a miserable Scott Glenn, fireproof buildings

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,680
anointed by the Lord and people literally breathing jazz.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,360
This podcast may seem harmless, but don't let it seduce you.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,000
It's Backdraft on Podcast The Ride.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a show about theme parks,

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,480
where we're excited to discuss all the times

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,800
that the universal backlot was supposed to be on fire.

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,960
I'm Scott Carradier joined by Jason Sheridan,

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,400
Mike Carlson, hey fellas.

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,000
Yeah, hello, I'm Mike Carlson.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,640
Yeah, there is a rich history of fires

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,040
at the universal backlot.

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,440
This one also has a time it wasn't supposed to be on fire.

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,360
Yes, within the attraction where there's a fire

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,080
inside of a soundstage, the outside of the soundstage

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,720
was also set on fire, unrelatedly, I don't know.

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,280
I believe it was a blowtorch, just a worker.

21
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,920
Then they were, that's what I'm thinking,

22
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,360
they were working on it.

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,080
During the day, during business hours.

24
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,920
What?

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,760
Yeah.

26
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,960
Was it a test run for the fake fire that happened later

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,360
that destroyed the King Kong part of the tram tour?

28
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,400
Like 20 years later?

29
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,200
Yeah, I mean, was it that late?

30
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,040
No, it wasn't that late.

31
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,840
It's 1992, this accidental fire happened.

32
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,160
This opened in 92 and the fire was in the first couple months.

33
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,520
Yes, it was also in 92 and then the fake New York fire

34
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,840
was 2008.

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,960
There was a different, I was watching, I can't remember.

36
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,680
It's like Yester Land, Yesterworld, one of those.

37
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,200
And there's another incident where.

38
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,040
Not the movie where the Beatles music disappears?

39
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,520
No, that's a different, that's yesterday.

40
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,080
And that's not the Bruce Springsteen musical one.

41
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,120
Yeah, I didn't know about that one.

42
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,280
Which we saw before when we saw Aladdin.

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,740
No, it's not that, it's one of those YouTube videos

44
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,780
where they recount what happened in a defunct attraction.

45
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,740
And there was an incident where the fire sprinklers

46
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,660
were set off drenching the people that were watching

47
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,180
Backdraft because the ride itself got like too flamey.

48
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,260
It like flared up and it set off the sprinkler system.

49
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,420
Like dousing people, I think in like chemicals and water.

50
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,260
No, oh sure.

51
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,180
And they had to change their clothes,

52
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,300
they had to go to the hotel, they had to like,

53
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,220
they offered, they all got free, whatever shirt,

54
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,300
thing one and thing two shirts.

55
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,540
And then they got March in the hotel

56
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,380
to take a shower and back out.

57
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,660
So I think I was confusing it with that

58
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,540
because that was, I don't think, too long ago.

59
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,460
I didn't know about that one.

60
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,460
But I bring this up partially because have you guys

61
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,520
been following that the 2008 Universal Fire

62
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,300
has been back in the news this week?

63
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,940
Yes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

64
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,260
This is fascinating.

65
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,580
This is, it suddenly is a story again

66
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,080
and we picked Backdraft pretty randomly as a topic,

67
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,600
but this actually, fire in the universe a lot,

68
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,360
extremely relevant right now.

69
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,480
And if you at home don't know this,

70
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,960
an incredible article from the New York Times Magazine

71
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,320
about the 2008 fire that, the big headline at the time

72
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,980
was that the fire destroyed King Kong,

73
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,920
the original experience on the tram

74
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,080
and the amazing animatronic that I got to yell at every day

75
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,320
for one of the best summers of my life.

76
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,160
That was the big thing about it

77
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,040
and it destroyed some of the backlot sets and everything.

78
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,000
And then there was also the element

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,640
that it destroyed a little bit of the video vault.

80
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,480
Yes.

81
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,600
And which I remember when I was training to be a tour guide,

82
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,080
they pointed out that building and they said,

83
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,240
this is one of the things you can never mention on the tour.

84
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,520
You cannot bring up that that building is the video vault.

85
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,600
We will tell you that,

86
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,700
but there's very precious stuff in there

87
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,800
and we need to make sure nobody knows where that is.

88
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,320
Then it caught on fire two years later.

89
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,520
And they tried to, they addressed that at the time

90
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,360
and they said, well, everything was backed up

91
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,840
and don't worry about it.

92
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,800
And we think maybe we lost,

93
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,720
we thought that we lost the original print

94
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,880
of What Dreams May Come.

95
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,600
I was gonna say, What Dreams May Come is the one that they,

96
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,120
yes, that was the one I remember

97
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,160
that they were trying to track down the master of.

98
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,880
We might've lost What Dreams May Come.

99
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,720
It went to heaven, like the movie itself.

100
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,520
But no, we tracked it down in Europe, it's fine.

101
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,200
Okay, so film situation's fine.

102
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,240
Oh yeah, oh and by the way,

103
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,640
we might've lost a little bit of music,

104
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,520
but we're not really worried about it,

105
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,720
just like a couple obscure.

106
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,640
That was all that remained of that.

107
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,160
And then in the last couple weeks,

108
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,960
mega expose where that basically is that

109
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,960
all of the master recordings for all of the music ever

110
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,480
was destroyed.

111
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,800
It is so bonkers.

112
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,200
And have you guys read the article?

113
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,200
I haven't, I didn't know the extent of it.

114
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,080
It's shocking.

115
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,660
I mean, as a result of media consolidation over decades,

116
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,340
the Universal Music Group is massive.

117
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,340
And there was all of this, like Buddy Holly Masters,

118
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,540
is it Louis Armstrong?

119
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,380
Was he in there?

120
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,860
Anyone you can think of.

121
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,140
And then other older stuff of record labels

122
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,940
people don't even remember anymore.

123
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,700
Stuff where it's like this could be the only copy

124
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,380
might just be gone now.

125
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,220
Which would be gone forever.

126
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,540
Entire labels, chess and I believe DECA.

127
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,620
Impulse, what was Impulse records?

128
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,460
Who cares?

129
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,280
Just throw it in a warehouse.

130
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,100
So that's most of John Coltrane's masters.

131
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,940
Wow.

132
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,500
Who else is on Impulse?

133
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,620
So Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie,

134
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,660
Sonny Rollins, Favaro Sanders, Charles Mingus.

135
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,160
And then that's just like, the list is so overwhelming

136
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,180
that if you just stop and meditate

137
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,380
on any individual one of them,

138
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,420
like rock around the clock was destroyed.

139
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,420
There can never be a true remaster

140
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,060
of a rock around the clock at last is gone.

141
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,900
Geez.

142
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,340
Louie Louie is gone.

143
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,460
Things these like fundamental touchstones.

144
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,700
In popular music.

145
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,940
Yeah, yeah.

146
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,700
And then if you keep going down the list

147
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,900
to like more recent stuff,

148
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,940
the other where you first you got blues to deal with.

149
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,060
It's John Lee Hooker and Buddy Guy and Howlin' Wolf.

150
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,420
And then you keep going through like Quincy Jones,

151
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,700
Four Tops, Burt Bacharach, Mamas and the Papas,

152
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,180
Joni Mitchell, Al Green, Steely Dan.

153
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,460
And that is the unkindest cut of all.

154
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,700
Now you're most favorite of all the people you listed.

155
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,060
You've gone too far, fire.

156
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,060
All Steely Dan?

157
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,200
Not all of Steely Dan.

158
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,900
And this actually comes up in the article

159
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,340
and I don't wanna just recap this

160
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,020
or the article in the podcast,

161
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,340
but I encourage everybody to look it up

162
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,900
because it's even if you're just,

163
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,100
you know, if you're a little interested

164
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,180
in the theme park of it or the music of it,

165
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,220
it's a, or just if you like government coverups

166
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,380
and conspiracies, this isn't government,

167
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,180
but if you like crazy conspiracies,

168
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,260
it's so insane.

169
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,980
Steely Dan comes up specifically in the story

170
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,980
because okay, so the fire happens and they downplay it

171
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,020
and they even, there's a guy who they make fall

172
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,580
on his sword and say, hey, can you just give me the names

173
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,900
of like two obscure artists who might've had their masters

174
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,740
in the fire?

175
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,100
And they're able to say like, oh, so and so,

176
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,940
you know, this guy's this organist, all his music's gone.

177
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,120
Nothing else important.

178
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,080
They hiding the fact that this is all like

179
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,320
fundamental American culture that got destroyed.

180
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,800
And nobody was really asking questions

181
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,000
and then Irving Azov started asking around

182
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,800
who was at the, in the 70s was like a manager,

183
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,640
an agent or something.

184
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,600
Now is one of the most powerful people in the industry

185
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,120
via Ticketmaster and all this stuff.

186
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,560
He started asking, was this set of Steely Dan masters

187
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,360
destroyed and they panicked and let's try to find it

188
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,880
and luckily they found it in a warehouse in Pennsylvania

189
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,880
or somewhere else.

190
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,140
Don't worry Irving, it's all fine.

191
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,720
But guess what, that wasn't all of it.

192
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,600
There are Steely Dan, there's Steely Dan songs

193
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,520
that can never be heard again, which is infuriating to me

194
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,380
because there's like demos that are on hissy tape

195
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:18,600
that are still fantastic and they'll never be done properly.

196
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,200
Do we, I have two quick thoughts.

197
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,120
Do we know what Steely Dan songs were destroyed

198
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,520
and was my old school destroyed,

199
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,680
my favorite Steely Dan song?

200
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,920
Oh, oh, I don't know actually.

201
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,160
And there's maybe no way of knowing.

202
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,040
Can't vouch for my old school.

203
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,960
You know what though, I think,

204
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,840
here's an interesting component of all this.

205
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,200
You start to ask why are masters important

206
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,480
beyond making better mixes of albums

207
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,000
and music engineering and stuff can be kind of esoteric

208
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,460
to me, I can't tell the difference

209
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,200
between the mono and the stereo.

210
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,860
But there's all these bizarre uses of masters

211
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,760
you might never think of, like with the Beatles

212
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,920
they wanna make a Cirque du Soleil show

213
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,040
and remix all the stuff or rock band.

214
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,520
And I believe my old school was on rock band.

215
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,200
I think you could buy that.

216
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,300
And in order to make rock band happen,

217
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,900
they had to separate out all of the stems.

218
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,840
So that makes me think that my old school is safe.

219
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,080
Yes, but there is a really hissy,

220
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,040
it's only available in horrible quality on YouTube

221
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,800
is a song called The Bear that I love

222
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,860
and there'll probably never be a good version of The Bear

223
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,680
by Steely Dan, fuck all this.

224
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,080
And also, and then another one,

225
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,280
Chris Novacelek himself says he's fairly certain,

226
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,600
Nirvana, Nevermind, the master recordings are gone.

227
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,440
Oh my God.

228
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,040
They have been gone since 2008.

229
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,240
And that's not even, it's like so,

230
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,920
this thing goes, the list is so insane.

231
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,000
It goes on Tom Petty, this Tom Petty, it's gone forever.

232
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,200
R.E.M. we think.

233
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,640
Yeah, yeah, it's so bonkers.

234
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,480
It is crazy, I mean, a couple things to think about.

235
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,480
One, these warehouses are just that, they are warehouses.

236
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,640
Even if you have the best climate control

237
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,360
and fireproofing, as we learned today.

238
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,640
And they didn't because, well, they did have

239
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,600
climate control and they made everything very cold,

240
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,320
the exact temperature for old film to be stored at,

241
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,160
which is too cold for music.

242
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,000
So some of this music already was cracking apart,

243
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,640
like the tapes were breaking.

244
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,320
So it was already shit and then it all caught on fire.

245
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,560
It's already shit, one, it's staffed by humans.

246
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,320
Sometimes it's just staffed by a guy or two.

247
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,040
Usually.

248
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,560
Sometimes it's staffed by a dog.

249
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,360
You said staffed by humans.

250
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,200
Yeah, yeah.

251
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,040
So sometimes it's a dog.

252
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,560
But maybe, they might have just had a big hound

253
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,520
like walking around this big warehouse.

254
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,640
An old, like 15 year old hound with like a security hat

255
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,640
on top in the barrel, the St. Bernard barrel,

256
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,640
in case somebody falls and needs whiskey.

257
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,640
I mean, I worked at a post house for many years

258
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,200
with massive vaults of like dailies and stuff,

259
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,080
like and masters.

260
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,560
One project I worked on was the Blu-ray restoration

261
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,160
of Star Trek The Next Generation.

262
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,400
And I had the camera masters.

263
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,000
I just had a room filled with film canisters.

264
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,160
Oh my God, did you get fudge all over

265
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,560
the Star Trek The Next Generation masters?

266
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,280
All over them.

267
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,720
I got Trader Joe's yogurt all over them.

268
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,240
How come in most episodes, like this big brown gas

269
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,680
like filled, it seemed like they went to that plot.

270
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,840
Yeah, there was always a fudge gas monster

271
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,760
on every new episode, newly mastered episode of TNG.

272
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Yeah, so usually understaffed, sometimes often underpaid.

273
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,320
And a lot of times they'll just like cut costs or,

274
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,240
I mean, stuff disappears forever.

275
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,400
Like I just the other day watched The Other Side of the Wind,

276
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,560
the Orson Welles' last movie that they finally finished,

277
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,480
that they finally, and that film was scattered

278
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,680
all over the France and America.

279
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,480
Like the masters were scattered everywhere.

280
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,080
Frank Marshall, Hollywood power player, helped finish it.

281
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,680
He was one of his first jobs, was a production manager,

282
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,360
and he's even on camera in the movie.

283
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,520
Margaritaville power player.

284
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,360
Margaritaville, Jimmy Buffett's best friend.

285
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,120
Jimmy Buffett's best friend, always on tour with Jimmy.

286
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,840
His wife is heading up Lucasfilm, he's off hanging out,

287
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,240
drinking a margarita and watching the same setlist

288
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,120
every night, but it's great, honestly.

289
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,960
It sounds like a great life.

290
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,280
Brown Eyed Girl only gets better.

291
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,360
Yeah, with, hey, you know the steel drums you put

292
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,080
on the Brown Eyed Girl in the night sounded great, Jimmy.

293
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,360
Hell yeah, they did.

294
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,800
And then that's like his every night, essentially.

295
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,840
Sure.

296
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,400
Probably fist bump, hug it out.

297
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,520
Yeah, hug it out.

298
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,320
Yeah, so that was able, they were able to piece that

299
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,760
all together with what Orson had already edited

300
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,880
and script notes to cut it together as a miracle

301
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,880
because the ending to The Magnificent,

302
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,680
Ambersons was just thrown in a furnace.

303
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,760
Like Howard Hughes, which is like the actual,

304
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,880
his ideal ending, they recut it,

305
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,560
and it got taken away from Wells.

306
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,480
But people always think, maybe one day,

307
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,840
maybe one day we'll find it,

308
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,560
the canister's a film in a vault,

309
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,120
but it's also possible that died in a fire,

310
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,520
or Howard Hughes was just like,

311
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,240
no, throw it out, just burn it.

312
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,240
Right, right.

313
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,920
Or I come at it from the Beach Boys angle

314
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,360
where Brian Wilson wanted to not, you know,

315
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,000
he tried to destroy the smile tapes,

316
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,680
and then he came around on it eventually,

317
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,480
and thank God they weren't all destroyed,

318
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,560
or we couldn't have pieced together

319
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,680
this great musical artifact.

320
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,360
Do we know, are the Prince archives anywhere near

321
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,240
an amusement park?

322
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,920
That's my biggest concern.

323
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,720
I mean, they're only, they're like probably 40 miles away

324
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,800
from the Mall of America into indoor amusement parks,

325
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,640
so it'd have to be a really epic fire

326
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,920
to make it all the way to Chantousin,

327
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
or whatever the town is where.

328
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,920
Well, they've been moved, I've heard.

329
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,840
They've been all moved to Los Angeles.

330
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,280
Uh-oh. That's my understanding.

331
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,160
No, no. Is the whole archives now

332
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,000
somewhere in a climate-controlled place

333
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,520
in Los Angeles for them to. Climate control is good, okay.

334
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,720
But is it, you know. It's not the lot, is it?

335
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,560
I don't know. It's not next to earthquake.

336
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,040
I don't know, it might be the lot.

337
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,720
It might be in Buena Park next to Knott's Berry Farm.

338
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,000
I don't know where it could be,

339
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,920
but hopefully it's not near a theme park.

340
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,080
That's my concern. No, no.

341
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,000
I, oh God, it's next to, it's right next to the Flash Flood,

342
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,240
and at some point, it's like it's right,

343
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,520
it's in old Mexico, and at some point

344
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,000
that facade's gonna crack.

345
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,360
The seaplane from Waterworld is going to fly

346
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,240
right into them. It's just balsa wood, but.

347
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,800
Who would ever suspect that all the Prince Masters

348
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,560
would be under the tank where they

349
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,040
perform Waterworld every day?

350
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,440
No one will find them there.

351
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,520
That's what the Mariner is trying to protect.

352
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,600
That's what the Deacon is trying to get at.

353
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,440
He doesn't care about dry land.

354
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,480
Oh, wait a minute. Oh, precious

355
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,520
Prince Masters. He just wants the

356
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,520
DV tapes of the documentary Kevin Smith

357
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,240
shot hours and hours of like following Prince around.

358
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,360
Talking about spirituality. Yeah.

359
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,040
All right, I have the answer to the question,

360
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,960
where are the Prince archives?

361
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,680
They're at Iron Mountain.

362
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,760
Well, Iron Mountain came up in this story.

363
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,480
Iron Mountain's presented as like an important alternative,

364
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,520
and that it is, which is so crazy,

365
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,080
race to Iron Mountain.

366
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,280
You know, Iron Mountain also.

367
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,360
It's not Iron City though, which is good.

368
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,480
So we can't use those coins we got

369
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,760
when we won the Alita experience.

370
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,720
It would be better if the tapes were in Zalem.

371
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,120
We're up in the sky in Zalem.

372
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,720
Iron Mountain is also a destroying company,

373
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,160
like a shredding and like hard drive destroying company.

374
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,240
They do both.

375
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,880
There is an Iron Mountain literally across the 101

376
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,440
from Universal City Walk.

377
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,760
No, no, no. I don't know which

378
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,520
Iron Mountain Prince's archives are at.

379
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,040
They're everywhere, like big office buildings

380
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,080
use Iron Mountain. So we don't know which one.

381
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,800
So what if there's a flood of those aqua spas

382
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,000
in the Zen Zone, all that like chemical water

383
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,120
starts rushing down the hill. Very possible.

384
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,200
Yeah, or say someone's in the iFly

385
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,120
and they get shot out the top

386
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,360
and then they get flying into the archives

387
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,720
and they just destroy all of it

388
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,280
with their dead lifeless body.

389
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,200
That would be a nightmare.

390
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,040
Crash through the rain.

391
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,520
Yeah, at that point they're going 120 miles per hour

392
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,080
with such force that yeah, the original,

393
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,560
all of parade cracks in half.

394
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,160
Well, you know, Prince's, Prince,

395
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,680
there's a quote about Prince in this article,

396
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,680
it's our quote from Prince in this article,

397
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,600
which is, if you don't own your masters,

398
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,440
your master owns you.

399
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,000
All of that shit that Prince is so crazy about

400
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,240
and writing slave on his face

401
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,800
and changing his name and everything,

402
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,000
this is the kind of thing he was fighting about.

403
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,120
This is exactly what, like,

404
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,920
he was smart enough to realize that

405
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,360
and then it all got put in a vault at Paisley Park

406
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,400
and now we're all getting to experience it,

407
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,520
newly remastered, thanks to Prince being aware

408
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,560
that this could be a problem.

409
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,280
He could have left a little bit of a clear will,

410
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,440
but other than that, I think a lot of people

411
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,080
accused him of being kind of kooky in the 90s,

412
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,280
but I think on a lot of this stuff,

413
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,280
he's 100% right, artists rights, owning your masters,

414
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,120
not having to-

415
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,880
Wanting to put out albums all the time.

416
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,720
Right, you like-

417
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,040
No, only, please, Prince, only put out one,

418
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,680
like 10 songs every three years,

419
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,840
that's what the label wanted.

420
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,360
Right, so yeah, so I think that in hindsight,

421
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,240
a lot of the things he was championing were correct.

422
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,640
Yeah, and the only thing he got wrong

423
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,240
is that he thought he would live to be 120 years old.

424
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,080
Right.

425
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,900
And didn't have to make a will.

426
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,040
But he also didn't celebrate his birthday

427
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,520
because he didn't believe in birthdays.

428
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,920
Oh, so he didn't know.

429
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,200
He didn't even know how old he was.

430
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,040
So how old-

431
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,480
When he did, he thought he was 36.

432
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,840
Yeah, he thought he was 36, eternally.

433
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,280
Something like that, I think.

434
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,160
Yeah.

435
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,880
Anyway, the theme parks do factor into this story also

436
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,120
because there's one guy who essentially

437
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,760
has been whistleblowing this whole thing,

438
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,720
and who expressed his concern in 1990

439
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,360
when the plan was to put all of this

440
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,240
and aware us on the universe a lot.

441
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,360
His concerns proved to be correct when later in 1990,

442
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,600
there was a fire purposefully set

443
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,320
by a disgruntled security guard

444
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,600
that burnt down lots of things very close to this vault.

445
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,160
And then another fire in 1997.

446
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,760
And besides all of the fires,

447
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,040
he points out in the article,

448
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,440
the King Kong riot had explosions all day every day,

449
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,040
flames shooting up right next door to the vault.

450
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,880
Right.

451
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,520
It's important to note that film-making technology

452
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,280
has never figured out a way to perfect lighting

453
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,280
other than very hot lights on top of very flimsy poles.

454
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,640
That smoke, that like.

455
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,480
That smoke, yeah.

456
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,880
We've all been on sets where just something starts smoking

457
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,800
and then nobody's actually that alarmed.

458
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
Like, that's fine, that happens.

459
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,480
Or like the gel is too close to the light,

460
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,000
but like gel or blackout stuff,

461
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,760
like flammable material that you put right next to the light.

462
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,040
Or we've almost been like hit in the head

463
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,200
with a falling light many times.

464
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,960
Like that always happens.

465
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,240
The light is about to fall on you or someone.

466
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,240
So like, yeah, if it falls over and cracks,

467
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,400
like yeah, the fire quickly spreads.

468
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,120
It's all pretty flimsy for sure.

469
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,600
And also do you guys know how that,

470
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,600
well, I know you might not believe me,

471
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,360
but I don't know if you even know how the fire

472
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,720
supposedly started in 2008,

473
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,080
which is that there was a guy repairing the roof

474
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,920
and that gets hot enough to start a fire.

475
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,560
So they keep somebody watching it for an hour,

476
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,040
which they did, and then the people went on break

477
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,680
at four in the morning,

478
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,200
and then it caught on fire 35 minutes later.

479
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,720
It was still hot enough to start a fire,

480
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,000
even though it had been cooling for an hour and a half.

481
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,960
They watched it for like the exact amount of time.

482
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,080
Like when you jump a battery in a car

483
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,240
and they're like, drive it for 30 minutes.

484
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,560
They turn the car off at 30 minutes even.

485
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,080
That feels like a perfect alibi though.

486
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,880
It gets the workers off the hook,

487
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,040
and then it's no problem.

488
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,800
There's nothing will ever convince me

489
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,320
that it was not set on purpose

490
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,880
because of the fact of the new King Kong that got put in.

491
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,160
That's the most suspicious thing.

492
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,000
I mean, it was two months later.

493
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,200
You feel that it was so close to,

494
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,320
that they had the new Peter Jackson King Kong

495
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,480
so ready to go.

496
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,800
Yeah.

497
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,960
I mean, they waited maybe a year or something

498
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,080
to announce it officially, but they had it ready to go.

499
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,160
They had to deal with him in place.

500
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,800
Like if what other part of the tram, I don't know,

501
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,320
I guess they could have updated anything

502
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,960
that got destroyed by a fire,

503
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,080
but it seems very convenient to me

504
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,920
that they were just like, yeah, we'll put the new King Kong,

505
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,320
that thing that we've made a deal about already.

506
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,880
Like, let's just do that.

507
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,920
There was a recent release of theirs

508
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,720
and they didn't know it was a King Kong,

509
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,680
it was a license before I think.

510
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,720
Right, it just seems very convenient is all I'm saying.

511
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,200
Let me ask you guys,

512
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,920
how quickly after the fire did you go to Universal?

513
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,080
Very quickly.

514
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,120
Cause I was there the next day.

515
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,440
The fire was on a Sunday.

516
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,920
I was there on Monday doing runs

517
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,360
cause the production company we were working for at the time

518
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,680
had a bungalow and then one of those little temporary

519
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,680
kind of office trailers next to the smoldering wreckage.

520
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,800
I was looking at like ET hazmat suit guys

521
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,640
who sorting through flaming wreckage

522
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,800
and everyone just had the windows open

523
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,040
and the fans going like, oh, the smell is terrible.

524
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,080
And I'm like, what are we breathing in?

525
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,880
How are you doing accounting here?

526
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,760
Like I'm getting the fuck out of here as quick as I can.

527
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
Yeah, yeah.

528
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,520
I mean, I was there that day.

529
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,920
I went because I wasn't supposed to work that day

530
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,640
but I was still on the schedule as a tour guide

531
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,040
and somebody called me and said, put on the news.

532
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,160
And I said, which channel?

533
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,800
He said, any channel.

534
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,600
Put it on, raging fire.

535
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,760
Or like I drove down as quick as I could.

536
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,880
I came running to the fire.

537
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,240
The ghoul that I am.

538
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,200
And I watched it from the balcony

539
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,720
where there was an unbelievable view.

540
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,680
But now I'm adding up that I was from there breathing up

541
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,920
a lot of toxic fumes.

542
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:05,400
And I now realize that I breathed Etta James at last.

543
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,480
Etta James at last went through my lungs

544
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,720
and I'm going to die of cancer

545
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,280
because Etta James at last was in my body.

546
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,560
They'll be doing some sort of scan

547
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,720
and they'll be like little vibrate.

548
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,320
They'll be able to hear it a little bit in the machines.

549
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,560
He's gone but there's a lovely tune playing.

550
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,880
The last remnant of the song, Left With Scott's Soul.

551
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,240
Yeah.

552
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,080
That what year was it?

553
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,240
2008.

554
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,080
2008.

555
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,640
So I was a PA nearby Warner Brothers at the ranch

556
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,400
and I remember seeing it, I'm pretty sure from,

557
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,880
I think, what was it a weekday?

558
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,840
Yeah, I could see the smoke.

559
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,680
Was it a weekday?

560
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,520
I think I saw it.

561
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,360
It was a Sunday, I think.

562
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,560
There were a lot of fighters that year.

563
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,920
So I'm trying to remember if that was one of the fighters

564
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,880
I saw from there but I could have easily seen it

565
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,280
because it was so close there.

566
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,080
But then we went very quickly on the tram tour.

567
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,920
Anyway.

568
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,960
Absolutely insane.

569
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,800
I highly recommend this article

570
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,520
which describes the incident as the biggest disaster

571
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,280
in the history of the music business.

572
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,080
Universal Music Group is going to get sued

573
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,160
into the ground now.

574
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,640
Sued by the states and management houses

575
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,360
and record label like sued out the eyes.

576
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,960
And apparently there were three artists,

577
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,280
Joni Mitchell, Sting and Peter Frampton

578
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,080
who all put in the request to have the masters

579
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,080
enough time had passed and legally the masters

580
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,440
could revert back to them and they could have them

581
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,200
physically now and due to bureaucracy and red tape

582
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,000
they never got it.

583
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,200
Those three can fuck Universal up.

584
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,040
Wow.

585
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,880
It's great.

586
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,120
That is an insane problem.

587
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,280
When a client wants masters, dailies,

588
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,320
that sort of stuff back, then the company

589
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,880
has to go through, catalog everything in the system,

590
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,280
print it out, start giving that out

591
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,200
and then you have to find it all in the physical facility,

592
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,920
box it up, catalog it again to make sure you got it

593
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,120
and then send it at like, it's insane.

594
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,960
That's a lot to do.

595
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,800
Yeah.

596
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,000
Okay, you know the wins and outs of the post.

597
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,440
And there was tons of this stuff that just wasn't labeled.

598
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,840
Nobody knew where it was if they wanted to start

599
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,680
looking for it.

600
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,500
No, of course not.

601
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,340
If stuff is coming right from a recording studio

602
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,920
or coming right from set, people are writing

603
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,200
grease pencil or scratchy notes and just shoving it

604
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,600
in a box and sending it to the lot.

605
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,640
Barely remembering to say what the hell it even was.

606
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,360
So this thing is so insane and if I could tie

607
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,280
everything together to really add insult to injury,

608
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,720
the biggest revelation of the article has to be that

609
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,440
in every show of Backdraft, the initial fire

610
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,120
was sparked by a rare blues master.

611
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,200
Every single time that Backdraft ran,

612
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,040
30 times a day, they burnt through the entire

613
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,160
Howlin' Wolf catalog on a single labor day in 1983

614
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,220
and it's just, it's hateful.

615
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,060
Ooh, man.

616
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,280
That is not rough.

617
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,600
That's not, it's learned from mistakes of the past.

618
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,600
But anyway, in 2008, the purposeful fires of Backdraft

619
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,960
still raging not very far away from down on the lower lot.

620
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,040
If you aren't super familiar with Universal Studios

621
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,000
or its history, it's where the Transformers ride is today.

622
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,400
And yeah, Backdraft.

623
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,880
Backdraft, I saw a clip of an old commercial

624
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,240
that was promoting, like if you've been to Universal

625
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,480
in a while, come check this out.

626
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,080
And it was guys in prison.

627
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,920
Like it was like, hey, I bet you haven't been

628
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,760
to Universal in a while and they're like, no, I've been busy.

629
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,200
And it's like, you gotta come check out Backdraft.

630
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:41,280
And I think, did the Trantor also briefly load

631
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,960
from the lower lot for a while?

632
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,800
Do you remember that?

633
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,160
It did before Jurassic Park, it did.

634
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,800
Yeah, yeah, that was all done.

635
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,600
So that was all sort of what they were plugging.

636
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
And Lucy attributes, guys.

637
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,440
Oh, and Lucy attributes.

638
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,600
Lower lot has to be, this was the new land of its time

639
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,420
before Galaxy's Edge.

640
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,480
All of that in one place.

641
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,240
Oh my God. The Starway.

642
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,480
Yes, and the Starway.

643
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,120
A miraculous theme park invention

644
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,760
of three or four escalators in a row.

645
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,600
It feels like eight escalators.

646
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,880
It feels a lot crazy.

647
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,720
Is it four?

648
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,000
I think it's more than five, maybe five.

649
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,840
Well, we'll find that out.

650
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,200
That'll be one of the pieces of info

651
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,560
in the eventual Starway episode.

652
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,960
That's a perfect second gate to me.

653
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,360
Full things you have to travel, is it four?

654
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,640
One, two, three, four?

655
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,720
That sounds right.

656
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,280
I mean, the first one is like an overlook.

657
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,360
Universal Studios Hollywood has to do

658
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,480
a little more of the LA, the magic of the movie,

659
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,520
sort of like.

660
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,360
And it's in a scenic spot,

661
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,480
so there's a spot just for pictures.

662
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,200
Wait, and only recently is it four?

663
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,200
That's interesting.

664
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,360
What was it?

665
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,880
They only added a, oh no, I'm sorry,

666
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,080
they added a fourth row.

667
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,560
I'm talking horizontally.

668
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,400
Yeah, they widened it.

669
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,240
It's interesting.

670
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,160
I'm not sure how many long ways there are.

671
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,680
They never try, I wonder if they ever did the math on,

672
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,160
could we build, I guess it wouldn't be a monorail,

673
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,200
it would probably be a funicular,

674
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,960
like at a Grand Budapest Hotel,

675
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,680
or an angel's flight in Los Angeles.

676
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,040
A funicular goes down a slanted hill.

677
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,360
Well, I've always wondered, will they try to do,

678
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,840
will the Harry Potter train suddenly become a,

679
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,040
what's the word, funicular?

680
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,200
Funicular, yeah.

681
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,120
I think they can turn it into a funicular.

682
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,960
I mean, that would be a very gradual, that'd be great.

683
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,440
That would be perfect.

684
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,680
Make it an angel's flight.

685
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,520
Sure.

686
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,480
Do we have an answer?

687
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,040
It looks like four from this picture.

688
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,640
It's only four, they're so long.

689
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,000
That's why I'm saying it feels like eight,

690
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,480
but I think it's like four.

691
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,320
Now I can't stop thinking about a Starway episode.

692
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,160
Yeah, yeah.

693
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,360
Oh yeah.

694
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,920
Let's just go straight into the head from this.

695
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,760
Yeah, sure.

696
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,600
Well, because if we can find all the loops.

697
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,480
Starway, Father of the Pride, summer is heating up.

698
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,320
As you hear this.

699
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,280
And Lucy, Lucy Attribute.

700
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,560
Oh, well that's my white whale.

701
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,360
Haven't listened to podcast the ride in a while.

702
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,320
But here's what you're missing out on, Starway episode.

703
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,000
Lucy Attribute.

704
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,080
Sounds good, I'm gonna bust outta here.

705
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,160
I'm bustin' outta Sing Sing.

706
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,520
We start at Star Wars Galaxy's Edge in the summer

707
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,160
and we end with Lucy Attribute.

708
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,360
Lucy Attribute.

709
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,320
And our ratings plummet.

710
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,000
But praise from my mother goes skyrocketing.

711
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,960
She's so happy with that episode.

712
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,520
Praise is always high with her as long as you don't swear.

713
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,880
Yeah, that's true.

714
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,720
That's really what it depends on.

715
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,440
Yeah, that's really what the main thing is.

716
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,240
Or something about the Lord.

717
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,480
So, Fact Draft, a pretty big movie of its time.

718
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:48,480
The number 14 top grossing movies, 1991,

719
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,120
made about, in America made about 78 million.

720
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,520
Internationally brought it up to 150 million.

721
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,280
Did pretty good.

722
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,240
But they were a little disappointed, it felt like.

723
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,080
They were a little disappointed.

724
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,920
They wanted it to be a massive one.

725
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,320
Because it is like Kurt Russell and Ron Howard directing.

726
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,960
Robert De Niro's in it and Donald Sutherland.

727
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,800
Scott Glenn.

728
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,640
Scott Glenn.

729
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,480
Oh gosh.

730
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,160
Glenn fans out.

731
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,400
I mean, it's a weird level of hit.

732
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,720
Certainly a hit, but weird that.

733
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,280
I wonder if it, what's the actual ratio

734
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:22,240
of least box office success to theme park attraction

735
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,120
and like long running, their length of the ride being open.

736
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,320
Well, 1991 was a big year for movies.

737
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,840
Terminator 2, Judgment Day.

738
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,120
Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, number two that year.

739
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,040
Beauty and the Beast, Silence of the Lambs,

740
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,840
City Slickers Hook, The Addams Family,

741
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,800
Sleeping with the Enemy, Father of the Bride,

742
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,760
Naked, number 10, Naked Gun, two and a half,

743
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,520
The Smell of Fear, number 10.

744
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,360
Wow.

745
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,200
Wow.

746
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,160
In domestic receipts that year.

747
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,200
Now, with that guy who's on Twitter now.

748
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,320
Oh yeah.

749
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,080
I think the third lead of Naked Gun, I forget his name,

750
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,200
but he just joined Twitter and people seem oddly agitated.

751
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,040
Oh right, right.

752
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,880
I did hear about him.

753
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,360
I forget who, now George, is that George Kennedy?

754
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,400
No, he passed away.

755
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,240
I forget, I don't know.

756
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,080
I'll look it up later.

757
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,480
Was that also Scott Glenn?

758
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,960
I think it's also Scott Glenn.

759
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,400
Scott Glenn is on Twitter now.

760
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:18,120
That's already so twisted up about Scott Glenn's Twitter.

761
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,200
So kind of, it reminded me, thinking about this

762
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,360
and reading about Backtrack,

763
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,120
which I don't think I've ever seen all the way through.

764
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,720
I think it's one I've seen bits and pieces of on cable.

765
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,920
Not seen it.

766
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,400
Not seen it, yeah.

767
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,560
It seems like that type of movie where they're like,

768
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,320
oh they don't make movies like that anymore.

769
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,360
They don't make movies for adults anymore.

770
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,360
Sure, well a lot of what was on your list,

771
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,480
I feel that way about it.

772
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,320
Yes.

773
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,000
Those are all, that's when movies worked

774
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,680
and how much of that was original.

775
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,000
So not a lot of franchise in there.

776
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,840
They could gun franchise.

777
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,360
I guess Kate Fear was a remake,

778
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,520
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2, Star Trek 4.

779
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,360
I guess so, yeah.

780
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,360
But JFK, Hotshots, Prince of Tides.

781
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,960
Do you consider JFK based on IP in a way?

782
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,440
JFK IP?

783
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,280
Yes, I do.

784
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,120
Okay.

785
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,360
Yeah, for sure.

786
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,680
The mental real estate of assassination.

787
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,440
Yeah, but not an earth shattering hit.

788
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,240
I mean, you're not gonna take down T2.

789
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,080
It took them a few more years to get those rights

790
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,000
to make a ride.

791
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,280
Also something that I feel like,

792
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,000
I didn't see it and maybe I'm wrong and biased.

793
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,360
This doesn't feel like one that lasted very long.

794
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,440
It didn't feel like Apollo 13 or something

795
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,720
where I felt like, people thought of that movie.

796
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,560
I feel like no one thought of this after a few years.

797
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,560
Maybe that's totally wrong.

798
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,080
Like a match that you ignite and burns out very quickly?

799
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,400
And it goes out very quickly, yes.

800
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,480
Yeah, okay.

801
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,520
Maybe I'm wrong.

802
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,400
Once you're seduced by the flame.

803
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,640
Yeah, I wouldn't disagree with that.

804
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,480
I think that sounds right.

805
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,480
I think it looms, any looming that Backdraft has

806
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,480
is due to the attraction, I would think.

807
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,520
Although, now once again,

808
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,720
we picked this topic pretty randomly a couple days ago,

809
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,200
but strangely, A, there was the fire tie-in that we covered,

810
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,480
but also, y'all know about Backdraft 2, right?

811
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,120
Scott, I'm so glad you wrote on Backdraft 2.

812
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,800
We've all not said it yet,

813
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,880
but we all know we learned about Backdraft 2

814
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,000
in the last 24 to 48 hours.

815
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,480
I was almost done my research,

816
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,400
and I was like, let me just look at the Wikipedia

817
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,360
for the movie, not the ride,

818
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,600
to just go over it all once again,

819
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,880
just to make sure I didn't miss anything.

820
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,160
And I opened up another 45 minutes

821
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,520
of learning about Backdraft 2.

822
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,480
Well, we should say when Backdraft 2 came out.

823
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,240
A month and a half ago.

824
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,080
A month ago.

825
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,440
What in the world?

826
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,960
How is it that the day we think of Backdraft,

827
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,280
there's oddly the current things.

828
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,680
Surely they didn't get anyone from the original cast back.

829
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,200
They're all too busy, right?

830
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,440
You're Kurt Russell's, he's got plenty to do,

831
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,280
and I don't suppose.

832
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,560
Wait, I'm sorry, I was wrong.

833
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,000
They got William Baldwin and Donald Sutherland

834
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,880
to reprise the characters.

835
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,200
What two members of great acting lineages

836
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,440
lending their valued names to this franchise again.

837
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,280
I didn't actually learn this.

838
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,080
Where is this available?

839
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,560
It's on Blu-ray DVD.

840
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,720
It's on demand.

841
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,960
You can get it, and it's Universal produced.

842
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,880
This isn't someone bought the rights.

843
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,480
Universal put this out.

844
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,960
Billy Baldwin plays his character from the movie,

845
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,520
and the main character is the son

846
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,720
of Kurt Russell's firefighter character,

847
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,440
who passes away in the first one,

848
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,280
and there's lots of mention of his wife and son.

849
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,200
His wife, I gotta get you.

850
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,080
It's too dangerous being around you.

851
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,800
All you care about is, you're too reckless,

852
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,720
so all you care about is fights.

853
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,360
Sean, I think that's the son's name.

854
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,960
I can't have Sean around you all the time.

855
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,160
And Sean's all grown up and is also an arson investigator.

856
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,880
Wow, wow. Like his father

857
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,960
and grandfather, because Kurt Russell plays

858
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,960
Kurt Russell's character's father in the first movie.

859
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,480
It's a multi-generation?

860
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,160
It's multi-generational, and Billy Baldwin is the brother,

861
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,520
so the new character's uncle.

862
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,320
And it goes all the way back into time,

863
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,000
and eventually that ancestral line

864
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,320
fought the first fire ever set by man.

865
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,760
They had to fight the fire,

866
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,280
the cow that kicked over the lantern

867
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,120
that started to chow down.

868
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,760
Mrs. O'Leary's cow.

869
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,320
Mrs. O'Leary's fucking cow.

870
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,520
Backdraft 2 available on Netflix for streaming right now.

871
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,000
Oh boy, oh, we got a lot to do.

872
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,160
We really should watch that.

873
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,720
And it's also, it's universal and imagined.

874
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,560
Oh. Yeah.

875
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,360
As is Kindergarten Cop 2,

876
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,840
which I unfortunately rented on a lark

877
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,760
from a video store not that long ago,

878
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,520
and discovered that it is a big anti-PC tirade.

879
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,800
It's a movie where Dolph Lundgren gets to show

880
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,600
that he's mad that kids have peanut allergies,

881
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,360
and why don't they just like shut the fuck up

882
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,440
and get over it?

883
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,400
Eat the damn peanut butter.

884
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,120
Isn't that what all dads wanna say

885
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,080
to their children who have a legitimate syndrome

886
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,920
and a thing they can't.

887
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,760
Yeah, force them to eat.

888
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,920
That they did not choose to have.

889
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,600
These little wimps.

890
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,600
These snowflakes.

891
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,960
Eat the peanut butter.

892
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,840
Is there anyone from the original movie in that?

893
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,200
I don't think so.

894
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,880
The grown kid.

895
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,560
Yeah, the famous kids.

896
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,520
Yeah, what do the kids even say?

897
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,320
I don't know.

898
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,600
Kindergarten Cop's not coming to me.

899
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,240
I wonder, are there more of these weird 90s movies

900
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,360
that were like kind of hits that all of a sudden

901
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,640
are quietly just being sequelized on Netflix?

902
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,480
Oh.

903
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,320
They mean there have to be.

904
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,160
There have to be.

905
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:44,980
Yeah, there have to be.

906
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,820
This snuck by us.

907
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,660
We didn't even know.

908
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,480
We wouldn't know if we weren't doing this topic.

909
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,320
Yeah.

910
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,440
We might get them a lot of their box office.

911
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,280
Right.

912
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,240
Most people are going to log on to see this now

913
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,600
because of us.

914
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,840
We should get a commission check.

915
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,400
So the screenwriter of the first back draft,

916
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,520
Gregory Wilden.

917
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,280
Wilden.

918
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,120
Named checked in the ride by Ron Hark.

919
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,360
Named checked in the ride is a former firefighter.

920
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,760
I didn't realize he also wrote Highlander.

921
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,600
Yeah.

922
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,200
And The Prophecy, the Christopher Walken movie,

923
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,400
The Prophecy.

924
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,680
Wow.

925
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,520
Wow.

926
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,480
And he wrote the sequel, right?

927
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,680
For back draft too?

928
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,520
Yes.

929
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,360
He did write the sequel, okay.

930
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,180
Uh-huh.

931
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,120
There's so much original crew.

932
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,960
Yeah.

933
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,400
It's kind of as close as you could come to a sequel.

934
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,240
Yeah.

935
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,280
Do you think Ron at least sent flowers or anything?

936
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:34,880
Ron seems like a nice guy.

937
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,120
He seems like he would have done something,

938
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,760
a token of some like, hey, great job.

939
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,600
Yeah.

940
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,760
Box of cupcakes or something.

941
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,600
Cupcakes.

942
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,440
Yeah, maybe.

943
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,280
Well, and it's imagined.

944
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,100
So he is like.

945
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:45,940
He had to know.

946
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,780
Yeah, yeah.

947
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,620
Check, yeah.

948
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,720
He might've gotten an email.

949
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,920
Hanging him.

950
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,760
Wilden said it specifically.

951
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,240
While he was trying to make solo work,

952
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,240
he was like an email, like, we're doing back draft too.

953
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,080
Okay, sure.

954
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,920
Fine, fine.

955
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,760
Great, send.

956
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,600
All right, back to figuring this out.

957
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,760
So Alden, here's what a merc is.

958
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,600
Um.

959
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,420
Um.

960
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,260
Um.

961
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,100
Um.

962
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,920
Um.

963
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,760
Um.

964
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,360
It's a terrible way to keep, to refer to Star Wars fans

965
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,760
who are keeping the faith, Scott.

966
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,260
You can call them marks.

967
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,200
Different marks, different marks.

968
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,780
They refer, original back drafts, music by Hans Zimmer.

969
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,080
Yes.

970
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,900
Interesting, yeah.

971
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,880
And one of, an early score of him.

972
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,320
And I actually wanted to point out,

973
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,520
I haven't pulled up on Spotify.

974
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,220
I didn't realize till re-watching this

975
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,820
that this music cue that has loomed in my head,

976
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,580
I didn't realize is from back draft

977
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,980
and is used in the ride.

978
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,500
And you see, this will see,

979
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,880
like hopefully seem familiar to you guys,

980
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,500
maybe even outside of back draft here really quick.

981
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,340
Whoop.

982
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,680
["Spring Day"]

983
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,060
Oh yeah.

984
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:58,140
That's you, that's every universal area music's

985
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,540
fireworks show like that is played.

986
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,660
I remember it from, I associated with,

987
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,180
I think they used it in ads for The Lost World.

988
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,900
Like in my mind that cue,

989
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,900
because it's still a little haunting to me

990
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,360
and it reminds me of like watching a T-Rex run.

991
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,200
I think they used,

992
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,420
I think they repurposed it for a lot of other stuff.

993
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,300
The other song like that, that gets used,

994
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,340
I feel like maybe Disney and Universal is actually,

995
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,140
I forget what it's called, but it's from Dragon Heart.

996
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,300
It's like a very stirring orchestral thing.

997
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,120
Yeah.

998
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,680
It's just used everywhere in theme parks.

999
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,640
It is outlived Dragon Heart by like decades.

1000
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,040
I think there was a video you could play on the tour

1001
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,800
that had, yeah, that was whatever that Dragon Heart theme is.

1002
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,880
It's an interesting genre,

1003
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,240
the music that outlives the movie.

1004
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,800
It doesn't outlive it because people like this movie,

1005
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:52,320
but I know Hook is like, that score is so well regarded.

1006
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,160
Right.

1007
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:53,980
Oh yeah.

1008
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,760
Isn't like the American president,

1009
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,600
don't people, they feel like they use that all the time.

1010
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,960
Soarin' maybe, is that the American president they use?

1011
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,200
There's something like some older, not that old,

1012
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,040
but like movie in the Soarin' queue.

1013
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,920
I think the theme from the Warped Rites stuff

1014
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,040
shows up in a few attractions.

1015
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,880
Yeah, absolutely.

1016
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,720
Right, right.

1017
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,320
But especially, oh, there's a website,

1018
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,640
I just saw they released some compilation.

1019
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,400
I think it's like the Epcot Legacy Project

1020
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,920
put some playlists together

1021
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,180
that you could stream on their site

1022
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:27,180
of the different entry loops for MGM studios.

1023
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:31,060
And they would use a lot of classic movie stuff.

1024
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,740
Not all Disney either.

1025
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:37,740
Like a lot of classic movie songs in this style mixed in.

1026
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,540
Sure, did they play that Alan Thicke puttin' on the Ritz?

1027
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,140
Oh, if only.

1028
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,220
The masters of that weren't burned up in any fire,

1029
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,300
were they?

1030
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,380
Because we need to preserve that.

1031
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,860
They were and I did it.

1032
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,540
Oh no. Sorry.

1033
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,380
Had we done it.

1034
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,340
That's fine, I'm not actually that upset about it.

1035
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,180
She also know Hans Zimmer was,

1036
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,180
I didn't know Hans Zimmer was associated with The Buggles

1037
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:05,020
and appears in the video for Video Killed the Radio Star.

1038
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:05,860
Wow, really?

1039
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,900
Yeah, the first music video.

1040
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,060
Little known trivia,

1041
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,420
I don't know if anyone's ever said this trivia

1042
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,660
that Video Killed the Radio Star

1043
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,660
is the first music video ever played on MTV.

1044
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,860
But I do like that song and he's in the video.

1045
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,780
Hans Zimmer in the first video ever played.

1046
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,280
He wasn't in the band though.

1047
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,460
I mean, he may have not been an official bugle.

1048
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,380
He was bugle, he's like Billy Preston in The Beatles.

1049
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,180
Right, he was the fifth bugle.

1050
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,020
The fifth bugle.

1051
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:32,860
Hans Zimmer.

1052
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,180
It's a lot of discussion of who's the fifth beetle

1053
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,820
but nobody pays attention to the fifth bugle a lot.

1054
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,660
Interesting.

1055
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,260
The fifth bugle is you, all the bugle heads out there.

1056
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,380
Thanks for the one hit.

1057
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,220
That's...

1058
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,380
Yeah, so Backdraft.

1059
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,620
What else about Backdraft?

1060
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,460
As a kid, I didn't get to watch

1061
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,940
R-rated movies as a child.

1062
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,900
I'm sure I've talked about it before.

1063
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,020
I was so scared, I don't even think I was like,

1064
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,980
felt like I was missing anything until like the mid-90s

1065
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,220
or whatever.

1066
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,500
But my friend Luke was like a big,

1067
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,780
I feel like his family watched Backdraft a lot.

1068
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:10,140
I feel like he would talk about Backdraft.

1069
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,620
They would watch like all these,

1070
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,220
everything that was on, like they'd watch Empty Nest

1071
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,540
and he'd be like a six or seven year old

1072
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,380
and talking about Empty Nest on TV.

1073
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,220
And I was like, I don't know,

1074
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,420
I don't have any context for this at all.

1075
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:26,420
So like that was my only time I'd ever hear about Backdraft.

1076
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,660
He would talk about watching like the VHS

1077
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:33,180
for the taped off of WGN Backdraft that his dad had.

1078
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,060
I'll say this, I do not,

1079
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:39,060
especially as a kid, I did not like man versus nature movies.

1080
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,260
Cause like, what do you do?

1081
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:44,140
You fight, heroes fight it.

1082
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,100
That's what happens.

1083
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,700
I think a lot of kids entertainment

1084
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,940
in the late 80s, early 90s were like,

1085
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,940
here's how you stop a bad guy with a gun,

1086
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:55,900
like with a zapper or like the Ghostbusters proton pack

1087
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,100
or swords, a lot of swords in kids entertainment.

1088
00:41:59,100 --> 00:41:59,940
And as a kid, I think-

1089
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,900
In some cases, that's true.

1090
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,140
Most of you stop a ghost.

1091
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,500
Sure, I think as a kid, I was like,

1092
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,940
well, you can't stop with a gun or a sword.

1093
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,780
So what do you do if there's like a tidal wave?

1094
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,780
Like what, how fast can you run or drive away from it?

1095
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,620
Like-

1096
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,260
You could try to fire into the,

1097
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,180
you could try to shoot bullets at the fire

1098
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,180
and see if that doesn't even-

1099
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,740
Yeah, even as I got older,

1100
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:23,900
I was like that summer of the meteor Armageddon

1101
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,740
deep impact, I was like, I'm not seeing,

1102
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,740
I don't wanna see these.

1103
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,580
Like, I don't-

1104
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,780
Oh, so even back then, even at that point you were scared.

1105
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,580
Cause then I was all in on like these types of movies.

1106
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,340
I think I saw the TV cut of Dante's Peak

1107
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,380
where they were like in the boat,

1108
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,500
going across the lake that was melting like someone.

1109
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,500
And I was just like, this still sucks.

1110
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,820
Like I still hate this.

1111
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,300
Did you see Independence Day?

1112
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,740
I saw that on VHS.

1113
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,700
You could see that was a clear enemy.

1114
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,820
That was a clear, that was aliens.

1115
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,300
Man versus aliens.

1116
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,340
But isn't Armageddon 98 or is it 97?

1117
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:00,700
You know, I was real good at worrying at all ages, Michael.

1118
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,580
So Armageddon, really?

1119
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,820
And that's very interesting to me.

1120
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,460
Cause at Armageddon, at that point I was still like,

1121
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,740
it's PG-13 movie you'd go see with a couple friends

1122
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,260
in the summer, like it was a big event.

1123
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,020
Do you have the same experience or no?

1124
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,420
I didn't see Armageddon in a group, no.

1125
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,260
Oh, okay.

1126
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,100
I felt like there was a-

1127
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,100
I missed out.

1128
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,260
That would have been a blast.

1129
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,820
I felt like that was a time,

1130
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:22,660
like that was in the zone of like summer movies.

1131
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,780
I saw it on VHS when it came out.

1132
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,620
Okay.

1133
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,460
But you were too scared.

1134
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,060
You were freaked out by the army.

1135
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,820
I think I was kind of indifferent.

1136
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,220
I mean, I don't think I was like,

1137
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,980
oh right, Ben Affleck and Bruce Will.

1138
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,100
Like I don't think I was a super fan

1139
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,500
of either of them at the time.

1140
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,820
I mean, I don't think I was a super fan

1141
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,660
of either of them either.

1142
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:38,500
I think I was just like-

1143
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,820
You were chasing Amy Head at 12?

1144
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,980
No, no, a few more years before I entered the view

1145
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,700
of Scootiverse. I could appreciate it.

1146
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,860
Interesting.

1147
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,300
This is an interesting existential.

1148
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:52,700
You like if a problem can be solved in a solution.

1149
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:57,060
Though, I mean, if you view Deep Impact or Armageddon,

1150
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:59,100
Armageddon, they do solve the ish.

1151
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,060
They do go plant bombs and blow it up.

1152
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,100
I guess that one a little better.

1153
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,340
It's just how do we live in a post-Asteroid world.

1154
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:10,580
Yeah, but like the rock is bad guys.

1155
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,580
He just killed the bad guys.

1156
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:15,060
Okay, then Jurassic Park.

1157
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,820
That's a tough one because they,

1158
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:21,460
Jurassic Park, like the video game,

1159
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,220
like the arcade games, I was like,

1160
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,460
okay, let's shoot these dinosaurs.

1161
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:30,220
But the movies, they were like very not into killing

1162
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,820
the dinosaurs because they were trying to protect them,

1163
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:36,420
but also run away from them.

1164
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,260
But like did that freak you?

1165
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,100
Because I didn't see-

1166
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,580
That's man versus animal, not man versus nature though.

1167
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,300
Okay, I see the distinction.

1168
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,140
I feel like-

1169
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,300
I didn't see that in the theater.

1170
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,940
I was I think too intense for me at that age.

1171
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:51,300
But then I saw it later on tape and I liked it,

1172
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,780
but I was scared of it.

1173
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:55,960
But do you consider is Jurassic Park a man problem

1174
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,820
or a nature problem?

1175
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,460
It's a fine line because man created nature

1176
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,480
that started acting like nature.

1177
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,460
So where does that fall in this issue umbrella?

1178
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,140
Woman inherits the earth.

1179
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,180
Herets the earth.

1180
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:15,460
I did see Lost World opening weekend.

1181
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,820
I remember seeing that.

1182
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:17,660
Okay.

1183
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:18,500
It was like-

1184
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,420
We saw it too and we goofed on it the whole time.

1185
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,260
That's one of the first-

1186
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,100
I'm still enjoying it.

1187
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,380
One of the first memories I have of like,

1188
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,860
just being like, we're funny,

1189
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,900
and like we're better than this movie.

1190
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,180
Like we're cool.

1191
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,140
We were down the shore, we were in Jersey

1192
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:34,340
and like rainy at the beach.

1193
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:37,860
You're like just so thankful a good movie is out.

1194
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,380
Sure.

1195
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:40,940
Because you want to be out here like-

1196
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,740
You started staring in the distance when you said that.

1197
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,420
Everything, I mean maybe,

1198
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,020
I'm sure it's better now with phones

1199
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,220
and streaming media and stuff,

1200
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,140
but like at the time it was like,

1201
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,220
oh fuck it's raining out.

1202
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,780
We're not going to the beach.

1203
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,100
Most of the boardwalk shuts down.

1204
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:55,940
Nature.

1205
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,780
You can't shoot at the rain and make it go away.

1206
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,620
No.

1207
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,540
Or sword or throw or take a sword to it.

1208
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:05,020
You stand in the rain while you're waiting to buy

1209
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,740
the ticket at the one movie theater on a boardwalk.

1210
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:08,580
So you wouldn't like,

1211
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,380
you didn't like the movie Hard Rain.

1212
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,860
I don't think I've ever seen that.

1213
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,300
Okay.

1214
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,740
That's the movie from within Bowfinger?

1215
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,580
Or that's Chummy Wings?

1216
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,540
No, that's Hard Rain is a real-

1217
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,940
No, I know.

1218
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,180
Christian Slater.

1219
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,020
Yeah, is that right?

1220
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:23,860
I think so.

1221
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,340
Yeah, Randy Quaid, yeah.

1222
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:27,420
98, so right around the same time.

1223
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,100
Wow, Randy Quaid and Christian Slater.

1224
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,780
Were the stars of films.

1225
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,060
And Morgan Freeman.

1226
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:34,780
Freeman makes sense.

1227
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:36,940
Mini Driver, Ed Asner.

1228
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:37,860
Wow.

1229
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:38,700
What a-

1230
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,520
That's our podcast, right?

1231
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,360
Pick of the week.

1232
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,940
Pick of the week, Hard Rain.

1233
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,340
And Hard Rain 2 coming soon on Netflix.

1234
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,860
Coming soon.

1235
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:46,860
Everyone is back.

1236
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:47,700
It's all of them.

1237
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,180
They're all of you.

1238
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:53,420
If I could say my childhood feelings about the elements

1239
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:57,620
and fire specifically, I was terrified of fire.

1240
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,340
I was terrified of this attraction.

1241
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,660
And I don't think wrong, Felisa.

1242
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,660
Sometimes we bring up things where it's like,

1243
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:03,940
you were afraid of that as a kid.

1244
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,700
This thing was very scary to be in.

1245
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,060
And I think I did it pretty young.

1246
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,820
And hey, look what happened.

1247
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:12,380
They did have to set the sprinklers on people

1248
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:13,660
and the thing caught on fire.

1249
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,060
So it was a, I felt like a scare.

1250
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,660
And it was very hot to be in there.

1251
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,940
But I was like, yeah, my biggest fear as a kid was

1252
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:23,140
anything that mattered to me burning up.

1253
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:26,320
And I expressed my fears to my parents once

1254
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:31,320
that what if the house burns down or catches on fire?

1255
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:35,460
And they explained to me what would happen if that happened.

1256
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:39,300
Which is that they, when they moved into the house,

1257
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,820
they had a priest bless the house.

1258
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:46,540
So therefore it could not catch on fire.

1259
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:50,980
This was told to me at eight or so years old.

1260
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:51,820
I mean, I guess it can't.

1261
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:54,620
You guys are acting as if that's not true.

1262
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:55,460
Did you not have super houses?

1263
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,940
I guess it can't catch on fire lit by a demon.

1264
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:01,060
Like I think you're good on hell fire.

1265
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:01,900
Oh, okay.

1266
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:02,740
Yeah, yeah.

1267
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:03,560
But I think like.

1268
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,500
That's what I was the most concerned about

1269
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,420
was Satan himself.

1270
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:08,700
I think like a toaster oven with a fraying cord

1271
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,020
might still be like an issue.

1272
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,800
My question is, did that actually happen?

1273
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,100
That a priest came?

1274
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:16,940
Yeah.

1275
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:18,260
I wouldn't be able to put it past him.

1276
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,100
Is it possible?

1277
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:19,920
There's a lot of stuff getting blessed.

1278
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,180
And hey, you baptize a baby, why not baptize a house?

1279
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,020
Interesting.

1280
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:24,940
And is that a thing a lot of Catholics do?

1281
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:25,980
Yeah, I'm not sure.

1282
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,340
Yeah, were they telling me that?

1283
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,940
But that's my question.

1284
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,620
Is it what's the, is it just like a little,

1285
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,540
like a little fun, like not fun,

1286
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:35,660
but like a little white lie to make the child feel better

1287
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:36,740
and not feel like they're gonna die?

1288
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:39,460
I'm just imagining one of your parents with a scratch pad

1289
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:42,700
going like, okay, Bell Atlantic set up the phone.

1290
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,940
Time Warner was here, got the cable hooked up.

1291
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:49,320
Let's see, what day was Father O'Malley coming?

1292
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,300
We need to have a covered dish.

1293
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,000
Well, first off, he's doing this pro bono.

1294
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:56,820
I guess he is a priest,

1295
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:59,260
but we do need to have a covered dish ready for him.

1296
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:01,140
We haven't settled on how many Hail Marys

1297
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:04,380
it would take to properly bless the house.

1298
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,220
Wow.

1299
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,060
But one thing of chicken a la king.

1300
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:07,900
So.

1301
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:12,580
I, you know, this is a question that I would ask them.

1302
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,420
Did you actually have a priest bless the house?

1303
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:16,420
But that will lead to a line of questioning

1304
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,420
where the question goes to,

1305
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:18,980
why don't you go to church anymore?

1306
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:19,820
Oh yeah.

1307
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:22,140
So I can't, I can't exactly go down that line.

1308
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,260
So I will just have to imagine it.

1309
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,700
Yeah, I mean, there'll be a nice way

1310
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,260
for you to like trick them into answering it

1311
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:29,420
without getting into your beliefs.

1312
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:30,820
That would be somehow, like, I don't know.

1313
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:31,660
Yes.

1314
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:34,180
Well, maybe I could send a letter as the government.

1315
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,020
Yeah, that's it.

1316
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,780
Just like, can you check, like, have you, yeah,

1317
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:38,180
did you have you like, you know,

1318
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,620
replace the roof recently?

1319
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,340
Is there an asbestos issued?

1320
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:44,660
Have you gotten the house blessed by a priest since 1994?

1321
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:47,740
Because the laws, the Vatican laws changed.

1322
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,420
It has to be blessed again.

1323
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,540
It has to be renewed.

1324
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:51,380
Yeah.

1325
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:53,940
That is interesting.

1326
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,820
I'm very interested in that.

1327
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,220
I want to know the answer.

1328
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:59,820
I really do too.

1329
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:00,700
I'm very curious.

1330
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,940
And what else did that priest do?

1331
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,260
Was he, was it, did he like?

1332
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:07,460
Flood protection also, like gutter protection.

1333
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,660
Yeah, yeah, did he bless the house

1334
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,380
to protect against rust?

1335
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,860
What was the extent?

1336
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:17,700
No leaves will back up this gutter for over 30 years.

1337
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,700
May you remain sludge free.

1338
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:23,180
May your pipes not make weird noises.

1339
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,740
You may still have a child

1340
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,620
who goes into the entertainment field.

1341
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,700
So I can't do anything about that.

1342
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,940
Lord knows we've tried.

1343
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,100
I like the broke yes.

1344
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:34,020
It's father of all.

1345
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:34,860
Yeah, you're right.

1346
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:35,700
It's father of all.

1347
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,540
You existent with the name for brilliance.

1348
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:37,740
Oh, very good.

1349
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:38,940
Oh my God.

1350
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:42,100
Well, thank God our priest did not bless stage 30

1351
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,700
or back draft could not have run its show.

1352
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:45,540
Sure.

1353
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:48,900
Yeah, I mean, I saw this probably in 2006

1354
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,740
when I first went to Universal Hollywood.

1355
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:52,420
I was impressed.

1356
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:55,020
I mean, it is, it was impressive the effects.

1357
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:58,460
I would say very similar set up to the twister.

1358
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,300
Ride it out that we talked about

1359
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,940
with Mount Rogers many episodes ago.

1360
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,820
I'm gonna call it rooms of peril.

1361
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:05,940
That's my genre I'm putting on it.

1362
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:06,780
Rooms of peril is a good way.

1363
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:09,740
Increasingly scarier things until the third room,

1364
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,020
which is the most perilous of all.

1365
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:14,180
Yeah, they both have that floor drop.

1366
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,300
The floor drop always scared the crowd.

1367
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,260
It's really scary.

1368
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,020
It would scare me today, I think, if I did it.

1369
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,740
And if I've gotten the chance to do it in Osaka

1370
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:27,020
where it remains, strangely.

1371
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:29,140
I'm hoping it's still there a year from now.

1372
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:30,380
It is, of course.

1373
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,980
Even though I'm not the biggest fan of this,

1374
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,300
but I'd like to do it.

1375
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,140
It'd be such a time capsule.

1376
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,580
It seems like they went bigger in Japan

1377
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,340
as they tend to with Theme Park A Track.

1378
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,300
You enter through a firehouse facade.

1379
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,140
Yeah, yeah, right.

1380
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,700
And the first soundstage is bigger.

1381
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,820
The second soundstage is like an alleyway

1382
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:49,140
with a lighting show and a fire truck thing.

1383
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:49,980
Much better sets, yeah.

1384
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:54,020
The footage of the cast and crew is all in Japanese.

1385
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,140
Which is fun.

1386
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:59,260
That's amazing to me that it's footage of Scott Glenn

1387
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:03,700
from 1991 dubbed over in Japan in 2019.

1388
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:04,820
Yeah. Really strange.

1389
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:07,380
Scott Glenn in his massive blazer.

1390
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:08,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1391
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:09,060
His giant jacket.

1392
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:10,860
I said was he putting himself on tape

1393
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,540
to be in Night at the Roxbury?

1394
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:18,220
Is he gunning to replace Katan in his own idea?

1395
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,820
Scott Glenn is in a giant blazer

1396
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:22,260
and then Kurt Russell shows up in a fireman's jacket,

1397
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:25,460
which are large and it fits slimmer

1398
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,220
than it's got Glenn's blazer.

1399
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,180
From Kurt's firefighter jacket.

1400
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,260
Was just that broad.

1401
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,820
Yeah, and he, yeah, there's this weird movie

1402
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:36,740
where Scott Glenn talks at you

1403
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,340
and then Kurt Russell shows up

1404
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,100
and Scott like watches him pull up

1405
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,540
but they're never in the same shot.

1406
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,380
Never.

1407
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:46,340
And then it feels to me like Kurt walks exactly to

1408
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:49,900
and past where Scott Glenn was previously standing.

1409
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,180
Yeah, it doesn't.

1410
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,340
They really didn't figure out the geography of it

1411
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,700
before they, I don't know who knows what was shot first

1412
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,500
but it's a piece together.

1413
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,940
It's like Callen Hunt and Paxton in the pre-show.

1414
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:02,780
Yes.

1415
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1416
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:04,780
I mean that one's like side by side

1417
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:06,700
trying to fool you into thinking they were there.

1418
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:10,580
Wow, so that's an important component of Rooms of Peril

1419
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:14,260
is the second one has to have disconnected actors.

1420
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:15,100
Yeah.

1421
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,740
Speaking as mellow as possible.

1422
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:21,260
Scott Glenn seems so depressed in that video.

1423
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:22,100
Yeah.

1424
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,300
I'm trying to think of a pre-show video

1425
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:27,420
where somebody seems like maybe that's sad.

1426
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:31,700
Cause people, we've talked many a time about bored,

1427
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:35,180
disinterested, bad public speaker, whatever

1428
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,220
but this one's, he seems sad to me.

1429
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:38,300
He seems depressed.

1430
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,100
And it was also maybe because he was describing

1431
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:43,020
getting hurt on the set of Backdraft

1432
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,740
to prove to you that it was real.

1433
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,380
He got fucked up on the Backdraft.

1434
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,620
He got shot with that Ash-O-Matic.

1435
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,660
Yeah, they were shooting ash at everyone.

1436
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:54,220
He had what, he was the one who got lit on fire

1437
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:56,100
and it burned through to the last layer

1438
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,220
of No-Max Long underwear.

1439
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,460
It got too hot.

1440
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:00,980
I had to call cut.

1441
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:01,820
I had to call cut.

1442
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,100
That's horrifying.

1443
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,980
That story is being repeated in a theme park.

1444
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:09,580
Like it should not have gotten that close whatsoever.

1445
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:13,380
I mean, this is very much before CGI.

1446
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,260
So like a lot of fractal effects.

1447
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,940
I think that was the main, all practical effects.

1448
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:20,580
Some models, some very little models

1449
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,180
but that's still practical I guess.

1450
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,180
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

1451
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,420
The possibility of somebody getting hurt.

1452
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:28,060
If then, if the story kept going and Scott Glenn said,

1453
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:31,460
and I did lose a leg that day

1454
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:35,980
and then he lifts his big thick pant leg

1455
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:39,060
and just shows the metal leg underneath.

1456
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:42,380
Enjoy your day at Universal Studios Hollywood.

1457
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,220
You guys have fun

1458
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,300
but know that people are really suffering out there.

1459
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,980
Including me, Scott Glenn.

1460
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,780
Oh, Kurt, good to see you.

1461
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,740
How's your legs?

1462
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:52,660
Fine.

1463
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:54,260
I see.

1464
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:57,700
You didn't have to burn alive like I did, Scott Glenn.

1465
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:01,860
For some of us, we didn't want it to end.

1466
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,420
I wanted my pain to end immediately.

1467
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:07,740
Who says they didn't want it to end, Kurt Russell?

1468
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:10,700
Scott Glenn says it as like a dig at Kurt Russell

1469
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:11,780
getting out of a fire.

1470
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,620
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1471
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,460
Some of us, yeah, yeah.

1472
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,500
That was like he lost his mind in the part.

1473
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,940
He was implying that Kurt Russell was like Jim Carrey

1474
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,260
in Number 23.

1475
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:23,500
He stayed in the role forever.

1476
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,340
Yeah, yeah.

1477
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:26,740
Well, of course, in the plot of the movie,

1478
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:30,540
Scott Glenn's character is the both,

1479
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:33,980
I'll say a term that I've heard a lot recently,

1480
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:37,100
both the arsonist and the firefighter.

1481
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:37,940
Oh, is that right?

1482
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:39,740
That is like the twist.

1483
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,820
He's one of the main firefighter guys.

1484
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:45,940
There's some crazy thing about Chicago mayoral politics

1485
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:48,460
and an arsonist.

1486
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:50,860
They keep consulting an arsonist,

1487
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,660
Donald Sutherland's character,

1488
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:55,340
and they realize like, oh, these burns are so controlled,

1489
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:59,140
only another fireman could do this.

1490
00:55:59,140 --> 00:55:59,980
Oh, really?

1491
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:03,060
So like Scott Glenn could have set the universal fire

1492
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,580
for real and then put it out.

1493
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,060
It's, oh, gosh.

1494
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:08,180
Like, and that would have thrown off the scent.

1495
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:09,020
Interesting.

1496
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:10,020
So he's the bad guy in the movie

1497
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:10,860
and having him do the intro.

1498
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:12,340
That's the twist.

1499
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:16,060
Spoiler alert for this super old movie.

1500
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:18,940
So the bad guy is introducing backdraft?

1501
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:19,780
That's interesting.

1502
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,140
Well, he's the good guy for most of the movie

1503
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:24,380
and then it's revealed like, I had to set these fires

1504
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,860
because this guy who's running for mayor

1505
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:29,020
was gonna cut the fire department budgets, which,

1506
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:32,260
what politician has ran on, like,

1507
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:35,100
we gotta slash these fire department budgets.

1508
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,820
I mean, it seems like something Trump would wanna do.

1509
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:38,660
Yes.

1510
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:39,500
I don't know.

1511
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:42,540
But yeah, so that's the whole thing.

1512
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:44,740
Chicago people don't run on it,

1513
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:46,060
they just do it probably.

1514
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:47,620
They just, yeah, they do it secretly.

1515
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:48,460
It comes out five years later.

1516
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:50,940
A manual just stole it in the middle of the night or something.

1517
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:51,780
Just stole it.

1518
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:52,620
Big bag of money from a firehouse.

1519
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,500
Think it's like five jobs immediately.

1520
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,340
Mm-hmm.

1521
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:56,820
That's what he did.

1522
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:59,940
Yeah, so like he is the twist.

1523
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:01,940
He is like the bad, he's like, I did it.

1524
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,980
One of those, like, I did this for us.

1525
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:04,820
Right, right.

1526
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:05,640
Interesting.

1527
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,980
Firefighters died.

1528
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:10,940
So then, so at the end, in the scene that they show

1529
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:15,940
in the, in room two, there's the exchange,

1530
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:18,340
he's when he, in the scene where he really burned up,

1531
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,900
he says, let me go, bull.

1532
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:21,740
Yes.

1533
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:23,660
You go, we go.

1534
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:26,220
That's him saying, I deserve to die.

1535
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:27,460
And he does.

1536
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:28,940
Oh, and then it's, oh, that's right.

1537
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:30,580
They spoil it all in the attraction.

1538
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:31,420
Yeah, yeah.

1539
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:34,140
Kurt Russell gets, he's like barely alive.

1540
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:36,380
They get, he dies in the ambulance.

1541
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:37,220
Oh, okay.

1542
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:40,020
But he tells, I think Billy Baldwin, he says like,

1543
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:43,220
don't tell them it was him.

1544
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:46,260
Like, it'll just make it worse for the fire department.

1545
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:47,940
It's a two-face scenario.

1546
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:48,780
Oh, yeah.

1547
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,500
Yes, he has Harvey Dent.

1548
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,020
Or Jebediah Springfield.

1549
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,820
Or Jebediah Springfield, yeah.

1550
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:55,500
Donald Sutherland in that episode, too.

1551
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,340
Oh, yeah.

1552
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:00,260
You're children's children for two months.

1553
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:01,900
So he's, I was thinking like,

1554
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:05,060
who else could they have gotten to do the opening?

1555
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:05,900
Like, who could they have?

1556
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:08,140
I mean, De Niro would have been the get.

1557
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:08,980
But he wouldn't have done that.

1558
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:11,780
He would have been just as depressed and sad in the video.

1559
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,140
Donald Sutherland might have played ball.

1560
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:15,700
Or Billy Baldwin.

1561
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,540
Where Billy Baldwin?

1562
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:17,660
Yeah, that is surprising.

1563
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,220
Yeah, that seems like, especially back then,

1564
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:23,060
folksy or, not maybe not folksy,

1565
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:24,860
but more energetic.

1566
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:25,900
Slicker.

1567
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,300
Slicker, hey, this is,

1568
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,260
they're gonna get to see this fun piece of movie magic.

1569
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:31,100
Yeah.

1570
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,780
Instead of like, we almost died and they hated it.

1571
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:34,620
Let's keep going.

1572
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:36,140
They hit me with a machine

1573
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:38,180
and then I got to destroy the machine.

1574
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:39,020
Yeah.

1575
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,100
The crew let me blow it up.

1576
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,300
You know movies, you know,

1577
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,220
when you work on a movie or TV show

1578
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:48,100
and they let you destroy a massive expensive piece

1579
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:51,620
of property at the end because you hated it.

1580
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:54,180
Yeah, that's a very common thing.

1581
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:56,620
How did they destroy the Ash-O-Matic?

1582
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,820
With another Ash-O-Matic?

1583
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:58,660
With more flames?

1584
00:58:58,660 --> 00:58:59,940
Yeah, I guess so.

1585
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,500
Yeah.

1586
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,460
Well, it's kinda,

1587
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,540
I guess it's Scott Glenn getting to have

1588
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,300
his office space moment.

1589
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:08,140
Right.

1590
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:08,980
Yeah.

1591
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:09,820
That's kinda nice.

1592
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:12,060
I was on the DVD extra maybe.

1593
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,860
Could we see, does anyone have the DVD for back draft?

1594
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:15,700
Oh, Scott Blow.

1595
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,300
Edit it to that song, whatever the rap song.

1596
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,620
Oh yeah, he could've taken a bat

1597
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:21,900
or an iron rod or something and beat it up, you know.

1598
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,740
We're driving a car into it.

1599
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:25,940
Yeah, I wanna see this.

1600
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:28,700
Scott Glenn beating up a piece of machinery.

1601
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,220
Yeah, why didn't they save that for it?

1602
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:32,700
Instead of him actually coming close to death.

1603
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:33,820
Or even just put it in the entry,

1604
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,780
like I got, and they let me destroy it.

1605
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,460
And then there's just a quick shot of him

1606
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:40,300
railing with a baseball bat on this metal.

1607
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,540
You think you're better than me, Ash-O-Matic?

1608
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:44,780
You try to kill me, well I kill you.

1609
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,140
You're going to hell now.

1610
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:47,900
I'm Scott fucking Glenn.

1611
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:50,900
I'm Scott fucking Glenn.

1612
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:56,300
All right, will somebody find that piece of footage

1613
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:57,460
because I can't find it right now.

1614
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:00,420
Maybe it was unerrable in a theme park environment

1615
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,820
because he peed on it.

1616
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:05,460
Yeah, he took his pants on the whole time

1617
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:06,860
when he was with the baseball bat.

1618
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:09,740
Big plop shit onto the Ash-O-Matic.

1619
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,940
The blurring would have to be, it was too expensive.

1620
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,580
There's a locations guy who's like,

1621
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,500
I can't go home until he's done.

1622
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,700
He better fucking finish beating up that machine.

1623
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,660
It's three in the morning.

1624
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:22,620
Pooping on it won't make it not work.

1625
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:23,460
Yeah.

1626
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,820
I do have to say, one of the things about this ride,

1627
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:30,380
they show the footage of the different fire effects

1628
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,180
from the movie and they're very impressive

1629
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:34,700
that they're doing this live.

1630
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,900
They're also very varied.

1631
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:40,700
In a theme park ride, you need to run every 10 minutes.

1632
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:44,660
You kind of can't have flames that look like this

1633
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:45,900
and flames that look like,

1634
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:50,380
you need a reliable controlled burn, which is why most

1635
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:53,780
of the flames in the attraction are natural gas.

1636
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:58,020
It's natural gas that is apparently mostly silent.

1637
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:01,460
A lot of the fire burn you hear in that last scene

1638
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:03,820
of the ride is sound effects.

1639
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:07,020
Because natural gas burns quietly,

1640
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:10,420
you really only hear the fire going on or off

1641
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:11,260
with natural gas.

1642
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:13,420
In that one video I was watching before,

1643
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,820
they were saying on occasion,

1644
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:16,660
the sound effects wouldn't be working

1645
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:18,660
and it would be very strange.

1646
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:19,500
Weird.

1647
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:22,380
Because that's so much of it in your head.

1648
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,580
Oh, well that obviously is coming from that sound.

1649
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:27,020
I mean, that's in theme parks everywhere.

1650
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:28,180
I have to remind myself, oh yeah,

1651
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:30,620
that sound of cars racing in Radiator Springs

1652
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,340
is not the cars.

1653
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:34,500
It's a weird, invisible thing.

1654
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,340
Because you never really hear about it.

1655
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:36,180
Because you never really hear about it.

1656
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:37,020
It gets tricked.

1657
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:37,860
Yeah.

1658
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,820
Sometimes the recording has reactions.

1659
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:44,820
Like multiple alien encounter walkthroughs I've watched,

1660
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,380
I realize after a few years,

1661
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:52,260
like, oh, that scream is on the soundtrack.

1662
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:55,060
That scream comes at the same time every time.

1663
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:56,660
That's not an audience member.

1664
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,340
Oh yeah, right, right.

1665
01:01:58,340 --> 01:01:59,180
To try to make people freaked out

1666
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:00,820
by hearing other people scream.

1667
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:01,660
Yeah.

1668
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:02,500
Oh sure.

1669
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:03,340
Yeah.

1670
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:06,140
And well, the end, the Muppet Vision 3D.

1671
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:07,140
He's up there.

1672
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,460
Oh yeah, he's up there.

1673
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:09,900
He's up there.

1674
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:10,740
Yeah.

1675
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:11,580
Uh huh.

1676
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:12,420
Good trick to get everybody.

1677
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,300
I wonder if there's like a really good one

1678
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:15,460
that I don't know,

1679
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:18,700
that I've always for years assumed is something that has.

1680
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:20,100
Like a machine is making the noise,

1681
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,700
but it's really just a piece of soundtrack essentially.

1682
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:23,620
I'm sure there is.

1683
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:24,460
I just wonder.

1684
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:26,660
Well, the busts in the Haunted Mansion

1685
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:27,740
aren't really alive.

1686
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:28,580
Okay.

1687
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:30,260
Why is that on tape?

1688
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:33,900
Those aren't real ghosts.

1689
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:36,100
But I know Thurl's there.

1690
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,420
You're saying Thurl isn't.

1691
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,140
He is not, that actor is long past

1692
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:43,740
and is not sitting there live performing the song.

1693
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:44,580
Okay.

1694
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:45,420
Every day.

1695
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:46,240
Disappointing.

1696
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,080
Yeah, sorry.

1697
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,460
First to tell you that he's not with us.

1698
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:49,620
I don't care for that either.

1699
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:52,020
He doesn't sit in that room all day.

1700
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:54,700
I'd prefer he lived to be as old as Prince thought

1701
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,780
he would live to be as old as.

1702
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:01,220
Just Thurl and Prince living into infinity.

1703
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:02,660
I hope they've met in heaven.

1704
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:04,420
They for sure have met.

1705
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:05,580
What dreams may come.

1706
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:06,420
What dreams?

1707
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:07,260
In a meadow somewhere.

1708
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:09,100
Everything's tying back.

1709
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:10,980
And the rain is purple.

1710
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:11,820
Yeah.

1711
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:15,140
And whatever Thurl liked is represented to.

1712
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:15,980
Yeah.

1713
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:17,940
His infinite frosted flakes.

1714
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:19,780
He was Tony the Tiger.

1715
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:20,620
He voiced Tony the Tiger.

1716
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:21,460
That's what that.

1717
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:26,460
I saw this ride, I think probably 2007 or eight

1718
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:29,340
the first time, cause it wasn't in Florida.

1719
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:34,260
But fire did always just, real life fire scared me

1720
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:38,300
whether it was at the Hollywood Disney's MGM studios.

1721
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:40,620
Catastrophe Canyon.

1722
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:41,460
Thank you.

1723
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:42,780
That got very hot.

1724
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:43,620
That would always freak me out.

1725
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:44,620
Yeah, and the heat.

1726
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,300
That would always feel new.

1727
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:49,620
I feel like touching my face, did it burn me?

1728
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:53,700
Jaws in Florida was the scar, was the craziest.

1729
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:54,540
Yeah.

1730
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:55,380
So like anytime.

1731
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:58,620
So I do remember going on back draft in 2007 or eight

1732
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:00,260
or walking through I should say,

1733
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:03,580
and still feeling like a fire.

1734
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:05,100
Yeah it's intense.

1735
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:07,820
It's not a thing I don't think people wanted to do a ton.

1736
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:08,660
That's maybe the problem.

1737
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:10,740
Yeah, it's extremely impressive.

1738
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:13,580
But yeah, I wouldn't like, hey, I worked there.

1739
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:16,060
I could have gone on it every day if I wanted to.

1740
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,140
And I think I only did one time.

1741
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:20,180
It's also the furthest away attraction

1742
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:22,100
from the gate of the park.

1743
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,100
Takes forever to get there.

1744
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:24,900
It's not fun.

1745
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,940
Back draft is not a fun experience.

1746
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:29,900
That's a thing to key into.

1747
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,860
Yes, it's extremely impressive.

1748
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:35,260
And everybody who put it together should be very proud.

1749
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:39,420
But it's not, yeah, it's like basically unpleasant.

1750
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:40,340
It's unpleasant.

1751
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:44,300
I think it's more unpleasant than the Twister

1752
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:46,620
because Twister at least in the,

1753
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:49,700
because both of them are just watching a scene play out.

1754
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,740
But like Twister has like a little more character maybe.

1755
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:52,700
There's a town.

1756
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:56,580
This is just a cold, impersonal warehouse.

1757
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:57,660
Chemical warehouse.

1758
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,220
There's like no, I don't know.

1759
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:00,100
There's no fun.

1760
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:01,500
There's no little gag in it.

1761
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,500
There's no fun.

1762
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:05,700
There's Mrs. O'Leary's cows nowhere to be seen.

1763
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:07,300
That would be something maybe of like,

1764
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:09,340
oh, there's a little whimsy here.

1765
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:12,940
No, it's just fires and barrels and doors,

1766
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:14,540
like and it's loud.

1767
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:17,020
Like it's impressive, but it is not.

1768
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:19,500
Only a fire in the center office

1769
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:22,860
burns up everything in the room until it ran out of oxygen.

1770
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:26,340
Oh, it may look quiet now, but that is deception.

1771
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:30,700
It's deception for hiding inside our unburned natural gases

1772
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:33,380
waiting for a breath of fresh air.

1773
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:35,220
And that's when they simulate the back draft

1774
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:37,260
and the doors fling open.

1775
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:38,940
That kind of scares me, this dialogue.

1776
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:39,780
That is a scary dialogue.

1777
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:41,340
It is unnerving.

1778
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:43,340
It would be cool if it was like a dark ride

1779
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:44,620
that was on fire.

1780
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:46,420
It would be scary, but at least like

1781
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:47,980
you'd be kind of doing something.

1782
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:50,020
I think the mix of it being a passive,

1783
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:51,740
kind of a passive experience,

1784
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:53,940
there's nothing fun to hang onto.

1785
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:55,660
It's a little scary.

1786
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:58,580
So like would dummies have been good?

1787
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:00,580
Or did dummies make it darker?

1788
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:03,980
Because you're watching human shapes get lit on fire.

1789
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:06,780
There's not a lot of ways to make fire fun.

1790
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:09,340
I was thinking as far as fire goes,

1791
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:13,540
maybe my favorite fire-based attraction

1792
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:17,700
was at Santa's Village in my hometown,

1793
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,860
a couple towns over.

1794
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:22,460
And the idea was that you were on this whole train

1795
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:25,260
and at the end you were all in like little firefighting

1796
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:27,340
trains or whatever you'd call it.

1797
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:30,300
I don't know, I guess cars, but there was like a long train.

1798
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,740
And you had little water guns in front of you.

1799
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:35,660
And the idea was that Santa's house was on fire

1800
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:38,500
and you had to put Santa's house out.

1801
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,380
So the whole thing.

1802
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:41,220
That's amazing.

1803
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:43,740
Yeah, and it was a very, it was not a big,

1804
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:46,460
it was not a giant house, it was a smallish house.

1805
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:50,580
Help me kids, I left the electric blanket on, please.

1806
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:52,940
We would go around here and the whole thing was like,

1807
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:54,860
all right, we're getting to Santa's house,

1808
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:58,340
everybody get on the water gun to put it out.

1809
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:00,220
So like I had to have like a water gun,

1810
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:01,940
like you'd have at a carnival or whatever

1811
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:04,900
to that sense of when you, like, I don't know,

1812
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,380
those ones where they go up the,

1813
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:08,380
you know, there's like eight people,

1814
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:09,620
they all have water guns, you're trying to shoot

1815
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:12,300
at the target and whoever gets up to the top first,

1816
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:13,500
it's like a race.

1817
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,820
It was like similar to that.

1818
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:17,920
And then we would all shoot our water guns

1819
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,900
at this tiny Santa's house to put out a fire.

1820
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:25,060
It was obviously a little controlled flame inside.

1821
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:26,460
But I loved it.

1822
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:27,380
Yes.

1823
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:28,220
I loved putting out Santa's house.

1824
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:30,380
If there was ever a motivation,

1825
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:33,860
if you're worried about kids not understanding stakes,

1826
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:36,900
you don't get presents this year unless you fix this.

1827
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,620
Yeah, and we did every time.

1828
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:41,220
It would always, we'd always, I never questioned

1829
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:43,380
why it was always on fire.

1830
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:45,820
Santa always falling asleep with a cigarette in his mouth.

1831
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:47,660
You gotta make Mrs. Claus.

1832
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:49,420
I never learned.

1833
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:53,140
I think because I'm eternal that I can do this, but.

1834
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:55,980
And he was also nowhere to be found either.

1835
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:57,340
I guess like maybe he was out.

1836
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:58,460
He had an alibi.

1837
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:01,940
They explained, yeah, they explained Santa was out.

1838
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:05,460
So like, but his house is on fire and we had to fix it.

1839
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:07,900
Yeah, because you'd expect like elves and reindeer,

1840
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:10,660
Mrs. Claus on the front lawn and like, oh my God,

1841
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:13,140
we're, oh, our house, Jesus Christ.

1842
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:14,820
I had some workers working on the roof,

1843
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:16,780
but they said they watched the tiles

1844
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:19,100
for 40 minutes afterwards.

1845
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,460
Trying to rescue the photo albums.

1846
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,540
Look at this, it's the first elf I ever bought.

1847
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:31,140
That elf island.

1848
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,740
My master recordings.

1849
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:35,100
They're burning up.

1850
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:36,580
All my albums.

1851
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:37,420
Jingle bells.

1852
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:38,260
My blues records.

1853
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:45,020
Yeah, why did Santa have the muddy waters masters?

1854
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:47,620
I was a collector.

1855
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:49,540
New plan from Universal Music Group.

1856
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:51,060
Give them all to Santa.

1857
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:51,900
Yeah.

1858
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:53,660
He seems to be good with inventory.

1859
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:56,060
There's so many presents and stuff getting made

1860
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:56,900
and going around.

1861
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:57,740
Well, sure.

1862
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:59,740
But it's too cold up there, they're gonna crash.

1863
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:01,020
Oh no.

1864
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:03,100
It's cold, but too cold.

1865
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:05,220
But Santa is associated with religion,

1866
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:08,300
so does he have a blessed house of some kind?

1867
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:10,180
It's his magic of some kind.

1868
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:11,020
So perhaps.

1869
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:14,820
Did he bless it or did Santa's priest come to bless it?

1870
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:16,820
Santa's priest, I probably did it.

1871
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:20,500
Whatever parish that Santa goes to in the North Pole.

1872
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:23,820
It's a snowman, a priest probably.

1873
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:27,780
Yeah, yeah, it's gotta be a snowman.

1874
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:29,100
Isn't it in Frosty the Snowman?

1875
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:29,940
Doesn't he?

1876
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:31,420
They pretend that he's Parson Brown.

1877
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:34,460
In this case, it is a snowman who is really a parson.

1878
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:35,300
Yep.

1879
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:37,380
Parson Brown is real.

1880
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:38,860
Frosty was impersonating him.

1881
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:39,860
Frosty was committing fraud.

1882
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:42,260
But also it made a lot of sense,

1883
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:44,420
because how else would you impersonate a human man

1884
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:45,460
if you were a snowman?

1885
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:47,340
So he had to have been a snowman.

1886
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:48,180
Yeah.

1887
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:50,340
Because then it's easy to impersonate two snowmen.

1888
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:53,380
You could look like each other.

1889
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:55,500
But another being wouldn't,

1890
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:56,980
because it's not the right shape.

1891
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:58,420
Yeah, you could be confusing.

1892
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:03,460
Although very few humans are bigger in their bottom third.

1893
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:06,100
Yeah, that's true.

1894
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:08,740
It's a very sick human being.

1895
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:10,140
You have a lot of health problems

1896
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:14,060
if your legs are almost twice the size of your head.

1897
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:14,880
That's true.

1898
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:15,720
I'm saying yes.

1899
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,780
I'm saying Parson Brown was a snowman already.

1900
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:18,620
Yes, sure.

1901
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:19,460
That's all I'm saying.

1902
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:23,100
I'm just going through why a snowman couldn't

1903
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:24,820
go around and trick a person.

1904
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:25,660
I 100% agree.

1905
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:26,500
It's a big thing in there.

1906
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,340
It would be impossible to trick, yeah.

1907
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:32,460
Please, Parson Brown, bless this house.

1908
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:34,060
It's made of gingerbread.

1909
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:36,040
It would burn almost instantly.

1910
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:41,460
Well, I saved the house regardless of the magic.

1911
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:43,100
You're a good boy who did a good job.

1912
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:44,220
Thank you.

1913
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:45,980
We both have Mike to thank.

1914
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:48,100
We might not have gotten presents

1915
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,220
almost any Christmas growing up.

1916
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:53,860
Everyone, please use the hashtag thank you, Mike,

1917
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:55,740
for our Christmases.

1918
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:59,580
I think Santa's Village has had a weird,

1919
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:01,300
there's many different Santa's Villages.

1920
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,860
It has a weird history and I'm wondering if it's,

1921
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,140
they reopened it a few times.

1922
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:06,400
I wonder if that is still there.

1923
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,900
That's worth looking into.

1924
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:11,040
Yeah, that might be, we might have to each pick

1925
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:14,420
a different Santa's Village in the country.

1926
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:17,620
I mean, I had the one in San Bernardino

1927
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:21,540
that was recently reopened in some regard.

1928
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:22,360
I haven't been there.

1929
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,380
I believe it was at Extreme Sports Park.

1930
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,700
Oh, that's nice.

1931
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,140
But also Santa's house is still there.

1932
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:29,700
He's still around sometimes.

1933
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:30,540
I hope so.

1934
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:31,780
But you can go zip lining.

1935
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:35,100
So somebody, so Parson Brown, the snowman,

1936
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:36,780
now needs to go bless it to make sure

1937
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:39,300
a snowboarder doesn't wreck it.

1938
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,060
Doesn't go crashing through the walls.

1939
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:43,180
I'm looking, there was a Santa's Village,

1940
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:44,620
the one I was talking about,

1941
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:47,700
rebranded as an Azuzman Park for a little while,

1942
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:50,220
which I'm not sure if they are still an Azuzman Park.

1943
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:51,060
Ooh, to that word.

1944
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:52,340
That's torturous.

1945
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:53,180
Yeah.

1946
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:55,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh, here we go.

1947
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,580
Tragedy at the Azuzman Park today.

1948
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:58,900
Become a firefighter for a day

1949
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:01,100
and join the Santa's Village Fire Department.

1950
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:02,820
Once you hear the sirens and see the lights,

1951
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:04,820
hop onto the Santa's Village Fire Department

1952
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:06,660
engine number three and use your hose

1953
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:08,900
with real working water to put out the fire.

1954
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:10,100
Still there?

1955
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:11,100
So it's still there.

1956
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,380
Oh, you gotta go.

1957
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:13,220
Yeah.

1958
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:15,260
Is it, wait, I'm sorry, are you on a vehicle

1959
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:16,660
or are you an adult?

1960
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:18,820
Would you fit on whatever?

1961
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:23,300
It's, here it is, hold on, let me, there it is.

1962
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:24,140
Okay.

1963
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:26,020
It's a little wagon.

1964
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:27,580
It's a little more of a hose than,

1965
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:30,100
like it's sort of the hose end of what I was describing

1966
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:31,300
as the carnival game.

1967
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:33,260
Oh, I see.

1968
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:34,460
Oh, so you could be part of it.

1969
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:35,300
Yeah.

1970
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:36,340
You'd have to push a kid out of the way.

1971
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:38,460
Yeah, the adults seem like they're maybe taking

1972
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:41,380
the back seat without the hoses, but you know,

1973
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:43,180
maybe one for old times sake.

1974
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:46,540
You gotta see if you still got it in ya.

1975
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:48,260
It's been years since you've been in the game,

1976
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:51,140
much like the firefighters in Backdraft 2.

1977
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:52,060
That's true.

1978
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:53,780
Oh.

1979
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:56,100
Suit up again, we're going back.

1980
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:58,780
Billy Baldwin seems like in Backdraft 2 in the trailer,

1981
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:01,140
he's like sitting down a lot more,

1982
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:05,860
delivering lines from the fire truck front seat a lot more.

1983
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:09,460
So he's not, as opposed to Backdraft 1,

1984
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:12,620
going to run across an actual burning roof

1985
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:15,260
while it splits down the middle behind him.

1986
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:18,820
His speed in Backdraft 2 is a little more sitting a chair.

1987
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:19,660
Yeah.

1988
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:21,260
I see.

1989
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:22,340
I got an idea for a scene.

1990
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:26,860
What about petting a Dalmatian for 17 minutes straight?

1991
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:29,700
Yeah, he's definitely more of a chief character now

1992
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,540
in this one or something.

1993
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:32,740
That's less fun though.

1994
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:34,620
But I get it, he could shout out in three days.

1995
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:38,740
But yes, but again, again, maybe we would watch Backdraft 2

1996
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:40,820
and decide that it is more fun.

1997
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:41,860
Yeah.

1998
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:43,620
It's up to us to do now.

1999
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:48,580
Some technical innovation in the Backdraft attraction.

2000
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:51,020
This was the first appearance of Brainfire.

2001
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:53,100
Did you guys call Macaroth Brainfire?

2002
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:54,580
I saw that word, but what is it?

2003
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:58,300
So developed by Technifex, which is in California,

2004
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:01,300
right by Magic Mountain, their headquarters.

2005
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:05,900
It's where you pump natural gas onto a stone or metal ceiling

2006
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:07,140
and light it on fire.

2007
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:10,420
So it looks like a whole ceiling's on fire.

2008
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:11,700
So I think in the attraction, you

2009
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:17,620
could see that right by the doors that fly open

2010
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,980
at the beginning of the attraction.

2011
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:20,820
There's kind of a small ceiling there.

2012
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:22,700
You can kind of see on fire.

2013
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:24,900
Because the fires don't get that close to you.

2014
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:27,340
So the ceiling above you is not on fire.

2015
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:27,860
No.

2016
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:30,740
You start to feel like it is with the rafters falling.

2017
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:31,460
But I see.

2018
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:33,980
So maybe the more intense effects are further back.

2019
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:35,820
There's some trickery in that regard.

2020
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:36,300
Yeah.

2021
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:40,380
Technifex, also responsible for some stuff

2022
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:42,940
in the Borg Invasion 4D and Star Trek,

2023
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:46,460
the experience we talked about lately.

2024
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:50,780
Some mechanical effects in the Indiana Jones Stunt Spectacular.

2025
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:53,620
Some cool effects at the Six Flags Power Plant,

2026
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:55,540
the short-lived attraction in Baltimore.

2027
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:56,040
Oh, boy.

2028
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,500
Oh, we've got to get to that one day.

2029
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:01,420
And then two big ones, the water tunnel in Poseidon's Fury

2030
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:03,300
at Islands of Adventure.

2031
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,580
Oh, it shoots water.

2032
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:07,660
The water that goes 360 around you.

2033
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:09,580
And then, Mike, you'll like this.

2034
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:12,700
They made the tiny hologram at Dick Van Dyke

2035
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:16,500
that shows up in the Walt Disney Family Museum

2036
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:21,020
and explains how Disney's first optical printer works.

2037
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:24,780
Tiny Dick Van Dyke appears at different parts of the machine

2038
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:27,220
and says, and this does this, and this does this.

2039
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:29,980
Is a little Dick Van Dyke trapped in a printer?

2040
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:30,500
Yeah.

2041
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:34,340
Is it like Madame Leota at the end of the Haunted Mansion?

2042
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:36,420
He does kind of look about that size.

2043
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:37,340
Wow.

2044
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:38,180
That's fun.

2045
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:43,220
And at the end, he's ultimately seeking a mate.

2046
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:45,060
Marry me.

2047
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:48,540
Join me in this printer forever.

2048
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:52,140
So yeah, a very theme park tied in company.

2049
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:52,640
Wow.

2050
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:53,500
Yeah, really.

2051
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:54,420
Very good work.

2052
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:57,620
And it's done lots of other fire effects stuff out there.

2053
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:58,740
For casinos, too.

2054
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:01,740
They do a lot of fire stuff casinos.

2055
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:03,900
You mean like decorative fire?

2056
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:05,940
Like your mirage type situation.

2057
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:10,140
Yeah, I guess there's some fire casinos and stuff.

2058
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:13,060
Yeah, what else have we missed?

2059
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:16,580
The sound stage where it was at was the sound stage

2060
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:19,820
where they shot the Munsters, which I like.

2061
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:20,940
Yeah.

2062
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:23,420
And then it was backdraft.

2063
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:24,860
So it was a real sound stage.

2064
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:26,860
They actually did convert it.

2065
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:27,700
Now it's gone.

2066
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:28,740
Now it's blown up.

2067
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:31,340
And Transformers is there.

2068
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:34,980
And probably the line is where the line was

2069
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:37,340
isn't around where you now enter for hopefully soon

2070
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:41,220
for Super Mario World or whatever they

2071
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:42,900
are calling it ultimately.

2072
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:45,020
Super Nintendo Land, I believe.

2073
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:46,220
Super Nintendo Land.

2074
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:46,940
OK, OK.

2075
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:48,020
I believe that's the word.

2076
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:50,060
At the moment, it's where the line stretches to

2077
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:52,900
for the tiki drinks at Ila Nubar.

2078
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:54,220
Soft open now.

2079
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:54,720
Oh, yes.

2080
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:55,540
Ila Nubar.

2081
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:58,460
The ride's not ready, but the bar is open.

2082
01:16:58,460 --> 01:16:59,260
Oh, really?

2083
01:16:59,260 --> 01:16:59,760
Huh.

2084
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:00,260
Yeah.

2085
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:00,860
They open everything.

2086
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:02,620
That might be all that I'm doing.

2087
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:03,120
Oh, yeah.

2088
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,460
Depending on what the word of fear is.

2089
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:06,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2090
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:08,020
The fear factor is on the ride.

2091
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:09,820
Something's going on over there.

2092
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:12,020
They've got the people from Iron Mountain

2093
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:13,180
on top of the ride.

2094
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:15,340
Don't worry about it.

2095
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:16,980
Whether it's from the preservation side

2096
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:19,860
or the shredding, industrial shredding side, I'm not sure.

2097
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:21,100
This will be a quick side note.

2098
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,180
I do think that opening it this week, which

2099
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:26,860
was the rumored day around when they were opening the ride,

2100
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:29,020
for weeks I think I've seen like, oh, June 15th

2101
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:30,340
is when the ride's going to open.

2102
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:32,900
And everything opening without the ride to me is like,

2103
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,980
that's a delay.

2104
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:39,500
You would think a theme park that is opening a water ride,

2105
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,740
you want it open before July 4th, right?

2106
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:43,380
You're going to get those July 4th crowds.

2107
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:44,580
It's probably going to be hot.

2108
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:45,100
Uh-huh.

2109
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:46,700
I'm just saying, to me, it's like,

2110
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:50,500
there's no way they planned for just the bar to be open.

2111
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:51,000
Yeah.

2112
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,380
And they were probably like, well,

2113
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:54,300
open it all around here, then there's something going on.

2114
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:55,540
Which there's plenty of rumors.

2115
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:57,860
You could look for an hour and 17 into the back.

2116
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:01,420
You can look these up on your own on all those message boards

2117
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:03,980
we talk about.

2118
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:06,260
Yeah, but there's no way this deep into the Galaxy's Edge

2119
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:11,820
Did they not have their competition ready?

2120
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:12,580
Yeah.

2121
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:13,080
Yeah.

2122
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,940
At a certain point, they were, yeah.

2123
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:16,700
Well, they got Hagrid's open.

2124
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:17,300
Kind of.

2125
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:17,940
Kind of.

2126
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:18,660
Hagrid's open.

2127
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:20,660
Kind of open.

2128
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:23,740
Yeah, it's only in the afternoon, though.

2129
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:24,740
That's what's happening.

2130
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:25,500
It opens late.

2131
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:26,180
It opens late.

2132
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:29,260
It's opening at noon for a few weeks.

2133
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:30,660
Stay at our on-site hotels.

2134
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:32,820
Get an hour early admittance.

2135
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:34,980
But Hagrid's is, you've got to come back at noon.

2136
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:35,940
Come back at noon.

2137
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:37,540
We've been at Today's Show Cafe for a while.

2138
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:38,900
Come and look at Today's Show Cafe.

2139
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:40,660
Take the Hogwarts Express.

2140
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:43,060
Yeah, so there's a lot of others.

2141
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:44,740
Yeah.

2142
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:46,260
Everyone's doing their best.

2143
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:47,780
We're laughing at their pain.

2144
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:48,420
They try.

2145
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:51,140
They want to do a nice thing for everyone.

2146
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:53,980
We're like, ha ha ha, it's not open in the morning.

2147
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:55,220
We think that's funny.

2148
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:56,580
It's one of our dicks.

2149
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:59,140
I like to criticize the big picture, the rush that

2150
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:02,340
creates things to be shortchanged or cheapened out on

2151
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:04,020
or things to be open when they aren't ready.

2152
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:04,300
Right.

2153
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:06,060
That's what you've got to be mad at is those up top

2154
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:09,260
decisions, not the people working very hard on everything.

2155
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:12,060
And everyone loves this Hagrid's ride.

2156
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:13,580
Everyone is raving about it.

2157
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:15,980
So I'm excited to figure out what it's all about.

2158
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:17,980
I have a different definition for theme park.

2159
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:20,780
A tireless cast and crew working under demanding

2160
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:26,540
conditions to realistically portray imaginative scenarios.

2161
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:31,700
You there have just quoted, that's the only thing I have

2162
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:34,220
left that we haven't talked about is the Ron Howard

2163
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:35,020
video.

2164
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:37,420
You know what I was thinking about this?

2165
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:39,900
So you the the premises.

2166
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:43,820
OK, so in room one of the rooms of peril, you are where

2167
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:48,460
you watch kind of a sizzle reel of scenes from backdraft

2168
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:50,940
and they tell you that Ron Howard is working on his

2169
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:55,820
latest project and his latest project, I guess, is still

2170
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:58,620
backdraft, which came out a year and a half ago.

2171
01:19:58,620 --> 01:19:59,980
Yes, forever backdraft.

2172
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:01,580
It made me think we just talked about Mickey's

2173
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:06,380
Philhar Magic, where I think we determined that all the

2174
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:09,180
Disney characters are in an infinite loop, living their

2175
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:10,940
most memorable moment.

2176
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:12,780
And that's what's happening with Ron Howard.

2177
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:17,340
Ron Howard is always in the edit bay alone, personally,

2178
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:23,260
physically slicing the film of backdraft, tinkering, never

2179
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:24,220
quite getting it right.

2180
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:27,180
Like Lucas and the original Star Wars.

2181
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:29,660
Yeah, he's going.

2182
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:33,100
Maybe he's in the process of adding tauntauns and stuff

2183
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:34,300
into it.

2184
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:35,900
And they never updated this either.

2185
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:38,460
Like there's three different versions of Spielberg on the

2186
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:40,060
ET intro video.

2187
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:41,660
It's always just him doing it, too.

2188
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:43,900
So there was never one where he was like, you get into that

2189
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:45,500
room and you help out or anything.

2190
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:46,700
Like it was.

2191
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:46,940
Yeah.

2192
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:51,020
So he was just stuck there up until 10 years ago editing.

2193
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:52,860
And then they put him out of his misery.

2194
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:55,660
Also, those sounds that first room, that second room are

2195
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:56,780
almost identical.

2196
01:20:57,820 --> 01:20:58,300
Yeah.

2197
01:20:58,300 --> 01:20:58,620
Yeah.

2198
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:02,540
Just and they're just it's just barely barely dressed

2199
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:03,260
sound stages.

2200
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:06,300
I mean, again, Japan has this cool alleyway and there's a

2201
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,060
light show and a fire truck.

2202
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:13,500
And they painted the barrels in their version of the final

2203
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,020
room where everything's lit on fire.

2204
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:19,260
It's multicolored barrels as opposed to here in Los Angeles,

2205
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:22,300
where it was all beige backdraft, potentially the

2206
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:23,420
beigest attraction.

2207
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:27,740
Very beige, but had some cool trash cans that had flames on

2208
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:29,500
them outside the entrance.

2209
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,020
They think they're garbage cans.

2210
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:32,540
Cool trash cans outside.

2211
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:34,460
Can you do you have a picture on hand?

2212
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:35,020
I didn't see it.

2213
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:35,980
I had a picture.

2214
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:37,260
I gotta see these cool trash cans.

2215
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:38,460
Take a look at these.

2216
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:42,220
Galaxy said it's cool trash cans, but can they dethrone?

2217
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:44,380
And that's an eventual final for best trash cans.

2218
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:48,700
Maybe push wins the one that talked.

2219
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:49,340
Yeah, of course.

2220
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:49,660
Yeah.

2221
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:50,780
Well, we determined it already.

2222
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:51,740
Congratulations.

2223
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:51,980
Push.

2224
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:57,500
One of my favorite things is, and I think it is mostly universal,

2225
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:00,940
but I'm forgetting everything today.

2226
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:07,260
This twister and the tram tour in the subway, there's a funny

2227
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:11,260
thing that like a big inanimate object like in this one,

2228
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,980
it's the it's like the what do you call it?

2229
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:16,140
The support thing falling and swinging.

2230
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:16,780
What do you call that?

2231
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:17,580
Like a walkway?

2232
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:19,100
Yeah, like a catwalk.

2233
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:19,580
Thank you.

2234
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:20,140
Geez.

2235
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:22,620
A catwalk falling and swinging.

2236
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:25,020
And then it's in the subway.

2237
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:29,260
It's like the ceiling falling and then like moving.

2238
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:34,300
There's a funny robot motion that these things make that I really enjoy.

2239
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:39,740
It doesn't look quite natural because it's obviously it has to be reset every time.

2240
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:41,580
Every time the show starts again.

2241
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:46,140
But I don't for whatever reason, it really makes me laugh when something like big

2242
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:48,460
that's supposed to be, oh my God, it's wildly out of control.

2243
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:52,140
And it like slowly moves to its final move.

2244
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:52,940
So like the catwalk.

2245
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:53,980
Oh, no, here it comes.

2246
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:56,140
Oh, it's coming at two miles an hour.

2247
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:58,140
And then it comes to a nice stop.

2248
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:01,580
And it's the same thing in the subway and it's the same thing in Twister.

2249
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:03,900
I think it's kind of relaxing.

2250
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:06,460
Yes, I think that is actually perfectly described.

2251
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:09,820
It's cute because it's most it's supposed to scare the shit out of you.

2252
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:10,140
Yeah.

2253
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:13,820
And it doesn't quite do it because they can't really throw a catwalk at you.

2254
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:14,320
Yeah.

2255
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:19,440
So if I if a like street that you're under collapsed,

2256
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:24,480
the gasoline truck up above would not just kind of slowly like,

2257
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:29,520
you know, like a kid on a sled just kind of like slope down that hill.

2258
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:30,720
Oh, yeah, here it comes.

2259
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:31,760
Oh, it stopped.

2260
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:32,560
Everything's fine.

2261
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:35,440
Give me a start for a second.

2262
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:38,880
Yeah, the water when the water like floods in, that's still kind of

2263
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:43,360
almost seems like the scariest part of it to me on the subway specifically.

2264
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:43,860
Yeah.

2265
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:45,600
Subway.

2266
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:47,280
I keep calling it subway.

2267
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:50,240
Subway exclamation point.

2268
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:52,240
I barely made any sense for the last three minutes.

2269
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:55,040
That also is a weird coincidence.

2270
01:23:55,040 --> 01:24:01,280
A wooden catwalk collapses in a weird way like three times in the other side of the wind.

2271
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,840
I have not I think what I think.

2272
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:07,360
Yeah, it's very weird that this just happened to come up.

2273
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:11,520
But like is like an opening shot of the movie and then a closing shot of the movie

2274
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,680
is a catwalk that collapsed awkwardly.

2275
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:16,480
Now, in that case is probably we have one shot to do this.

2276
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,920
We have no money.

2277
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:22,080
We have to use whatever it is, but it falls in a really odd way.

2278
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,800
So the magic of the movies, folks.

2279
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,080
Yeah, that is what that is.

2280
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:29,360
Collapsing catwalks, everyone's favorite part about a film.

2281
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:33,200
But yeah, like, I mean, what's or do you have something else?

2282
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:33,600
I don't know.

2283
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,360
I really am sort of tapped out.

2284
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:38,320
Plus up, obviously, like if you get to put the fire out,

2285
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,080
like Santa's house, that would be great.

2286
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:40,800
That's it.

2287
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:41,200
Yes.

2288
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:41,920
Wait a minute.

2289
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:46,160
Just like we all had like maybe little like Ghostbuster packs full of water.

2290
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:46,800
That's great.

2291
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,720
And they give you a little plastic hats.

2292
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:50,240
You stop the fire.

2293
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:50,480
Right.

2294
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:53,120
And you walk in there and it's already kind of on fire and it gets worse.

2295
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,680
But like you keep trying, keep trying.

2296
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,640
And yeah, yeah, yeah.

2297
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:59,120
And Scott Glenn is encouraging you along.

2298
01:24:59,120 --> 01:24:59,360
Right.

2299
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:00,640
Keep going.

2300
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:02,960
Yeah, you're almost there.

2301
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:05,600
Don't let what happened to me happen to you.

2302
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:08,160
Keep your legs on burnt, kids.

2303
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:09,520
I found the trash can.

2304
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,600
Oh, pretty cool.

2305
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,920
Looks like Guy Fieri's shirt.

2306
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:14,480
Yeah, it really does.

2307
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:15,120
That kind of flame.

2308
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:18,160
It is a little bawdy, but I like it.

2309
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:18,640
I enjoy it.

2310
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:22,160
I'm not going to see a flame that cool unless I go to the Bob's Big Boy Burbank

2311
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:23,680
and look on the hoods of some cars.

2312
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:24,880
Or Bob Bob Maloo Bob.

2313
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:29,360
Or go to Tim Allen's garage in Burbank or Jay Leno's garage in Burbank.

2314
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:33,040
I was just learning about Tim Allen's garage via some like CBS.

2315
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:35,440
I watched the same Tim Allen piece, I think that you did.

2316
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:41,200
Yeah, where we've discovered that he has tool time recreated in the garage.

2317
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:45,680
He has the full tool time set somewhere mere minutes from here.

2318
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:49,040
It has to be potentially adjacent to Leno's.

2319
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,560
Yeah, probably next door.

2320
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,480
The billionaire car district.

2321
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:56,480
We live very near it and I don't know where it's got to be near the Burbank airport.

2322
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:59,280
Yeah, does Seinfeld have a car garage out here too?

2323
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,480
I feel like he might.

2324
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,640
I think most of them are in New York.

2325
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:05,760
Like how James Bond can get a car in any city in the world.

2326
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:06,720
I think he does.

2327
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:10,000
And he also keeps bees in there.

2328
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:10,640
There's a bee.

2329
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:14,320
He recreated a scene from Bee Movie in there like Tim Allen recreated tool time.

2330
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:17,600
An interesting fact about you guys, you both saw the same segment because you like to watch

2331
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,040
the Sunday morning news shows.

2332
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,520
If we record on Sundays, we have to be wrapped up before 60 minutes because you both go to

2333
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,360
your separate homes and watch that.

2334
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:26,880
Sunday is CBS Day.

2335
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,760
But also we're big Tim Allen guys.

2336
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,320
We'll watch whatever he is.

2337
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,400
Any piece about Tim we got to see.

2338
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:39,920
I specifically hate the Toy Story films but I see them because it's Tim.

2339
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,520
I got to support Tim.

2340
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:42,720
More of this toy shit.

2341
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:44,640
Hold your sides, fellas.

2342
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,040
Well, I got one thing right.

2343
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:50,160
He is a funny man.

2344
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:52,960
Have we missed anything?

2345
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,520
Scott Glenn and Rush Bray.

2346
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:56,080
I wish.

2347
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:56,880
Here's the thing.

2348
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:01,680
Like this is a pretty minor plus up and they don't really make these kinds of rides anymore.

2349
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,680
But like the same thing with like this.

2350
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:08,480
This, less twister.

2351
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:12,880
This and like earthquake in Florida and then disaster.

2352
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:17,120
You have to go, you cannot just jump right to the attraction part of it.

2353
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:19,200
You have to go through so many pre-show rooms.

2354
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:19,760
Yeah.

2355
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:24,160
And they are really holdovers of like here's how the movies get made.

2356
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,320
And now it's more like you are in the movie.

2357
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,440
You are in the action.

2358
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,560
Let's get right to it.

2359
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,800
Maybe one or two quick pre-show rooms.

2360
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:31,600
But like.

2361
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:35,280
Well, you say this but these attractions are all no more.

2362
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:36,880
Yeah, they don't really make these.

2363
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:40,080
Yeah, I guess in Japan, but I don't know.

2364
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:42,720
But they have cool sets so that offsets it.

2365
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:46,400
Which is interesting because this like Jim Hill was talking about,

2366
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:50,800
like just talked about how they almost made a Godzilla attraction when they were going to build

2367
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,640
Disney MGM Studios Japan.

2368
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:58,800
And then part of the verdict that Second Park morphed into Disney Sea because.

2369
01:27:58,800 --> 01:27:59,680
Thank Christ.

2370
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:04,320
They seemed more like the Japanese audience was more interested in.

2371
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:04,720
Rides.

2372
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:07,920
Living stories than finding out how they are made.

2373
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:11,120
But Backdraft is just finding out how it's made.

2374
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:11,840
So.

2375
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,120
Yeah, I'm glad.

2376
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:16,240
Universal Japan, I guess, is a window into the never built.

2377
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:17,440
Yeah.

2378
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:20,800
Yeah, what the dull Disney second Kate would have been.

2379
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,480
What about like the Star Trek?

2380
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:27,760
We talked about on the Patreon, the Star Trek where you would dress up like Starfleet officers

2381
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:29,040
and then you would take a video home.

2382
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:33,040
What about an attraction like that where you had firefighter suits on and then you

2383
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,360
got a video of yourself in the middle of the fire?

2384
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:37,200
That would be better.

2385
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:38,400
That would be something.

2386
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:43,200
And then it kind of they like edit it together with a flaming dummy and it makes it look like.

2387
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:43,760
You died.

2388
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:44,800
Like Scott Glenn.

2389
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,520
Uh huh.

2390
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:45,840
Yeah.

2391
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,760
There's an in memoriam for you.

2392
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:54,560
And there's a 15 minute intro of Scott Glenn and Kurt Russell and Ron Howard talking about

2393
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,800
how much they respect the firefighter.

2394
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:02,800
Like they, I feel like not like two lines go by every between all of the,

2395
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:07,600
before they get another line out about like we respect the men and women that fight these

2396
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:08,000
fires.

2397
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
And like he say it so much.

2398
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:14,320
What they think they are playing into, at least like it does seem to me like the,

2399
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:21,200
probably a back draft lives on now is that it is like the main firefighter movie still,

2400
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:24,800
possibly because once one was made, nobody wanted to make one again.

2401
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:29,120
They said, well, I kept coming across the phrase like this is the second or third most

2402
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:30,640
popular firefighter movie.

2403
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:33,120
And I'm like, what are the others?

2404
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,560
Firehouse dog.

2405
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:35,040
Oh no.

2406
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:37,440
You know what it was in terms of box office receipts?

2407
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:41,360
The first one was technically I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry.

2408
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,040
It was a joke.

2409
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,720
It was a joke in a video.

2410
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:51,600
A movie which contains the slur that starts with F and it's a scene where they,

2411
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,720
there are scenes where they tell you or Sandler mumbles like,

2412
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:56,240
that's not a good word.

2413
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:58,000
Don't use that word.

2414
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,000
But there were scenes earlier in the movie where they use that word and I got a laugh.

2415
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:05,440
I was at the premiere at Universal.

2416
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:06,720
Yeah.

2417
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,120
Yeah.

2418
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:11,920
And I at the amphitheater and they, yes, that word was used in lines,

2419
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:15,520
that were joke lines and succeeded before towards the end of the movie.

2420
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:17,680
He mumbles about it's not good.

2421
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,360
Don't you don't like put it in a screenplay.

2422
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:23,280
I was going to suggest before you told me that because I've never seen that movie that

2423
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:26,240
they could have changed this to a Chuck and Larry.

2424
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:31,040
But now that I hear that, I guess that would be a problem.

2425
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:36,000
So then at the end you get like, you go to a photo booth, like you were at Chuck and Larry's

2426
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,840
wedding, their wedding to where they right.

2427
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:44,000
Humiliate themselves pretending to be gay to get insurance money.

2428
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,280
This is a bad film.

2429
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:50,480
I'm so happy that Sandler is in like a good run because I think that was the,

2430
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:51,920
those were the darkest days.

2431
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,800
That was a rough date.

2432
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:55,840
What 2008, right?

2433
01:30:55,840 --> 01:31:00,800
Around the same time, the universal, all the world's music catches on fire and Sandler

2434
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,000
makes his worst film.

2435
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:05,520
But now he's back on top with murder mystery.

2436
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:07,920
Maybe I don't know.

2437
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,160
I've liked all the stuff so much.

2438
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:11,040
Like maybe I'll like it.

2439
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,240
Maybe I like murder mystery.

2440
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:12,640
I don't know.

2441
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:13,360
Who knows?

2442
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:14,640
People seem to like the stand-up.

2443
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:15,520
I haven't really seen.

2444
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:16,960
I saw Cletson, the stand-up special.

2445
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:17,840
That was all right.

2446
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:18,480
It's very good.

2447
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,680
Recorded some of it at dynasty typewriter.

2448
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:23,680
Right where we forward our show.

2449
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:24,080
Yes.

2450
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:24,880
Part of the lore.

2451
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:29,760
It's where Sandler and Mike and Jason and I go work stuff out.

2452
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,600
I can't, I won't tell you in what order.

2453
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,800
We might be messing around with him there, but.

2454
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:39,840
I haven't seen the full special either though, but does a certain gangster show up

2455
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,800
at the Adam Sandler special as well?

2456
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:45,040
No?

2457
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:45,440
Okay.

2458
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:46,960
He knows what's good for him.

2459
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,080
He puts it in there.

2460
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:48,560
Yeah.

2461
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:52,320
Well, what have we.

2462
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:54,720
I'm out of things to talk about.

2463
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:55,200
Yeah, I know.

2464
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:58,000
With this one actually, it was a little bit tidy.

2465
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:02,480
The only thing I have to say is I really like that Ron Howard intro and it made me that and

2466
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:07,680
the early Spielberg intros and ET just feet away from each other.

2467
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:10,240
Universal made me think that all directors have to wear caps.

2468
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:12,560
I thought I really thought as a kid.

2469
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:13,920
I thought three things as a kid.

2470
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,280
Directors all wear caps.

2471
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:18,560
Scott Glenn and Billy Ballard, one of the biggest movie stars in the world.

2472
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:24,160
I didn't know who they were watching back draft, but I was like, but my mom probably knows and

2473
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:27,360
she probably, they're probably, once I'm an adult, I'll learn.

2474
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:27,840
They're the best.

2475
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:32,800
ET also starts with Spielberg talking about how much he respects ET and Botanicus.

2476
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:36,880
I respect the work of the interstellar plant fixers.

2477
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,960
I respect the work of the healing touchers.

2478
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:41,200
Yeah.

2479
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:44,720
Of course I respect firefighters and everything they do.

2480
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:46,720
I'm just being silly because they say it so many times.

2481
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,360
No, no, no, absolutely.

2482
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:51,440
And the, well, and the, and the third thing that I have all of these that I believed as a child

2483
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:54,560
related to back draft was that my house was, was safe.

2484
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:58,720
I really, that's what's looming large in my mind after we were, after we're finished here.

2485
01:32:58,720 --> 01:32:59,920
Hey, it's never burnt down.

2486
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,040
Yeah.

2487
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:01,920
I can't argue with those stats.

2488
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:04,160
I can't argue with that, but I, that's what I guess.

2489
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:04,800
Yeah.

2490
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:06,080
Just find out somehow.

2491
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:08,160
I'll try to figure out a way.

2492
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:09,600
I think the government letter is the way.

2493
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:14,640
I think I know if we could see, if we could get Bugsy Bones to that house and if he

2494
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:17,520
can not step foot onto the property.

2495
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:20,240
I'm from hell.

2496
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:21,760
I can't even make it in.

2497
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:23,280
Yes, cannot like.

2498
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:24,640
But he can, but he's Hugsy now.

2499
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:25,680
So he never could.

2500
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:26,880
We lost Bugsy.

2501
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:27,840
He's gone forever.

2502
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,200
Bugsy is gone forever.

2503
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:31,920
We are, we are with Hugsy who I thought was really cool.

2504
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,160
He's a pretty awesome, really nice guy.

2505
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:35,360
Yeah.

2506
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,640
Good guys have white hats.

2507
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,440
He was, yes.

2508
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:41,120
If he weren't, if you were just listening and you didn't see it, he was dressed in all white

2509
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,080
as opposed to all black.

2510
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:45,360
He's good now and I can't wait to see him again.

2511
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:48,320
I hope he shows up next episode and he just might.

2512
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,080
But anything's possible.

2513
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:50,580
Yeah.

2514
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:55,280
You'll be hearing a lot of Hugsy every episode from now on.

2515
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:59,520
But until then, you survived podcasts ride back drafts edition.

2516
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:04,400
Hey, more stuff over on patreon.com slash podcast.

2517
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:08,480
The ride, we got the T public, we got the Twitter, we got the Instagram,

2518
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:10,560
tons of ways to participate.

2519
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,960
I bet on one of those things we can show that cool trash can.

2520
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:15,840
All right.

2521
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,120
Got that to look forward to.

2522
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:22,640
If that was our, that we considered that bonus content.

2523
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:26,240
You pay $5 a month and you get to see this flame trash can.

2524
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:27,040
Flame trash can.

2525
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:30,480
We're hiding that photo behind the paywall.

2526
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:33,360
That's where we're going to put all the extra Chukos stuff.

2527
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:37,920
Hope everyone's enjoying waiting at the Chukos.

2528
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:40,240
I'd like to put him in one blessed house.

2529
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:44,240
I want to thank everyone for all the Chukos content in the last few days

2530
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:45,760
on all the various platforms.

2531
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,440
And I just want to say keep it coming.

2532
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:48,080
No.

2533
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,320
Because I'm thinking about him a lot.

2534
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:51,120
He's Chukos.

2535
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:54,480
He's the happiest clown in town.

2536
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:55,600
He's the happiest clown in town.

2537
01:34:55,600 --> 01:35:00,640
And just in case you didn't know, his face was a menu at the Disneyland Hotel.

2538
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:01,520
And a mask.

2539
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:04,160
And also the menu was a mask.

2540
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:08,960
So just I want you all to think about that as you're going about your day.

2541
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:10,560
You're going to bed.

2542
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:13,600
Think about it all night.

2543
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:18,800
And when you wake up and the whole rest of the day, my menu face.

2544
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:21,520
Thanks for listening everybody.

2545
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:26,240
And if you ever hear a fire engine, get out of the way.

2546
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:27,520
They're not going to the movies.

2547
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:31,040
Yep.

2548
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:31,540
All right.

01:35:31,540 --> 01:35:34,880
