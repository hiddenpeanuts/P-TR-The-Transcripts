1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
DOG!

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,720
Warning, the following special podcast report may include Disney property that resembles

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:16,000
the film Children of Men, freakish mashups of fish and waffles, and an emotionally draining

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,220
bathroom visit.

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:23,120
Jacquees Neal regales us with travel tales from Shanghai Disney and so much more on today's

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,920
podcast The Ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:50,120
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a theme park podcast which is making an extremely wise

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,600
decision by not attempting an opening joke in Chinese.

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,600
I'm Scott Gertner, I executed that decision, and Mike Carlson probably agrees.

11
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
Thank God, yeah.

12
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
Can you imagine it?

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,920
Because you might think, like, that'd be a cute thing to do.

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,040
We'd do a little welcome, too, but then we translate it and then, like, knowing how we

15
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,720
pronounce things, I think in one syllable, we are not only mocked but canceled.

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,080
Oh, but yeah, that's probably, yeah, there could be, it could be any version of just

17
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,280
embarrassment to just, we're not allowed to broadcast somehow.

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,280
Mm-hmm.

19
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,280
I mean, that hasn't stopped other people.

20
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,040
Or pulled off the airs, the air that no body governs whatsoever.

21
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,760
It'd be kind of weird because there are other people that are doing much more offensive

22
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,640
things, but somehow maybe that would happen to us, I don't know.

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,200
We would pronounce things so offensively, Jason, Jared, and Helen.

24
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,760
Look, you do it in Mandarin, the Cantonese speakers are mad, you do it in Cantonese,

25
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,400
the Mandarin speakers are mad.

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,800
And probably both sides are like, which one were they doing?

28
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,600
Didn't sound like either.

29
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Yeah.

30
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,000
Well, we're going to stay away from that.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,600
We will focus on English here.

32
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
Smart.

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,400
Yeah, I believe so.

34
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,520
It's the language I know the best, and only.

35
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,680
So today, here's what's happening.

36
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,080
Since pandemic and babies, since that era, I would say international theme park travel

37
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,880
has not been our forte, any of us.

38
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,520
And that is why we lean so heavily on the Foreign Correspondent Program.

39
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,760
We have guests who are on the beat meeting and greeting the world.

40
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:23,760
Griffin Newman started this program and we're passing the baton today to a great returning

41
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,760
guest, a very well-traveled guest who's here to talk about things we've almost never talked

42
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,440
about on the show, so I'm very excited.

43
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,680
From Grand Cru and the live show Comedian Feud here in LA, it's Jaquice Neal, hello.

44
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,680
Hello, everyone.

45
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,680
Hello.

46
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
I am going to attempt Chinese.

47
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
I'm not.

48
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,680
Did you learn it?

49
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,680
No, not at all.

50
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,680
I tried to.

51
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,800
Well, I went to Japan and I was doing Duolingo and then I stopped doing it for like three

52
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,000
or four days and then it started to roast me.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,840
It was like, well, I guess you're ignoring me.

54
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,840
And I was like, yeah, fuck you.

55
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,840
I'm going to ignore you now.

56
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,360
And then it changed my icon to like the saddest green monster.

57
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
Really?

58
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
Yes.

59
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,560
On my phone, it was the happy Duolingo, whatever that thing is.

60
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,240
And then after I didn't go for like a week, I looked at my phone, I was like, why does

61
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,240
it look like that?

62
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,240
It was like so sad.

63
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,960
It had folds in his face.

64
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,960
What?

65
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,960
I was like.

66
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
He was dying.

67
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
He was dying.

68
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
He was dying.

69
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
You were making him sick.

70
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,960
Like ET.

71
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
He's suffering.

72
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,640
I was like, this is not the way to get me to engage in this at all.

73
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,600
I don't want to engage with this.

74
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Wow.

75
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Wow.

76
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,200
Are you making it sick or is that like, this is you.

77
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,720
You're a sickly loser who's not learning.

78
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,200
I think it's both because it was like, you know, it would be great for you today.

79
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:49,360
If you practiced, it would like neg me, like straight up neg me.

80
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,920
So I gave up learning any type of language on my way to Japan, which probably was a mistake

81
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,840
because man, those pronunciations were whooping my ass.

82
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,880
It was, it was hard.

83
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,880
You just have to start.

84
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,400
What I remember from Tokyo is just like, you just kind of like, maybe you, you talk into

85
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,040
a translate program and then like sadly hold out the phone and play it or just show them

86
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,560
what's on the screen or you just kind of like the worst case scenario is you just kind

87
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,080
of put your hands up like help, help, help me, which they do because everybody's nice

88
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,080
and helpful.

89
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
Thank God.

90
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,080
Yeah.

91
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,200
A lot of people do speaking when I was in Shanghai, that was half the case.

92
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:35,600
It was less the case or they were just, you know, like whatever, like leaf, which is very

93
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,440
much the vibe, but was signage helping you out?

94
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,200
Was there at least like English sign?

95
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,360
Okay.

96
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
I mean, that's what you need.

97
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,840
I mean, the Chinese system, you guys know.

98
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,840
Yeah.

99
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,840
It's fucking great.

100
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
It's great.

101
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,840
Yeah.

102
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
Yeah.

103
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,840
A lot of, sorry.

104
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,840
A lot of stuff is in a lot of, a lot of things are in English that you, it's easy to go.

105
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,840
I did not struggle.

106
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,880
I was there for three and a half weeks and I was like, I'm, this is fine.

107
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,880
It's not, they aren't, it's not different arrows there.

108
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,880
Right.

109
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,520
You know, it's not different arrows.

110
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,960
And then like, they still do use like our, or the alphabet that we use for a lot of things,

111
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,960
like the symbols.

112
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,320
I'm like, yeah, that's cool.

113
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,320
That's the most intimidating.

114
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,640
That's what you wonder the most is like, if I'm in a, if I'm in a land of all symbols,

115
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:27,680
some screw, but yeah, I can't learn all this for 10 days because you know, the thing is

116
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,200
not even that is hard to like, cause I don't know what the other, I don't know what the

117
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,720
things that are using the alphabet are saying either, but if I learned it once, then I could

118
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,200
be like, oh, I know what that says.

119
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Oh yeah.

120
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,880
If I see the symbols and somebody like, that means this, I'm not going to remember that

121
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,680
shit the next time I see it.

122
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,360
Like it's like harder for me to actually like pick up that in a, as quick as I can pick

123
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,120
up like anything that uses the alphabet that we use.

124
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
Yeah.

125
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,120
Yeah.

126
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,120
I'm very impressed.

127
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,440
Anybody learns, who successfully learns languages now when they are more of an adult.

128
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,440
Yes.

129
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,440
Yeah.

130
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,440
Yeah.

131
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,440
When your brain is not the sponge it used to be.

132
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,440
Yeah.

133
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,440
Yeah.

134
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
Yeah.

135
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,520
You have like, I was so excited when we started talking about what to do, it was a matter

136
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,040
of narrowing it down because you've done, since you've, and you weren't with us that

137
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,160
long ago, but since then you've done like everything.

138
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,600
You've been everywhere theme park speaking.

139
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,880
I, it wasn't that long ago, but I'm almost sure it was still before I went to Europe.

140
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,440
I think I'm way over two years actually.

141
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,440
Yeah.

142
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,440
I think so.

143
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:38,480
I went to Europe in August, September of 2022.

144
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,920
So I'm pretty sure it was before that.

145
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
I think so.

146
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,920
Yeah.

147
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
Were you about to go on a cruise?

148
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
Disney cruise?

149
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,720
I also went on, I also went on a Disney cruise.

150
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,480
So that's, and that's probably, that's ancient at this point.

151
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,480
Which one?

152
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,480
I went on in December of 22.

153
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
Okay.

154
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,760
That was, I just did the one off of, it was like a five day cruise.

155
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,880
I truly can't even remember where we went because I went on two cruises that month.

156
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,880
It was insane.

157
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,880
Wow.

158
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,880
But it was beautiful.

159
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,320
I loved it.

160
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
It was great.

161
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,200
We, it was just like going to a couple of places in Mexico, which I feel like, I mean,

162
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:17,880
now I sound like just a couple of places in Mexico, just a little dilly dally in Mexico.

163
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,240
But I think the cruises that leave like Los Angeles or Southern California are all great,

164
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,840
but like you, they're, they're a lot more like hangout cruises.

165
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,840
Right.

166
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,560
It was like three days, go to Ensenada, come home, but it's mostly about just hanging out

167
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,520
with your friends and eating and drinking.

168
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,520
Okay.

169
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,520
Destiny.

170
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,520
It's not all about the destination.

171
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,520
It's not always about the destination.

172
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,520
Yeah.

173
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
Yeah.

174
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
So this Disney cruise was similar to that.

175
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,080
It wasn't about the destinations.

176
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,880
It was more about just being on the boat.

177
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,440
Do you remember the name of the boat?

178
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,840
Because they always name these wish or dream.

179
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,560
This is the biggest area of like, yeah, it's destiny.

180
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,440
I'm almost sure it was Inspire.

181
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,400
Which is the name of one of the passes.

182
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Which is the name of one of the passes.

183
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
That's where the other place they use all the words.

184
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
No, no, no.

185
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
That's a lie.

186
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
It was Wonder.

187
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
The Wonder.

188
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Disney Wonder.

189
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,320
I don't think you could feel the specific theme of Wonder as opposed to, I'm sure the

190
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,640
wish is an entirely other situation.

191
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,320
You know what I did when they made it snow on the boat, because it was a holiday cruise.

192
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
Oh, wow.

193
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
It was a holiday cruise.

194
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,320
I was like, this is wondrous.

195
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Wow.

196
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,320
This is wondrous.

197
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,320
It is a wonder.

198
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
Holiday wonder.

199
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
Was Santa there?

200
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,320
It was a holiday wonder.

201
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
Santa was there.

202
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,320
Santa was there.

203
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,320
He was all over the boat.

204
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,320
It was great.

205
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,800
Did he like jump in the pool or anything?

206
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,560
No, I did that on another cruise though, and it was slightly more sexual.

207
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
That cruise.

208
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,260
It was a Virgin cruise.

209
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,760
So I don't think that was the Disney cruise vibe.

210
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,400
Wait, did you jump in the pool or Santa did?

211
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
No, no.

212
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,040
It was a party.

213
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,040
Santa was not on that boat.

214
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,400
Santa was on that boat actually.

215
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,280
He did not jump in the pool.

216
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,280
Not in his Santa gear at least.

217
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,800
Not in his Santa gear.

218
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
It was crazy.

219
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,960
I can't conjure the name now to officially recommend it, but I found this YouTube channel

220
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,880
that is dozens and dozens of videos deep, that's like the 20-minute video they would

221
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,160
send you if you were going to go on the cruise or to convince you to go on the cruise, and

222
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,600
it's all from late 80s, early 90s, exactly the pocket I'm looking for.

223
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,560
These are so great.

224
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,040
Every shot they show you, these incredible atriums with incredible elevators on the boat,

225
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,040
original songs.

226
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:27,560
There's people who are represented as like cruise ship celebrities, you know who Martin

227
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
Starling is.

228
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,280
Wow, you got to be deep, I get to know Martin Starling.

229
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:37,040
And my other takeaway from all these videos, Kathie Lee Gifford is in a lot of them, and

230
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,520
I did not realize until watching these how attracted I am to Kathie Lee Gifford.

231
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,460
It never occurred to me, if you watch these videos, I don't think anyone would disagree

232
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,460
with me.

233
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,440
I will say I've had this thought in the last year.

234
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,680
Kathie Lee Gifford is attractive.

235
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,400
I'm not obsessing about it, but watching her in cruise mode, you're like, jeez, there's

236
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
something about her.

237
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,400
But is it kid you're like, it's like my mom's on TV or something like that, you didn't think

238
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
of her in that way at all.

239
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
She was no one way at all.

240
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
She was no one way at all.

241
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,400
And Cody and Howard Stern makes fun of her and all that, but you remove her from all

242
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
that.

243
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
When you see her in vacation mode, it's a whole other vibe.

244
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
It's a whole different vibe.

245
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,400
See, I'm struggling to even remember what she looks like because I haven't seen her

246
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,880
face in probably 20 years.

247
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
Carnival cruise.

248
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,360
I mean, I think she was like, you know, part of an, there was an official one that she

249
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,360
was in spokes for.

250
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,320
It could have been Carnival.

251
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,280
But that's, that's, that's there to look up.

252
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,840
I'll try to figure out what the channel is because we were not, there was not a miss.

253
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,760
We were putting on one of these a night for a while and not a single one of them.

254
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
Let me down.

255
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,760
I love it.

256
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,840
And this, and this was from the eighties and stuff you said, right?

257
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
Yeah.

258
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
Yeah.

259
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
Did they send you a video?

260
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,480
Did you get like, here's what to expect on the cruise?

261
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,480
Yeah.

262
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,280
It was very, it was very much like, thank you for your money.

263
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,560
We'll see you on December 2nd.

264
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,560
Yeah.

265
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,560
Wow.

266
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,960
That's a lack of, that's the, they're missing wonder.

267
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
They're missing wonder.

268
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,160
They could have got the wonder going from the very beginning, but instead they saved

269
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,640
it for the boat.

270
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,640
Yeah.

271
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,720
No, they don't, they didn't send much.

272
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,240
They send like the little luggage tags and stuff like that, but you know, they didn't

273
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,240
send much.

274
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,960
So let me ask you this question because I believe Kevin Perjurer from Defunct Land was

275
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,200
on our show maybe three years ago.

276
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,120
And he said that the cruise is the only place that the Disney difference still exists.

277
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,520
Meaning that's where you actually feel like, oh, this is a different level of, I don't

278
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,280
know, service or theming or.

279
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,280
Yeah.

280
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
So do you feel that?

281
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,280
Maybe.

282
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:41,120
I actually just talked about this with somebody about the difference in service between Disneyland

283
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,080
and world.

284
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:50,440
And it's all kind of tanking, but land is a whole different level of tanking right now.

285
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:59,360
But like, I would say yes, but I don't know, like I've been on, it was definitely, I've

286
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,360
been on nine cruises.

287
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,360
Oh wow.

288
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,360
10.

289
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,880
I've been on 10 cruises in my life and it was definitely a different cruise.

290
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,840
It was like, this is a Disney cruise, right?

291
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,440
Other cruises have similarities.

292
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:21,080
And the only reason that I probably am not as enthralled with that idea is because later

293
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:26,100
that month I went on that Virgin cruise, which was like 21 and over.

294
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,800
And that was truly like the craziest, most different cruise I've ever been on in my life.

295
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,000
So it was like, so like the Disney cruise, while it was different from like your Royal

296
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,040
Caribbean's, your carnivals, it still had cruise elements to it.

297
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:46,120
Whereas that Virgin cruise was like, nah, bro, this is going to be different.

298
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,880
Should we throw out what we were going to do and just talk about this Virgin cruise?

299
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,560
Just talk about the Virgin cruise.

300
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,560
Do we just review that?

301
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,560
How much you can tell us?

302
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
Seeming on it?

303
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,560
Listen.

304
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,560
Trip report.

305
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,560
Listen, it was crazy.

306
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,560
It was crazy.

307
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,560
Out of Miami too.

308
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,560
It was crazy.

309
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,360
It was a beautiful time.

310
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,320
But yes, I did the Disney cruise.

311
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,120
I've also been to Disney Paris now.

312
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
Oh yeah.

313
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,120
Yeah.

314
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:17,120
I've been to Disney Tokyo, both of them, Universal Japan.

315
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,280
A week before I went to Japan, I had been before, but I was at Universal Orlando.

316
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,280
Wow.

317
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,280
I sent that in too?

318
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,280
Oh my God.

319
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,280
Yeah.

320
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,920
And it's been, it's been, I went with my partner and she was like, I have not been in as many

321
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,920
parks in my life, let alone in a five week period.

322
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,080
How did she, did she wear out?

323
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
Did she wear out?

324
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,080
Yeah.

325
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
Yeah.

326
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
Was it too much?

327
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
To a degree.

328
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,080
Yeah.

329
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,080
To a degree.

330
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,520
By the time we got to Shanghai, Disney, we went to it, but then we also had another day

331
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,000
to chill and she was like, I'm staying in.

332
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,400
You go do whatever you got to do.

333
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
I'm sleeping.

334
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
It's important.

335
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
Know your limits.

336
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
We've all been partnered in there.

337
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,400
We've all just communicated.

338
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,240
I like, like where the, the partner has to communicate.

339
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,360
You understand, you understand, I still like this more than 80% of people, but that doesn't

340
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,360
match you.

341
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Right.

342
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
You're in the top 0.05%.

343
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,360
Seriously.

344
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,560
Do what you got to do.

345
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,880
You've offered us so many options.

346
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
I'm not even sure where to go.

347
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,520
I'm interested to just hear about your Disneyland tanking thoughts, but I'm going to leave it

348
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,520
to you.

349
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,960
Just like, where, where do you want to take us?

350
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,760
Where are you the most excited to talk about?

351
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,040
You know, like, here's the thing.

352
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,680
We got to talk about Shanghai because it was truly one of the most wildest experiences

353
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,920
of my life for any park that I've ever been to.

354
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,040
I will say this though, like a lot of people have asked me, because now I only have one

355
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,040
left.

356
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,040
I only have Disney Hong Kong.

357
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,040
Yeah.

358
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,040
Yeah.

359
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,040
Right.

360
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,720
So I've been to, and I've been to, Alani, I've been on the cruises.

361
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,680
I've been to every Disney thing that you can fucking do and like, which is crazy to me,

362
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,240
but like at this point I'm doing it so I can check them.

363
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,440
I mean, I'm doing it because I love it, but I'm also like, I got to check it off now.

364
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:08,320
At this point, I'm close enough, but people always ask, all right, so what's your favorite

365
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,360
Disney park now?

366
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,680
And I will say my favorite Disney vacation will always be Disney World.

367
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
Sure.

368
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,840
Best Disney parks are Tokyo.

369
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,600
That's a good distinction.

370
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,800
Best Disney parks were Tokyo.

371
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,080
My favorite Disney vacation was Disney World.

372
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,360
Shanghai, my Lord.

373
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
Now let me say this.

374
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,360
Okay.

375
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,920
It's a great park.

376
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,960
It's a great park.

377
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:42,240
The crowd culture at Disney Shanghai was the worst crowd culture I have ever experienced

378
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,240
out of any park.

379
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,080
Like worse than Six Flags.

380
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,080
Whoa.

381
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,080
Interesting.

382
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,080
Why?

383
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,280
What's happening?

384
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:56,880
They literally have signs around Shanghai asking guests to not pee and poop out of the

385
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,880
bathroom.

386
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,880
What?

387
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:07,120
And I saw it, like I saw butt naked children pissing in the middle of the goddamn road,

388
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,120
like in bags.

389
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,120
On Main Street?

390
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,120
Yes.

391
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,120
Wow.

392
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,120
Really?

393
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,120
Crazy.

394
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,120
I mean, all right.

395
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,120
So here's the thing.

396
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,120
Like Disney Shanghai was beautiful.

397
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,120
It's a beautiful park.

398
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
It's chill.

399
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,120
It's only one park.

400
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,120
Yeah.

401
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,960
And we went for one and a half day, essentially.

402
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,200
So we did everything.

403
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,720
Everything was fun.

404
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,000
The parades were cute.

405
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,560
The firework show, best firework show out of any Disney park that I've been to.

406
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,560
Really?

407
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,560
Really?

408
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,560
There were great things about the park.

409
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,560
Zootopia Land is new.

410
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,560
Oh, yeah, yeah.

411
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,560
Oh, you saw that.

412
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,560
Oh, you knew that.

413
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,560
Yeah, yeah.

414
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,560
I did.

415
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,560
It just opened last year or this year?

416
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,560
Recently.

417
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,560
Last few months.

418
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,560
Last few months.

419
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,120
It was like, you know, it was a line to get in the land that can take up to an hour type

420
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,120
thing.

421
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
Yeah, yeah.

422
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,120
But the land is very cool.

423
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
Like super dope.

424
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,120
It feels like you're dropped in the middle of like Zootopia.

425
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,680
Does it feel small?

426
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,680
That's a question I have about it.

427
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,200
Is it like, is there a lot jam packed or is it sort of a spacious land?

428
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:12,240
It is a lot jam packed, but it's not as small as like Super Nintendo World.

429
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,240
Super Nintendo World.

430
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,240
Yeah.

431
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,640
It's not as big as like, you know, Star Wars land or Cars Land.

432
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,640
Sure.

433
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,560
It's somewhere like in the middle of the two, where it didn't feel, it was a type of place

434
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:29,320
that you could be like, all right, you know, I can stand in this spot and see 70% of the

435
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,240
park or 70% of the land.

436
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,520
And then if I go over there, I'll see the rest.

437
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,060
Like if I'm just, you know, standing and looking around type thing, which I guess Cars Land

438
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,260
is kind of like that too.

439
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,260
But it has, you know.

440
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,700
There's like a corner you turn.

441
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,700
Here's a whole other section.

442
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,700
Yeah.

443
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,980
Nothing's going to be as impressive as like Star Wars land.

444
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,660
Like as far as the scope, size, stuff like that.

445
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,860
You cannot see it all.

446
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,460
Like yeah, it's radically different.

447
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,620
Nothing's going to be like that.

448
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,620
But Zootopia was dope.

449
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:01,020
And it was like, it was like really cool because it also makes you feel like you're an animal.

450
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,180
So like, and it's like a city.

451
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:08,560
So they have like a news ticker and like, you know, newscast for like the animals and

452
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,320
like people, the animals getting off the subway station and like there was a big giraffe

453
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,840
working out on the treadmill and stuff like that.

454
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,560
Do they have puppets in the window or something too?

455
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,160
They have puppets in the window, animatronics.

456
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,680
And they have yeah, like animatronics like in the windows, on the, on the streets and

457
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,680
stuff like that.

458
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,240
Just kind of moving and talking and stuff like that.

459
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,040
Did you get any of the food there?

460
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,040
I did get the food.

461
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,040
The food there was.

462
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,500
Like the big food.

463
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,200
There's like a big popsicle in Zootopia land.

464
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,960
There's like the big popsicle.

465
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,800
There's also like, their food combinations were a little weird.

466
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,480
Like they had tuna and waffle, which I was like, I don't need to try that at all.

467
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,480
That sounds good to me.

468
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,480
I'm okay.

469
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,480
Horrible to me.

470
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,480
You would eat that.

471
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,480
Yeah, sure.

472
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,480
I mean, it's just a tuna sandwich in a slightly different form.

473
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,800
Mixed with sweet, that's a little rough.

474
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,800
I didn't try it.

475
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
Neither one of us tried it.

476
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,800
All right.

477
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,920
They had like little Paul food, you know, like food that's in Paul shape.

478
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,080
Also by that time, you know, we had just, we were in Japan for like three and a half

479
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,640
weeks.

480
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,720
I was a little over trying new shit.

481
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,720
Sure.

482
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:25,320
I was like, I, you know, just, I just want to eat McDonald's for a taste of home.

483
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,480
Not even, not even going to McDonald's was just like, I don't need to try anything that

484
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,960
I'm like, I may not like this.

485
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,240
I just like, just give me food that I want.

486
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,400
I'm hungry.

487
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,400
I want to eat it.

488
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,120
And then like, you know, cause they had a couple of things there that was like, okay,

489
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,680
maybe, you know, a week ago, I would have tried this to see how it was, but right now

490
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,160
I'm like, I'm good.

491
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,160
I'm okay.

492
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,920
I think that zone that like, cause when Tokyo Disney opens, I think there's the feeling

493
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,080
of they want the American experience and they want just like burgers, hot dogs, pizza.

494
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,000
If you wanted to go that route, is that, can you do that in Shanghai?

495
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah.

496
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Just basic basics.

497
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:08,600
Not, kind of, kind of, it's not, it's, it's very, the one thing I liked about the Tokyo

498
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:15,160
Disney's, the Disney's in Asia, obviously I haven't gone to Hong Kong yet, as opposed

499
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:20,120
to like Disney Paris, which I've been to, was like, they very much don't give a shit

500
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,120
about Americans.

501
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,000
Like most of the shows are not, have no English in them.

502
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Right.

503
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,480
There's a couple that did, but like every show in Disney Paris was like, it's half English,

504
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,480
half French.

505
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,480
Right.

506
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,960
Whereas this one, which like was really cool cause it's like, yeah, no, you're here.

507
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,680
Like, this is ours, right?

508
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,440
There was some where I was like, hey, you know, maybe just play, you know, never had

509
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:51,400
a friend from Robin Williams instead of whatever version this is, but like other than that,

510
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,320
Even the crowd was just like, we don't care about this.

511
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:01,400
You'd rather it be the voice you know and the syllables you know, even if it's not your

512
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,400
language.

513
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Yeah.

514
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,800
Cause they, you know, a lot of people all over the world know those versions too.

515
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:15,720
But yeah, it was, it was, it was definitely just very un-American, which was like refreshing

516
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,720
in a way.

517
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
Yeah.

518
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,720
It's just fully theirs.

519
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
Yeah.

520
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,480
And then in that land and in that ride, assuming you did the ride.

521
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
Zootopia ride.

522
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,920
I did do the Zootopia ride, which was very fun.

523
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,920
Okay.

524
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,920
Very fun.

525
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,600
Are you dealing, is it like Jason Bateman and people, did they, or is it sound-alikes

526
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,800
because it's all in other?

527
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:42,960
It's all in, it's all in, that one was all in, man, y'all about to make me, whatever

528
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:49,480
language they speak in, Shanghai, Mandarin or I'm not sure.

529
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,240
Yeah.

530
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,640
I'm not sure the division of Mandarin and Cantonese and the breakdown.

531
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,400
It was not, it was not in English.

532
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,240
So I would assume that it was not like-

533
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,240
Probably not Bateman.

534
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,240
Bateman.

535
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,240
Unless-

536
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
He didn't teach him Chinese.

537
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,040
Unless he has some hidden skills that we haven't seen yet on camera.

538
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
I don't know.

539
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,520
Well, John Cena, I don't know if you've seen John Cena speak Mandarin.

540
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,520
He's fluent.

541
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
Yeah, yeah.

542
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,520
When he had to do, it's an amazing video where he had to do an apology for something

543
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,320
which he executes in perfect Mandarin and it looks like a hostage video.

544
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,040
It's the scariest thing you ever see.

545
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:24,760
Is that, did he use a slightly wrong distinction of Taiwan, Taipei?

546
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,760
And he wanted to apologize.

547
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,760
Oh, yeah, I don't remember.

548
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,760
I don't even remember what it was about.

549
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
You might be right.

550
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,760
He had to apologize because it was-

551
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,760
It was the Taiwan is a country issue.

552
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,760
Yeah.

553
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
Okay.

554
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
Yeah, yeah.

555
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,960
He, I believe if I'm, hopefully I'm not getting my John Cena history wrong is that there was

556
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,080
an interview where maybe Steve Austin asked him like, well, what do you do for fun?

557
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,080
What are you doing for fun?

558
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,560
He goes, well, I'm learning Chinese so I can help expand the brand, the WWE brand over

559
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,560
to China.

560
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,080
And he's like, you could tell he was like a little confused, like for fun, like, well,

561
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,000
I just, you know, I just want to help the WWE grow more and more.

562
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And you're like, oh, okay.

563
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,160
That was John Cena's whole thing.

564
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,640
He just announced his retirement yesterday.

565
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,640
Yes, he did.

566
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,640
Yeah.

567
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,640
Yeah.

568
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,640
Next year.

569
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,640
Next year.

570
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,840
It was his last year doing anything, well, wrestling at least.

571
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,560
Or he comes back in two years and it's like none of it happened.

572
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,560
Like they all do.

573
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,560
They all do.

574
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,560
They all do, yeah.

575
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,760
They never retire.

576
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,760
Never retire.

577
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
Oh yeah.

578
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,880
No, I didn't, I didn't, I forgot what the, I know what we were talking about.

579
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,400
I was actually talking about Voices in the Rite.

580
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,840
Voices in the Rite, yeah.

581
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,840
But the Rite itself.

582
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,840
Rite itself was great.

583
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,840
Looks cool.

584
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,840
Yeah, the Rite itself was great.

585
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,160
It's very similar to, I mean, it's trackless.

586
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
Uh-huh.

587
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,160
You know, like.

588
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:37,000
With like some of the same tricks where like, now I don't remember the names of the kid

589
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,000
that hasn't been on in my house in a while, the fox and the rabbit that they pull up in

590
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,720
a car and almost the same way as Mickey and Minnie and yeah, yeah.

591
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
Yeah.

592
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
It's very similar to that.

593
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,320
Uh, it's way better than like, people get mad at me when I say this, but like the Mario

594
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,520
Kart shit is so trash to me.

595
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,520
That's been the take on this show.

596
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,520
That's what we feel.

597
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,520
Yeah.

598
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
It's so trash.

599
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,520
Yeah.

600
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,680
We talked around it for a while and ultimately let, no, I think there's no other way to land

601
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,680
than this.

602
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,680
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

603
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,680
It's sad.

604
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,680
It makes us so sad to say it too.

605
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,680
It is.

606
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,680
It should be very fun.

607
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,680
Yeah.

608
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,360
It's the ultimate slam dunk of a ride.

609
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,360
Yeah.

610
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,360
And yet they figured out a way.

611
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,360
And they just biffed it.

612
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,360
Yeah.

613
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,360
Uh, but Zootopia was fun.

614
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,360
Yeah.

615
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,360
Like it was a fun ride.

616
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,360
It was cool.

617
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,360
It was dope.

618
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,360
Yeah.

619
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,360
Do you end up like, uh, I should know this.

620
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,920
I should have watched her ride through, but like, do they, and in the land in general,

621
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,520
do they, they take advantage of that?

622
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,800
Like now we're in a small world and now we're in a big world, like big size differences.

623
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Yeah.

624
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:40,600
So like, it's like half screen, half like actual sets and stuff like that, but they

625
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,640
also do like, uh, take advantage of like, if you're in a place where it's windy, you

626
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,720
feels like there's a place where it was supposed to be cold and it got super cold and hot and

627
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
stuff like that.

628
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,000
So they take advantage of like all the, the feelings around you and stuff like that.

629
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:01,560
Um, but it is, it is utilizing like screens, but also like animatronics and it was very

630
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,560
well done.

631
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,240
It was like super, super cool.

632
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,440
Um, you'd be happy if this, if this showed up in animal kingdom, which is a possibility

633
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,680
I guess where it should go.

634
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,680
Right?

635
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,680
Yeah.

636
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,680
Yeah.

637
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,680
I think people will love it.

638
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,680
I've not done Ratatouille yet.

639
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,680
We did.

640
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,680
We've all done it now.

641
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,680
Yeah.

642
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,680
You know what?

643
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,680
I think I was kind of underrating it.

644
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,000
I got to do it in Paris kind of right when it opened and was maybe like with all the

645
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,360
build up, maybe built it up too much.

646
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:32,880
And then the way we did it end of the day, end of a long day, uh, tiring day, a wine

647
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,880
filled day.

648
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:39,080
It was like a really nice little like, ah, of a, yeah, if you do it under that, like,

649
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,240
because trackless rides is often you build up that like they're supposed to be, uh, you

650
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,480
know, the thrilling breakneck kind of, but if you view that as like a tourism ride, like

651
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,040
a Soren or something, I think it's a pleasant little ride.

652
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
Yeah.

653
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
It's a chance to do it.

654
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,120
I mean, it was closed when I went to Paris, which was very, it was the only ride closed

655
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,120
when I went to Paris.

656
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,160
What do they have in that park?

657
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,800
What do they have if not Ratatouille?

658
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,200
It was, I was very disappointed.

659
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,200
I was like, and it was when I always laugh at people when they come here, like to Disneyland

660
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,280
because we're local, so we can go anytime, but I always like, man, I came in this ride

661
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,280
was closed.

662
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,720
And I was like, Hey man, I'm big breaks.

663
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:21,240
And then it happened to me and I was like, this was bullshit on the other side of the

664
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,240
earth.

665
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,040
I traveled all the way here and it's closed my money back.

666
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,680
Well, that's what we're, and we'll talk about it soon a little bit, but like it's come up

667
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,240
before, but I didn't get to do Pooh's honey hunt, which still itches at me and isn't that's

668
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,240
a good one, right?

669
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,240
In Tokyo.

670
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,240
Tokyo.

671
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,240
I did not do it actually.

672
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,920
I didn't think I did it either.

673
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
Oh, okay.

674
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,920
I think it was closed.

675
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
Oh, also closed.

676
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,920
Wow.

677
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
We are not.

678
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,920
Mike, you're the only one with any luck.

679
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,920
It's much better than the ones here.

680
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,920
Yeah.

681
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,920
It's trackless.

682
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
First trackless, I believe, right?

683
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,920
In Disney.

684
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,920
Yeah.

685
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,920
That's crazy.

686
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
Yeah.

687
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,800
When I saw it was closed, I was like, ah, that's okay.

688
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,480
Cause I was comparing it to the one here.

689
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,480
I was like, that's fine.

690
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,480
No.

691
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,480
It's not fine.

692
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,480
Dang.

693
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,480
Gotta go back.

694
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,480
You should be upset.

695
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,480
Gotta go back.

696
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,920
Gotta go back.

697
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,560
Did you get something?

698
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,320
I don't know if anybody's really been on our show and talked about Beauty and the Beast.

699
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,320
Did you get that one?

700
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,320
Man.

701
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:22,120
Uh, top, top three, top three rides that I've ever been on at Disney for sure.

702
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,280
That's the Magic Kingdom, it's not called that, but that's the Magic Kingdom Park in

703
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,280
Tokyo.

704
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,280
Yeah.

705
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,280
That's, that's Tokyo Disneyland.

706
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,280
Yeah.

707
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,080
Um, and I didn't know anything about it.

708
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,280
Like I, I didn't, I, I, I purposefully.

709
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,360
Cause like, you know, I'm such a Disney park person.

710
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:45,880
I purposefully like, didn't like look at what rides are there, you know, and stuff like

711
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,880
that.

712
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,800
Cause I wanted to have some surprise.

713
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Yeah.

714
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,360
You rarely have that opportunity to like just bump into things and I literally don't know

715
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,000
what I'm getting on right now.

716
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Exactly.

717
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
It's the greatest.

718
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,120
And I don't have that opportunity in many parks.

719
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,040
Even at, even at Universal Japan, like.

720
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,040
You know what Spider-Man is.

721
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,040
You know what, yeah.

722
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,120
That's what the rides are.

723
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
Right?

724
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,600
So I was like, I didn't look too much.

725
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,240
So when we got, when we were looking, it was like, Oh, this Beauty and the Beast ride is

726
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,440
like, you know, the wait times are pretty high.

727
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,680
Like it must be popular.

728
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,680
Yeah.

729
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,480
And we were able to get like the priority pass forward or something like that.

730
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,360
And we rode it and like this, you know, the big teacups, I'm like, huh, this is interesting.

731
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,440
But I still didn't know what was about to happen.

732
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,400
And then when you get on it and you're in it and like, I'm looking around, I'm like,

733
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,920
this is phenomenal.

734
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,680
This is fucking phenomenal.

735
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,680
Like it was so.

736
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,600
Like some of the nicest rooms they've ever made.

737
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
It seems like.

738
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
Man.

739
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
I got a lot.

740
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,280
I have a lot to say about Shanghai, but I will say this about Tokyo.

741
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,840
Best technology out of any park I've ever been to.

742
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,840
Yeah.

743
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,440
Like the technology at, I mean, there was fucking, I mean, the statues, like this little

744
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,160
statue, this might, who's this?

745
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,160
Leatherface?

746
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,160
Leatherface.

747
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,080
Space where another, where the show movies baby happens on forever dog.

748
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,880
So it's often, you listeners might not know, we're often recording next to a life sized

749
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,520
leather face with a chainsaw that could come on if we plugged it in.

750
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,760
It could, which would be dope.

751
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,760
Oh yeah.

752
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
You got some.

753
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,760
Okay.

754
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,760
That's dope.

755
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,560
Well, at Tokyo Disney, they would sprinkle a little magic and then it would just come

756
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,560
to life.

757
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:27,120
Fully articulated, bending and moving.

758
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,320
It was really, really cool.

759
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,120
Like I loved the technology at Tokyo Disney.

760
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,160
So the technology in that room was dope.

761
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,640
We're jumping all around a little, but do you flash to any, uh, any attractions or,

762
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,680
or just, or, or just buildings or whatever, where you're like, I know this, I know this

763
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,400
from the American parks and then you did the Tokyo version and like, Oh, I don't know that

764
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,440
like they did it so much better.

765
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,440
Yeah.

766
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:56,000
Uh, not, not so much in Tokyo for some of the things that were the same.

767
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,640
Like there were some differences, but I had that experience more actually in Paris with

768
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,640
Haunted Manor.

769
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,640
Oh yeah.

770
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,640
Yeah.

771
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,640
Yeah.

772
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,640
Yeah.

773
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,640
Yeah.

774
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,640
Yeah.

775
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,640
Yeah.

776
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,640
I was on that ride and I was like, this is kind of terrifying.

777
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,640
Yeah.

778
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,640
That is a moody ride.

779
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,640
Yes.

780
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,640
Yeah.

781
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,640
There is a vibe to that.

782
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,640
Yeah.

783
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,640
It sticks.

784
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,640
I like feel something in my chest.

785
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,640
Yeah.

786
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,640
Even remembering it.

787
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,640
And I was not expecting that.

788
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,640
Yeah.

789
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,640
Even though some of the things are the same, it's still the busts and it's still like the

790
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,640
stretch.

791
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,440
Like so many of the things are the same, but it's just the way it's painted in the score

792
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,440
and everything.

793
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,440
Yeah.

794
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,440
It's even the regular stuff scarier.

795
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,440
It is more horror-based.

796
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,880
It also feels like, wait, cause I've only watched a video of it.

797
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,480
It's like you do the cemetery and then you leave through the town, which I assume gives

798
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,920
you like just a, there's a final feeling of leaving through the town and seeing the, whatever

799
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
that guy's name is.

800
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,920
What is it?

801
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,920
Phantom Manor?

802
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,920
The Phantom?

803
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,920
The Phantom?

804
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,920
Yeah.

805
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,280
There's a thing that like lingers with you that way because the last thing you see is

806
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,280
that stuff.

807
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,280
Yeah.

808
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,280
Yeah.

809
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,280
It was really wild.

810
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,280
And it's not just a fun party with the ghosts following you.

811
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,120
What was going on in that town?

812
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,920
I don't even remember specifically, but it's a mood.

813
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,920
It's definitely a mood.

814
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,920
I was surprised by that.

815
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,880
And then Space Mountain in Paris too, like it was pretty much the same, but then all

816
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,880
of a sudden I felt myself going upside down and I was like, what the fuck is going on?

817
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,880
Oh yeah.

818
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,880
Oh, you didn't know it, did you?

819
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,880
I didn't know that.

820
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,880
Oh, this is great.

821
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,880
I love how you experienced it.

822
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,880
Like we've ruined too many things for ourselves.

823
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
I know.

824
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,120
I didn't ruin Journey to the Center of the Earth.

825
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,720
That was the one where I was like, I don't think it's scary enough that I need to like

826
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,840
know that it does, but that was like the rare time.

827
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,840
Like I'm going to make myself not know what the hell is right.

828
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,840
Yeah.

829
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,840
And I'm so glad I did it though.

830
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,840
It was cool.

831
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,840
I like, I really like Journey.

832
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,880
Tokyo Disney was great.

833
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,520
Did you see any of the Fantasy Springs expansion?

834
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,240
It was, I think it was slated to open in June.

835
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,240
Okay.

836
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,240
So it's open now, I think.

837
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,240
Yeah, it is.

838
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,240
Yeah.

839
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,520
I was there late April.

840
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:54,040
So it was pretty, I don't even think I saw where it was.

841
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,440
It's like way back too.

842
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,040
Yeah.

843
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,520
It was pretty well hidden and pretty like, nobody come near here.

844
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,320
That's not like Vasa Coasters getting built in the middle of the park.

845
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,480
They can like fully close that off and still conduct regular business.

846
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,240
It's a huge walk from Disney Seas entrance, I think too, to completely opposite side,

847
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,240
I think.

848
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:20,240
It's like, cause Disney Seas, huge, like it is so big.

849
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,240
Cannot believe.

850
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,240
Yeah.

851
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,600
It was truly one of the most, and just like we went for two days and like toward the end

852
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,720
of the second day, we were still coming up on parts of Disney Seas.

853
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,600
We were like, oh shit, we didn't even know this was over here.

854
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,600
Yeah.

855
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,680
It was so big.

856
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,360
So yeah, no, I didn't see any of Fantasy Springs, but I'm sure it would be dope.

857
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:46,560
I mean, they were getting ready for it, they were passing out stickers and like when we

858
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:51,800
turned the sticker down, cause we had already gotten three, they were like, what?

859
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,840
They start laughing at us like, they don't want a sticker?

860
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,840
I was like, damn.

861
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,120
Aren't you also like knowing that there's this huge, there's this big expansion with

862
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,520
like three mini zones and big new rides.

863
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,880
And you were at Tokyo Disney Sea before that, it's like, it doesn't need that.

864
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,880
It doesn't need it.

865
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,680
I mean, it's great that it has it, but like of all, it's so insane that that of all parks

866
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,920
gets an expansion while here we wait.

867
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,800
There's just full dead zones in the Disneyland resort.

868
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,800
Yeah.

869
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,480
It needs something to happen.

870
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,800
I kind of almost wish like they would start franchising the Disney's out here, like they

871
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,640
do at the ones in Asia.

872
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,640
Cause it's like.

873
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,640
Well, it's just budget.

874
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,640
Yeah.

875
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,880
Budget wise, they'll spend the money.

876
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,880
They spend the money.

877
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,880
Yeah.

878
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,100
They have so much money for the ones that like, I was reading like how much money they

879
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,440
have just for those parks and it's in the millions of dollars.

880
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,440
Yeah.

881
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,160
Well, Shanghai, the full Shanghai resort, there's land to build two more theme parks.

882
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,160
Yeah.

883
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,160
Wow.

884
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,520
It's huge and it's kind of too big.

885
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,520
Right.

886
00:33:54,520 --> 00:34:01,280
Like to start the day at Disney Shanghai, like, cause we took a Uber or taxi or something

887
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:06,360
from our hotel and to get to the, from that to get to the park was almost like a 20 minute

888
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,360
walk.

889
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,200
But like, which is, you know, kind of can be the same here, but it was like a 20 minute

890
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,200
straightaway walk.

891
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,000
It was not like going through different, you know, got to turn these blocks and go through

892
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
a town and shit.

893
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,640
It was like, no, straight to like the park gate is like a 20 minute walk.

894
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,640
That's harder.

895
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,640
Yeah.

896
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,480
You can get tricked if there's like, you're winding and strolling, but oh my God.

897
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:34,040
But the one, all right, so man, when we got out the car, I will say this about Walt Disney.

898
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:40,400
He had, he had it right when he was like, I want to move to places where I can regulate

899
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,120
who's around my park.

900
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,000
Like, because that was needed at Shanghai.

901
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:54,760
As soon as we got out the car, there are hundreds of people trying to sell you bootleg Disney

902
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,760
stuff.

903
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,760
Oh really?

904
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,760
Yes.

905
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,960
To the point where like somebody put their hands on me, like they are opening your car

906
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,960
door.

907
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,960
They're following you.

908
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,680
They're in your space.

909
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,120
And this is on Disney's property.

910
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,120
Oh shit.

911
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,320
It's not like, it's not in the town next to Disney.

912
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,240
You have passed the gate of Disney and like, they are there.

913
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:25,000
And so, and like, and it's the whole 20 minute walk, trying to in your face, selling you

914
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
stuff.

915
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,360
This, I've not even gotten to, we'll talk about nighttime because it's crazy, but like

916
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,200
the whole 20 minute walk.

917
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,720
And so I, like, I just did not expect that.

918
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,720
Like, you know, you don't expect that at Disney.

919
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:45,320
I noticed it in Paris and it's not the full, but like right outside the train station.

920
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:50,240
I was shocked that it's just like people like doing like glowing things that fly up in the

921
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,960
air, like in regular Paris.

922
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,400
I was so surprised to see that anywhere close.

923
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,360
It was, it was, it was crazy.

924
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:06,440
It was truly like, the only thing I could equate it to was like when I go to the Caribbean

925
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:13,640
and everybody's trying to sell you shit, times 20 and throw in time square vibes of

926
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,400
like, just aggressiveness.

927
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
Yeah.

928
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,120
Like it was like, it was, it was really crazy.

929
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:24,520
And, and also at this point, like I'm at the end of the trip, my patience is low and the

930
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,520
dude touched me.

931
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:31,560
Like my, my girlfriend had to like, come on, man, don't get arrested in China because he

932
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,160
literally like grabbed me and turned me around.

933
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,160
Whoa.

934
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,560
And it's nine in the morning.

935
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,840
I'm like, please take your hands off of me.

936
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,120
Like you're dialed in for a Disney day.

937
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,760
You are not expecting to get into a street fight.

938
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,560
It was, it was so insane.

939
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,560
So about it.

940
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,160
So by the time we do that, I'm like, all right.

941
00:36:51,160 --> 00:37:00,400
Can I ask what are they like t-shirts, t-shirts, ears, teddy stuffed animals, like sunscreen,

942
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,400
like everything.

943
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,400
Yeah.

944
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,360
Some of it is knockoff merchandise that you can find in the park.

945
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,480
Others are things that you may need for the day.

946
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,480
Right.

947
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,840
Like there's kids selling shit and adults.

948
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:20,080
It was, it was truly, and it's not even that it was like, I've been around that before,

949
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,080
right?

950
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,000
You know, like, but not at Disney.

951
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,760
So like, that was the jarring part.

952
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,680
Like I was not ready for that in particular.

953
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,680
Yeah.

954
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,520
And are you, you're like on the, you're like on like landscaped grounds and like faint.

955
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,520
It's a small world.

956
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,520
I can see.

957
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,520
Yeah.

958
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,520
I can see the castle.

959
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,520
Weird.

960
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,520
I can see the castle dude.

961
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,520
I've never heard this.

962
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,520
It is.

963
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,520
This is why.

964
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,480
It was, it was so wild.

965
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,520
And like we're walking to the park, we're like, all right.

966
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:52,480
Like, you know, by the time when you get a little closer to the park, it's not as like

967
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,320
aggressive.

968
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,920
So that was like chill.

969
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:03,760
But when we got in the line and this set us up for the whole day, like there's people

970
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,160
smoking in line.

971
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,880
And like, when I say it set us up for the whole day, you will get people smoking in

972
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:17,000
the lines and the rides and the bathrooms, like walking through the park, like it, and

973
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,960
it was so crazy.

974
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:25,200
And it's just like, I get if, if you'd let people get away with this, they will try,

975
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,840
but like, they don't let you get away with this at other Disney's like, right.

976
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,320
That was the crazy part.

977
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,320
Like.

978
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,320
Is it tech?

979
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,320
It's no technically not supposed to be smoking, right?

980
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,320
Yeah.

981
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,320
I looked it up as we were starting.

982
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,320
It's not supposed to be.

983
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,320
Yeah.

984
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,720
And it is like smoking only in certain areas.

985
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,720
Okay.

986
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,720
No.

987
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,720
But they just don't enforce it.

988
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,720
No, they don't.

989
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,720
That's the thing.

990
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,720
They don't enforce anything.

991
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,200
Like they have the sign saying don't piss on the street, but they don't enforce it.

992
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,760
People are actually like not doing it.

993
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,760
Right.

994
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,880
Wait.

995
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,880
I think we also plowed past that.

996
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,280
I knew you said piss and poop percent.

997
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,280
Did you see people peeing?

998
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,280
That's what he said.

999
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,280
Yeah.

1000
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,280
I didn't see anybody shitting, thankfully.

1001
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,280
Okay.

1002
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,280
But I saw two people.

1003
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,280
I saw two people.

1004
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,280
I saw a preteen.

1005
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,280
Where?

1006
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,280
Both children.

1007
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,280
So not adults.

1008
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,280
Okay.

1009
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,280
But I saw a preteen, but their families were with them.

1010
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,760
I saw a preteen just pissing in a bush.

1011
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,120
And then I saw this kid was maybe like six, seven, butt naked.

1012
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:23,680
And his parents were holding a like grocery store bag for him to pee in.

1013
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
But a bag to pee in seems impractical.

1014
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,040
Pooping at least makes more sense.

1015
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,440
It makes, I guess, you know, the bathroom 30 yards away.

1016
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,440
It makes the most sense.

1017
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,440
Regardless of that, I'm just saying.

1018
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
Pooping in a bag makes more sense.

1019
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,440
It makes more sense to me.

1020
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,960
The whole urine is just pure liquid.

1021
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,200
You can scoop up a poop.

1022
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,160
You can scoop up the poop once it's on the ground, but pee you know it's going to spread.

1023
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,160
I understand the thought.

1024
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,040
I'm just saying.

1025
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,400
It's like a diaper that they aren't wearing.

1026
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,400
Yeah.

1027
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
A diaper that you hold out.

1028
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,160
You're like a target.

1029
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:07,360
This is, I mean, she won't care if I say this, but like me and my partner were like having

1030
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,360
a disagreement.

1031
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:17,440
Like, in this hour, you know, 24, 25 days, 25 days together, yeah, we were having a disagreement.

1032
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:23,440
So, we weren't like, you know, we were just like, you know, arguing about something.

1033
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:30,160
I can't even remember what, and like, and we saw this little kid, that was the first

1034
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:36,520
one we saw, the kid like butt naked, and it like snapped us out of our argument.

1035
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:41,080
We were both just like, you saw that, right?

1036
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,240
Like we were fine after that.

1037
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:48,280
Because it was just so jarring, it's so jarring to see that.

1038
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,280
Sure, yeah.

1039
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,320
I wonder what was nearby, do you remember like, this line, this riot, or this sort of

1040
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:01,800
Yeah, it was, like imagine you are walking down the road where like Indiana Jones and

1041
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:08,000
like all, it was like that, it was like food places, and it's not even like seeing the

1042
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,080
kid pee, because kids will do crazy shit.

1043
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:15,760
The parents were assisting this child, and that was the crazy part to me.

1044
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,920
They came with a bag, they knew this was their plan, this is how they do it.

1045
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:26,240
And I'm like, take them to the bathroom, like, it's, I mean like, the Disney's don't not

1046
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,160
have bathrooms there, and they're pretty nice, they're clean.

1047
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,440
Sure, but you know, privacy you find to be a good thing, I think so.

1048
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,720
It's a good thing for everybody, for you and the people around you, there's a reason we

1049
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,720
do this.

1050
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,800
And so, you know, after we see this little naked boy, we're just like, all right, we're

1051
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,800
in for a day.

1052
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,160
And like, but the biggest pet peeve outside of the smoking, the peeing and pooping, in

1053
00:41:52,160 --> 00:42:00,680
the park, was like, you have to stand your ground, or people will cut you.

1054
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,680
Oh man.

1055
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:08,960
And not even like, people will just literally like, brush past you, and be like, no, you're

1056
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,960
not here.

1057
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:15,320
And like, and it's weird because it's not confrontational, like, if you say something

1058
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:20,160
they'll be like, oh, oh, okay, like, they'll back up and be like, oh yeah, yeah.

1059
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,960
But like, it's almost like you don't exist, it's like you don't exist.

1060
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,080
So there's no gate, because like, oftentimes in the American parks, or a Six Flags or something,

1061
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,160
I feel like people will do a trick.

1062
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,040
They'll pretend they're on the phone, they'll pretend, excuse me, they'll pretend somebody's

1063
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,040
ahead.

1064
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,040
I've seen this a lot.

1065
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,160
They go, oh, hey, and they wave to the person, then they go by you, and you're like, I'm

1066
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,160
pretty sure they just.

1067
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,160
Yeah, they just cut.

1068
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,920
So there's a little game that generally is played, I feel like, when I see this.

1069
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,920
There's no games.

1070
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,240
They were like, no, we're just going, we don't want to be here, we're going to go to where

1071
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,240
we want to be.

1072
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,240
Yeah, sure.

1073
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,840
And like, so it was almost to a point where like, and it wasn't every ride, but it was

1074
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:01,720
like two or three, where you almost have to kind of like stand side by side.

1075
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,960
So people like don't rush past you, like, to be your own bodyguards.

1076
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,720
It was, it was so wild.

1077
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:14,760
It was just such all this crazy, and it is the example, and it made me appreciate the

1078
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,760
Disney's here more.

1079
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:23,180
And it made me appreciate, I guess, American decorum, because it's not even because a lot

1080
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:27,960
of the things that people were doing, I would say would happen.

1081
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,460
Maybe not the peeing and the pooping, but like the smoking, the cutting in line, a lot

1082
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:37,260
of that type of stuff would happen if consequence wasn't a thing.

1083
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,260
Right?

1084
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:43,420
Like, if somebody, if somebody would say like, Hey, you can't do that.

1085
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,900
Like I, you know, people would cut everybody, you know, people try it even, but like, it

1086
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,180
would be more rampant.

1087
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,180
Sure.

1088
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,340
It was just like, they did, the Disney workers didn't care.

1089
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,060
Like they did not care.

1090
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:59,220
Like people were smoking in front of cast members, like, and I don't know if it's just

1091
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,380
like, Oh, well, we can't do anything about it.

1092
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,540
Too many people at once doing it.

1093
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,540
Like, I don't know.

1094
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,540
I don't know, dude.

1095
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:10,060
It would be, it would be unenforceable by cast members not making very much money.

1096
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,060
I guess maybe that's it.

1097
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,660
Because so many people are doing things.

1098
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:15,580
It would just be, they would be spending their whole day.

1099
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:16,580
It feels okay.

1100
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,420
If somebody was doing it, like if somebody was smoking, it wouldn't be like 12 people

1101
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,420
smoking in a line.

1102
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,860
It would be like one or two.

1103
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:29,900
So it was easy enough to be like, you put your cigarette out, you can pinpoint who's

1104
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:30,900
doing the things.

1105
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,700
Can I ask this question?

1106
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,380
Was the, with this, as far as the smoking, was there ever a time when somebody was smoking

1107
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:40,060
on a ride where you were like, that's actually cool looking?

1108
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,060
Never on the rides.

1109
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:43,420
It was always in lines and in bathrooms.

1110
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:46,500
Because that's what my dream is, to smoke a cigarette on Pirates of the Caribbean.

1111
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,500
That would be tight.

1112
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,500
Yeah.

1113
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,500
That would be tight.

1114
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:55,060
Did you and your partner go buy cigarettes after witnessing the naked child roaming around?

1115
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,060
We bought crack.

1116
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,060
Oh.

1117
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:02,060
Cause like, look, if they're going to let us do it, we might as well go all out.

1118
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,060
Sure.

1119
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:06,060
We might as well do it all.

1120
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,060
Sure.

1121
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:15,180
Yeah, man, it was, I was just, it was, it was, it was a really weird day.

1122
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:21,180
It was a really weird day because like in the middle of like all this beautiful stuff

1123
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:26,020
and it's still Disney-fied in a way, you just have like, I can't tell you how many times

1124
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:34,820
I got shoulder-checked, like somebody shoulder-checked like my partner, which like, it was just,

1125
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,860
people were rude.

1126
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,260
And they don't care.

1127
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:40,260
Like that was the crazy part.

1128
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:46,220
It was just like, there's no, and, and, you know, I know I'm saying all this and like,

1129
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:49,740
if we're talking percentages, 98% of the people were fine.

1130
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,740
Sure, sure.

1131
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:55,380
But still 2% of like people doing all that is still jarring for Disney.

1132
00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:00,260
I think you, one person does some of this stuff in a regular park day and you remember

1133
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:04,180
it and you clock it and it's a story later, as opposed to you, you're lost and it's happening

1134
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:06,540
so much you can't even pick them up and pick them out.

1135
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:11,780
Yeah, because we were together when we saw the person vape during the Barbossa scene

1136
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:15,860
on Pirates of the Caribbean and it blew smoke up and I'll never forget it, so it stuck with

1137
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:16,860
me forever.

1138
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,860
Yeah.

1139
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:18,860
Because it's not something you see very often.

1140
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,860
It's not something you see very often.

1141
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:20,860
And because you were jealous.

1142
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:21,860
You wanted it to be you.

1143
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:22,860
And because I said that looks fucking cool.

1144
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:23,860
Yeah.

1145
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:24,860
I wish I could do it.

1146
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:25,860
I wish I could do it.

1147
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:26,860
Which you should, look, go to Shanghai.

1148
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:27,860
You will, you can do it.

1149
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:32,220
I will say this, you, I completely forgot about this, to your point like from earlier,

1150
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:35,300
was there any like ride that was just like way, Pirates.

1151
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:36,780
Oh yeah, right.

1152
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,780
In Shanghai.

1153
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:38,780
You've done that.

1154
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:39,780
That's what my question is.

1155
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:40,780
Oh my God.

1156
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:41,780
Nuts.

1157
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:42,780
That's one that I've watched the video just because I'm like, I'll spoil this.

1158
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,820
I don't know, when am I going to get to Shanghai?

1159
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:45,820
That's bonkers.

1160
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:52,020
It is, that, that, yeah, that Beauty and the Beast Pirates, definitely like top like five.

1161
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,020
Wow.

1162
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,020
Like any ride I've ever been on.

1163
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,020
Yeah.

1164
00:46:55,020 --> 00:47:00,900
Like as far as like besides like roller coasters, but like that Pirates ride, I, because they

1165
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:09,100
did the Disney Plus did the Behind the Attraction and one of the episodes was, I think Shanghai

1166
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,100
or something.

1167
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:16,020
I can't remember what, but like I did see on the documentary or something, like it was

1168
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,020
different.

1169
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,500
So I knew it was different going in, right?

1170
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,500
Yeah.

1171
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,900
Even knowing it's different going in, it's still like, this is one of the best things.

1172
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:24,900
Yeah.

1173
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:32,420
You are, you are on a boat that is like going through an entire world.

1174
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:35,980
You're turning, you're like, I mean, like you're going backwards.

1175
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:36,980
You're doing is.

1176
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,420
Does it, does it fake you out?

1177
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:43,580
Like you sort of, it resembles the Pirates, you know, and then starts doing things that

1178
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:44,820
the real boat never could.

1179
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,100
Is there sort of a fake out like that?

1180
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,680
There's a couple, like there's, there's, they really utilize the space really dope.

1181
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,180
Not to spoil, I mean, at this point, if you listen to this, you probably spoiled a lot

1182
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,180
of shit.

1183
00:47:55,020 --> 00:48:00,300
But like, there was a part where like you're on the ride.

1184
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,900
They do really good with like keeping your attention over here while some other shit

1185
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:04,900
is happening.

1186
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:09,460
So like you're looking at some great stuff and it's another thing they use, utilize the

1187
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:12,300
screens and sets and animatronics and things like that.

1188
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,300
Yeah.

1189
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:17,780
So you're looking at like this animatronic in the screen and you're on a boat and it's

1190
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:22,420
just immersive is all you can see then all of a sudden you're like boat turns to the

1191
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:26,740
left and it's a huge boat with the pirate fight going on, like that.

1192
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:29,500
You're just like, where the hell did this come from?

1193
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:35,220
Like, and it's just like a lot of that, like as you're going through it and you go like

1194
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:39,620
these big screens, like simulate going under the water and then going back up above the

1195
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:40,620
water.

1196
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:41,620
Yeah.

1197
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:42,620
Yeah.

1198
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,620
Yeah.

1199
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:44,620
Yeah.

1200
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:45,620
Yeah.

1201
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,940
And this is the one like, you know, there's talk of maybe depth comes out of some of the

1202
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,300
ones here, but not this one.

1203
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,300
Depth's part.

1204
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,300
He's in it.

1205
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:56,580
Sparrow is the, you can't extract sparrow from that version of the ride.

1206
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:59,100
No, he is, he is, he is in it, in it.

1207
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:03,900
Like he, if you were to do it, you would have to like change the entire ride.

1208
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:04,900
You think everything.

1209
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,900
Look at a different theme entirely.

1210
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:06,900
Tron.

1211
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:07,900
It's Tron now.

1212
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:08,900
Yeah.

1213
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:09,900
Yeah.

1214
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,420
Well, that's the Shanghai Bedlam is you can drink, you can piss outside and they're never

1215
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,420
getting rid of sparrow.

1216
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,420
Not even, right.

1217
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:16,140
This is the wild culture.

1218
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:20,540
Listen, for that one, I don't think, I think sparrow would be like a saint for them.

1219
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:21,780
Sure.

1220
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:22,780
They're all emulating it.

1221
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:23,780
They're all emulating it.

1222
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:24,780
I'm just acting like sparrow.

1223
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:27,620
Can I tell you guys the end of the day?

1224
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:29,940
Oh yeah, go ahead.

1225
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:35,380
So we, I am a fan of the Disney fireworks.

1226
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,380
Yeah.

1227
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,380
I love a fireworks show at Disney.

1228
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,380
It's a beautiful thing.

1229
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:42,660
The fireworks show at Tokyo was complete ass.

1230
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:43,660
Really?

1231
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:44,660
It was so bad.

1232
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:48,820
It was like five minutes or less.

1233
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:51,900
It's not a theme to it.

1234
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,420
It's like not even over the cat.

1235
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:57,580
They put it in a place where you could see the fireworks show from both Disneyland and

1236
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:58,900
Disney Sea.

1237
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,660
So it's not really over anything.

1238
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,980
It's just kind of randomly in the middle of the sky.

1239
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:03,980
Yeah.

1240
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:04,980
Music playing.

1241
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:10,460
It's just like, it's like a, it's like a Burbank 4th of July fireworks show.

1242
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:13,460
And so I was like, that was terrible.

1243
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:18,060
So like I had heard the Shanghai fireworks show was beautiful.

1244
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,700
I purchased like a thing where we can get like good seats for it.

1245
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:22,860
It was like $20.

1246
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,740
So it wasn't that expensive, but it was like, you're right in the middle.

1247
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:26,740
It was gorgeous.

1248
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:29,580
One of the best fireworks shows I'd ever seen.

1249
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,900
We're riding this beautiful high flag.

1250
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:36,460
It's the end of the day, even after all this crazy shit, we're like, ah, that was a Disney

1251
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,460
day.

1252
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:38,620
Like it feels great.

1253
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:43,900
And we walk out the park and all those people that were there in the beginning of the day

1254
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:47,020
are also there at the end of the day.

1255
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:54,580
However, also there at the end of the day, where at least one to 200 security guards

1256
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,580
on bullhorns.

1257
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:56,940
Oh my God.

1258
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:04,380
Just repeatedly, like, like, like at full volume, repeatedly, it's in another language,

1259
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:12,140
but like just, and it's like that nonstop.

1260
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:16,660
When I tell you it was like, I, I, you know, if you went, if you've been to some protests,

1261
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:21,340
if you were going to those protests in 2020, when the cops were like aggressive toward

1262
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:27,940
like the, it was like that and it was like, yes, this is a problem.

1263
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:31,100
Like the people selling things, cause that's what they're doing it to.

1264
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:33,820
They're doing it to like push all those people away.

1265
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:40,320
So they're like, so like there would be 20 people like chasing one person selling something

1266
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,860
to push them out and the bullhorns are basically yelling at them.

1267
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,460
So I'm like, is that a problem?

1268
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:47,460
Is it annoying?

1269
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:48,460
Yes.

1270
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:52,980
But you guys are making it much worse.

1271
00:51:52,980 --> 00:52:00,660
It was the most aggressive, like it truly, I truly felt like I was in like, in like a

1272
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:03,660
police state, like it was crazy.

1273
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:09,300
And it was like, my, my partner was like this, like I'm stressed.

1274
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,300
I was stressed.

1275
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,300
Yeah.

1276
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:13,140
It was the craziest.

1277
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:16,900
I wish I would have got like a video of it, but I was just so like, what the hell is going

1278
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:17,900
on?

1279
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:22,780
And I didn't even like think to do it, but I was like, after this beautiful, magical

1280
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:30,020
like end of the day, we walk out to the most aggressive energy that I could possibly.

1281
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:37,700
And it's like this on that entire 20 minute walk back to where we need to go.

1282
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:42,140
It was, it was the craziest shit I've ever experienced in my life.

1283
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:44,060
And that must happen every night.

1284
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,060
It must.

1285
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:47,620
Like the second day we went, we were only there for a half day.

1286
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:48,860
So we left in the middle of the day.

1287
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:51,540
So it was like, it was like a peaceful exit.

1288
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:55,780
Like, I was like, this is great.

1289
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:58,100
But like, it must be like that every night.

1290
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,180
At least it was like that the night I went.

1291
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,180
Yeah.

1292
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:07,940
And this is in third downtown Disney, Disney Springs, which is called Disney town.

1293
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:08,940
Disney town.

1294
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:09,940
Yeah.

1295
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:10,940
It's in Disney town.

1296
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:16,220
It is in like the way back to like where it, you know, if you took a bus, a shuttle parked

1297
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:19,340
taxi is on the way back to that stuff as well.

1298
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:21,620
But it is literally like, as soon as you exit the park.

1299
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:24,140
I'm trying to figure out, I just don't want to see this on street view.

1300
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:28,580
Like what is this route that I want to know like the official name of it.

1301
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,580
The route.

1302
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,580
I don't even know what it's got.

1303
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:36,340
You walk over a huge bridge and then like there is you walk through parts before you

1304
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:40,020
can like go off to like Disney town because there's a huge lake.

1305
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,020
Okay.

1306
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:42,020
Yeah.

1307
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,020
There's so much property there.

1308
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,020
That's the crazy thing.

1309
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,460
It's a lot of property there.

1310
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:51,420
You also go up this long escalate, this long escalator, similar to like a universal escalator

1311
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,420
to get up.

1312
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:53,420
Starway.

1313
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:54,420
Yes.

1314
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,420
Yeah.

1315
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:57,260
Yeah, man.

1316
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:06,700
It like, it was just a cheesecake factory, eating cheesecake, just hear screaming bullhorns

1317
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,700
outside.

1318
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:08,700
Bro.

1319
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:12,300
It was, it was the wildest shit I've ever experienced in my life.

1320
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:19,740
And like, I grew up on the south side of Chicago and I was just like, I have been around police

1321
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,740
officers.

1322
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,140
I've been around gunshots.

1323
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,940
I've been around all types of shit.

1324
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:31,140
And at the end of this Disney day at Shanghai, I was like, this is the most aggressive energy

1325
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:35,380
that I've ever felt like leaving a place in my life.

1326
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:37,500
This felt like watching Disney fall.

1327
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,740
This is like, this is the state overtaking.

1328
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:41,740
It was wild.

1329
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:42,740
Disney town.

1330
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:46,860
And it's just like, again, I know those Disney's are franchised.

1331
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:53,380
So Disney itself doesn't have a say, but I'm like, if this were to happen at Disneyland

1332
00:54:53,380 --> 00:55:01,300
or Disney World, like the way they stop that is just don't allow those people on the property.

1333
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:05,420
You don't bring like a tank.

1334
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:10,700
Disney Springs rolling it around like, if you don't leave, we gonna fuck y'all up.

1335
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:12,580
Like, they're not doing that.

1336
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:16,020
Like, they just don't, you just don't get on the property.

1337
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,020
Right.

1338
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:18,020
Yes.

1339
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:22,220
Warnay, please vacate, but also come back tomorrow and just be nicer tomorrow.

1340
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:23,220
That's the thing.

1341
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,180
You can come back tomorrow, but leave now.

1342
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:29,860
We know you'll be back tomorrow, but today you should leave.

1343
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:33,940
Leaving Tokyo, Disney, I was like, man, you know, we just suck in America.

1344
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:39,420
And then after Shanghai, I was like, I can't wait to get the fuck back to like, like some

1345
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:42,420
American decorum.

1346
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:43,420
Some Florida decorum.

1347
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:44,420
Yeah.

1348
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:51,220
Where shit makes sense, you know, they may not like me cause I'm black, but they won't

1349
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:53,300
put a bullhorn on my face.

1350
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,100
It's just dirty looks.

1351
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,100
It's just dirty looks.

1352
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:04,700
A man is trying to sell me a fucked up looking Cluedo, 10 police officers are chasing him.

1353
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,980
It was, it was, it was so funny, man.

1354
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,700
It was, it was just so crazy.

1355
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:14,180
It was, it was the wildest thing and it was like the last park out of the whole trip.

1356
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,180
So it was just like the final image.

1357
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,180
That was the end of the trip.

1358
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,180
Way to go out.

1359
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:18,180
It was the end of the trip.

1360
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,180
Oh my God.

1361
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:21,940
My wife and I both cried when we left Tokyo.

1362
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:24,260
We're on the plane tearing up because we didn't want to leave.

1363
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:25,260
This is the opposite.

1364
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:27,260
You're like, I was like, yeah, we can go.

1365
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,020
I don't have to come back to Shanghai.

1366
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,020
You're blowing noisemakers.

1367
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,020
All right.

1368
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,020
America.

1369
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,020
Like Disney Tokyo.

1370
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:34,020
I'll go back any day.

1371
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:37,020
I cannot wait to be in LAX.

1372
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,020
Seriously.

1373
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,420
A place with clarity and order.

1374
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:41,420
And order.

1375
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:42,420
Law and order.

1376
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:49,020
I do love like, I copy, just to remember wherever you've been, I copy pasted your

1377
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:53,860
DMs into my notes and I am looking at the phrase, you know, crowd culture differences.

1378
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:56,860
I'm like, well, you really underplayed.

1379
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,180
I didn't think piss bags would be part of that.

1380
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:00,580
It was, it was really wild, man.

1381
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:06,140
Like I, cause you know, look, again, I've been to so many, I've been to every, at this

1382
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:10,580
point until next year, when the new universal opens up, I've been to every universal gate.

1383
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:13,580
I've only not been to one like Disney gate.

1384
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:15,100
I've been to like Cedar point.

1385
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,220
I've been to bush gardens.

1386
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:17,900
I've been to all the shit here.

1387
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,940
Like I've been to so many theme parks.

1388
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,740
I was a teenager at Six Flags.

1389
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:27,580
Like I've been to parks where like, you know, people are wild, right?

1390
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:33,500
And so like, you know, it is, I'm 37, it is very rare where you can have experiences where

1391
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:39,180
like I just truly was not expecting like that.

1392
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:44,500
And I walked out of that was like, and the weird part about it is it would even make

1393
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:51,980
a little bit more sense if it was just a full trash day, if it was just like that Disney

1394
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,620
just sucked everything about it.

1395
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:58,420
But it was like, it still had the Disney world in it.

1396
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,780
Your favorite fireworks.

1397
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:05,060
Yeah, it was, it was like my least favorite hellish mile where I was screamed at by bull

1398
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:06,060
horns.

1399
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:10,580
It's like the most, it's the juxtaposition that was the problem or it was the like whiplash.

1400
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:11,580
It was the whiplash.

1401
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:12,580
Yeah.

1402
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:16,380
I hate to keep bringing up a pro, but if I'm at a protest and this shit has happened, I'm

1403
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:17,380
like, yeah, this makes sense.

1404
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:18,380
Yeah.

1405
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:21,580
It's a little stranger next to a giant Lego store.

1406
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:22,580
Yeah.

1407
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:23,580
Yeah.

1408
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:27,980
You're at a protest, but then like you go on a boat ride to like see Johnny Depp and

1409
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:29,380
then it's like the most magical thing.

1410
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:33,940
It's the most magical thing and then you walk out and you know, somebody's pooping in a

1411
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:34,940
bush.

1412
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:35,940
It was crazy, man.

1413
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:36,940
It was crazy.

1414
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,100
It was crazy.

1415
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,100
It's a very unique experience.

1416
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,100
I had never heard that.

1417
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,100
Okay.

1418
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:45,660
So, you know, just, just spoilers, I guess, if you, if you don't want the parks, if you

1419
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:50,180
go to Shanghai, you don't want to rune for you, Zootopia is a trackless ride system.

1420
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:56,620
And when you leave, you are accosted and scared for, you're part of an, you're part of an

1421
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,780
unwilling haunt experience.

1422
00:58:58,780 --> 00:58:59,780
That is real.

1423
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:00,780
That is so real.

1424
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:04,060
And look, man, you, you know, you can get some Disney ears for maybe a half a price

1425
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:05,060
if you want.

1426
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:06,060
It's probably some deals though.

1427
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:07,180
You can get some deals.

1428
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:08,180
There's some deals.

1429
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:09,180
You can probably get some deals.

1430
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,180
Yeah.

1431
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,180
Honestly, you can probably get some deals.

1432
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,180
A piss bag with Huey on it.

1433
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:13,180
Yeah.

1434
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:14,180
Get your piss bags here.

1435
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,180
An off model Huey.

1436
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,180
Yeah.

1437
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:17,180
But he still is Huey.

1438
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:18,180
He looks like Huey.

1439
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,180
He's Huey.

1440
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,180
But he's still.

1441
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:21,180
Man.

1442
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,180
This is crazy.

1443
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:23,180
Yeah, dude.

1444
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:30,820
I, if, if I got to go for free, I would go back to Disney Shanghai, uh, because the park

1445
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:31,820
is fun.

1446
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:32,820
The park is cool.

1447
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:35,020
There was some rides there that were like really great.

1448
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:38,780
Um, I'm almost sure Tron was, yeah, Tron is there.

1449
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:41,660
Did you do the Buzz Lightyear ride?

1450
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:42,660
Looks crazy.

1451
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:43,660
Yeah.

1452
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:44,660
I did do that.

1453
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:45,660
It was fun.

1454
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:46,660
It was, it was super fun.

1455
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:47,660
Was it different?

1456
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:48,660
What's up with that one?

1457
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:51,980
It's just like very built up and there's a lot of animatronics and robots.

1458
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:52,980
There's more animatronics.

1459
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,580
It's like a bigger budget version of it.

1460
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:55,580
Yeah.

1461
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:56,580
Yeah.

1462
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,580
Yeah.

1463
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:58,580
It's still the same type of ride.

1464
00:59:58,580 --> 00:59:59,580
Sure.

1465
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:00,580
Sure.

1466
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:02,580
Um, as far as like what you're doing, but like, it's just bad.

1467
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:03,580
Better.

1468
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:04,580
Yeah.

1469
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:05,580
Um, in that aspect.

1470
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:09,540
There's something called, there looks like this very pleasant boat ride that kind of

1471
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:13,460
goes around the castle and it's lots of little like fairy tale scenes.

1472
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:14,460
Did you do that?

1473
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:15,460
Did you do that?

1474
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:16,460
Does that sound familiar?

1475
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:17,460
Yeah, that sounds familiar.

1476
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:18,460
I can't.

1477
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:19,460
Voyage to the Crystal Grotto.

1478
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,740
Do you remember, did you voyage to the Crystal Grotto?

1479
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:23,980
Did I voyage to the Crystal Grotto?

1480
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:24,980
Like I'm sure I did.

1481
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:31,860
It seems like a very like slight ride, but like very pleasant and that kind of like uses

1482
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,460
castle environment in a way you don't always see.

1483
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:40,940
It seems like a kind of like updated storybook land and like here's just like pastoral grounds

1484
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:41,940
and gentle.

1485
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:42,940
Okay.

1486
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:43,940
That's the thing.

1487
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,580
I did, we, I did so much that like so much stuff blends together.

1488
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:51,540
So I did do that and it, and it kind of lets you off in like a Alice in Wonderland or near

1489
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:56,540
Alice in Wonderland type like land or area or something like that.

1490
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:57,540
Okay.

1491
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:00,260
Um, but it's right around a castle and this really is really cute.

1492
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:03,820
You see like what I'm looking at now, there's like Beers Beauty and the Beast, right?

1493
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:08,460
Like they'd dance for a second and then like Aladdin and then Genie on a carpet and, and

1494
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:10,820
it's all fountains and just looks nice.

1495
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:12,180
That's of all the ride throughs I've watched.

1496
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:14,260
This one seems like it'd be kind of a quiet leave.

1497
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:18,900
It was very much like storybook canal or whatever they call it here.

1498
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:23,780
Storybook land or whatever, the bold ride, but just, you know, better.

1499
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:27,900
They got more money for their stuff there, which is, you know, so a lot of the things

1500
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,380
are much better.

1501
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:30,500
Yeah.

1502
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:34,380
As far as like just the experience of the ride or how much money they have.

1503
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:35,380
Yeah.

1504
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:38,420
The castle is the castle, the biggest castle, right?

1505
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:42,660
Or did the new Hong Kong, did that make it bigger when they just, they expanded the castle

1506
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:44,380
in Hong Kong and made it bigger.

1507
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:45,380
But this is the biggest.

1508
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:48,660
This is the one where the castle is like, if you look at it and if you like divide it

1509
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:52,580
into fifths, it's kind of like, they all nod to the different castles.

1510
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:54,460
Are you talking about the one in Shanghai?

1511
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,460
Yeah.

1512
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:56,460
Yeah.

1513
01:01:56,540 --> 01:02:00,940
So that sliver of it is kind of a nod to Cinderella Castle and this part is Sleeping

1514
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:01,940
Beauty.

1515
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:03,860
Or is that the Shanghai one?

1516
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:04,860
Or is that Hong Kong?

1517
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:05,860
No, that's Hong Kong.

1518
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:08,860
I think that's Hong Kong.

1519
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:11,500
Now I'm looking to see like what the...

1520
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:18,340
So the castle at, the castle at Shanghai is pretty basic.

1521
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:25,460
I think the castle at Disney, Tokyo Disneyland was probably more impressive to me, I think.

1522
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:27,700
I think, if I'm remembering.

1523
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,900
This is, it is the Shanghai is the biggest one.

1524
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:31,900
The Shanghai is the biggest one?

1525
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:32,900
Okay.

1526
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:33,900
So maybe that's the one.

1527
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:34,900
Maybe that's the one I'm thinking of.

1528
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:41,060
They also have a, on the attraction list, on the English language website, there is

1529
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:46,100
in Disney town one attraction just labeled Giant Donald Duck.

1530
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,100
Yep.

1531
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,100
Wow.

1532
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:52,660
There's a big, by the lake, there is a big inflatable Donald Duck, which is also funny

1533
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:56,460
imagining like bull horns next to big Donald Duck.

1534
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:57,460
And it was.

1535
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:59,460
There's bull horns next to it.

1536
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:00,460
Oh yeah.

1537
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:01,460
That's just like pavement.

1538
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:04,900
That's really not dressed or...

1539
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:09,820
No, it's just in the middle of the water and you just walk up to it and it's cool, it's

1540
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:10,820
very big.

1541
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:13,820
I know, I'm a big fan of that.

1542
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:16,900
Does it feel fair to call it an attraction or does that feel like overseeing it?

1543
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:17,900
No.

1544
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:18,900
No, it's a photo spot.

1545
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:19,900
It's just listed under.

1546
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:25,580
It's definitely a photo spot, but you know, because like I said, we, the second day we

1547
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:30,380
left midday and before we went out and it was so peaceful, we went to go sit by the

1548
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:34,380
water and sit right in front of it because we was like, we didn't get this experience

1549
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:35,380
last night.

1550
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:42,820
Let's just have a peaceful last 10 minutes as we say goodbye to get the hell out of here.

1551
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:43,820
This is crazy.

1552
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,820
Wow.

1553
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:45,820
Wow.

1554
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:46,820
Do you remember anything else about Disney town?

1555
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,740
Disney town was pretty basic.

1556
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:52,100
I didn't go to that much.

1557
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:55,740
It was just a few restaurants.

1558
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:58,140
Nothing is as impressive as Disney Springs.

1559
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:04,620
Did you have any, did you stop anywhere, let me switch to Universal Osaka because you're

1560
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:11,580
probably one of the only people who's at least walked through City Walk Japan.

1561
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:12,700
Did you do anything?

1562
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:14,100
Did you notice anything?

1563
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,580
Is there anything to, would it be?

1564
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:20,780
I guess what I'm asking is would City Walk Japan have the fuel for a 19 parts or more

1565
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:25,580
daily series that a podcast like this might do?

1566
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:26,580
Probably not.

1567
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:27,580
Okay.

1568
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:35,740
I would say it's probably a mix between, it's probably a mix between Hollywood and Orlando.

1569
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:43,020
So like the one in Orlando is huge and the one here is very cool, but it's a lot smaller

1570
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:45,540
and the one there is probably a mix between the two.

1571
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:49,380
So it's not as big, but it's bigger than the one here.

1572
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:50,380
Okay.

1573
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:51,380
I like that.

1574
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:52,380
That's good.

1575
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:57,020
So it's definitely more space, but it has a vibe to the one here as opposed to the one

1576
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:58,020
in Orlando.

1577
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:03,100
Scott, what if I were to tell you City Walk Osaka, because I looked this up last night

1578
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:10,740
to compare it to Disney town, City Walk Osaka has a TGI Fridays and a Red Lobster.

1579
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:11,740
They do.

1580
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:12,740
All right.

1581
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:15,660
They're going to get factory stores so you can get some great deals.

1582
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:16,660
All right.

1583
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:18,700
Well, City Walk Japan Saga next year then, I guess.

1584
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:19,700
There you go.

1585
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:20,700
Why next year?

1586
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,180
Why not in a couple of months?

1587
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:25,180
I mean, listen, there's still six months left in this year, you know?

1588
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:26,180
That's true.

1589
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:27,180
A lot to go.

1590
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:28,180
A lot to go.

1591
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:30,940
I think we've all got another saga in us, right?

1592
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:34,260
It only takes 13 hours to get over there, you know?

1593
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:35,260
You can find that time in six months.

1594
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:36,260
Jason, you ready?

1595
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:37,260
Let's go to Japan.

1596
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:38,260
Yeah.

1597
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:41,220
You would definitely have some good times.

1598
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:45,140
You can get like a five-part saga.

1599
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:46,140
At least a five.

1600
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:47,140
Okay, okay.

1601
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:48,140
At least a five.

1602
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:51,540
Well, five in your numbers equals what, 25 to us?

1603
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:52,540
Okay.

1604
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:53,540
Sure.

1605
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:54,540
That's about it.

1606
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:55,540
Yeah.

1607
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:56,540
25.

1608
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:57,540
Great, great.

1609
01:05:57,540 --> 01:05:58,540
25.

1610
01:05:58,540 --> 01:05:59,540
Osaka, Japan was cool though.

1611
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:00,540
Osaka, Japan.

1612
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:03,780
Universal Osaka was cool.

1613
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:04,780
I had a good time there.

1614
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:06,780
I was only there for one day.

1615
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:07,900
It was really chill.

1616
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:09,980
It was the Nintendo World.

1617
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:14,140
I mean, I really want to like Nintendo World.

1618
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:15,140
I will say this.

1619
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:16,140
I'm not a huge Nintendo.

1620
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:17,860
I was always a Sega Genesis fan.

1621
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:18,860
Oh, okay.

1622
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:19,860
Okay.

1623
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:28,300
Nintendo, I played a lot as I've grown up.

1624
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:30,380
So I don't have as much, so I will say this.

1625
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:34,980
I don't have as much nostalgia for Nintendo as somebody who would.

1626
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:38,260
I hate to tell you this, I don't think that's helping anything.

1627
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,260
It doesn't.

1628
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:43,620
I think why I was more of a Nintendo kid doesn't mean I don't find this one not super crowded

1629
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:44,620
and irritating.

1630
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:50,140
It's so, and so like I went to the one in Universal Japan because like the one here

1631
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:52,140
to me is just bad.

1632
01:06:52,140 --> 01:07:00,300
It's so, it's too small, it's too crowded, and there's nothing to do for how crowded

1633
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:01,300
it gets.

1634
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:02,700
There's just nothing to do in there.

1635
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:05,500
So I was like, all right, maybe the one in Japan will be bigger, which it is.

1636
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:06,500
It's two stories.

1637
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:11,700
You know, they have two levels, still just as crowded though, and still really nothing

1638
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:12,700
to do.

1639
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:17,980
Like they got the one ride where like we got, because we went during Golden Week, so it

1640
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:20,540
was very busy in Japan when we went.

1641
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:21,540
Oh, right, right.

1642
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:23,580
And so we got express tickets.

1643
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:24,580
Okay.

1644
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:29,820
And so we were able to get express into the Mario Kart and whatever the Ouija ride or

1645
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:31,020
whatever it was.

1646
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:32,780
So we did the Ouija ride or whatever.

1647
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:33,780
The Yoshi ride?

1648
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:34,780
The Yoshi ride, yes.

1649
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:39,620
And see, that's how much I'm not a Disney or a Nintendo.

1650
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:43,580
The Yoshi ride and like, we were like, all right, this looks cool, it looks cute.

1651
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:49,980
And we went on it and I was like, I would rather stand in line for an hour and a half

1652
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:53,660
to go on that like 30 second Harry Potter ride.

1653
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:58,260
That like the flight of the hitter, yeah, which is the most annoying thing to stand

1654
01:07:58,260 --> 01:07:59,260
in line for.

1655
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:02,380
You just can't, if there's any line, it's too much line.

1656
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:05,260
And I would rather stand in line for that than go on this Yoshi ride.

1657
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:06,260
It was...

1658
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:07,260
Wow, really?

1659
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:08,260
Wow.

1660
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:13,860
It was, it moves three miles an hour and there's nothing to do.

1661
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:18,420
Like you press, you're supposed to press buttons and you're pressing it and nothing

1662
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:19,420
is happening.

1663
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:23,740
I'm like, this is, and by the end we were like, oh, okay, maybe the ride is about to

1664
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:24,740
pick up now.

1665
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:26,060
And it was like, oh no, it's time to get off.

1666
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,060
Oh man.

1667
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:33,780
See, we're looking at it like the key mistake was not doing the Yoshi ride, which seems

1668
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:37,780
so charming and brings so much life to the, and you're telling us like, no, the Yoshi

1669
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:38,780
ride is not...

1670
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:39,780
It was bad.

1671
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:46,140
Again, you know, maybe I don't have the nostalgia, the nostalgia for Mario world, but I really

1672
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:47,140
wanted...

1673
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:48,140
I like Yoshi, but I can look at a picture of Yoshi.

1674
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:49,140
You can look at a picture.

1675
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:50,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1676
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:51,140
Do I want to wait in that line?

1677
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:54,020
And you might see, that's the part.

1678
01:08:54,020 --> 01:09:01,300
If it was a 33 second line to get on a ride, by all means, but like that line, we did express,

1679
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:05,580
so we got right on, but that line was up to like two hours.

1680
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:12,140
And I was like, if I would have waited two hours to ride this, I would be an international

1681
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:20,500
news story because I would have flipped my fucking lid, like I would have been so mad.

1682
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:30,420
Man melts down, caught on 100 cell phones, fake Yoshi eggs smashed, American diplomats

1683
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:37,700
sent to embassy to retrieve American man riding diplomatic relations.

1684
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:44,820
An American started hopping on tourists' heads as if he is Mario.

1685
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:46,540
Real life Mario incident.

1686
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:51,820
Did you go to universal Beijing or just Shanghai?

1687
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:52,820
There's a universal Beijing?

1688
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:53,820
Okay, so now...

1689
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:54,820
This is where we're going to start.

1690
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:55,820
Oh shit, so I have not been to every universal.

1691
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:56,820
You do have more universals to go, I think.

1692
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:57,820
Damn.

1693
01:09:57,820 --> 01:09:58,820
Okay.

1694
01:09:58,820 --> 01:09:59,820
Is there also Singapore?

1695
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:00,820
Singapore?

1696
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:01,820
Yes.

1697
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:02,820
Do you have any universals, is it?

1698
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:03,820
More coming.

1699
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:04,820
Sorry.

1700
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:05,820
There's going to be assignments.

1701
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:06,820
Right.

1702
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:13,700
You're going to have, with your foreign correspond duties now on our show, I think you're going

1703
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:15,500
to have to go back and report.

1704
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:19,060
My plan is to go to Disney, Hong Kong in the next two-ish years.

1705
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:20,060
Okay.

1706
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:23,500
Which one of those is closest to Beijing, I think?

1707
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,500
Beijing, I think, is probably the closest to that.

1708
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:26,500
I'll throw that in.

1709
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,100
I forget what's special about it.

1710
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:31,420
That's the one that we've discovered has an entire, even though it was built in the last

1711
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:37,500
couple of years, they have a new Waterworld land, not just the show, it's an entire land

1712
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,500
that is Waterworld.

1713
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,500
That's fun.

1714
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:40,500
The relevant film in 2024.

1715
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,660
Listen, I love Waterworld.

1716
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:43,980
They have Waterworld in Osaka.

1717
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:44,980
Oh yeah, that's right.

1718
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:47,140
I got to be a part of it a little bit.

1719
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:48,140
Oh really?

1720
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:49,140
Whoa.

1721
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:51,220
Because I was the only black person there.

1722
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:59,180
So I stood out, and I had on a little Dragon Ball Z shirt, and they were just loving me.

1723
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:00,860
They was like, yeah, come here.

1724
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:06,180
They brought me up to pour water in one of the people's faces, and then my little stick

1725
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:09,180
didn't have water in it, and then they just doused me with water.

1726
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:10,180
Oh, classic bit.

1727
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:11,180
Really?

1728
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:12,180
The classic bit.

1729
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:13,180
The classic bit.

1730
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:14,180
Wow.

1731
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:20,420
So that was fun, and after we were leaving, people was like, yeah!

1732
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:21,420
So that was super fun.

1733
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:22,420
Wow.

1734
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:27,060
I love the Waterworld show, and my girlfriend had never seen the one here, so that was her

1735
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:28,060
first one.

1736
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:29,060
Oh yeah.

1737
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:30,060
Wow.

1738
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:35,380
Which was very funny, too, because the dude who plays the main hero, I think, didn't know

1739
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:42,500
any Japanese, so he literally was mute the entire time, and I was trying to remember,

1740
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:45,020
he talks in the show here, right?

1741
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:46,020
Yeah.

1742
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:47,020
Mute.

1743
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:48,020
Didn't say a single word.

1744
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:49,020
Wow.

1745
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:50,020
Not a single word.

1746
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:51,020
That's one way to play after what he's seen.

1747
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:52,020
After what he's seen.

1748
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:53,020
Yeah.

1749
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:54,020
Waterworlds.

1750
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:55,020
Yeah, yeah.

1751
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:56,020
After the piss he's drunk.

1752
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:58,620
Yeah, the Mariner does drink piss at one point in the movie.

1753
01:11:58,620 --> 01:11:59,620
So funny.

1754
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:03,260
I don't think I've ever seen the movie, and I don't think I have to.

1755
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:04,260
I've seen the show.

1756
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:06,580
The show is more of the thing now.

1757
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:08,740
That's really the main thing you've got to see.

1758
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:13,620
Potentially the plan in Shanghai with those guests, by the way, possibly, you need a little

1759
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:14,620
refresher later.

1760
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:15,620
You need a refresher.

1761
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:16,620
You got your piss bag.

1762
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:17,620
You got your piss bag.

1763
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:18,620
Maybe that's why they do it.

1764
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:19,620
Maybe that's why they do it.

1765
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:20,620
Maybe that's why they do it.

1766
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:21,620
Classic bag, yeah.

1767
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:22,620
The drinks are expensive there.

1768
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:26,260
They've got those straws now, like life straws, where if you're stranded or something, you

1769
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:31,300
could potentially, I think, drink pee with the straw, and it'll filter out the bad stuff.

1770
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:32,300
Life straws.

1771
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:33,300
Really?

1772
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:34,300
I don't know that the life straw says you should drink pee.

1773
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:37,220
I think it's more for just like if you're in the middle of somewhere and you had to

1774
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:39,980
drink water, you're not sure if it's filtered or not.

1775
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:41,380
But I bet it might work on pee.

1776
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:42,380
Okay, I'm sure it would.

1777
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:44,900
But you could just try using a light.

1778
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:45,900
You have life straws?

1779
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:46,900
Yeah.

1780
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:47,900
That was my next question.

1781
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:49,300
Have you purchased life straws?

1782
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:50,300
I have a few, sure.

1783
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:51,300
I think you have an assignment.

1784
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:52,300
To pee in the ...

1785
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:53,300
Well, I could just ...

1786
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:54,300
The Mariner Challenge.

1787
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:55,300
Should I just put the straw in the toilet?

1788
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:56,300
The Mariner Challenge.

1789
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:59,300
I just put the straw in the toilet after I go.

1790
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:00,300
Don't be disgusting.

1791
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:01,300
Yeah.

1792
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,300
Have some decorum.

1793
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,300
Use a coffee mug or something.

1794
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:08,300
It's hard to pee in a coffee mug though.

1795
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,300
Have some American decorum.

1796
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:10,300
Yeah.

1797
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:11,300
Okay.

1798
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:12,300
Pee in a mug and drink that.

1799
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:13,300
Okay.

1800
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,340
I think if you could do it ... All right.

1801
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:20,900
So we are going to make you drink piss for the show, but if we have you do it in a Trader

1802
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:25,340
Sam's Tiki mug that looks like a robot or something and you can line the room with sugar,

1803
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:29,980
we will let you prepare the best glass possible out of which to drink your own pee, which

1804
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:32,060
I think it might make you enjoy the experience, right?

1805
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:33,060
It might.

1806
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:34,060
If there was a sugar rim.

1807
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:35,060
Yeah.

1808
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:37,580
And it's a fun character.

1809
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:38,580
Wow.

1810
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:45,780
So I have the Hat Box Goes Tiki Mug from Trader Sam's and I'll just put sugar on his rim.

1811
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:46,780
On his hat rim.

1812
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:47,780
On his hat.

1813
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:48,780
Not his ...

1814
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:51,780
I'm not rimming the Hat Box Goes asshole.

1815
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:52,780
Here's a tip.

1816
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:55,780
Put sugar on a rim for a delightful experience.

1817
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:58,780
His hat rim, folks.

1818
01:13:58,780 --> 01:13:59,780
And then I'll pee in it.

1819
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:00,780
Okay.

1820
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:01,780
And drink it.

1821
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:02,780
Wait, is it the word brim?

1822
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:03,780
Is that the ... Is that a hat?

1823
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:04,780
It is.

1824
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:05,780
That is a part of a hat.

1825
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:06,780
It's not a rim.

1826
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:07,780
It's a brim.

1827
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:08,780
Well, the brim is here.

1828
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:11,380
You're pointing to your eye, but you're pointing ... Oh, but you would have to drink it out

1829
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:12,380
of the top so that it would be a rim.

1830
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:13,380
Yeah, it would have to be at the top.

1831
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:14,380
More of the rim of his hat.

1832
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:15,380
Got it.

1833
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:16,380
All right.

1834
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:17,380
Never mind.

1835
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:18,380
Okay.

1836
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:19,380
Little top of hat.

1837
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:23,620
Can you ... Do you think the LifeStraw ... Can you put a silly straw on top of a LifeStraw?

1838
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:27,020
Or does LifeStraw make a silly version of their straw?

1839
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:28,020
That's the way it is.

1840
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:29,260
Why not have fun in a survival situation?

1841
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:30,260
Why not have fun?

1842
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:31,260
Why not have fun?

1843
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:32,260
Let me Google to see if they have that.

1844
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:35,020
Why not make the water take longer to get to you?

1845
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:37,540
Or filter it.

1846
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:38,540
While filtering.

1847
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:39,540
Yeah.

1848
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:40,540
It's got a long way to go.

1849
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:42,540
Well, let's you psych yourself up.

1850
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:46,500
I'm drinking straight out of a sewer, or I'm drinking my own piss.

1851
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:51,100
Why not just ... Let me adjust to this while I watch it, go like, oh, it's lightening up.

1852
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,100
All right.

1853
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:56,340
I have Googled, can you drink pee with LifeStraw?

1854
01:14:56,340 --> 01:15:00,700
And it says they don't recommend drinking urine with any LifeStraw product.

1855
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:02,060
It's not going to make it not pee.

1856
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:03,860
But they didn't say no.

1857
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:04,860
Yeah.

1858
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:07,620
Didn't say ... They just don't suggest it.

1859
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:09,500
This ... Okay, wait.

1860
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:13,660
There's an editorial that says a LifeStraw does not make urine remotely safe to drink.

1861
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:20,620
But that's like, they have to say ... Remember how they used to have to say bongs are for

1862
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:21,620
tobacco?

1863
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:23,580
They had to pretend and play the game.

1864
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:26,020
They know the people ... If you're buying a LifeStraw, you're doing it because you want

1865
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:27,020
to drink piss.

1866
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:28,020
Yeah.

1867
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:29,020
They got to save themselves.

1868
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:30,020
Quote, unquote, caution.

1869
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:31,020
Don't drink your own piss.

1870
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:34,740
Oh, Rhett and Link actually did this, apparently, on YouTube.

1871
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:35,740
They drunk pee?

1872
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:36,740
Five years ago.

1873
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:37,740
Wow.

1874
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:38,740
Was Jordan Morton here?

1875
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:39,740
Did you hear that one?

1876
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:40,740
It's possible.

1877
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:41,740
Did Jordan have to drink his own pee?

1878
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:42,740
Maybe.

1879
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:43,740
We should ask him.

1880
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:44,740
Wow.

1881
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:45,740
They're still kicking.

1882
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:46,740
They still got a show.

1883
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:47,740
I guess so.

1884
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:48,740
Well, with innovations, like drinking piss out of LifeStraws.

1885
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:54,460
They need to make a more of a piss-based LifeStraw that will actually help filter it.

1886
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:56,260
Look, Costner's out there.

1887
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:57,820
Costner's never been more around.

1888
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:59,740
This is a great thing to put his name on.

1889
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:00,740
He is.

1890
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:01,740
Make a little extra stretch.

1891
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:02,740
He's directing stuff.

1892
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:03,740
Yeah, yeah.

1893
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:06,820
He could close out the dream of owning literally all of Montana.

1894
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:07,820
Yeah.

1895
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:10,460
I'm sure there's a couple acres he doesn't have yet.

1896
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:11,460
Yeah.

1897
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:12,460
You get that LifeStraw money.

1898
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:15,820
He sunk all that money into these movies, so I wonder if he's going to be hurting.

1899
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:16,820
That's how these happen?

1900
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:17,820
He's not making any of it back.

1901
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:18,820
This is a Megalopolis situation?

1902
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:19,820
I believe so.

1903
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:22,780
Yeah, I believe he hundreds of millions of dollars.

1904
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:25,540
This movie has to make, which it's doing okay, right?

1905
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:27,620
Disappointing now, but it's going to like ...

1906
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:28,620
Megalopolis?

1907
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:29,620
That's not Costner.

1908
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:30,620
Oh, it's Francis Ford Cobalt.

1909
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:31,620
No, no, no.

1910
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:32,620
It's the same city.

1911
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:33,620
It's the same city.

1912
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:34,620
Oh, okay.

1913
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:35,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1914
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:36,620
Gotcha, gotcha.

1915
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:37,620
I was like, Costner doing that?

1916
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:38,620
Selling his winery.

1917
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:39,620
Yeah, yeah.

1918
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:41,260
He's doing a Megalopolis 2.

1919
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:43,020
He's also doing a Megalopolis.

1920
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:44,020
Same titles.

1921
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:45,700
Yeah, yeah.

1922
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:47,300
What is the Costner one called?

1923
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:48,300
Horizon.

1924
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:49,300
It's a place.

1925
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:50,300
Part chapter one and two.

1926
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:51,300
Okay.

1927
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:52,300
Well, there could be a Megalopolis on the horizon.

1928
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:58,300
Chapter three could be ... Horizon chapter three Megalopolis and the franchises merge.

1929
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:01,540
I have not seen that movie, but somebody on Twitter said something along the lines of

1930
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:07,540
that there's a sex scene in this Kevin Costner movie that could fit into an early 90s Steven

1931
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:08,540
Seagal movie.

1932
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:09,540
Oh, cool.

1933
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:10,540
I was like, whoa, really?

1934
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:11,540
What a wild specific.

1935
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:12,540
Yeah, yeah.

1936
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:13,540
We have to see this.

1937
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:14,540
He's the sexiest man.

1938
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:15,540
Yeah.

1939
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:19,540
And we all want to see simulated thrust.

1940
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:21,940
70-year-old Costner.

1941
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:23,580
I assume it's Costner.

1942
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:24,580
I don't know who else is in the movie.

1943
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:25,580
Oh, good point.

1944
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:26,580
I assume it is, too.

1945
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:27,580
Yeah.

1946
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:30,580
I mean, if I direct it, I would put myself in the sex scene.

1947
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:31,580
Yeah.

1948
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:32,580
I wouldn't let anybody else have that.

1949
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:33,580
Right.

1950
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:34,580
You might as well.

1951
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:35,580
That's a part of you get ... Yeah.

1952
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:36,580
The Tommy Wiseau rule.

1953
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:37,580
The room rule.

1954
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:38,580
Put yourself in ...

1955
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:44,220
You don't think he's giving it to a co-star of Horizon, Michael Rooker, because they got

1956
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:45,220
Rooker in there.

1957
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:46,220
That's a way.

1958
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:47,220
That's an interesting weathered man.

1959
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:48,220
Yeah, he could be.

1960
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:49,220
That's a cool sex scene.

1961
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:50,220
Yeah.

1962
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:51,220
It's got a crazy beard in it.

1963
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,900
We don't know if it's not the two of them, although I have my guesses.

1964
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:55,900
It might be.

1965
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:56,900
Yeah, I don't know.

1966
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:58,900
No, I haven't seen Horizon.

1967
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:01,900
Isn't Rooker's butt in Mallrats?

1968
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:02,900
Don't you see him naked?

1969
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:06,060
Rooker's butt is ... Yeah, he is partially naked in Mallrats.

1970
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:07,060
So?

1971
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:08,060
Man.

1972
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:09,060
He's already done it.

1973
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:10,060
He's comfortable.

1974
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:11,060
So, 30 years ago ...

1975
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,060
Yes.

1976
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:13,060
He was naked.

1977
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,060
He's held it up.

1978
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:15,060
The butt only gets better with age.

1979
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:16,060
That's right.

1980
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:17,060
Yeah.

1981
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:18,060
Just know what they always say.

1982
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,060
Yeah, that's right.

1983
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:20,060
Crack, don't crack.

1984
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:21,060
Crack, don't crack.

1985
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:22,900
Crack, don't crack.

1986
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:23,900
Crack, stay the same.

1987
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:30,060
I'm not finding any results for Michael Rooker's butt, but maybe I've got a safe search on

1988
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:31,060
that I don't know about.

1989
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:32,060
That could be possible.

1990
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:35,060
Isn't there somebody whose butt is in Mallrats, and I thought it was his?

1991
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:37,140
I haven't seen Mallrats in ...

1992
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:38,140
30 years?

1993
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:39,140
Probably 20-plus years.

1994
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:40,140
Yeah.

1995
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:46,140
I'm sure it also similarly hasn't aged a bit.

1996
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:48,700
The Jaws Squad ride is preserved in Mallrats.

1997
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:50,980
I think that's ... Is that the Jaws in Florida?

1998
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:52,900
No, I think it's California.

1999
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:53,900
I think it's Studio Tour.

2000
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:54,900
It's California.

2001
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:55,900
Okay.

2002
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:56,900
Yeah, I believe so, but don't quote me on that.

2003
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,900
Oh, did you do the Jaws ride at Universal?

2004
01:18:58,900 --> 01:18:59,900
I did.

2005
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:00,900
It was the first ride I did.

2006
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:01,900
Great.

2007
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:02,900
Wow.

2008
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:03,900
Yeah.

2009
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:04,900
That would be my first.

2010
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:05,900
Wow, what a nostalgia blast.

2011
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:06,900
That's great.

2012
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:07,900
Yeah.

2013
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:08,900
It was fun.

2014
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:09,900
It was cool.

2015
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:16,100
Definitely, there's a Baskin Robbins right next to that with no flavors that I was used

2016
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:17,100
to besides vanilla.

2017
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:18,100
Tuna and waffle.

2018
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:19,100
Yeah, tuna waffle.

2019
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:20,100
Tuna waffle.

2020
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:21,220
Tuna waffle flavor.

2021
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:22,220
A fish.

2022
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:27,220
Yeah, that was the first ride we did, was the Jaws ride in Osaka.

2023
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:28,220
That's the way to do it.

2024
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:29,220
Yeah, it was cool.

2025
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:33,660
All the nostalgia ones are sort of ... They had no more T2 now and no more Backdraft now?

2026
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:34,660
No.

2027
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:35,660
Okay.

2028
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:36,660
No.

2029
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:37,660
Because that was what was luring me.

2030
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:41,980
I was on my way to Kyoto and like, what if we dropped off our bags, bought one more bullet

2031
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:47,300
train ticket, kept going, just hit up a real quick, but then Kyoto as you went to ... Kyoto

2032
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:48,300
is such a lovely place.

2033
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,500
Kyoto is my favorite spot.

2034
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:52,220
I was so at peace there.

2035
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:53,220
Tokyo was great.

2036
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:55,220
Tokyo was great.

2037
01:19:55,220 --> 01:20:00,460
Osaka, I'm happy I was only there for like three, four days.

2038
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:02,060
It was really close.

2039
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:05,300
But Kyoto, I was there for like seven, eight days and I was like, I couldn't come back

2040
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:06,300
here.

2041
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:07,300
Geez, really.

2042
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:08,300
I mean, me too.

2043
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:09,300
I'm really jealous.

2044
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:10,300
I wish I'd done so much more.

2045
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:15,220
I mean, we did a couple day trips and overnights from Kyoto, so we weren't there the full time.

2046
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:16,220
That was like a base.

2047
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:17,220
Okay, yeah.

2048
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:19,140
We were there for like four full days at last.

2049
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:20,140
Wow.

2050
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:21,140
It was beautiful.

2051
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:22,140
I'm so jealous of that.

2052
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:23,140
Geez.

2053
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:24,140
What a mega travel.

2054
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:25,140
Saw some geishas.

2055
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:26,140
Oh, wow.

2056
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:27,140
Which was really cool.

2057
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:28,140
Yeah, man.

2058
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:29,140
Kyoto was great.

2059
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:30,140
I really loved Kyoto.

2060
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:31,140
Man, man.

2061
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:34,100
Anything else you want to shout out that's not like a main theme party?

2062
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:38,300
Was there anything else like, not that it has to be like a silly, kitschy thing, but

2063
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,300
I'm sure there's, I mean, there's plenty of that in Japan.

2064
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:41,300
There was a lot, man.

2065
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:42,300
I really loved Akihabara.

2066
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:43,300
I think that's how you say it.

2067
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:44,300
What is that?

2068
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:50,460
It's like the electric city, they call it, it was in Japan, but it was very much like

2069
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:58,460
just a bunch of like lights and screens and like just, it just felt like a video game

2070
01:20:58,460 --> 01:20:59,460
world.

2071
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:00,460
Sure, sure.

2072
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:04,980
Like jumping into a video game world or an electronic world, which was really cool.

2073
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:08,300
And that night is beautiful because it's all lit up and stuff like that.

2074
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:09,300
Oh, okay.

2075
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:13,460
There was like multiple, like seven story, like arcades.

2076
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:14,620
Oh yeah, yeah.

2077
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:15,620
Oh sure.

2078
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:16,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2079
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:17,620
Which was like really cool.

2080
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:18,620
I didn't make it here.

2081
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:19,620
Yeah, this is nuts.

2082
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:24,580
Did you go in any of the like video game stores, like the, cause I went in those stores like

2083
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:27,140
where you could buy old video game consoles and stuff.

2084
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:28,140
Yeah.

2085
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:29,140
And that blew my mind.

2086
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:31,020
I went to, yeah, we did walk in a couple.

2087
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:34,900
I didn't buy anything, but like just to like see what it was like.

2088
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:36,700
So that was, that was really, really dope.

2089
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:41,380
I'm like, cause they, like stuff that didn't come out here and different covers for games

2090
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:43,380
that you had when you were a little kid.

2091
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:45,300
Yeah.

2092
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,300
I didn't come back with anything either.

2093
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:47,300
And I like kind of regret it.

2094
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:48,300
I don't.

2095
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:49,300
Yeah.

2096
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:50,300
I kind of the same.

2097
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:52,140
Like I was like, Oh, I could have bought something, but I would have bought it.

2098
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:57,620
I would have bought it and it would have just collected dust, which is fine.

2099
01:21:57,620 --> 01:21:58,620
Like that's cool.

2100
01:21:58,620 --> 01:22:03,900
But like, but like the Nintendo, they released a heart, like a different drive for the Nintendo

2101
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:04,900
64.

2102
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:05,900
Really?

2103
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:06,900
64 DD or whatever it was called.

2104
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:11,180
And it would put it, you would put it on top of it and it was like, like hard disks you

2105
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:13,400
would put in, not even cartridges.

2106
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:16,380
And they only released it in Japan and never came out here and I was obsessed with it and

2107
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:17,380
they had it.

2108
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:18,380
I could have bought it.

2109
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:19,380
Yeah.

2110
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:20,380
But yeah, I'm not going to be playing it a lot.

2111
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:26,060
I remember like when I had my PlayStation and PS2 and stuff like that, like, um, there

2112
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:30,500
were a couple, I think it was my PlayStation or Xbox, one of them, I can't remember, uh,

2113
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:32,460
that I sent to Japan to get modded.

2114
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:33,460
Oh yeah.

2115
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:34,460
Yeah.

2116
01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:38,380
And like, you know, so I could play bootleg games and stuff like that.

2117
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:41,100
Um, but yeah, I had forgot about that until a little bit.

2118
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:43,020
Literally this moment.

2119
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:48,060
Uh, so yeah, like I bet they have a bunch of stuff over there that never released here.

2120
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:49,500
That would have been cool.

2121
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:50,500
I can't wait to go back.

2122
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:54,700
I will say one of the more fun things I did to, that's not like ride or video again.

2123
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:58,340
I did go to like a, a new Japan pro wrestling show.

2124
01:22:58,340 --> 01:22:59,340
Yeah.

2125
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:00,340
Great.

2126
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:01,340
Yeah.

2127
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:02,340
Was it at Corgan hall?

2128
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:03,340
Yes.

2129
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:04,340
Yeah.

2130
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:05,340
Corgan hall.

2131
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:06,340
It's like going back in time.

2132
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:07,340
Yeah.

2133
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:11,500
It was truly like, Oh, this is most, this must be what it feels like when like wrestling

2134
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,500
was in like territories.

2135
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:13,500
Yeah.

2136
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:14,500
Yeah.

2137
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:15,500
Yeah.

2138
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:18,060
And then like the popcorn and the beer are both like stale there.

2139
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:19,060
Yeah.

2140
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:20,060
But like that's kind of part of it.

2141
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:21,060
I had a cold pork sandwich.

2142
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:22,060
Yeah.

2143
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:23,060
Yeah.

2144
01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:26,460
We had standing room, we saw a show too there and we saw it was standing room in the back.

2145
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:27,460
Yeah.

2146
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:28,460
We got, but.

2147
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:29,460
It was dope.

2148
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:30,820
I, it was, it was really cool, man.

2149
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:31,820
I enjoyed it.

2150
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:32,820
What was the main event?

2151
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:33,820
Can I ask?

2152
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:34,820
Um, the main event.

2153
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:35,820
Do you remember?

2154
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:37,940
I can't remember, but it was a couple of people.

2155
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:43,420
It was one person who's now in a WWE, um, a part of the bloodline, if anybody watches

2156
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:44,420
WWE.

2157
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:46,020
Uh, so that was cool.

2158
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:51,220
I can't remember any of their names, but, um, the crowd was like destiny, Tamatanga

2159
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:52,540
and Tonga Loa.

2160
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:53,540
Yeah.

2161
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:54,540
Yeah.

2162
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:55,540
Yeah.

2163
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:56,540
Uh, it was, uh, the crowd was into it, man.

2164
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:58,220
Like the crowd got into it.

2165
01:23:58,220 --> 01:24:04,620
The, the Jeff, Jeff, I will say this about Japan is just so polite, just so polite to

2166
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:06,420
the point where it's like, are you guys bored?

2167
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:10,540
Um, cause it was kind of like, but you can get them hot.

2168
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:16,500
Even at Disney, like they're like, if like never had a friend like me came on here, like

2169
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:22,340
everybody would be, but they were just like, I think part of it was like, it's not in English,

2170
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:26,980
even though like, I don't know, but like, there's no, the generalization at some point

2171
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:30,300
in time, maybe this isn't true anymore, but the concerts would, I'd hear about like American

2172
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:34,740
going to Japan and then finishing a song and like nothing happening.

2173
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:36,660
They're like, what's up with this?

2174
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:38,980
Well, no, they're just waiting for it to be fully done.

2175
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:40,460
They are just taking it in.

2176
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:41,460
They're taking it in.

2177
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:42,460
Yeah.

2178
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:43,460
Really respectful of them.

2179
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:46,380
Cause it's not, they're not, there's not like a boredom thing, but I do think it's just

2180
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:52,900
like a very respectful, like, cause like there was like a, at the New Japan show, there was

2181
01:24:52,900 --> 01:25:02,300
like a, one of the matches that started with almost a four minute grappling, like it was

2182
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:05,460
truly one of the most boring things I've ever watched in my life.

2183
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:09,740
And like the crowd was dead silent for the entire four minutes.

2184
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:12,260
And then when they finally started, I was like, yeah, I get it.

2185
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:13,260
This is boring.

2186
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:21,860
And then when they finally stopped everybody in the crowd, start clapping, it was so funny.

2187
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:25,300
It was like, even, even if they were bored, they still respected what they did.

2188
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:29,380
It's enough to like show appreciation, which I thought was really cool.

2189
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:30,940
I thought that was really cool.

2190
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:34,580
Did you, cause Crookin Hall is right by Tokyo Dome and Tokyo Dome city.

2191
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:36,900
Did you do any of the rides at Tokyo Dome city?

2192
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:37,900
I didn't.

2193
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:44,060
Cause it was, it was, we were going to Disney, we were going to Tokyo Disney the next day

2194
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:46,780
and like the show ended at like nine or 10 o'clock or something.

2195
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:50,500
So we were like, we gotta go home.

2196
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:51,500
But it was dope.

2197
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:52,780
I didn't expect to see Tokyo Dome.

2198
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:54,420
I didn't know it was right next to it.

2199
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:55,420
So it was really cool.

2200
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:56,420
It's like his own little city.

2201
01:25:56,420 --> 01:25:57,420
Yeah.

2202
01:25:57,420 --> 01:25:58,420
Yeah.

2203
01:25:58,420 --> 01:25:59,420
Around there.

2204
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:00,420
With a Bubba Gump.

2205
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:01,420
With a Bubba Gump.

2206
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:02,420
With a TJ Fridays.

2207
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:03,420
With a Shake Shack.

2208
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:04,420
With a Taco Bell that I ate at.

2209
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:05,420
I was very excited about it.

2210
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:07,420
Cause you could change the heat level of your meal.

2211
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:09,300
Oh, the taco of the meal.

2212
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:10,300
Yeah.

2213
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:13,940
So you could pick like whatever a number seven with the two Chalupas, but then you could say

2214
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:16,260
I want it medium spice.

2215
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:17,260
That's awesome.

2216
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:18,260
Wow.

2217
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:19,260
Yeah.

2218
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:20,260
All right.

2219
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:21,260
I gotta go back.

2220
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:23,740
And I don't remember what it was.

2221
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:25,060
Can I ask this?

2222
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:30,700
Because I don't eat, I eat McDonald's breakfast, but I don't, I haven't had McDonald's like

2223
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:35,660
lunch menu burger since 2012 until Tokyo.

2224
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:39,060
Because everybody was like, Oh man, the international McDonald's blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2225
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:41,700
And I was like, I guess I got to have a burger.

2226
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:44,340
And I ate it and I was like, yeah, that was still bad.

2227
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:45,340
Still bad.

2228
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:52,340
You're going to offend some people in this room by suggesting that McDonald's might be

2229
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:54,100
anything less than top tier.

2230
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:59,340
It was like, yeah, like this tastes exactly how I remember.

2231
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:03,100
Are the like Taco Bells, are they like a little bit, are they better?

2232
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:04,100
Are they?

2233
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:05,100
I would say all the fast food is better.

2234
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:06,100
Yeah.

2235
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:07,100
But we're still in the zone.

2236
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:08,900
You're still in the zone.

2237
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:10,700
So it's going to have the similar taste.

2238
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:11,700
It's going to be the similar taste.

2239
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:12,700
Okay.

2240
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:16,580
Zone being the best zone, the highest quality of zone there could ever be.

2241
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:17,580
Fantastic stuff that I love.

2242
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:18,580
Okay.

2243
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:19,580
And that I eat a lot.

2244
01:27:19,580 --> 01:27:22,980
Did you go to convenience store, the 7-Eleven is supposed to be very good.

2245
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:24,980
Oh yeah, the 7-Eleven Family Marts.

2246
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:25,980
That stuff's true.

2247
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:26,980
Yeah.

2248
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:27,980
Any 7-Eleven random snack.

2249
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:28,980
Yeah.

2250
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:29,980
I got some great spaghetti.

2251
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:30,980
I wanted the convenience store.

2252
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:31,980
Oh wow.

2253
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:32,980
It was like delicious.

2254
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:34,460
It was late at night.

2255
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:35,460
I was hungry.

2256
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:39,460
I was on my way back to my hotel and I was like, this, and my girlfriend's vegan, so

2257
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:40,460
she wanted something.

2258
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:42,220
She got us both something.

2259
01:27:42,220 --> 01:27:44,220
And I was like, this is delicious.

2260
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:46,220
This is good spaghetti.

2261
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:51,020
Those are the little things in Japan where you're like, why, if we all just decided together

2262
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:57,940
as a society to make, why do we all decide that this area has to be like bad and shitty

2263
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:02,660
food-wise, cleanliness-wise, like they all just, they all just together collectively

2264
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:05,300
said 7-Elevens will be great.

2265
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:06,500
I went to a bathroom.

2266
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:09,460
I had, I had, you know, I'm a bidet king.

2267
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:10,460
I love a bidet.

2268
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:18,100
I have a bidet on every toilet in my apartment and like, I, you know, so some of the, I had

2269
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:21,660
some of the best experiences of my life, like in the public bathrooms in Japan.

2270
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:22,660
Yeah.

2271
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:24,460
I was like, this makes me want to cry how great this is.

2272
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:26,060
And I also had one of the worst experiences.

2273
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:28,660
Seats, lights, music, all the like these little things.

2274
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:31,680
Just, just heated toilet seats, nice little lights.

2275
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:35,180
There was a spray that you press the button and it sprays the toilet so you can disinfect

2276
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:38,060
it on like a couple of the public bathrooms I went to.

2277
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:39,060
I was like, this is nice.

2278
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:40,060
Beautiful.

2279
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:41,740
I remember, I remember it in my hotel room.

2280
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:45,940
I remember a toilet in DisneySea that was wonderful.

2281
01:28:45,940 --> 01:28:52,680
I remember a toilet in the Hello Kitty Sanrio Puroland or just, there was just like a full-on

2282
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:54,540
like lights and music show.

2283
01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:55,540
Yeah.

2284
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:58,740
There is a like delightful little thing that you only can do in the bathroom, right?

2285
01:28:58,740 --> 01:28:59,740
Yeah.

2286
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:01,660
Where, there's nowhere else on earth I have bathroom memories.

2287
01:29:01,660 --> 01:29:07,340
The bathrooms at Disney like play like things so you can have privacy.

2288
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:13,900
They have like, where if you're taking a monster shit, nobody will hear you take a shit.

2289
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:20,060
It'll just sound like, oh, like it's just like noises, just like masks.

2290
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:24,700
It's like Thumper from Thumper's dialogue from Bambi.

2291
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:28,580
Did you encounter any of the toilets in the floor when you were traveling?

2292
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:30,060
That was the worst experience I've had.

2293
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:34,100
The worst toilet experience I've ever had was also Tokyo.

2294
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:44,260
I went to, we were going to the garden, the lab, something where it was like installments

2295
01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:46,260
in a park, like lights and shit like that.

2296
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:50,460
I can't remember exactly what it was called.

2297
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:53,500
And on the way there, like once we got off the train, we had like a little 10-minute

2298
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:54,900
walk to get to it.

2299
01:29:54,900 --> 01:30:03,740
And on the way there, your boy's stomach started hurting and I was like, I gots to go.

2300
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:09,020
And like it was, it was a bad, it was a bad one too.

2301
01:30:09,020 --> 01:30:13,340
And like, I'm like finding a bathroom, I find a bathroom and I'm like, you know what,

2302
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:18,980
like all I got to do is reach a bathroom, I'll get a bidet, I'll sit on a nice seat.

2303
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:23,060
I'll like, you know, go to work and like I'll come out and I'll be feeling refreshed.

2304
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:25,900
Take a good 20 minutes in there as much time as you need.

2305
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:29,260
And I opened the door and there's a fucking hole in the ground.

2306
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:38,660
And like, and it was one, and it was one of those shits where I had to take off all my clothes.

2307
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:50,540
And like, and like, I am squatting, I don't squat, and I'm like squatting.

2308
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:56,260
And it was just, and like, I like, I think I teared up a couple of times because I was

2309
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:58,820
just like, this is the worst.

2310
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:06,220
Like I walked out to my, I walked out to my girlfriend and just like, was like, can you give me a hug?

2311
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:16,260
And, and the goddamn sink didn't have no soap.

2312
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:21,820
So like, I couldn't even, so like, so I was just like, this was the worst 20 minutes of my life.

2313
01:31:22,820 --> 01:31:31,420
Was there, let me ask, because I learned about this from the YouTube channel Ordinary Adventures.

2314
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:31,820
Yeah.

2315
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:39,100
Who, they, they traveled through Asia and they were like, also some of the bathrooms don't have toilet paper.

2316
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:40,460
You have to bring your own.

2317
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:42,540
Thank the Lord that was not the case.

2318
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:42,980
Okay.

2319
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:47,900
But I did have to like, like open up the new toilet roll.

2320
01:31:48,860 --> 01:31:54,620
It was almost out and like, but luckily it was there, but like, it was no bidet.

2321
01:31:54,620 --> 01:31:58,820
It was, it was just a hole in the ground with not even like shit that I could hold on to.

2322
01:31:58,820 --> 01:32:01,820
So I'm like, and it's nighttime.

2323
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:02,940
So I've been walking all day.

2324
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:08,140
I'm like squatting and it was, it was the worst.

2325
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:08,980
And then no soap.

2326
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:15,900
And then to make it worse, like I found out that if I just want to went around like the building

2327
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:22,780
corner, there was a Western bathroom that I couldn't, it sat on the toilet.

2328
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:26,780
And, but like, you know, at this point, several steps make a big difference.

2329
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:28,060
You probably didn't have that in you.

2330
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:29,180
Yeah, I did not move.

2331
01:32:29,180 --> 01:32:31,660
I like, but you know how your brains work.

2332
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:37,820
By the time my brain saw a bathroom door, it was like, it's coming in a hole in the ground.

2333
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:40,060
If I have to, Oh, that is what I'm doing.

2334
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:40,940
We'll be doing that.

2335
01:32:40,940 --> 01:32:42,540
That is exactly correct.

2336
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:44,300
Who can I ask how big the hole is?

2337
01:32:45,980 --> 01:32:50,300
It is, it is, it is not circular.

2338
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:52,540
At least the one I use wasn't circular.

2339
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:54,780
It was more like oblong shaped.

2340
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:57,900
Like, cause it's, is it like hard to get it in there?

2341
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:59,260
It wasn't easy to get it in.

2342
01:32:59,260 --> 01:33:03,740
It wasn't golf or putting this is very precise.

2343
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:04,780
I know people are listening.

2344
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:09,980
It was like, this is the worst conversation, but like, I will say, like, I will say this.

2345
01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:15,260
If it was a normal bathroom experience, it would have been fine.

2346
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:20,540
A bathroom experience where like is messy.

2347
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:25,420
Because it was not, it wasn't booty shaped.

2348
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:28,380
It wasn't, it wasn't booty shaped.

2349
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:28,880
I see.

2350
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:31,020
It just seems hard.

2351
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:32,780
It seems hard for a number of reasons.

2352
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:35,900
And you know, you, you know, when we were growing up, you know, we got to,

2353
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:38,860
we had to learn how to, you know, you know, aim for the Cheerios, whatever.

2354
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:40,620
Nobody teaches you how to aim your shit.

2355
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:43,420
So it was not possible, right?

2356
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:44,380
You don't even think you have.

2357
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:45,580
Yes. You don't have to.

2358
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:47,740
It's general enough that I will never have to worry.

2359
01:33:47,740 --> 01:33:49,340
I would never have to worry about this.

2360
01:33:49,340 --> 01:33:57,100
And then my, my girlfriend who is a Southeast Asian or South Southeast, South Asian was like,

2361
01:33:57,660 --> 01:33:59,820
yeah, you're going to have a terrible time in India.

2362
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:04,140
She was like, cause she was like, yeah, this is, this is normal.

2363
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:05,660
Like she was like, yeah, that happens.

2364
01:34:05,660 --> 01:34:08,060
And my American ass was like, what the fuck is this?

2365
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:10,220
Wow.

2366
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:14,540
Can I run you through the thought experiment of if,

2367
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:17,740
as suggested, there had been no toilet paper.

2368
01:34:17,740 --> 01:34:18,140
Oh my God.

2369
01:34:18,140 --> 01:34:22,060
Do you think what, what might you have knowing what was, had been in that room?

2370
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:24,780
I'm going to run you through a survival scenario.

2371
01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:28,620
Man, if there was no toilet, I would have,

2372
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:35,180
I would have, I would have had to go home immediately afterwards.

2373
01:34:35,180 --> 01:34:35,680
Yeah.

2374
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:37,660
And maybe close.

2375
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:40,220
Whatever happens to the clothes.

2376
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:42,460
Yeah, I kind of, I guess so.

2377
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:44,700
Cause it was, but there was people all out in there.

2378
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:45,580
So I would have had to walk.

2379
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:48,540
I would have, yeah, here's the thing.

2380
01:34:49,420 --> 01:34:50,940
This has happened to me before.

2381
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:51,820
Oh no.

2382
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:57,020
Where I was on a hike and like, you know, nature called and I didn't have no toilet paper.

2383
01:34:57,740 --> 01:35:01,740
And, you know, you use, you use your underwear.

2384
01:35:03,180 --> 01:35:04,060
That layer goes.

2385
01:35:04,060 --> 01:35:06,220
That layer, that's the first layer.

2386
01:35:06,220 --> 01:35:07,820
You start using underclothes.

2387
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:10,860
If you have anything extra on socks.

2388
01:35:10,860 --> 01:35:11,420
Oh, socks.

2389
01:35:11,420 --> 01:35:11,740
Yeah.

2390
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:12,780
Then you just barefoot.

2391
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:16,140
If you've got some gloves on, if you're wearing hiking gloves.

2392
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:17,900
You use it, anything extra.

2393
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:20,460
And then sleeves, you just rip sleeves off.

2394
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:21,900
This is a sleeveless shirt now.

2395
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:26,620
And if I would have had to, I would have, I would have, I would have just called an Uber

2396
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:32,540
and just knew that this is going to be a story for this Uber driver.

2397
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:35,820
It was like, I had a person get in my car who smelled like shit.

2398
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:38,540
But I would have went directly home.

2399
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:43,660
He said, he said, take me to the closest combini so I can buy rubbing alcohol.

2400
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:48,140
I think you stumped me and Mike yet again.

2401
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:52,940
That's a slang term for Japanese convenience stores.

2402
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:54,060
Oh, okay.

2403
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:55,180
How'd you know that?

2404
01:35:55,180 --> 01:35:55,740
I heard that.

2405
01:35:55,740 --> 01:35:56,300
Convenience.

2406
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:56,620
Yeah.

2407
01:35:56,620 --> 01:35:57,500
I figured that's what you meant.

2408
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:58,060
I didn't know.

2409
01:35:58,060 --> 01:35:58,560
Yeah.

2410
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:00,300
Geez, good work.

2411
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:01,420
And you've not even been there.

2412
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:05,180
Man, it was a, it was, it was a terrible experience.

2413
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:15,420
So yeah, but still I had the decorum to do it in the toilet and not on the side of the road.

2414
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:15,980
That was good.

2415
01:36:16,940 --> 01:36:21,660
So you can rank yourself higher than certain six-year-olds at Shanghai Disney.

2416
01:36:21,660 --> 01:36:23,260
That's something to be proud of.

2417
01:36:23,260 --> 01:36:25,900
Dodging another international incident.

2418
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:29,180
Taking your clothes off to use the floor toilet.

2419
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:34,300
And you got away scot-free, did not have to call the embassy.

2420
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:42,220
Yeah, those 15, 20 minutes after that experience were some of the lowest.

2421
01:36:42,220 --> 01:36:43,020
I felt bad.

2422
01:36:44,700 --> 01:36:46,700
Body trauma you've been through.

2423
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:47,740
Oh my God.

2424
01:36:47,740 --> 01:36:48,940
Like I felt bad.

2425
01:36:48,940 --> 01:36:50,380
I was like, yeah, this is terrible.

2426
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:51,180
Is there a culprit?

2427
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:53,900
Can you name like what, do you have a, do you have a sense of what the food?

2428
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:55,180
It wasn't McDonald's, was it?

2429
01:36:56,780 --> 01:36:57,260
It wasn't.

2430
01:36:57,260 --> 01:36:57,820
Wait a minute.

2431
01:36:57,820 --> 01:37:01,100
And I mean, I think this is Tokyo we're talking about, but this, this would really

2432
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:04,940
confirm a lot of my feelings if this had been City Walk Osaka.

2433
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:07,100
We know there's something in the air.

2434
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:07,740
There's something in the air.

2435
01:37:07,740 --> 01:37:11,740
We all had a lot of gastrointestinal issues when we were dealing with City Walk.

2436
01:37:11,740 --> 01:37:12,700
All the City Walks.

2437
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:16,140
I think it's the thing that binds all of the City Walks together, no matter where they are.

2438
01:37:16,140 --> 01:37:17,580
You're going to have some stomach issues.

2439
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:18,540
You're going to have the bubbles.

2440
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:20,620
I can't remember what I ate.

2441
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:23,420
I can't remember what I ate before.

2442
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:26,140
And we had like very pressed time.

2443
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:29,980
Like it was like, you have to be here at nine and we got, and it was a 10 minute walk.

2444
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:34,620
And we got off the train at like 8 49.

2445
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:40,140
So like, we were like, kind of like we weren't running, but we were briskly walking.

2446
01:37:40,140 --> 01:37:40,620
Yeah.

2447
01:37:40,620 --> 01:37:47,820
And like, and I, and like sometimes if I play sports, like after the game, I'll be like, all

2448
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:49,260
right, time to go to the bathroom.

2449
01:37:49,260 --> 01:37:51,020
Like just jostle or running.

2450
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:55,100
Like the runners tell you, like sometimes like after you run, like your stomach is like,

2451
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:57,420
all right, you've jostled us enough.

2452
01:37:57,420 --> 01:37:58,700
Like, let's, let's get this over with.

2453
01:37:58,700 --> 01:37:59,980
This is news to the three of us.

2454
01:38:01,020 --> 01:38:02,860
I'm saying I know hypothetically what he's saying.

2455
01:38:02,860 --> 01:38:03,580
Hypothetically.

2456
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:09,500
And I, I, and like, so because we were briskly walking, I think my stomach was like, oh,

2457
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:10,300
you're moving.

2458
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:13,260
And like, eventually I had to tell that like, we need to slow down.

2459
01:38:14,140 --> 01:38:14,700
Yeah.

2460
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:15,260
Right now.

2461
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:16,940
Yes.

2462
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:23,340
And so like, but again, like my brain was still telling me like, this is like, calm yourself

2463
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:27,900
down, you know, like every adult, like we have IBS or something like that.

2464
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:32,140
So like, you learn, calm yourself down, you know, cause like I've learned this.

2465
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:35,260
Like when you, when that's happening, your body goes into fight or flight.

2466
01:38:35,260 --> 01:38:35,580
Yeah.

2467
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:38,460
And so that's what makes it really like, I need to go now.

2468
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:40,220
So it's just like, I was talking to myself.

2469
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:41,500
I'm like, you're good.

2470
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:42,620
You've got to go get a bidet.

2471
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:49,340
You've got to go like, and then that has, so it was just like a, it was crazy.

2472
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:49,820
Wow.

2473
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:50,220
Wow.

2474
01:38:50,220 --> 01:38:54,780
At least you're generally in the land of, I'm sure, I'm sure a bidet at some point helped

2475
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:55,340
rectify.

2476
01:38:55,340 --> 01:38:56,620
Oh, I took a shower.

2477
01:38:56,620 --> 01:39:04,860
Once I took a full body, get to a park with the art installations.

2478
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:06,300
Like, Hey, do you have a shower?

2479
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:08,700
It's really sour hose.

2480
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:10,380
I don't know the word for hose.

2481
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:11,580
I'm so sorry.

2482
01:39:12,700 --> 01:39:14,380
I need some butt water.

2483
01:39:19,340 --> 01:39:23,260
Is there any, let's, as we sort of head to the exit here is you've taken us to so many

2484
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:23,580
places.

2485
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:23,900
It's great.

2486
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:28,380
Is there, is there some, is there a more pleasant note to go out on somewhere from

2487
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:29,020
your travels?

2488
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:32,060
Do we miss anything?

2489
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:34,780
Cause you, I mean, boy, you've, you've whisked us on an international tour.

2490
01:39:34,780 --> 01:39:35,260
It's been wonderful.

2491
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:36,380
Did you buy any merch?

2492
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:38,860
Did you get any character pictures or any of that stuff?

2493
01:39:38,860 --> 01:39:40,140
Yeah, I got a couple.

2494
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:46,060
I did go to, I'm a fan of chef Mickey's, which is at the contemporary at Disney world.

2495
01:39:47,820 --> 01:39:49,820
And I was able, they had a chef Mickey's.

2496
01:39:49,820 --> 01:39:53,500
I was, I stayed at the ambassador hotel at Tokyo Disney.

2497
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:54,060
Okay.

2498
01:39:54,060 --> 01:39:55,500
And recommended good hotel?

2499
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:55,820
Huh?

2500
01:39:55,820 --> 01:39:56,540
Was it, was it good?

2501
01:39:56,540 --> 01:39:57,340
It was great.

2502
01:39:57,340 --> 01:39:58,060
Yeah, it was really great.

2503
01:39:58,060 --> 01:39:58,940
It was a really great hotel.

2504
01:39:58,940 --> 01:39:59,500
Yeah.

2505
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:02,780
It's not, it's one of the partner hotels.

2506
01:40:02,780 --> 01:40:03,020
Okay.

2507
01:40:03,020 --> 01:40:03,340
Yeah.

2508
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:04,380
Nope.

2509
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:05,020
That's a lie.

2510
01:40:05,020 --> 01:40:06,300
It's one of the main hotels.

2511
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:11,180
But it's not like the fanciest and like, like what's right outside of Disney.

2512
01:40:11,180 --> 01:40:13,340
So yeah, yeah, it's right.

2513
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:13,660
Yeah.

2514
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:14,620
It's right along the track.

2515
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:18,460
And shit, what was I?

2516
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:20,700
We're chef Mickey.

2517
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:22,460
Oh, chef Mickey's and I was pleasantly surprised.

2518
01:40:22,460 --> 01:40:23,500
I had a chef Mickey's there.

2519
01:40:24,220 --> 01:40:24,700
So that was cool.

2520
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:26,380
So I got some character pictures there.

2521
01:40:26,380 --> 01:40:29,100
I'm not a huge character picture taker anymore.

2522
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:29,340
Yeah.

2523
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:33,660
Like the first couple of times I went to Disney, I was like, yeah, let's get these.

2524
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:36,700
And now I'm like, all right, I got a couple.

2525
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:40,700
Is there a character you would be like, oh, I do need to get a photo because they're not always out.

2526
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:47,180
There was, they had Scrooge McDuck.

2527
01:40:47,180 --> 01:40:48,060
Oh, well that's, yeah.

2528
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:49,020
Which was, yeah.

2529
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:50,380
You don't really see a lot of Scrooge McDuck.

2530
01:40:50,380 --> 01:40:51,820
You don't see Scrooge McDuck.

2531
01:40:52,140 --> 01:40:53,020
So that was cool.

2532
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:55,580
I didn't get a picture of him because he was like walking away.

2533
01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:59,100
But like with him, I mean, I got a picture of him.

2534
01:40:59,660 --> 01:41:00,700
So that was cool.

2535
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:04,140
If I would have saw him again, I would have did that for sure.

2536
01:41:04,140 --> 01:41:04,940
And who else?

2537
01:41:04,940 --> 01:41:11,260
There was like one more and I was like, you rarely see that character like at the parks,

2538
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:13,580
but I can't, it was probably, maybe it was Scrooge McDuck.

2539
01:41:13,580 --> 01:41:13,980
Yeah.

2540
01:41:13,980 --> 01:41:17,820
We had like really transcendent moments with the Cinderella mice.

2541
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:19,980
That is my wife's favorite thing is those.

2542
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:23,820
I forget their names now, but that was such a dream.

2543
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:29,740
And when we got our Cinderella mice moment in their nice little like plain girls outfits,

2544
01:41:29,740 --> 01:41:31,020
she just loves them.

2545
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:32,620
And then which are the Aristocats.

2546
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:32,940
Oh yeah.

2547
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:35,660
I also don't know their name, but like Jacques and whatever.

2548
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:38,620
Like we had so much fun with one of those Aristocats.

2549
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:42,300
Just really did it up and was flirting with her and making me mad.

2550
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:43,340
We had a bunch of business.

2551
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:46,220
You don't see those.

2552
01:41:46,220 --> 01:41:49,180
Yeah, you don't see those too often.

2553
01:41:49,740 --> 01:41:50,860
Yeah, there was a few.

2554
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:54,700
One thing you mentioned I was curious about.

2555
01:41:55,340 --> 01:41:57,740
You said your girlfriend is vegan.

2556
01:41:57,740 --> 01:42:01,020
How did she do eating in Tokyo and Shanghai?

2557
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:07,580
Like was it reasonable accommodations or reasonable vegetable dishes or?

2558
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:09,980
Yeah, she actually, so that was her second time in Japan.

2559
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:13,420
She had gone like nine years previous.

2560
01:42:13,980 --> 01:42:16,220
And when she went that time, she was like,

2561
01:42:16,220 --> 01:42:19,740
I basically only had to eat in like convenience stores.

2562
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:27,260
This time, there is no shortage of vegan restaurants all over Tokyo.

2563
01:42:28,140 --> 01:42:31,820
Not so much in Shanghai, but she most, we were in Disney and

2564
01:42:31,820 --> 01:42:33,660
when we weren't at Disney, she was at the hotel.

2565
01:42:33,660 --> 01:42:40,860
So it was, but in Japan, if you're listening to this and you're vegan,

2566
01:42:40,860 --> 01:42:43,340
if you ever go there, download the Happy Cow app.

2567
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:44,860
Okay.

2568
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:48,460
The Happy Cow app is basically an app that lets you know every vegan

2569
01:42:49,180 --> 01:42:54,780
restaurant, food stand, like snack you can get no matter where you are.

2570
01:42:54,780 --> 01:42:56,300
It's like a Google's map type thing.

2571
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:57,980
So that was tight.

2572
01:42:59,180 --> 01:43:00,220
She ate well.

2573
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:04,700
Like she ate, there were some places where we were able to eat together,

2574
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:06,140
which was really cool.

2575
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:07,900
And then, you know, I'm a meat eater.

2576
01:43:07,900 --> 01:43:11,260
So in some places where there wasn't much for her to eat,

2577
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:13,740
what we would do is like, I would go to a place.

2578
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:15,420
I would have my like meal.

2579
01:43:16,300 --> 01:43:18,380
She would maybe have like an appetizer or something.

2580
01:43:18,380 --> 01:43:20,540
And then we would find like a place for her to go.

2581
01:43:20,540 --> 01:43:22,940
And then she would have her main meal and I would eat something.

2582
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:25,900
I would have a drink or something like that.

2583
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:26,300
Yeah.

2584
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:29,580
So like we were able to, so that way we wouldn't have to be like, you know,

2585
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:31,420
well, I can't go here because you can't eat here.

2586
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:35,260
We just was like, all right, dinner is going to be an hour and a half today or two hours.

2587
01:43:35,260 --> 01:43:38,460
Like we're going to go to two places, which was cool.

2588
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:44,700
So yeah, now at Tokyo Disney, this was my only gripe about Tokyo Disney.

2589
01:43:44,700 --> 01:43:52,700
It was, it was so hard to get them to do anything they weren't supposed to.

2590
01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:53,900
Oh, right, right, right.

2591
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:59,420
Like it was, it was almost to like, it was almost to a fault where it was like,

2592
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:01,580
we're not allowed to do that.

2593
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:05,260
And like, where it's like, that's very not Disney.

2594
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:09,340
Disney will very much bend over backwards to try to, not always, but like, you know,

2595
01:44:10,140 --> 01:44:11,420
and it was simple things.

2596
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:18,380
Like we went to a show and like, there's a whole menu of stuff, some vegan options,

2597
01:44:18,380 --> 01:44:21,580
but like the show only gave us two options.

2598
01:44:21,580 --> 01:44:23,660
And we're like, well, can we just get this?

2599
01:44:23,660 --> 01:44:25,500
It was like, nope, it's not a part of the show.

2600
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:30,700
It was like, but it's actually cheaper than what this costs to like, just like, no,

2601
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:32,540
like, can we substitute bread?

2602
01:44:32,540 --> 01:44:33,580
Nope, you can't do that.

2603
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:40,140
It was just, and like, we had one moment where she just wanted no mushrooms and something

2604
01:44:40,780 --> 01:44:43,820
and like two managers had to come over.

2605
01:44:44,940 --> 01:44:47,020
It was like a 20 minute talk.

2606
01:44:47,020 --> 01:44:52,380
The recommendations we got were like, well, how about you order it and he eats it.

2607
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:53,900
And it was like, no, I don't want it either.

2608
01:44:56,060 --> 01:44:59,260
So that was the hard, it was, it was very funny.

2609
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:02,060
But that was the hardest part about being there.

2610
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:06,780
It was just like, if it was something that they couldn't do, they would be very nice

2611
01:45:06,780 --> 01:45:09,340
about it, but they would not do it.

2612
01:45:11,340 --> 01:45:14,780
So like, so it was a little harder for her to eat in the parks.

2613
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:18,940
But they still had some vegan options, but it wasn't as easy,

2614
01:45:18,940 --> 01:45:21,660
but everywhere else was super easy, right?

2615
01:45:21,660 --> 01:45:22,460
Super easy.

2616
01:45:22,460 --> 01:45:28,220
But yeah, that, that the, I was talking to my friend because like I'm a sneaker head

2617
01:45:28,220 --> 01:45:31,420
and I was about to buy some custom Jordans, which were only going to be 120.

2618
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:37,340
And I don't know if this is as crazy to anybody else as it is to me, but like I wear a size 11

2619
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:39,660
and I was like, all right, can you give me a size 11?

2620
01:45:39,660 --> 01:45:43,020
And they went to the back and they finally came out and they was like,

2621
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:44,140
Hey, I'm so sorry.

2622
01:45:44,140 --> 01:45:47,660
We don't have a size 11, but we brought you a size nine.

2623
01:45:47,660 --> 01:45:53,740
And I was like, what the, what I can't fit that.

2624
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:54,140
Thank you.

2625
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:59,660
But it was more just like they want to, he was saying, cause he lives there.

2626
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:03,420
He was like, a lot of it was, you know, even if they can't do it,

2627
01:46:03,420 --> 01:46:05,740
they don't want the perception to be that they didn't try.

2628
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:06,700
I see.

2629
01:46:08,700 --> 01:46:11,740
It was very much like that at Tokyo where it was like,

2630
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:14,380
you know, we'll bring this person over.

2631
01:46:14,380 --> 01:46:15,420
We'll bring this person over.

2632
01:46:15,420 --> 01:46:16,460
We'll go through the list.

2633
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:18,300
We'll give you all the options.

2634
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:19,020
Right, right, right.

2635
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:20,300
But we can't do what you want.

2636
01:46:21,820 --> 01:46:22,860
The effort was made.

2637
01:46:24,460 --> 01:46:24,780
Okay.

2638
01:46:24,780 --> 01:46:25,820
Let's compromise.

2639
01:46:25,820 --> 01:46:28,220
She can pick the mushrooms out.

2640
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:29,180
How about that?

2641
01:46:29,180 --> 01:46:34,620
Yeah, that was, that was one option too, where we were like, yeah, but no.

2642
01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:39,740
There's a Jordan store in Tokyo, right?

2643
01:46:39,740 --> 01:46:41,340
I would be able to stand right around the corner from it.

2644
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:41,580
Okay.

2645
01:46:41,580 --> 01:46:41,980
Yeah.

2646
01:46:41,980 --> 01:46:42,940
Yeah, yeah.

2647
01:46:42,940 --> 01:46:43,660
In Shibuya.

2648
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:45,180
It was really dope.

2649
01:46:45,180 --> 01:46:45,420
Yeah.

2650
01:46:46,140 --> 01:46:47,660
I really wish I could fit a size nine.

2651
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:52,060
They tried, they tried.

2652
01:46:52,060 --> 01:46:54,940
You can build your own size 11 out of mushrooms.

2653
01:46:54,940 --> 01:46:55,820
Would that work for you?

2654
01:46:57,820 --> 01:46:58,620
Draw his shape.

2655
01:46:59,660 --> 01:47:00,620
In the mushrooms.

2656
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:05,340
I would say this, man, if anybody wants to ever, I mean, to end on a happier note with Tokyo,

2657
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:10,060
like, cause you know, for us, we get going, right?

2658
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:14,220
But there are some people, and I'm sure everybody who listens to this gets going too,

2659
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:17,100
but we get, there are going to be some people's like, why don't you go

2660
01:47:17,900 --> 01:47:20,700
all the way over there to like go to Disney, right?

2661
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:26,060
We have Disney here is something a regular person might say and has said to me.

2662
01:47:26,060 --> 01:47:27,500
Yeah, you get that all the time.

2663
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:27,900
Yeah.

2664
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:33,100
And truly, like, unless you just hate theme parks, like, which is fair.

2665
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:34,380
If you hate theme parks, don't go.

2666
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:40,700
But if you enjoy a day where a theme park is an option, like just take the day.

2667
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:41,820
You don't even have to do both.

2668
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:44,860
Like take a day, go check it out.

2669
01:47:44,860 --> 01:47:48,300
It's like truly the best park.

2670
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:52,860
It's one of the best park experiences I've had, like in a very long time, if not ever.

2671
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:53,100
Yeah.

2672
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:58,220
I think it'd be really strange to get for somebody to just not like Disney Sea,

2673
01:47:58,220 --> 01:48:01,980
especially to not be impressed by it, find something to like about.

2674
01:48:01,980 --> 01:48:02,940
I think food's good.

2675
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:04,300
That I think like there's great.

2676
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:04,780
I don't know.

2677
01:48:04,780 --> 01:48:06,540
It just has, it's the full package.

2678
01:48:06,540 --> 01:48:07,260
Everything was great.

2679
01:48:07,260 --> 01:48:07,820
For sure.

2680
01:48:07,820 --> 01:48:09,660
It was Disney Sea was beautiful.

2681
01:48:09,660 --> 01:48:12,700
Disney Tokyo, Disneyland Tokyo was also great.

2682
01:48:12,700 --> 01:48:17,660
And, you know, there was some similarities between the, all the Disneyland's, right?

2683
01:48:17,660 --> 01:48:20,380
You know, it was different enough where I went in Kaki.

2684
01:48:20,380 --> 01:48:21,580
I was like, this is Disneyland.

2685
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:23,100
I'm going to know where it is.

2686
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:25,580
And I went in like, all right, let me look at this map real quick.

2687
01:48:27,340 --> 01:48:30,140
Sorry, the train doesn't go around the park.

2688
01:48:30,140 --> 01:48:32,220
The train's one little thing over here.

2689
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:34,220
Haunted Mansion is in fantasy land.

2690
01:48:34,220 --> 01:48:34,620
Yeah.

2691
01:48:34,620 --> 01:48:35,820
What are you talking about?

2692
01:48:35,820 --> 01:48:36,060
Yeah.

2693
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:36,700
It's wild.

2694
01:48:36,700 --> 01:48:38,540
So it's really, it's worth it.

2695
01:48:38,540 --> 01:48:39,580
It was worth it.

2696
01:48:39,580 --> 01:48:43,500
It was the perfect way to end our portion in Tokyo.

2697
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:43,820
Yes.

2698
01:48:43,820 --> 01:48:44,220
Yeah.

2699
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:45,660
It was a great end to the trip.

2700
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:48,460
And then you had a much worse end to the trip.

2701
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:49,980
And then I had to work.

2702
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:51,740
Which still was nice too a little bit.

2703
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:52,940
Still was nice.

2704
01:48:52,940 --> 01:48:53,820
Look, it's a story.

2705
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:55,500
I have a story forever.

2706
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:57,260
Which made it perfect for us.

2707
01:48:57,260 --> 01:49:00,060
And we're so glad you brought all, that brought us all of this.

2708
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:01,340
I really appreciate it.

2709
01:49:01,340 --> 01:49:03,980
Jikki Sneel, you survived podcast, The Ride.

2710
01:49:03,980 --> 01:49:04,780
What a time.

2711
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:05,340
Boy, oh boy.

2712
01:49:05,340 --> 01:49:06,620
So glad you could do it.

2713
01:49:06,620 --> 01:49:07,900
Let's exit through the gift shop.

2714
01:49:07,900 --> 01:49:09,100
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2715
01:49:10,380 --> 01:49:11,500
We brought it up at the beginning.

2716
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:14,460
If you're ever in town, Comedian Feud is always a good time.

2717
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:16,060
We're live streaming it now as well.

2718
01:49:16,860 --> 01:49:19,500
Maybe come into a town near you at some point.

2719
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:20,220
Always have some.

2720
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:23,100
It's pretty much just Celebrity Family Feud.

2721
01:49:23,740 --> 01:49:24,700
That's all it is.

2722
01:49:25,660 --> 01:49:28,060
Which I was able to do last year, which was fun.

2723
01:49:28,060 --> 01:49:28,380
So-

2724
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:29,020
Really?

2725
01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:30,140
They know about the show too.

2726
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:30,540
Oh.

2727
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:32,460
My lawyer was like, don't bring it up.

2728
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:34,700
They brought it up to me.

2729
01:49:34,700 --> 01:49:35,260
Oh.

2730
01:49:35,260 --> 01:49:36,860
I was like, you want Steve to mention it?

2731
01:49:36,860 --> 01:49:37,740
And I was like, no.

2732
01:49:41,580 --> 01:49:43,020
Confusing or something.

2733
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:43,340
Yeah.

2734
01:49:43,340 --> 01:49:44,460
You were on the show, really?

2735
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:45,580
I was on the show last year.

2736
01:49:45,980 --> 01:49:47,340
How'd it go?

2737
01:49:47,340 --> 01:49:47,900
We lost.

2738
01:49:48,620 --> 01:49:51,820
I was on the Lauren Lapkus's team.

2739
01:49:52,380 --> 01:49:53,180
Oh.

2740
01:49:53,180 --> 01:49:53,820
Did this air?

2741
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:54,700
I don't remember.

2742
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:59,660
It aired last summer or last fall or something like that.

2743
01:49:59,660 --> 01:50:00,620
I can't remember exactly.

2744
01:50:00,620 --> 01:50:01,580
Oh, congrats.

2745
01:50:01,580 --> 01:50:02,380
It was super fun.

2746
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:07,740
But yeah, come to that Comedian Feud and then on social media,

2747
01:50:07,740 --> 01:50:11,260
I post everything else I'm doing that gets announced.

2748
01:50:12,140 --> 01:50:14,060
This was a debate on our show a little bit,

2749
01:50:14,220 --> 01:50:16,140
or a debate we closed off and answered,

2750
01:50:16,140 --> 01:50:20,060
but I think this was on a Club 3 episode about an old Family Feud episode.

2751
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:25,500
Do you have a choice of best Family Feud host for Besides Yourself?

2752
01:50:26,220 --> 01:50:26,720
Yes.

2753
01:50:28,300 --> 01:50:28,780
That's a good question.

2754
01:50:28,780 --> 01:50:29,420
Is it Steve?

2755
01:50:30,940 --> 01:50:33,020
I still think Richard Dawson is the best host.

2756
01:50:33,020 --> 01:50:33,820
Wow, really?

2757
01:50:33,820 --> 01:50:34,940
I still think he is.

2758
01:50:37,340 --> 01:50:40,060
The classic host, I think out of-

2759
01:50:42,140 --> 01:50:43,340
This is a very good question.

2760
01:50:43,340 --> 01:50:45,420
I think Richard Dawson is the best host.

2761
01:50:46,780 --> 01:50:50,860
I think one of my favorite hosts was Ray Combs,

2762
01:50:52,540 --> 01:50:53,980
but I can understand how people-

2763
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:55,180
But I just thought he was like-

2764
01:50:55,180 --> 01:50:57,580
He reminded me of like a Mark Summers.

2765
01:50:57,580 --> 01:50:58,140
Yeah, yeah.

2766
01:50:58,140 --> 01:50:59,340
Just like genial, nice-

2767
01:50:59,980 --> 01:51:01,260
He was the first one I ever saw.

2768
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:03,500
Yeah, it's probably the one I watched in the end.

2769
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:07,420
But out of all the hosts that they've had since Richard Dawson,

2770
01:51:08,220 --> 01:51:10,460
Steve Harvey has made it his own the most.

2771
01:51:11,020 --> 01:51:16,140
Where they had the Louis Anderson's, the John O'Hurley's,

2772
01:51:16,780 --> 01:51:17,820
all the people that's done it.

2773
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:19,420
Karn.

2774
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:20,480
Karn.

2775
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:28,380
Family Feud will forever be synonymous with Richard Dawson and Steve Harvey.

2776
01:51:28,380 --> 01:51:31,420
Those are the two hosts of Family Feud.

2777
01:51:31,420 --> 01:51:34,140
And everybody else in between is just everybody else in between.

2778
01:51:36,780 --> 01:51:39,340
Well, we sort of landed on we like Harvey the most,

2779
01:51:39,420 --> 01:51:40,700
and we all sort of agreed.

2780
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:43,180
And then Mike Scollins wrote us angry.

2781
01:51:43,180 --> 01:51:44,940
He was mad about that opinion.

2782
01:51:44,940 --> 01:51:46,060
Well, that, yeah.

2783
01:51:46,060 --> 01:51:47,100
You're insane, too.

2784
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:48,060
That's not a bad opinion.

2785
01:51:49,740 --> 01:51:51,180
Thanks for backing us up.

2786
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:53,580
I felt not strong enough about it to not-

2787
01:51:53,580 --> 01:51:55,660
I did not like double down.

2788
01:51:55,660 --> 01:51:57,180
Fuck off, Scollins.

2789
01:51:57,180 --> 01:51:58,300
I didn't feel that way at all.

2790
01:51:58,300 --> 01:51:58,940
He didn't say that either, yeah.

2791
01:51:58,940 --> 01:52:00,300
But he certainly felt strongly enough.

2792
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:01,180
He did feel strongly enough.

2793
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:04,380
I think also on the episode rewatching some old Dawson,

2794
01:52:04,460 --> 01:52:12,540
which I am, my brain wants to love an old boozed up actor hosting a game show.

2795
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:18,460
And I was disappointed because I was like, this guy's kind of like tired and like-

2796
01:52:18,460 --> 01:52:18,940
Yeah, he's drunk.

2797
01:52:18,940 --> 01:52:21,180
Actually not as fun.

2798
01:52:21,180 --> 01:52:23,260
It's not as fun as I want it to be.

2799
01:52:23,260 --> 01:52:25,740
I almost like Gene Rayburn on Match Game Better now.

2800
01:52:25,740 --> 01:52:27,180
Gene Rayburn was great.

2801
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:28,540
Because he at least had some energy.

2802
01:52:29,180 --> 01:52:33,660
Dawson, I'm like, the kissing and like that's like a funny thing, but it's like kind of gross.

2803
01:52:33,660 --> 01:52:33,900
Yeah.

2804
01:52:34,300 --> 01:52:37,100
I think Harvey takes it easily.

2805
01:52:37,100 --> 01:52:41,260
If you're really just, if they're all on equal footing, you're like,

2806
01:52:41,260 --> 01:52:42,940
I think Harvey's the best one of all time.

2807
01:52:42,940 --> 01:52:51,420
I think for me, what makes Richard Dawson good is, yes, he was very 70s, right?

2808
01:52:51,420 --> 01:52:53,500
Very suave, boozy, all that stuff.

2809
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:56,060
And the suits, the suits are so puffy and crazy.

2810
01:52:56,060 --> 01:52:56,540
Yeah.

2811
01:52:56,540 --> 01:52:57,900
Most 70s.

2812
01:52:57,900 --> 01:53:02,940
But he is like, out of any game show that I've seen,

2813
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:09,420
he is like, oh, this dude created the model for how this show is supposed to be hosted, right?

2814
01:53:09,420 --> 01:53:09,820
Yes.

2815
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:15,660
And like, you know, because even Drew Carey changes it up from like, but like everybody's

2816
01:53:15,660 --> 01:53:22,300
following that Richard Dawson model of just like how to navigate the families and stuff like that.

2817
01:53:23,740 --> 01:53:27,020
He was a boozy one, but he was like a host.

2818
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:30,780
Whereas everybody else kind of feels like they're playing host, except for Ray Combe.

2819
01:53:30,780 --> 01:53:31,740
I liked Ray Combe a lot.

2820
01:53:32,460 --> 01:53:33,980
But Steve Harvey is just Steve Harvey.

2821
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:38,140
Truly, it is celebrity for you.

2822
01:53:38,140 --> 01:53:43,180
So it's 10 celebrities, quote unquote, on stage.

2823
01:53:43,180 --> 01:53:47,740
And when Steve walks out, he's the biggest star on that stage, right?

2824
01:53:47,740 --> 01:53:49,020
Of course, yeah, right.

2825
01:53:49,020 --> 01:53:49,660
He didn't speak to us before.

2826
01:53:49,660 --> 01:53:51,660
But wouldn't you be the most fascinated to see?

2827
01:53:51,660 --> 01:53:52,140
Yeah.

2828
01:53:52,140 --> 01:53:53,740
Wow, like he talked to you.

2829
01:53:53,740 --> 01:53:54,940
Steve Harvey talked to you.

2830
01:53:54,940 --> 01:53:56,220
I'd be very starstruck.

2831
01:53:56,220 --> 01:53:57,500
He smelled great.

2832
01:53:57,980 --> 01:54:02,700
Yeah, dude, it was fucking Steve Harvey.

2833
01:54:02,700 --> 01:54:03,660
That's great.

2834
01:54:03,660 --> 01:54:07,500
If we had to guess, I'm not so sure Richard Dawson would have smelled great.

2835
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:07,980
I'm sure.

2836
01:54:07,980 --> 01:54:09,740
He would have smelled like cigarette smells.

2837
01:54:09,740 --> 01:54:11,020
Cigarettes probably are.

2838
01:54:11,020 --> 01:54:14,780
Some cologne that by our standards today would be disgusting.

2839
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:19,580
Your eyes would just start tearing up smelling cigarettes in the perfume.

2840
01:54:19,580 --> 01:54:22,700
Cigarettes and a couple 7-in-7s, you know.

2841
01:54:22,700 --> 01:54:23,340
Yeah.

2842
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:24,780
He certainly got booze on his breath.

2843
01:54:25,420 --> 01:54:26,620
At least that, yeah, yeah.

2844
01:54:26,620 --> 01:54:27,120
100%.

2845
01:54:28,380 --> 01:54:28,700
All right.

2846
01:54:28,700 --> 01:54:31,740
Well, yeah, check the show out if you're in town.

2847
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:37,340
And as for us, extra plug here, we brought this up on the second gate,

2848
01:54:37,340 --> 01:54:40,620
but let's tell the main feed, we are going to be at Comic-Con.

2849
01:54:40,620 --> 01:54:44,620
We can't say every detail about this, but we are doing a panel

2850
01:54:44,620 --> 01:54:48,700
that is a collaboration with Mattel, actually with Mattel.

2851
01:54:48,700 --> 01:54:51,260
Mike, can you say the deal here?

2852
01:54:51,340 --> 01:54:53,500
We're going to talk about the Street Sharks.

2853
01:54:54,380 --> 01:54:59,340
We're doing the Street Sharks panel, and we can't say much beyond that,

2854
01:54:59,340 --> 01:55:01,020
and we can't officially say date or anything,

2855
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:02,140
but just keep your eyes on our social media.

2856
01:55:02,140 --> 01:55:04,380
It might be out by the time this airs, but I'm not sure.

2857
01:55:04,380 --> 01:55:04,780
Maybe.

2858
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:05,820
It's possible.

2859
01:55:05,820 --> 01:55:06,700
But come check it out.

2860
01:55:06,700 --> 01:55:09,420
If you're already going to Comic-Con, if you got the badges and everything,

2861
01:55:09,420 --> 01:55:10,620
just look out for us and come see us.

2862
01:55:10,620 --> 01:55:14,380
It's an official panel during the convention.

2863
01:55:14,380 --> 01:55:20,220
Yeah, we aren't just taking over a Taco Bell cantina and talking to potentially no one.

2864
01:55:20,220 --> 01:55:21,260
This is a real thing.

2865
01:55:21,260 --> 01:55:21,660
It's real.

2866
01:55:21,660 --> 01:55:22,540
We are insane.

We talked about Family Feud.

2870
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:31,580
That was a fun one.

2872
01:55:35,980 --> 01:55:36,540
Good stuff.

2873
01:55:38,540 --> 01:55:39,580
Michael Rooker's butt.

2874
01:55:39,580 --> 01:55:40,460
Here it is.

2875
01:55:40,460 --> 01:55:43,340
It's that scene where he's like, he's like watching TV

2876
01:55:43,340 --> 01:55:46,540
and he's like trying to like pretending he's fighting and his towel falls off

2877
01:55:46,540 --> 01:55:47,420
and you see his butt.

2878
01:55:47,420 --> 01:55:48,140
Wow.

2879
01:55:48,140 --> 01:55:48,780
Okay.

2880
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:49,340
You remember?

2881
01:55:49,340 --> 01:55:49,980
I remember.

2882
01:55:49,980 --> 01:55:51,580
I was the one who confirmed.

2883
01:55:51,580 --> 01:55:54,620
Jason, look at his butt.

2884
01:55:54,620 --> 01:55:55,580
In Jason's face.

2885
01:55:55,580 --> 01:55:56,780
I wish you could have saw Jason's face.

2886
01:55:56,780 --> 01:55:58,140
Look, look it.

2887
01:55:58,140 --> 01:56:00,140
And Jason's like, why are you showing this to me?

2888
01:56:00,140 --> 01:56:01,420
Are you looking at yours?

2889
01:56:01,420 --> 01:56:02,940
It is so close to me.

2890
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:04,940
I broke my phone holding it.

2891
01:56:04,940 --> 01:56:06,140
If you need to see it.

2892
01:56:06,140 --> 01:56:09,420
If you need to chase that out of your eyes,

2893
01:56:09,420 --> 01:56:12,780
Cruise Nostalgia is the channel I mentioned forever ago.

2894
01:56:12,780 --> 01:56:15,420
Look at some nice cruise ship images and hey,

2895
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:16,620
Cathy Lee Gifford.

2896
01:56:16,620 --> 01:56:16,940
Hey.

2897
01:56:16,940 --> 01:56:18,620
You can't complain about that either.

2898
01:56:18,620 --> 01:56:19,180
Not bad.

2899
01:56:23,980 --> 01:56:26,540
