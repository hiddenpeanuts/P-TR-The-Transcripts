1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,200
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:27,000
Welcome to Pod Dome here on Podcast the Ride the Second Gate.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hey, let's open up the dome and let the people come in, to quote the refrain that is done hundreds and hundreds of times in a row at the end of this special.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Scott Gardner's coming in. Mike Carlson's coming in.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm here. I'm in the dome. I am coming in.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Watch out, I'm coming in.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Either through a wet car or through the sky. Jason Sheridan, hi.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This is very exciting. Scott, what age did you see this at?

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh, man. I know that I saw this when I was making Moonbeam City, which was like 2014.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I think Tommy Blacha exposed me to it and kind of helped make me more of an aficionado of like Canadian oddities.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
OK, like this. He like we're watching this and I'm like, holy shit.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And then he's like, you got to go to Canada and just go and like, don't even worry about doing anything.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Just go like watch TV. Just go see what their news is like.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yeah.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Which and then I did do that trip and I I did spend a lot of time just watching TV and I fell in love with an old game show called Bumper Stumpers,

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,000
which is a game show where you guess what like truncated like novelty license plate you get like its clues.

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You know, I'm trying to think of an example of a you know what I mean?

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Like if puzzles were embedded in novelty license plates with twos and us.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So you would just decipher what what it was trying to say or they would hide part of it?

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
No, it would come up and you would have to guess what the phrase is.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And there'd be like little codes like I'm like I'm trying to think of one.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
If it's like like two lips, it wouldn't spell it out like two lips.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And that's too obvious. That would be like maybe like less to use.

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And that's somehow too.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's this is not good for an audio medium to just Google image.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's adults with like boring kind of like communications jobs in Toronto,

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
had to go sit in little cars with each other and and guess what, you know, novelty license plates meant.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Wow. OK. Bumper Stumpers.

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Was it a famous Canadian game show host like somebody we should have like not on the show,

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
maybe on the show, but like as far as radar?

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Well, you know, it's an alternate universe up there.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So it's hard to know. You know, probably not like Al DuBois, Al DuBois.

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I don't think famous here. Yeah, I could be wrong.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You know, maybe he's made his name in America since then in a way I don't know.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Check it out, though. It's just, you know, to see some adults take, you know,

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
pals and co-workers getting together to sit together in a tiny car and solve puzzles.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Well, of course, we stumbled upon the littlest hobo last year.

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah, I must have found that around the same time.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Many years of this show about a dog that goes around solving people's problems.

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah, within a matter of, you know, 20 minutes fixing everything that was wrong in a series of people's lives.

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Maybe I haven't even said this in the show. I was watching some littlest hobo like maybe last year.

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And there's an episode where a man has a theory about the littlest hobo that he's a metacanine, a new super species of dog.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Does he then try to like exploit him because he might be smarter than other dogs?

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Does he try to put them behind bars or like take them out on the road?

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I don't think so. This is season five.

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So at a certain point, somebody's like somebody actually is like, hey, this dog has solved a lot of people's problems.

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What's going on here?

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:19,000
This is sort of like the Frank Grimes episode of like, let's comment on the fact that this guy always gets his way and has won a Grammy and been to space.

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's like where we're deep in.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Can we address please that this dog seems to just like move newspapers from here to there and somehow in doing that solve entire family crises?

51
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So I don't know. I mean, we will eventually get more littlest hobo on the show because I think we all like.

52
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm glad it stuck with you.

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah, I'm a big fan.

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
There was like, boy, there was a time where that that that that whistly song was just like such comfort to me.

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
There's a voice just inspiring.

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hey, it's a real calming agent.

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah, as a lot of Canadian programming, especially from the 1980s, seems to be to me.

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:05,000
A song I feel like is not played in this special, despite how long it is that the littlest hobo theme is not played.

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I mean, yes, absolutely a big missing area there.

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And then also, like at the end of the special, lots of famous Canadians are trotted out in open top cars and that one of them is not the dog that played hobo.

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah, exactly.

62
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Littlest hobo.

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Now's your time.

64
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Open up the dome.

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm excited to let people know what all of this refers to.

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hobo didn't parachute in.

67
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Man, I mean, look, spirits were lifted.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
This is a heck of an event.

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But imagine if they had shoved the littlest hobo out of a helicopter and you might think that sounds danger.

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
No, I don't think so.

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I think he's landed on his feet.

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And I do think he's landing on his feet.

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Oh, you think no parachute?

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Parachutes fine.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We can slow him down.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You said you pitched basket, though.

77
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Is that what you just said?

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
In my mind, the dog was in a little basket with a parachute.

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
A regular dog, maybe.

80
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But the meta canine that is the littlest hobo.

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And I know that was pretend in the show, but even the actor dog who played him is himself a meta canine.

82
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He could have conveyed that much emotion.

83
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He could be in a basket.

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
He wouldn't have a parachute.

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
He would flip the basket around.

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What do you mean?

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Oh, using it as a parachute.

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He would put the handle in his mouth or her mouth and use that to slow down his descent.

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Absolutely.

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I think you're right, because that's a resourceful dog.

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Can I say something?

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
This is sort of tangentially related.

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Did you know Bubbles the Chimp is still alive?

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I didn't.

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah.

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This is something I just saw yesterday.

97
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I think Bubbles is 40 years old.

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Michael Jackson's monkey, Bubbles the Chimp, is still alive.

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Living on some sort of...

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Was Bubbles born into Michael's custody?

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That's a very good question.

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I wonder how old he was when they first encountered each other.

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah, that's a good question.

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I think the thing I read said Bubbles is 40 years old.

105
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Hopefully not an old article.

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Hopefully not from three years ago when something bad has happened to Bubbles.

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh, yeah.

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I got some big PTR curse potentially.

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Bubbles is not in his 90s though, so that's good.

110
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But is he in...

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't know monkey ages.

113
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Is he in his monkey 90s?

114
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yes.

115
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Very good point.

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm not sure.

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The Wikipedia says is a chimpanzee.

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yeah, yeah.

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Not was.

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
1983 born.

121
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
A chimpanzee.

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Nice.

123
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Retired of Florida.

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That's the dream of any chimp.

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I was thinking Bubbles had passed away, but no, Bubbles still alive.

126
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That is fascinating.

127
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Captive chimps look like they can live longer than chimps in the wild.

128
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So Bubbles is old for a chimp if he's like 40 or 41.

129
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yeah.

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I mean, Little Mama, the chimp Little Mama was over 70 years old.

131
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Who is Little Mama?

132
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't know.

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This is just Wikipedia.

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm just giving basic info.

135
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Little Mama, 79 she made it to.

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Wow.

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Good for her.

138
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Geez.

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Well, something for Bubbles to aspire to.

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
If the oldest chimp was also the most famous chimp.

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Right.

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If that is the case, I'm taking Bonzo out of the running if Bonzo is a chimp.

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Right.

144
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I don't keep my species very straight.

145
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah.

146
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But yeah, hey, something to aim for.

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Bubbles, if you're listening, maybe are because you're a smart chimp.

148
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Of course, yeah.

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Retired chimp.

150
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Nothing much to do.

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Catching up on my podcast.

152
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Wearing like a tracksuit at an animal retirement home.

153
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Pretty good.

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's a pretty good premise.

155
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Like Jordan and Jesse Goh, actually.

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yeah.

157
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's my dignified chimp voice.

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
All right.

159
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Let's get into what this is, what we're talking about.

160
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And it's something you might be a little bit familiar with because we've seeded this before.

161
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What we are focusing on here is the Sky Dome.

162
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And it's some percentage the Sky Dome, the Toronto sports venue, which is now called Rogers Center.

163
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But more primarily, it is a TV special and live event that took place called the Opening of Sky Dome Celebration.

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
We're doing it right now because we kind of promised it last year.

165
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And now it's landed perfectly via parachute into this is the 35th anniversary of that event.

166
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It happened 35 years ago this week.

167
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So this timed out very nicely.

168
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
This is something that was kind of backdoor piloted during a discussion of Alan Thicke and the Ninja Turtles

169
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:54,000
rendition of Santa Claus is Coming to Town, which itself was kind of a backdoor pilot for Alan Thicke's music,

170
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
which is something I've been wanting to get into for a while.

171
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And one of the big pieces of it, absolutely, is his performance in this hours long TV spectacular

172
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
celebrating the opening of this incredible new arena.

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And we got into it in the episode and it was clear that there was it was going to have to be a rush job.

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
We weren't going to be able to give it the full amount of time.

175
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And I was so happy that you guys were both you just signed off right away and like, OK, we'll cover that later.

176
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
We'll get we'll get to that later. Put on the list. Yeah, of course.

177
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm glad it was like enticing enough for you because you weren't familiar with this event previously.

178
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Oh, I know of it. I never sat down and I can't remember if I sat down and watched the full special.

179
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
This is doing this in that episode was like doing pandemonium circus in our happy birthday Islands of Adventure.

180
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I know. So it's the same thing would have been as ridiculous as the clowns at a circus.

181
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Why? Yes. I mean, they had enough time.

182
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
They should have had like no throwing a Betty Boop would have been at this too.

183
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yeah, I think they could have squeezed it in.

184
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yeah, yeah. It might have been between the horniest beer commercials I've ever seen.

185
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It might have been happening deep in the background.

186
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You might have like you would have to like this is like a really complicated for you.

187
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Remember that R.E.M. video from a long time ago where it kept like it keeps zooming into different details that are all happening in the same eight seconds.

188
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Imitation of life. Yes.

189
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
This is like that. If you go to wides of the Sky Dome opening, yeah, you see murders happen.

190
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You see like, you know, somebody serving papers to a criminal and then being taken away by the feds.

191
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
There's so much happening in every frame.

192
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Compression is the word I kept thinking.

193
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I kept feeling like like a 10 minute segment felt like I had watched it for like four hours.

194
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yeah, there's so much going on jam packed in these segments and in the audience.

195
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And it's like too much. It's almost cut away.

196
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And you can't really like look away because you might miss something big.

197
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I think I might have. We should all help each other.

198
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Make sure that we remember all pertinent and strange details.

199
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I wrote notes down, but I was like, oh, my God, I should have started watching this four weeks ago.

200
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I this is not enough time for me to like comb over this footage because of how much stuff is going on.

201
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And as the special goes on, we might be missing details due to the torrential rainfall

202
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
that just keeps seemingly getting worse and worse or like every camera cut.

203
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm like they they shouldn't be holding an electrified and held microphone.

204
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
They're going to get electrocuted.

205
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Well, yes, this is kind of the key detail of this tale and of the special.

206
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I've come to the table with behind the scenes info about how all of this played out.

207
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And rain is really at the heart of why there was a sky dome made at all.

208
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So before we get into the special, let me say some of the backstory that brings us to this moment in June 1989.

209
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So I said some of this before. Sky Dome is today called Rogers Center.

210
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's the stadium in Toronto that is home to the Blue Jays, their baseball team.

211
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And it is the world's first stadium with a retractable roof where you can decide we can flip this roof on or make it go back the other way,

212
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
which means that you can play baseball or whatever else you're going to do there in rain or shine.

213
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Key detail underlying that part.

214
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That is the entire reason that it exists is so we can do events without the threat of rain.

215
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And why does this place get built other than just the functional, you know, that makes sense as a thing to have?

216
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But also there's been domes, there's been the Astrodome.

217
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Why do this situation where it could go either way?

218
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Well, in 1982, there was a Canadian football game.

219
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The Toronto Argonauts were playing.

220
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And it was like a big high pressure game where like all the most important politicians were there.

221
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And it was being viewed by the largest audience in Canadian TV history.

222
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And it got rained out so hard, aggressively hard, brutal amount of rain.

223
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The bathrooms overflowed.

224
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It all ruined what was supposed to be a great day for Toronto, a great day for Canadian football.

225
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Every day is a great day for Canadian football.

226
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
We're all big fans here.

227
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And this is Americanized.

228
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
This is the tackling football.

229
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The tackling.

230
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
This is the tackling football.

231
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I believe so, right?

232
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yes, yes.

233
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
No, I have it up.

234
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm just saying this to differentiate from American football versus rest of the world football.

235
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Which is soccer.

236
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Which we call soccer.

237
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But you did it in a way that made all three of us look like the most non-sports-knowing guys possible.

238
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You exposed us.

239
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I was trying to be as...

240
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The audience did not know by this point.

241
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
They didn't know until now.

242
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I was trying to be as simple.

243
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
This is the sum-kicking football?

244
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I understand your intention.

245
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You said it in a funny way.

246
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And then Scott and I just went, uh, duh, I don't know.

247
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And then we still didn't know.

248
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That's the thing.

249
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Jason looked like a fool in one way and we looked like a fool in another.

250
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
He set all three of us up perfectly to look like we didn't know anything about sports.

251
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I don't think it's expected that we know a lot about the Canadian football league.

252
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I assume this will be the last time this ever comes up.

253
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It better be.

254
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
We're trying to protect our masculine image, Jason.

255
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Because it might help Jerry Seinfeld like us more.

256
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Oh, I know. I want him to.

257
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
He wants to restore that traditional masculinity.

258
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And if he ever hears this show, we're fucked.

259
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
We could beat him.

260
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The three of us could beat him up.

261
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Single, each of us.

262
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
At any time in his life.

263
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I just like, yeah, he's, I guess he's saying.

264
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I don't know, but dude, that guy seems like so rugged and tough and not that just like

265
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
seeing video of somebody not being pleasantly received at a college 23 years ago

266
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
would be enough to blow him over like a leaf.

267
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yeah.

268
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And also he thinks Hugh Grant is like the prime masculine man.

269
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You're like, oh, OK, I guess.

270
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I don't know, what do you think?

271
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Our problems with this film and this guy run so deep that we haven't even talked about

272
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
the bizarre treatment of Thurl Ravenscroft.

273
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I know.

274
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
This is not the place to do it.

275
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But if he thinks his way back into relevance in 2024 is to pedal a bunch of inaccuracies

276
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
about voice talent, great Thurl Ravenscroft, it's got nothing coming.

277
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's got nothing coming.

278
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Maybe this is a backdoor pilot for the full Thurl second gate episode.

279
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
That's true.

280
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
We've been talking about forever.

281
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

282
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I know from the beginning we were saying like, let's highlight these guys who we like.

283
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Yeah, why not?

284
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Let's do that.

285
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah, sure.

286
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Absolutely.

287
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
All right.

288
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
More old men to come.

289
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And maybe Jerry would like that.

290
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That we tribute old men.

291
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Tough guys.

292
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
With rugged wrinkly faces.

293
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And deep voices.

294
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Like Hugh Grant.

295
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So a bad day for Toronto.

296
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And this must have been a thing where they couldn't, as I'm wrong, maybe it's a thing

297
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
that they couldn't predict, where maybe having the option to close it or to keep it open,

298
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
because I think it's a place where weather can whiplash back and forth.

299
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I experienced really nice weather there.

300
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I experienced really terrible weather there.

301
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So the next day, a bunch of people who were at the game showed up at City Hall and chanted,

302
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
we want a dome.

303
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
We want a dome.

304
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And that began the process and earnest of figuring this out.

305
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Now, a bunch of not interesting logistics happened from 82 to 89.

306
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
But by 89, it has happened.

307
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
In May, 87, a contest was held to name the arena or the stadium.

308
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And Sky Dome was chosen by 2,000 people.

309
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So then they had to take those 2,000 and put them in a big lottery ball thing.

310
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And then Kelly Watson of Ontario won.

311
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And she got two lifetime passes to every event held in Sky Dome.

312
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Really good prize.

313
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But there was also some scorn because Lloyd Mosby, the Jays center fielder, did not like the name

314
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
and in fact said they should ban that person for life for coming up with Sky Dome.

315
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What?

316
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
This is strange to me because so much of my interest in this event and in this place is the name.

317
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Sky Dome, it's so fucking awesome.

318
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
That name rules.

319
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Also, slow your roll, buddy.

320
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You play for the Blue Jays, okay?

321
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's an MLB team that's not even in our beautiful country of the United States.

322
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Oh, your problem with them is that they aren't in America?

323
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I was just talking.

324
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I was going to go along with it so I knew what I was talking about when sports were involved.

325
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I was going to go like, yeah, notoriously bad Blue Jays don't look that up.

326
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
We'll be proven wrong immediately if I something, I'm sure.

327
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I have, talking about being on the sportsman, I have watched a lot of Phillies games this year.

328
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And I still have no idea what the infield fly roll is.

329
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What?

330
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What is the infield?

331
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I don't know.

332
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Why are you asking him?

333
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
He just said he doesn't know.

334
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I think when you hit a pop fly into the infield, but I don't, it's something the way.

335
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
We can't unpack this because either I know exactly what that is or I'm going to just embarrass myself so thoroughly right now.

336
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
There's no way.

337
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
We can't do this.

338
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Thoroughly.

339
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I only, a few weeks ago, cemented understanding of what a sacrifice fly was.

340
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You mean like when it pops up and the guy in the outfield catches it and then the people on base still can run?

341
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I don't know.

342
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You don't know generally what we're talking about at all.

343
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:11,000
There's a bunch of unwritten rules of baseball and I don't even know all the written rules of baseball.

344
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
But I've been enjoying it.

345
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I don't know.

346
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
We are getting on the path to 15 minutes of fumbling through Wikipedia pages.

347
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
This is not Jason.

348
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
This is for you to look up on your own time and then do a book report later about what you learned about the infield fly roll.

349
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Yeah, but I don't know.

350
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I agree with you, Scott.

351
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
The name is just great.

352
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It rules.

353
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's so James Bondy.

354
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's really, isn't it?

355
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And it's like combines the, well, wait, no, Thunderdome is not James Bond, but it's cool movie titles.

356
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's Thunderdome and it's meets Skyfall.

357
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I wish it was still the Skydome and I don't even hate Rogers Center as a name.

358
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I think it's a fine name.

359
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I do because it took away Skydome.

360
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yes, it took away Skydome.

361
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's not the worst.

362
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's not as bad, like nothing, no naming device, I hope, I shouldn't say will ever be as bad.

363
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Currently, no naming device is as bad as crypto.com arena, which we should be.

364
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
We should be ashamed as Angelenos.

365
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
We should be ashamed as Americans.

366
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
We should be ashamed as human beings that we all didn't do enough to stop crypto arena from happening.

367
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yeah.

368
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And really, I've said this before.

369
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's the dot just as far as name, like things that sound interesting or cool crypto, obviously the association.

370
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
But the dot com is the thing that really fucks it.

371
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yeah.

372
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You know what, because Crypto Dome is good.

373
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Crypto Dome is awesome.

374
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
That sounds pretty cool.

375
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm totally on board if it's the Crypto Dome.

376
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's the dot com that makes it seem like not classy.

377
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's like the Disney name mechanisms where we can't, like, look, I'm not bringing this up to hate.

378
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I think all the footage coming out of the Tiana ride is looking great and I can't quite, or is it Tiana's Bayou Adventure?

379
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Tiana's Bayou Adventure.

380
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It still feels like, couldn't we call it Tiana Mountain?

381
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Like, what is it?

382
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Why can't we have our stupid names anymore?

383
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yeah.

384
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Tighten these names up.

385
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Bayou Mountain would be pretty fun.

386
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Bayou Mountain's all right.

387
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Because that's like silly and whimsical.

388
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Princess Mountain.

389
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Whatever.

390
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I think Keep Mountain.

391
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yeah.

392
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I mean, yeah.

393
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
We're always talking about this.

394
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
But yeah, the hyphens and the dashes and as many words as they can pack in.

395
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Please simplify it.

396
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yeah.

397
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And truly all would be forgiven.

398
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I think everyone's going to call it the Tiana ride.

399
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I think so.

400
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I think that'll be like Star Wars land is the thing people call Galaxy's Edge.

401
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Tiana ride.

402
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh, you want to go into the Tiana ride?

403
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Yep.

404
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So we'll see.

405
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Maybe it'll change.

406
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I don't know.

407
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Yeah.

408
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Or we all finally start acting the way Disney wants and saying their big clunky titles.

409
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Maybe we'll all finally fall in line.

410
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So another thing that happens in the intervening years from announcement of this project to

411
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
opening is that they start adding a lot of shit to it.

412
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Already, they have to invent this retractable roof situation, which has never existed in

413
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
the world before.

414
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And it's like pretty efficient and cool, but extremely expensive.

415
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And then they start throwing like, well, what else can we do?

416
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And this place, when it opened, they threw a hotel on.

417
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
They threw on a health club.

418
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Like you could go to tennis courts in the baseball stadium, which is all in the unit.

419
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It helps create this kind of like urban hub where it used to just be like rail yards.

420
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
But also now this price tag is shooting up and up and up and bringing up the pressure

421
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
a lot for this place to deliver.

422
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It is home to what it opened as the 600th McDonald's in Canada.

423
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Wow.

424
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
OK.

425
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And I think at the time, the most expensive McDonald's you could find almost anywhere.

426
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Wow.

427
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So those prices are crazy.

428
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
So that made people upset.

429
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And then also a Hard Rock Cafe in Wright Field.

430
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
There was a Hard Rock Cafe with windows.

431
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
What?

432
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I didn't see that.

433
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
There was indeed.

434
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Holy shit.

435
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And I will also show you this T-shirt that commemorates it.

436
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I'll show it to you, Jason, who is wearing a Hard Rock Cafe City shirt right now.

437
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
And that is cool.

438
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,000
But it's hard to beat this different Hard Rock logo with like more sleek underlines.

439
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And it looks more like a chrome ball.

440
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And then it says Sky Dome Toronto at the end.

441
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And that Sky Dome logo is good, too, with like sun rays going into.

442
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
The D turns into an open dome.

443
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
This shirt is great.

444
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
It looks like a production company's logo or something from the 80s.

445
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Oh, yeah.

446
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Like a Vestron video or something.

447
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yes.

448
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Do you know it was a full Hard Rock or was it like kind of a little airport style?

449
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I think it was full.

450
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I believe so.

451
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I was looking.

452
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I couldn't figure out merch in there.

453
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I don't know.

454
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I don't know if they had maybe after the ceremony, they got all of Glass Tigers.

455
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
That was my next question.

456
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
What did they have in there?

457
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
This is 1989.

458
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Glass Tigers Tambourine.

459
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Lover Boy?

460
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Did they have a hit?

461
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
They're Canadian.

462
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Yeah, Canadian, right?

463
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Did they have a hit, though, by 89?

464
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I don't know.

465
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Oh, yeah.

466
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Another stuff was in the early 80s.

467
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Yeah.

468
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Corey Hart.

469
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Need some Corey Hart.

470
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Yeah, yeah.

471
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Was this a Hard Rock Cafe that was only accessible if you had tickets to a Sky Dome event?

472
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm not sure.

473
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And there is still a restaurant there.

474
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And I think you, I believe, friend of the show Bugman Buzz Buzz has been in whatever

475
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
that restaurant is now.

476
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And I think you can go and like kind of see the game.

477
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I could be wrong.

478
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I could be totally wrong.

479
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But I think there's parts of this facility where you can like get a sliver of a game

480
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
even if you didn't pay for the game.

481
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Really?

482
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Just a hell of a hack.

483
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Interesting.

484
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Again, tell a listener if you're in Toronto.

485
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Tell me if I'm totally wrong.

486
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
OK.

487
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
So this is an ambitious place.

488
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Just one facet is the Hard Rock Cafe.

489
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And when it's ready to open, they cannot just say, hey, everybody, it's open.

490
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,000
They have to do a big, mighty TV broadcast, something that is like the Olympics opening

491
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
ceremony, but just for Canada.

492
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
That's kind of what this is.

493
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It's the size and scope of that.

494
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And I'd say more entertaining than some of those that have existed here and there.

495
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Those are pretty good every year.

496
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
But I mean, come on, this is insane.

497
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
They're not as tacky, I think, is the problem.

498
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
No, no.

499
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
They are still in the same zone.

500
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Tackiness will always be a part of these things, even if it's not like 80s, 90s style tackiness.

501
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
You know, I feel like at least every Olympics opening ceremony will have things that are

502
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
somewhat embarrassing four or five years later, which is good.

503
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
That's true.

504
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
That's what we want.

505
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Right.

506
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Because if they aren't taking big swings, if it's not embarrassing, that means they

507
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
aren't taking big swings.

508
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Right.

509
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
So that gets us to this broadcast, the opening of Sky Dome, a celebration.

510
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Now, I have played probably a lot of the same clip on the Alan Thicke episode, but I'm going

511
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
to do some of it again because I can't help myself.

512
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Big opening titles with all the stars are going to be there.

513
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Glass Tiger, David Clayton, Thomas, all the stars, all the stars are out.

514
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,000
But then we get into Masters of Ceremony, Alan Thicke and Andrea Martin.

515
00:27:38,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And then thousands of people run out and come out.

516
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Thousands of people run out in glittery uniforms.

517
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Again, repeating some of this, but I mean, how could you not?

518
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
This is such a clip.

519
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
What a moment, right?

520
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It feels like so many Simpsons bits come from that.

521
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It feels like so many Simpsons writers saw crap like that.

522
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Yes.

523
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And what made fun of it in various times during their tenure.

524
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Now that we have a show that we can comment on things, the first show, seemingly, that

525
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
has any sense of irony.

526
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Just making fun of this type of thing.

527
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:43,000
That chunk of the lyrics of the world's largest retractable seal.

528
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Words that have never been in a song, ever.

529
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
They are having trouble getting it in one breath.

530
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
It's so cumbersome to even say.

531
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Multipurpose.

532
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I mean, yeah, that's a part of it.

533
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And they need to fill that line with something.

534
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
But multipurpose, you'd also say about a gymnasium.

535
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You'd say that about your high school gym.

536
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
You can play sports in there and you can do a dance in there.

537
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So it's not a very sexy word to put in the song.

538
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
80 stories, high dome.

539
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
That's also very, I said last time, it's so Christopher Guest.

540
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
That feels really Christopher Guest to me.

541
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
That they would rhyme Skydome with such and such high dome.

542
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And then it reminds me so much of the Fred Willard, Catherine O'Hara, Midnight at the Oasis

543
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
audition piece from Waiting for Guffman.

544
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Namely, this cutesy thing.

545
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And they kind of like, you know, that's Catherine O'Hara's SCTV castmate.

546
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And he's kind of a cheeseball like Fred Willard.

547
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Yeah, a number of SCTV people in here.

548
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Oh, yes, we got another one later.

549
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I was looking, this made me look up, like, hey, whatever happened to that documentary

550
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
or roundtable Martin Scorsese was going to make?

551
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Oh, yeah.

552
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And it just has been delayed due to his other directing gigs.

553
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And making lots of things.

554
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Yeah.

555
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
He had to film his TikToks with his daughter?

556
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Come on, man.

557
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
He had his TikToks with him.

558
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Maybe if he'd make the movies a little bit shorter, he could fit more of them in.

559
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I thought it was supposed to be like a roundtable and then Netflix uploads all the episodes

560
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:27,000
because I have not seen a lot of full SCTV, maybe little segments.

561
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
There's DVDs.

562
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You can track that stuff down.

563
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Yes, Timelife.

564
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Timelife was very big in selling DVDs of that.

565
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
SCTV recommendation, Rick Moran is performing downtown, you know, pink leisure suit

566
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
in the style of Michael McDonald.

567
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's got that famous Michael McDonald sketch, which is really good.

568
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
But then there's this other one.

569
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,000
He just does downtown like Michael McDonald with odd stray Michael McDonald backing vocals

570
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
while he walks through the least glamorous part of mundane Ontario you've ever seen.

571
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Maybe it's one of my favorite sketches I've ever seen.

572
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And this one I saw last night where Bill Murray is Joe DiMaggio.

573
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Who is he playing?

574
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Have you seen this one ever?

575
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
That sounds familiar, but I don't know.

576
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
He was running a restaurant and you eat for free if you pitch him a ball that he can't hit.

577
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Oh, I did see this.

578
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Yes, I did see this.

579
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
He just slams them all into all these full people.

580
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Somebody just talked about this.

581
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Was this on like a fly on the wall or something?

582
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
This came up somewhere for me to see it.

583
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Possibly.

584
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I don't know.

585
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Flying Wall, Dana Carvey and David Spade's podcast that we're often discussing off mic.

586
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
DiMaggio's on the wharf is that sketch.

587
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
That's a good one.

588
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Okay, but so that is so insane.

589
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Some of the strangest lyrics that have to serve us so much that you've ever seen.

590
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And that this is being done, this is what, a 50,000 person venue?

591
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:01,000
So crazy and a perfect place for Alan Thicke to shine to give that perfect Thicke cheesiness.

592
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And we've played little clips here and there.

593
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And I'll play one more.

594
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
But the thing to say is that this opening alone is 10 minutes long.

595
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And that's really where I got the feeling of like compression where I felt like I had lived a year in 10 minutes or something.

596
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Your daughter was a different size when the song began.

597
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
It was like interstellar.

598
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I came out of the room and I had gotten like, she had gotten older, but I hadn't.

599
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Because I was in like a time warp from watching that.

600
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Like the atmosphere was different where I was watching it.

601
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Lightyear happened.

602
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
All of your family aged and died.

603
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And then similar looking equivalents showed up many generations later.

604
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And I only experienced 10 minutes of the opening of Skydome.

605
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
The world's largest kickline sent you through a wormhole.

606
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
All those flapping of legs created this cosmic effect and whipped them around the earth.

607
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
When the football players referred to their feet as Tootsies.

608
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
500 years passed.

609
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Now I rewound that a lot because I was like, are they saying Toosies or Tootsies?

610
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I thought Tootsies.

611
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Perhaps it is Toosies.

612
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I think it is Tootsies.

613
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I think Toosies makes more sense.

614
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Tootsie is also Tootsie Goodbye.

615
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Like that's an old time song too.

616
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Not that it was this, but I'm just, I don't know.

617
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
That's why maybe I heard it that way.

618
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Is that one of your songs by the way?

619
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Tootsie Goodbye?

620
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I've certainly heard it, but I don't think it's not one of mine.

621
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
It's not one of yours.

622
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Not a Desert Island disc.

623
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
No.

624
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
We need to do, we need to make that Spotify playlist of your top 10 Desert Island discs.

625
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Oh yeah.

626
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
But I think after maybe you're hearing Tootsie Goodbye, whatever it's called.

627
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
If he sits down and listens to it, it might do it well.

628
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
That could enter the top 10.

629
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I got a clip of this and I might have cut it off mercifully before it gets to Tootsies.

630
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,000
But I picked it kind of to keep underlining the point and to the point.

631
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And I think we can all tell where this is going.

632
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:17,000
It's like what's going to happen in Act 3 is so clearly broadcasted over and over again in Act 1, including by the song.

633
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Just to stop it there.

634
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And we can close the roof whenever storms are due.

635
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
This is the most specific song ever written.

636
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
And it's about how we got a roof and we can close the roof.

637
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And when there is rain, it's a cousin to if the song was like, it's like now a musical salute to the general concept of being dry.

638
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Oh man has loved being dry for years.

639
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Safe from water, safe from beers.

640
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
So then then some football players join and we get close to the Tootsies.

641
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:15,000
OK.

642
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Like all the dancing football players are.

643
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Tackling.

644
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I don't know what they said there.

645
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
No bucking.

646
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
No bucking.

647
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
No football is the one with bucking, right?

648
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Right.

649
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Bucking is bucking.

650
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I assure you the middle school football team really didn't have any interest in hearing about singing in the rain in my experience.

651
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
You would have signed up to play if they were doing singing in the rain.

652
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Well, I I never played, but I was the manager for what football of the high school football.

653
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
No, the middle school.

654
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Pretty good.

655
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
What does the manager role entail?

656
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Getting ice and water.

657
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
So you were the P.A. is what you were.

658
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Yeah, I was the unpaid P.A.

659
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And I think I was they were they wanted me to place the what do they call the orange stand that you put the football on the kick.

660
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
You're going to fuck us again here.

661
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Well, I didn't I just said the stand was fine.

662
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I don't know the rules of I watch football and it's like I at least played baseball.

663
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I understand most of baseball.

664
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I never played football either.

665
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
But they at some point they gave up and having me run out to place it.

666
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Oh, because you had to like you had to keep the pace of the game and run at all.

667
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
You were like a ball boy.

668
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Like that's like how the ball boy tennis ball.

669
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
They don't have those like a thankless job.

670
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
How did you get yourself in this position?

671
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Yeah. Why would you do that?

672
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:58,000
The science, the sixth grade science teacher, a man who would occasionally fall asleep due to his narcolepsy.

673
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I had a narcoleptic teacher.

674
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
He asked me it was like you got to do this next year.

675
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And I was helped.

676
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I was where I was doing the yearbook.

677
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I was.

678
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Yeah, that makes sense.

679
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Yeah, absolutely.

680
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
That makes sense.

681
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And then I was also managing the football team and football season course ended.

682
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And then the play started.

683
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I want to say I think I take Umbridge with you saying I was managing the football.

684
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Because it sounds like you were doing something.

685
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Being this manager role.

686
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
But I was managing implied that you like could say something and they would listen to you.

687
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Scott, look, I kind of I kind of take my kicks where I can get it.

688
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
OK.

689
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And you did.

690
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It sounds important.

691
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I bet.

692
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It sounds important.

693
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
That's what you're saying.

694
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
It sounds like I'm managing.

695
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
But like I guess a manager could just be really like a functional job.

696
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It was mostly dragging the bag of balls and occasionally filling up the cooler and the

697
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
water dispenser.

698
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
But you were never in.

699
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I had to use like a hand cart because like a person can't lift a full like water.

700
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Right.

701
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It's incredibly heavy.

702
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And I was like tiny.

703
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I was like four foot.

704
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
You're the size of the water.

705
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And then every now and then, like the football players were like, oh, we're going to give

706
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
you a swirl.

707
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And that thankfully never happened.

708
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
They threatened swirlies that didn't come to pass swirlies.

709
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
But it's like this guy thinks he can manage us.

710
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
The Roughnecks on the what is what's the seventh grade team?

711
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Whatever the what was the Chichester Eagles?

712
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
The Chichester Eagles manager.

713
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Did you but you never got in the huddle?

714
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
No.

715
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
OK.

716
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Even like I just want to say, do a bang up job.

717
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And just playing is winning.

718
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
They as well have a ball like they're like, all right, we're going to do.

719
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
But I'm going to blow it here because I don't know anything like we're going to go down

720
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
the field.

721
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
We're going to do this.

722
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Yeah, I want this to pop.

723
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And he goes, hey, fellas, we're all going to it's starting to rain.

724
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
How about a little song to cheer you up and get you motivated?

725
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I bet you all got pretty gals out in the stands.

726
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Be sure to wave to him and blow him a smooch.

727
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
And if one of them accidentally hits me, I won't complain.

728
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Let's wrap this game up.

729
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I bet we all got to go home and do our homework and read Mark Wade's newest issue of the Flash

730
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
comic.

731
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
My tootsies are getting stuck in the muddy ground.

732
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
It's cold out here.

733
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Why are we out here at all?

734
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I also I think what happened with that with the narcoleptic teacher is that you were on

735
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
one side of the room.

736
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Then he dozed off.

737
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
You at casual speed walked to the other side of the room.

738
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
He went came back to.

739
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Whoa, how did he?

740
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
What happened?

741
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Speedy Gonzalez here.

742
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
How did he get from here to there?

743
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Right.

744
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
You should be down on the football field, my friend.

745
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I think it was the first science class, too, where we're in like the science classroom

746
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
with lab tables, big black like stone tables.

747
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Yeah.

748
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And beakers and chemicals.

749
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And looking back, I'm like, I don't know that you want a guy with narcolepsy.

750
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
In a room full of children and chemicals.

751
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Well, if someone spills something, it'll presumably wake him up.

752
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Whatever.

753
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Yeah.

754
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
What if he falls asleep on the Bunsen burner or something when it was on with his tie right

755
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
in there?

756
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Yeah, really bad.

757
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
He didn't fall asleep standing up, though, I guess.

758
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I guess not.

759
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
You'd have to be sitting down usually, I think.

760
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I guess it depends how bad your narcolepsy is.

761
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I mean, he was very old, too.

762
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
So he might have been sleepy.

763
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
No, he told us he was a narcoleptic pretty early on.

764
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Did he ever fall asleep while standing up right into a standing skeleton model?

765
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And then it looked like the two of them were getting it on.

766
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Did that ever happen, Jason?

767
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Well, the skeleton model would put in the DHS tape if he would fall asleep.

768
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Oh, he was rigged up like mousetrap style.

769
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
In my absence, here's the plan.

770
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I will fall asleep into the skeleton, and he'll push in a copy of...

771
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
What year did Kevin Klein's Dave come out?

772
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I feel like every classroom had a copy.

773
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Well, what year did it come out?

774
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
And then add six years.

775
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
The hottest movie in Hollywood, Dave.

776
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
The hottest movie.

777
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Wow, I didn't know that you were a manager.

778
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
That's incredible.

779
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
We keep finding lines.

780
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I know.

781
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Wow.

782
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
So a bunch of stuff is said in this song.

783
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
They claim that it's multi-purpose.

784
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
They're like, we will do operas here.

785
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
No, you won't.

786
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I bet if I looked that up, there's never an opera in Sky Dome.

787
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I mean, it sounds cool, but that's the kind of thing they have to tell people in the neighborhood to get them up.

788
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
They told people there would be operas at City Walk, I bet.

789
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Okay, then very good.

790
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Build away.

791
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I feel like Sky Dome does not have the best acoustics for an opera.

792
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Most likely not, or it really lets it shine.

793
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
That voice can really travel all the way to the rafters.

794
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:11,000
And then there's also, there's going to be Broadway, which is the excuse then to give all the baseball players and football players...

795
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I forget now what they sing.

796
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
That's not the worst thing that I forgot.

797
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Do they all do like, memory?

798
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I mean, that's performed later.

799
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
That is performed later in a very confusing fashion.

800
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Memory medley.

801
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Yeah, it is a memory medley, because I was like, why is, she's from Cats?

802
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
They say she's from Cats.

803
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
But she's singing the way we were.

804
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Yeah, yeah, really through me.

805
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
And then it goes into the Cats memory.

806
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And then it kicks into the hit.

807
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Yes, Trump's favorite.

808
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:47,000
But so, yeah, this thing goes and goes and it's full of like brassy singing and that kind of stuff.

809
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
It's just like, you could tell this was like the dream come true for whoever was putting into it.

810
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Like, ah, finally, this is what they'll remember me for.

811
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
And this part goes off without a hitch, I got to say.

812
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Yeah, yeah.

813
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I mean, it's like crazy and corny, but boy, I'm eating it up.

814
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I love it.

815
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And then like when you think they're out of moves, then they do like, give me an S, give me a K, and they spell the entire name.

816
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:21,000
And then this is really where it gets like super Christopher Goose Simpsons that they, it's sky dome, sky dome, your dome, my dome.

817
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Incredible.

818
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
People just used to write stuff like that.

819
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It wasn't supposed to be laughed at.

820
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I know.

821
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
That is so weird.

822
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
So weird.

823
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Yeah.

824
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Did you find the writer of it?

825
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,000
It says in the credits and somewhere in the special, I think they, I found interviews with the choreographer.

826
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:47,000
There's nothing terribly interesting in there, but the person who put together the world's largest kick line, which does also occur in the midst of all this.

827
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Right.

828
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:56,000
There's also that part where they interview a bunch of like, you know, the kinds of people who would go volunteer to be part of a big kick line for weeks and weeks.

829
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Well, that's an interesting part.

830
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I don't remember.

831
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Yeah.

832
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I didn't write down any of their part.

833
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Maybe I could find it really quick.

834
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Do you remember any of the, that is, that is some just like real good old regular Canadian.

835
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Yeah.

836
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Mundane folks.

837
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
But some people are like high, like some people are like hyped and like a little odd.

838
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:19,000
It's the dream of like civic engagement, but I'm like, wait, they all volunteered for that?

839
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And they, Alan Thicke just said this cost half a billion dollars.

840
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
It's really important.

841
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
There's money around.

842
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Get paid, folks.

843
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:35,000
We got, we discussed this with Super Bowl halftime shows that I think still a lot of roles in Super Bowl halftime shows are bad.

844
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Halftime shows are volunteer positions.

845
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
The people that run, like the fans that run onto the field, I think, specifically.

846
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
In a way I get that, but I think, and this might not be sure anymore.

847
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Maybe now just like logistically, it's like we are paying dancers.

848
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
That is like a Canadian job.

849
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:58,000
But for sure in that crazy Indiana Jones one, it was still like an all volunteer group came out to Joe Robbie Stadium to what?

850
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Why?

851
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
It's Disney plus Super Bowl.

852
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
What is the need to volunteer for this?

853
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
In this case, I'm like, you're right.

854
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
They should be getting paid because there is a giant corporation, which I think is literally called Stade Co.

855
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I'm saying that because it's short for stadium, but it looks more like Stad Co.

856
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
That's easier to say.

857
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Yeah.

858
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
The Stad Co.

859
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Corporation, unfortunately, has gone over on building the right field Hard Rock Cafe.

860
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
We had to we had to purchase some expensive locks of Geddy Lee's hair.

861
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And thus that and that money was going to go towards playing the kickliners.

862
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
But out of the question now, a thing that bumped for me.

863
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:46,000
So they had the little the musical number with football players, a little musical number with people in baseball uniforms.

864
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
And then it just cuts to a medley of Broadway songs.

865
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,000
And I started to get really hyped because they go into 42nd Street, but it's just 42nd Street.

866
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
It's not Sky.

867
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
It's not Sky Dome lyrics.

868
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Yeah, they didn't change the lyrics.

869
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
They didn't change the lyrics, but I have.

870
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
So if you would humor me.

871
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Wow.

872
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
The most micro specific parody.

873
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Are you kidding me?

874
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Wow.

875
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
It's just a couple.

876
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Get hyped, y'all.

877
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Are you singing it?

878
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I'll sing it.

879
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Please. Yeah.

880
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Go ahead.

881
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Sky Dome retract on the Avenue.

882
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I'm taking you to one Blue Jays way because that's the actual address to the Sky Dome.

883
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
That part, too.

884
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Yeah, because that's the address of the address.

885
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Oh, yeah.

886
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Wow.

887
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
You were inspired to write a little song because it was you were hyped because it's what you like.

888
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Yes.

889
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
That's amazing.

890
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Is that what's the name of the song?

891
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
That's 40 seconds.

892
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
It's called 42nd Street.

893
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
That's the title.

894
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I've seen it.

895
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I apologize.

896
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I don't know the name.

897
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Is 42nd Street on your 10 Desert Island Discs?

898
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I think so.

899
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Yes.

900
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
All right.

901
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
That's pretty good.

902
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Because the original cast recording got Jerry Orbach doing a couple of numbers.

903
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Sure.

904
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
That's good.

905
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
And he's great.

906
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And the only modern song is which Postal Service?

907
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
The what?

908
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
The only modern song on this Top Ten?

909
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I know.

910
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
It gets up to what?

911
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
2013.

912
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
That is.

913
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
There's one new Pornographer is the one Postal Service and the rest are all.

914
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Yeah.

915
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Yeah.

916
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
It's 42nd Street.

917
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Postal Service New Pornographers, Ding Dong Daddy from Doomis from the Nathan Veehler,

918
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Nathan Reuven finale.

919
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Oh, yeah.

920
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Oh, yeah.

921
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,680
Ding Dong Daddy from Doomis.

922
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:35,800
Let me try, you know, if that wasn't enough razzle dazzle for you from Jason, I just landed

923
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,000
randomly in the clip of the auditioners.

924
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,760
I meant to curate a clip of this.

925
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,440
I haven't vetted this, so I don't know what we're going to land on, but I think we can't

926
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,440
go wrong.

927
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,440
Let's see the kind of people that would volunteer for a kickline for weeks.

928
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,440
I feel this is going to be a good one.

929
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,440
Here we go.

930
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,440
You all set?

931
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,440
Thank you.

932
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,440
We have some good thorns here in Sky Dome.

933
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,440
Being a Sky Dome dancer is wonderful.

934
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,440
Oh, it's wonderful.

935
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,440
All right.

936
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,440
What am I going to say?

937
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,440
It's wonderful.

938
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,440
I'm just playing a little bit of the town of Covert to Sky Dome.

939
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,440
Hi, Covert.

940
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,440
All right.

941
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:22,200
Mr. Rowland taught me how to move in this Sky Dome course, however, I still didn't lose

942
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,200
my accent.

943
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,200
All right.

944
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,200
Great.

945
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,200
This is wonderful.

946
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:30,040
We got a strange melting pot here.

947
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:35,120
Those two who talked exactly in that pleasant Canadian clip tone, they would have been great

948
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,120
bumper stumpers.

949
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,120
That's what they're all like.

950
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,120
Oh, yeah.

951
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,120
They're the most mild-mannered.

952
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,120
Right, right.

953
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,120
I'm stay-at-home mom.

954
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:46,720
Well, my favorite wasn't in that clip, of course, the woman who goes, there's only one

955
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,280
thing I'd like to do more than Sky Dome.

956
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,280
Oh, that's what I-

957
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,280
All right.

958
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,280
Wait, I'll find it.

959
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,280
I'll find it.

960
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,280
I love Sky Dome, and let's go course.

961
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,280
Let's break the world record's longest kickline.

962
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:06,800
I can only think of one other thing I'd rather be doing than Sky Dome.

963
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,800
Wow.

964
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,800
Fucking.

965
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,800
She's talking about fucking.

966
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,800
Wow.

967
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,800
That's the most scandalous thing in the whole thing.

968
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,800
We'll have some fucking here.

969
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,640
We'll look the other way.

970
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,640
Did they get fined?

971
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,600
Did Canadian government fine them for that?

972
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,600
That was the body of thing ever on the CDC.

973
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,600
Right.

974
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,600
They had to have meetings.

975
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,040
You know, it was a little risque.

976
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,840
It was a bit risque, but we'll let it slide this time.

977
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,840
But that's a warning.

978
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,840
We're giving you a flag.

979
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:37,800
You can't be on TV again in six weeks' time.

980
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:42,760
Now throw to the La Bat Bleu commercial, which is the dirtiest, the second dirtiest thing

981
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,760
we've ever seen.

982
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,960
Okay, you say that, and I noted that there was a La Bats commercial, and when I went

983
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,560
to Toronto, I had some La Bats.

984
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,560
I love drinking some La Bats.

985
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,560
Sure.

986
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,320
They had a little like base beer they got, but what happened in the ad?

987
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,320
I don't remember the ad.

988
00:49:55,320 --> 00:50:03,000
Well, there's one where they're talking about like, you know, meeting people and going out,

989
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,360
and then there's another one.

990
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:12,440
There's a Molson's ad where like it's like three guys at a table, of course, are all

991
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:19,560
dressed in denim, and then two sexy ladies walk by, and the one guy's like, him?

992
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,920
And they're like, no, him?

993
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:27,760
No, and he points at himself, and they go, yes, and then it cuts, and he has joined their

994
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:33,560
table of two, and he's giving a thumbs up, you know, holding a Molson's.

995
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:39,760
Is this yet another Jason's interest in thirding coming into play?

996
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:44,080
Look, how if we got to, if it relates to thirding.

997
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:48,360
Ah, a rare male unicorn, interesting.

998
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:52,040
Because they're different in Canada.

999
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,320
The challengers, there's an old challengers thing there.

1000
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,320
Yeah, it's reverse challenges.

1001
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,920
Oh, is it this one?

1002
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,760
I'm trying to find it because I was-

1003
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,240
Oh, this is the Molson's one.

1004
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,280
This is the one you were talking about just now?

1005
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,280
Yeah.

1006
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,280
Okay.

1007
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,280
They're like all dressed like Blossom or something.

1008
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,400
They have like big kind of hair and little hats.

1009
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,360
You get good ads in whatever version of this.

1010
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,360
If you want to follow along with us, the YouTube user is David Dixon.

1011
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:22,160
I don't know, there's probably multiple versions, but that's one I saw.

1012
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,160
Good ads throughout.

1013
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,560
You get an ad for Ghostbusters 2.

1014
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:30,920
You get an ad for an equally well-liked film today, Lou Diamond Phillips and Kiefer Sutherland

1015
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,920
and Renegades.

1016
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,920
Renegades.

1017
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:33,920
Oh, yeah.

1018
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,920
Renegades.

1019
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,920
Multiple Renegades ads.

1020
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,800
Cool aid ad here that says, having kids means having cool aid.

1021
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,400
Oh, yeah.

1022
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,400
You can control the sugar because it's on sweet and cool aid mix.

1023
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,400
Yes, it's on sweet and cool aid mix.

1024
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,400
Yeah, yeah.

1025
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,400
So you control how much-

1026
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,400
Is that still how cool aid works?

1027
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,400
I haven't- Jason, when was the last time you had cool aid?

1028
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,400
I haven't had cool aid in a while.

1029
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,400
I might have had it-

1030
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,400
March.

1031
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:01,400
Every now and then you see it at like Southern Food or something or restaurants.

1032
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,400
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1033
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,400
But you haven't had a canister or a little packet in a while.

1034
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,400
I have.

1035
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,400
I don't remember the last time I had it.

1036
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:14,400
I think I sent it to you at some point, but we tried the Sunny D Hard Vodka Seltzer.

1037
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,400
Right.

1038
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,400
Which does taste like Sunny D.

1039
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,400
It's kind of weird.

1040
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:24,400
I'm surprised they're even doing that to confuse the brand, which is a child drink.

1041
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,400
Cool aid hasn't made a hard cool aid.

1042
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,400
No, yeah.

1043
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,400
So it seems odd for them to do that, but yeah.

1044
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,400
So I won't be supporting this is what I'm saying.

1045
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,400
Everybody's doing what they can in this economy.

1046
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,400
I won't be supporting that kind of drink side.

1047
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,400
Turning to the drink side.

1048
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,400
Bidenomics, right?

1049
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,400
I loved cool aid as a kid, I will say.

1050
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,400
I was like, oh my God, are we getting like three packets of cool aid?

1051
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,400
It's so exciting.

1052
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,400
You watch that ad, having a kid means having cool aid.

1053
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,400
And I was like, it does?

1054
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,400
We're back, yeah.

1055
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,400
When?

1056
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,400
Yeah.

1057
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,400
At what age is that allowed?

1058
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,400
How soon can I put that in this bottle?

1059
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,400
I think we were more of a country time lemonade household.

1060
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,400
They controlled the sugar.

1061
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,400
I was going to say that-

1062
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,400
In fact, they controlled the sugar on that.

1063
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,400
That was a sweet ass lemonade.

1064
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,400
That was sugary lemonade.

1065
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,400
Which we couldn't get it, I think, because it was too sugary.

1066
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,400
We very rarely had country time because my mom felt it was too sugary.

1067
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,400
Did you have a soda fridge?

1068
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,400
Well, my grandma had a soda fridge.

1069
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,400
We did not.

1070
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,400
She had one in the basement where you'd go down and there were like six different varieties.

1071
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,400
Sounds like bribery to me.

1072
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,400
Yeah, well she had a Super Nintendo and a soda fridge.

1073
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,400
Well, my grandma had the Disney Channel and we didn't.

1074
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,400
That's pretty good.

1075
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,400
And an endless amount of Fruit by the Foot.

1076
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,400
So you got to do what you can to get the visits.

1077
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,400
Did she have a Fruit by the Foot cabinet?

1078
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,400
Not a dedicated Fruit by the Foot cabinet.

1079
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,400
Jason, did you have one of those?

1080
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,400
My grandma was so lame she didn't even have a full Fruit by the Foot cabinet.

1081
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,400
I think it was mostly stale hers or Ut's chips.

1082
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,400
Okay.

1083
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,400
Have you thought about getting at least a mini soda fridge?

1084
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,400
We have a shelf with a lot of beverages in it right now.

1085
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,400
Okay.

1086
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,400
So it sounds like maybe you're headed that way.

1087
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,400
Coke Zero.

1088
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,400
Maybe you're headed that way.

1089
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,400
Yeah.

1090
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,400
Okay.

1091
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,400
Well, it depends.

1092
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,400
He has to increase this campaign of drinking more soda.

1093
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,400
Right.

1094
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,400
Is that going well?

1095
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:23,400
You know, it helps me keep my constantly flagging energy up.

1096
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,400
Okay.

1097
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,400
We're trying to stay on top of more healthy choices.

1098
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,400
Sure.

1099
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,400
Well, we're all trying to do that.

1100
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,400
Yes.

1101
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,400
Well, so Kool-Aid and Sunny D.

1102
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,400
I'll pass out your assignments.

1103
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,400
Jason gets Kool-Aid, you get Sunny D.

1104
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,400
We did have Sunny D in the house a few weeks ago.

1105
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,400
Regular Sunny D.

1106
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,400
Yeah.

1107
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,400
It was good.

1108
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,400
We're not doing orange juice.

1109
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,400
Living it up, boy.

1110
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,400
Now that was a weekend.

1111
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,400
I would love to see a picture of your drink shelf.

1112
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,400
Oh, I'll take a picture.

1113
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,400
I think the listeners would as well.

1114
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,400
I think they would too.

1115
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,400
Leave them out.

1116
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,400
You don't need to clean it up, you know?

1117
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,400
Yeah.

1118
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,400
Okay.

1119
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:03,400
So you also get an ad where an Oreo retracts like the Sky Dome.

1120
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,400
Oh, okay.

1121
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,400
Don't forget that one.

1122
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,400
Yes.

1123
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,400
It conveys the process in a pretty realistic fashion with an Oreo.

1124
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,400
That ad would not play in LA or New York.

1125
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,400
No.

1126
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,400
So opening sequence happens.

1127
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,400
Then we get some Alan Thicke stand-up.

1128
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,400
Thank God.

1129
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:26,400
We aren't done with the Thicke material.

1130
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,400
This is part of the big push.

1131
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,400
We're going to put Canadian baseball on the map.

1132
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,400
We're going to prove once and for all that our Cubans are better than their Cubans.

1133
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,400
Yes.

1134
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,400
Yes.

1135
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,400
He gets laughs in this.

1136
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,400
He does pretty good.

1137
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,400
And I think stadium stand-up.

1138
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,400
Look, this wasn't a thing at the time.

1139
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,400
This was not the Sebastian Maniscalco era.

1140
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,400
So Alan's doing what he can.

1141
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,400
I think he's just working pretty good.

1142
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,400
He's working pretty good.

1143
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,400
Are those laughs real?

1144
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:55,400
Because Dave Thomas later gets laughs, but I think those were piped in.

1145
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,400
They feel kind of fake, don't they?

1146
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,400
Yeah.

1147
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,400
Yeah.

1148
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,400
Especially because that Dave Thomas bit is insufferable.

1149
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,400
He also does some of his bits like twice.

1150
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,400
Yes.

1151
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,400
He repeats one.

1152
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,400
Because the bit is that he's on the Jumbotron and he says like,

1153
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,400
Oh, hello, all you little people down there.

1154
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,400
I could eat you up if I wanted to.

1155
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,400
Om, om, om, om.

1156
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,400
And it gets a laugh.

1157
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,400
But I think it's a fake laugh.

1158
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,400
I think they have like, because was this aired live?

1159
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,400
Yeah.

1160
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,400
Oh, yeah.

1161
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,400
Well, because it wouldn't have played out the way it did.

1162
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,400
Oh, right.

1163
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,400
Of course.

1164
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,400
Of course.

1165
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,400
Jesus.

1166
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,400
Yeah.

1167
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,400
I think they have a button.

1168
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,400
I think somebody's hitting a button.

1169
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,400
Yeah.

1170
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:42,400
We didn't talk about the other host who appears on the helicopter at the beginning.

1171
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,400
Brian Williams.

1172
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,400
Oh, yeah.

1173
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,400
Another Brian Williams.

1174
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,400
Yeah.

1175
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,400
For the helicopter.

1176
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,400
But for real.

1177
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,400
Yes.

1178
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,400
This one was on a helicopter.

1179
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,400
That's why I was going to say this is a properly remembered helicopter.

1180
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:58,400
But is that another Brian Williams or is that?

1181
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,400
No, that's not that Brian Williams.

1182
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,400
No, no, no.

1183
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,400
It's not fake helicopter Brian Williams.

1184
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,400
This is Canada's Brian Williams.

1185
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,400
Or shot at in a helicopter.

1186
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,400
Brian Williams probably was in a helicopter.

1187
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,400
He just wasn't.

1188
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:11,400
He was allowed to keep the name in the news medium because it's two different markets.

1189
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:19,400
Wait, but I think the IMDB entry for this lists Brian Williams, the news broadcaster.

1190
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:27,400
Well, IMDB has some problems such as listing Michael Eisner as the golfer and soren despite

1191
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,400
me having proven this incorrect.

1192
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,400
So you can't remember, folks.

1193
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,400
You can't trust IMDB.

1194
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:40,400
And if you look at my IMDB and see a bunch of old Funny or Die videos that I would rather

1195
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,400
forget the existence of, remember those might be false credits.

1196
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,400
Yeah.

1197
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,400
Remember that.

1198
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,400
Some of them are.

1199
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:52,400
I've tried maybe 20 times, no exaggeration, to get rid of something called the Bachmann's

1200
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,400
You've Got Mail, spelled M-A-L-E.

1201
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,400
And I had nothing to do with the sketch.

1202
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,400
I don't know what it is.

1203
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,400
It's about, you know, ancient GOP candidate Michelle Bachmann.

1204
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,400
Oh, right.

1205
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,400
I do not.

1206
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,400
And no one is looking at my IMDB and carrying them now.

1207
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,400
I guess, OK, look, if I'm going to bring it up on the show, audience, we just go and

1208
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:17,400
click on the Bachmann's You've Got Mail and get the star meter up on that so that, you

1209
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:22,400
know, maybe somebody will click on me to direct the next Thor or something.

1210
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,400
Can I guess who plays Michelle Bachmann?

1211
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,400
Is there a Michelle Bachmann in it?

1212
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,400
I think so.

1213
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,400
Is it Kathy Griffin?

1214
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,400
Good guess.

1215
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:35,400
I think this might have been an Aaron Gibson recurring character at The Tough Fellow

1216
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,400
podcaster and nice person, Aaron Gibson.

1217
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,400
But I could be wrong.

1218
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:45,400
Maybe there were many different Michelle Bachmann's at the time, like because the era

1219
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:49,400
spanned four years, maybe different people played her.

1220
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,400
Yeah, possibly.

1221
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,400
Look, you know, it was tough in front of your dad.

1222
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,400
We never landed on a Romney.

1223
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,400
We never got our Romney.

1224
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,400
Rob Delaney did it just once and then he never came back.

1225
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,400
He got too busy.

1226
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:03,400
It's why it was a tough election and it's why when 2016 rolled around, we've got Trump

1227
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:09,400
and Trump is funny and we could all finally have fun with a political campaign again.

1228
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,400
Yeah, finally.

1229
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:17,400
Here's something interesting about what Alan Thicke talks about is that he says, you know,

1230
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,400
hey, maybe we'll win a couple of World Series here.

1231
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:26,400
And the way that we tend to, you know, if we're talking about a place, it tends to be

1232
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,400
cursed.

1233
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:31,400
We were just talking about the Bass Pro Shops pyramid, which used to be where the Grizzlies

1234
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,400
played.

1235
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,400
And I think they had a pretty not good run in that play.

1236
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,400
So I'm hearing Alan Thicke say, we're going to win some World Series.

1237
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:43,400
And I'm like, let's see how that worked out because I bet they put too much money into

1238
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,400
the McDonald's and then failed.

1239
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:49,400
Two years later, they won two World Series in a row.

1240
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,400
The Skydome worked out spectacularly.

1241
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,400
This was what they needed.

1242
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,400
Yeah, Thicke called it like Babe Ruth.

1243
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,400
If Thicke hadn't said it, it might not have happened.

1244
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:06,400
But yeah, this is a case where a big dumb themed event did not damn the stadium for

1245
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,400
all eternity.

1246
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,400
They won a couple of World Series right after.

1247
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,400
Oh, right.

1248
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,400
They beat the Phillies in 93.

1249
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,400
Oh, I'm sorry to remind you.

1250
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,400
We were so excited for that series.

1251
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,400
Apologies.

1252
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:22,400
They came back in 2008, the Phillies.

1253
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,400
Only took them 15 years.

1254
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:32,400
So then the other acts start pouring because we've got a full evening's worth of entertainment

1255
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,400
planned.

1256
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:37,400
The first act up is precision police motorcycle riding.

1257
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,400
Oh, I wrote that down.

1258
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:44,400
They put spotlights onto police motorcycles and they kind of like weave in and out of

1259
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,400
each other.

1260
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:49,400
OK, it's the Ontario Police Golden Helmets Precision Team.

1261
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,400
I believe that's the same thing you're talking about.

1262
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,400
Yeah, Golden Helmets Precision Team.

1263
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,400
Golden Helmets.

1264
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,400
Yeah.

1265
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,400
Yeah, the Golden Helmets made it much heavier, much tougher to drive in, but it was worth

1266
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,400
it.

1267
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,400
Made it read to the back row.

1268
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,400
But they don't stop there.

1269
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:17,400
They pair the Golden Helmets up with Canada's presumably hottest band at the time.

1270
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:21,400
Welcome to our Sky Dome opening celebration.

1271
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:26,400
Capital recording artists and Juneau Award entertainers of the year.

1272
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,400
Glass Tiger.

1273
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,400
Sounds like a coming out of our shells tour song.

1274
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,400
Big Pyro burst there.

1275
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:52,400
Sometimes Canadian entertainment is like Christian entertainment.

1276
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,400
That was the exact same thought.

1277
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,400
Just like what is it that is not hooking up here?

1278
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:02,400
There's definitely like, you know, not always, not in every case, but in this case, I would

1279
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:07,400
say, just like with Christian entertainment, like maybe an inherent lack of sex appeal

1280
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,400
is that that might be what it is.

1281
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,400
Whatever.

1282
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,400
He's fun.

1283
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,400
But he's just, you know, he's kind of this like, he's kind of this doofy guy with doofy

1284
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,400
hair.

1285
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,400
Telephone rings and I'm coming for you.

1286
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,400
I'm feeling the night in my veins.

1287
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,400
It's just nonsense.

1288
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,400
Van Halen is happening and it's like cool.

1289
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:33,400
And at the time, yeah, it's almost yeah, it's almost like a like royalty free music library

1290
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,400
was tasked with.

1291
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,400
Yeah.

1292
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,400
Come up with something that's like Van Halen.

1293
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,400
Right.

1294
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,400
And that's what they did with no personality.

1295
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,400
We are listening in that case to the song searching.

1296
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:51,400
Glass Tigers hit searching number two in Canada, number 31 in America.

1297
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,400
And they won Junos to Junos.

1298
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,400
That's a whole other.

1299
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,400
I love the Junos.

1300
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,400
Yeah.

1301
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,400
I've never watched somehow in all of my old TV wanderings.

1302
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,400
I've never watched a Junos broadcast.

1303
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,400
You better bet when I do.

1304
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,400
If I see anything interesting, I'll bring it to the podcast.

1305
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,400
I don't know that I've ever watched a full one.

1306
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,400
I've certainly seen my share of bare naked ladies win a Juno.

1307
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,400
Oh, there you go.

1308
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,400
You know, right.

1309
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,400
Right.

1310
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,400
I've seen them get into the hall of fame.

1311
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,400
Now, look, that's good Canadian music.

1312
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:27,400
That's a big, popular, legit Canadian band in the pride of Canada.

1313
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,400
They crossed over, yeah.

1314
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,400
Does it break from what I said about inherent sex appeal?

1315
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,400
I would say no.

1316
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:36,400
I would not, of all the, I know it's, I like a lot of bare naked ladies songs.

1317
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,400
I would not put in the list of qualities about them as sexy.

1318
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,400
I think that's probably correct.

1319
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:47,400
They are a bunch of dorks and remain sexy.

1320
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,400
Dorks.

1321
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,400
And remain a bunch of dorks.

1322
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,400
Which, hey.

1323
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:54,400
Hey, welcome to the, yes, present company.

1324
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,400
Yes, of course.

1325
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,400
Appreciate the dork representation.

1326
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:01,400
Yeah, and they probably know more about sports, chances are, than us.

1327
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,400
Almost anyone would.

1328
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:11,400
Glass Tigers performing and our motto of rollerbladers comes out, a lot of whom are in Christmas colors inexplicably.

1329
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,400
And that's what we're dealing with.

1330
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,400
It's like using all that.

1331
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:19,400
We've got a three tiered stage and we've got pyro on the stage, but we've got to use that bottom area too.

1332
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:23,400
So what else, all right, just like how about a thousand rollerbladers.

1333
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:31,400
And all of these, this is really where the spirit of it is, is that like they fill that extra arena space with so many people.

1334
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,400
How did they possibly coordinate all of these?

1335
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,400
Where did they all go in the bowels of Sky Dome?

1336
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,400
Right.

1337
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:43,400
It's not like, yeah, like what is the average thing happening here, a sporting event?

1338
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:47,400
Let's say it's some football teams, where they have 30 people on each side.

1339
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,400
Again, I'm embarrassing myself here.

1340
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,400
Not on the field.

1341
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,400
How many people on a football side?

1342
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,400
I know there's special teams.

1343
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:01,400
But like, what is it, a couple hundred people that need to be around?

1344
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:06,400
Obviously there's production people and all that, but like there's just so many changing out of what they're doing.

1345
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,400
I agree.

1346
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,400
Where are they all going?

1347
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,400
Are they in the parking lot?

1348
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,400
I don't know.

1349
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,400
It's weird.

1350
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,400
I think everyone in Toronto was, you know what?

1351
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:17,400
I don't know if they were in the parking lot because complaint about Sky Dome, not very good parking.

1352
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:21,400
I think Alan Thicke makes a joke about that very premise.

1353
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,400
You know, he does a little bit of J.

1354
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:26,400
He like, and this place looks expensive.

1355
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,400
He like commented on what was on people's minds.

1356
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,400
You know, comedians today, we don't go for it like Alan Thicke used to.

1357
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,400
Who inspired Alan Thicke to get into show business?

1358
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,400
I am fascinated by his delivery.

1359
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,400
And like, is it Robert Goulet?

1360
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,400
Like, where does that kind of over the top cheesiness?

1361
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,400
Is that a depper gentleman kind of thing?

1362
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:53,400
A big explosion of volume and then kind of a trail off back to where you started.

1363
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,400
Right. But he's not doing that ironically.

1364
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:58,400
That's sort of his just normal comedy delivery.

1365
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,400
Yeah.

1366
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,400
Normal showman delivery.

1367
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,400
At some point, is it him that says-

1368
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,400
It's normal showman delivery?

1369
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,400
It's showman ships.

1370
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,400
It's showman ships.

1371
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,400
Is it Amu that says, it's a way of life and a national sport?

1372
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,400
Of course he is talking about aerobics.

1373
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,400
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1374
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,400
Yeah, we get a big aerobics chunk where I'm starting to think,

1375
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:24,400
are we going to get another Alan Thicke aerobics song in the spirit of sweaty and hot?

1376
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,400
Right.

1377
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,400
Which I talked about last time and we don't, but it's still nice to see him up there.

1378
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,400
He clearly was intrigued with the notion of aerobics.

1379
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,400
Wanted to be around aerobics people.

1380
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,400
Ladies were wearing tight clothes.

1381
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,400
There's a joke about that.

1382
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,400
Now, I guess that makes aerobics sexy,

1383
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:48,400
but also there's no less revealing clothes than what we're looking at here.

1384
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:52,400
Yeah, of course, but it was the 80s, so that was, you know, that was the-

1385
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,400
That's on television. We can't be scandalous.

1386
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,400
Right, and it's Canada.

1387
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:02,400
He's got the windbreaker suit on, pants and jacket,

1388
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:06,400
which I had, me and my brother had outfits like that.

1389
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,400
Like the matching track suit kind of a thing?

1390
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,400
Yeah, like complimentary.

1391
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,400
And you were both wearing the same outfit?

1392
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,400
Yeah, the same.

1393
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:19,400
Like one was blue and like aqua green and then one was blue and red.

1394
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,400
Okay.

1395
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,400
Well, it's not matching, but it's like the Royal Tenenbaum's kids.

1396
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,400
Oh, yeah, can you find a photo of it?

1397
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,400
Aren't those matching?

1398
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:27,400
Those are matching.

1399
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,400
Yeah, those are matching.

1400
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,400
I don't have a photo close by.

1401
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:34,400
Do you want us to go get matching sort of track suit type things?

1402
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,400
Oh, boy, that'd be fun.

1403
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,400
Yeah, we could do that.

1404
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,400
Yeah, I think that would read, if we did that on stage,

1405
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,400
we all wore matching track suits.

1406
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:49,400
I think it would definitely read as fun and cool and not as Miami Beach retiree.

1407
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,400
That's right.

1408
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,400
Yeah.

1409
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,400
What's the thing?

1410
01:07:54,400 --> 01:08:00,400
Like, you know, so if you want to turn your buns into tiny little croissants.

1411
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,400
Love it.

1412
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,400
He's real Troy McClure.

1413
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:04,400
Yeah, that's right.

1414
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,400
Yeah.

1415
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,400
I think it is probably right.

1416
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,400
Is it right before or right after this?

1417
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:17,400
There is like a commercial break where there's an oil of the lake commercial

1418
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:23,400
where a woman is talking about like, I am fighting off AJ with the oil of the lake.

1419
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:31,400
Like, it's really like crummy in the way she's like, they say men age gracefully

1420
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,400
and women just age.

1421
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,400
Oh, I saw this one.

1422
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,400
It's just so brutal.

1423
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,400
Well, she's fighting back against what she feels are the.

1424
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,400
With oil of the lake, of course.

1425
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:42,400
But then the next commercial is about losing weight.

1426
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,400
And I'm like, what is that?

1427
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:48,400
And it's like, with special K, you can.

1428
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,400
It's like a healthy breakfast.

1429
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:54,400
So are you telling me, a man is not concerned with his aging,

1430
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:59,400
that if I just get oil of Olay and eat special K, maybe I can fight back against aging?

1431
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,400
You should fight back against aging.

1432
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,400
OK, because I have been trying to fight back.

1433
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:07,400
The full sentence is men age gracefully, women just age.

1434
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,400
Mike Carlson does not age.

1435
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:10,400
Well, you're right.

1436
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,400
Not at all.

1437
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,400
Sure.

1438
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,400
OK.

1439
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:14,400
Well, I.

1440
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,400
Olivia Rodrigo records keep me young.

1441
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:20,400
My daughter loves Bad Idea Right by Olivia Rodrigo.

1442
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,400
It's a favorite song.

1443
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:22,400
I also love Bad Idea Right.

1444
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,400
It is her favorite song.

1445
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:27,400
And she starts like mashing and she stops right before the chorus comes in.

1446
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:31,400
And then the full thing comes in and she starts like going like this and like going wild.

1447
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,400
It's great.

1448
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,400
It's really fun.

1449
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:34,400
I didn't force it, by the way.

1450
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,400
This is just a song she likes.

1451
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:37,400
And does it end?

1452
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,400
And do you say now this is this is a current song.

1453
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:42,400
This is a song from this very decade that your daddy knows and likes.

1454
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:43,400
I haven't said.

1455
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:46,400
Well, I have probably once, but I don't say it after every time.

1456
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:53,400
Now, daddy and some of his friends were never in the position to sing the ballad.

1457
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,400
But I have not.

1458
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:59,400
There's some cursing in there and some adult themes, but she's too young to understand those.

1459
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:00,400
Yeah.

1460
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:05,400
So I guess at a certain point I'll have to put the clean version on where she didn't say, it's fine.

1461
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,400
What is the clean version of that song?

1462
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:08,400
I have to know.

1463
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,400
Well, there'd be no F word.

1464
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,400
OK.

1465
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,400
I assume.

1466
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,400
But maybe she said like slipped and fell into his bed.

1467
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,400
Probably still in the clean version.

1468
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:20,400
But maybe it's like slipped and fell into his arms.

1469
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,400
I slipped and fell into his arms.

1470
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,400
Fell into a bed.

1471
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:24,400
Yeah.

1472
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,400
Or into a bed.

1473
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,400
Alone.

1474
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,400
Yeah.

1475
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:30,400
It got eight to nine hours sleep.

1476
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:35,400
Good idea, right?

1477
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:40,400
One good idea in this event was the booking of André Philippe Gagnon.

1478
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,400
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1479
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:42,400
Boy.

1480
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,400
Who's a truly unique entertainer, the man of a thousand voices.

1481
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:53,400
So after all this, after like stunts, they also, I mean, it comes right after a bunch of police officers all dive in from ropes.

1482
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,400
Oh, and they look.

1483
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,400
Or he's up in the air.

1484
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,400
They all look like strippers.

1485
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:01,400
They all have this like cheesy 80s mustache on.

1486
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,400
And it just looks like they're ready to take the clothes off.

1487
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:09,400
They don't do it, but they look like the hot cops on Arrested Development.

1488
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,400
They're like, oh, and they're all big smiling.

1489
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,400
I mean, I assume they're.

1490
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,400
That would have been a show.

1491
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,400
That would have been great.

1492
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,400
But yeah, that's the first thing I thought of.

1493
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:20,400
And this is all during the part of the show where the roof is still up.

1494
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,400
Right.

1495
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:22,400
That's important.

1496
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:28,400
Also, real quick, I feel like there's a part where they go, and now welcome martial arts children.

1497
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,400
I saw the martial arts children.

1498
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,400
Before this, yeah.

1499
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,400
Yeah, you're not imagining.

1500
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,400
And I go, huh?

1501
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:37,400
Again, I lived a thousand lifetimes watching this clip.

1502
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:38,400
Yeah, geez.

1503
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,400
I know.

1504
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,400
I missed big swaths of it.

1505
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,400
Andre Philippe Gagnon.

1506
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,400
I forget.

1507
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,400
I might be fucking up the last name.

1508
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:53,400
But he takes you back to a time where it was fine for white people to do impressions of Louis Armstrong.

1509
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,400
Sure does.

1510
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,400
I found that a little.

1511
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,400
Something else recently reminded me of that.

1512
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,400
There is a lot of this going on.

1513
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:00,400
Oh, I saw something crazy.

1514
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,400
I don't even want to talk about it because it's too creepy.

1515
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:08,400
When I was looking up acceptable wedding entertainers who I could book for my wedding.

1516
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,400
And these are the people that the venue works with.

1517
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,400
You can book any of these.

1518
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,400
And one we clicked on.

1519
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,400
And it was a white guy.

1520
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,400
Click off.

1521
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,400
Nope, gone, no.

1522
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:22,400
That will not be how we celebrate our most special day.

1523
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:27,400
Did slash does Rich a little do one in his show?

1524
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:28,400
I can only imagine.

1525
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,400
I bet he does.

1526
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,400
I could be wrong.

1527
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:35,400
This guy's premise done in French Canadian accent.

1528
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:38,400
Do you know that there are a lot of ghosts?

1529
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,400
There are many ghosts.

1530
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:44,400
Let's see who will be the next ghost that I bring to Louis Armstrong.

1531
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:49,400
But then he can't think of Elvis Presley.

1532
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:54,400
But then he can't think of enough dead famous Canadian performers.

1533
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,400
So the ghosts have to be alive for the rest of this bit, yes?

1534
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:02,400
Roy Orbison was not dead yet.

1535
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,400
He was very recently dead.

1536
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,400
I'm trying to remember.

1537
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,400
Did he add him to the dead part of the act or the non-dead?

1538
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,400
He might have been in the dead half.

1539
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:18,400
I think this is a moment where I add this playing in an air pod and went to the bathroom or got a glass of water.

1540
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:22,400
88 Roy died so he was dead.

1541
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:27,400
He does Traveling Wilbury's song Handle with Care.

1542
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,400
So he does George Harrison first.

1543
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:33,400
I could not place which Wilbury he's trying to be.

1544
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:39,400
George Harrison sings most of that song or at least the first parts of the song, the verses and stuff.

1545
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:43,400
But then he says he's setting up Roy, but then he does that first part.

1546
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:46,400
I don't know if he wanted to make sure you remembered what this song was.

1547
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,400
And then he goes into I'm so tired of being lonely.

1548
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,400
That's the Roy part.

1549
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:55,400
But I was like, OK, this is kind of a confusing one.

1550
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,400
George is not dead at that point.

1551
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:58,400
Yeah.

1552
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:02,400
So then we have to start doing Living Canadians.

1553
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:08,400
And boy, a boy, the moment where he starts singing spinning wheel.

1554
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,400
Blood, sweat and tears spinning wheel.

1555
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:18,400
And then you hear a second of the same voice and it's the real David Clayton Thomas.

1556
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,400
Who is apparently the singer of Blood, Sweat and Tears?

1557
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,400
I do not know the name of that guy.

1558
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,400
My, oh my.

1559
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,400
What comes up?

1560
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:31,400
Obviously, I know it sounds like I'm singing that sarcastically, but that's on the Desert Island Discs for me.

1561
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,400
What comes up?

1562
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:34,400
Ten Discs?

1563
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,400
Yeah, yeah.

1564
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,400
That's top ten.

1565
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:40,400
Are Discs singles or albums, just to clarify?

1566
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,400
I think we gotta go singles to Parrot Town.

1567
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:43,400
Oh, yeah.

1568
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,400
When we do your episode.

1569
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,400
Right.

1570
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:46,400
Yeah.

1571
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,400
Single songs.

1572
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,400
Right up in it, bone it.

1573
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,400
So how about that?

1574
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,400
I mean, what is it?

1575
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,400
Andre and David Clayton together.

1576
01:14:55,400 --> 01:15:01,400
And then you get into this zone where now the process is going to begin of opening up the dome.

1577
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:06,400
And they take a little time to explain concisely how that is going to work.

1578
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,400
It's run by computers.

1579
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,400
The computers are not fully operational.

1580
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:15,400
The button will activate a laser beam, which will in turn signal the computers.

1581
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:18,400
And there's a man, three men, a man in each of the three sections.

1582
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:22,400
And in effect, what they're doing tonight is working a joystick in each section.

1583
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,400
And that's how this giant roof is going to retract.

1584
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:26,400
Simple.

1585
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,400
The computers are not functional.

1586
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:35,400
So in essence, what we will do is point to a man who will nudge a joystick, which will signal the computers.

1587
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,400
But the computers are not working.

1588
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:45,400
So the people at the computers will instead wave a flag, which will cause somebody to flip a spotlight.

1589
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:55,400
And a girl will start a series of dominoes, which will create a nice array of colors in the Canadian flag colors once flipped over.

1590
01:15:55,400 --> 01:16:00,400
And then seven horses will all drag different apparatuses behind them.

1591
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,400
And those will generate heat.

1592
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,400
And the heat will rise.

1593
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:19,400
Which will melt a series of computers, which are not functioning on the floor, so that they will be heated up, start a fire, which will cause a rope to burn up, releasing it, and thus beginning the opening of the dome.

1594
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,400
He really struggles through that.

1595
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,400
And that's it.

1596
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:23,400
That's how it's done.

1597
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:24,400
Yeah, that's it.

1598
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:30,400
At some point, do they say it takes like 30 to 40 minutes to open and close the dome?

1599
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,400
I think that is what it takes.

1600
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:33,400
Yeah, yeah.

1601
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:38,400
Yes, we can open the dome, or we can close the dome.

1602
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,400
But it has to be decided with that much force.

1603
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:46,400
The life of the littlest hobo broadcasts, commercials included.

1604
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:51,400
It only takes one hobo's time.

1605
01:16:51,400 --> 01:17:01,400
But yeah, with that clunky explanation, what it does become is that then Canadian Premier David Peterson has a laser pen.

1606
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,400
That's what it ends up becoming.

1607
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:09,400
He fires up a laser pen, but then I ended up looking into the backstory of how this all came together.

1608
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:14,400
And they were like, yeah, we made a prop with an upside down Dixie cup that we painted.

1609
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:18,400
There was nothing interesting that actually required the dome.

1610
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,400
Somebody pressed the dome start button.

1611
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:25,400
Yeah, the laser beam part made it sound like it was sophisticated, or the technology was interesting.

1612
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:29,400
Laser activated to keep thieves out of the...

1613
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:37,400
I'm sure everyone in Toronto is concerned about what if thieves airdrop into the top of the sky dome?

1614
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:40,400
Will we be able to stop them?

1615
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:48,400
Or if they do make their way in, can we quickly crunch the dome, which will crush their spines, crush the thieves right in the middle?

1616
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:54,400
It does make it seem like a bond base, or a bond villain base, excuse me.

1617
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,400
No, it is so...

1618
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:57,400
Laser beams.

1619
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,400
Also calling it laser beams is funny.

1620
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,400
Laser beams.

1621
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,400
Laser beams is such an old school way to call lasers.

1622
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:04,400
Sure.

1623
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,400
Yeah, we should bring that back.

1624
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,400
Laser beams.

1625
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,400
Yeah, laser beams.

1626
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:10,400
Laser beam arena would be great.

1627
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,400
Laser beam arena, yeah, please.

1628
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:20,400
Oh my God, if the crypto.com became laser beam arena, the joy that would spread all around the globe.

1629
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,400
Yeah, it would heal.

1630
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,400
There'd be the confusion about, wait, so is it just a big laserium?

1631
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,400
No, no, no, it's where the Lakers play.

1632
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,400
Yeah.

1633
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:29,400
So the Lakers play at laser beam.

1634
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:30,400
Wow.

1635
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,400
Not Laker?

1636
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:32,400
No, laser beam.

1637
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,400
Not just laser or not just beam?

1638
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:38,400
No, it's the full phrase.

1639
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:49,400
They, at some point, they talk to a person who designed this, and he says he was inspired by the Houston Astro Dome.

1640
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,400
Okay.

1641
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,400
Is that dome not retractable?

1642
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,400
It's not retractable because this is the first retractable.

1643
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,400
Okay, so that's just a big dome.

1644
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:04,400
Yes, inspired by it, but we, through this marvel of engineering, we will be able to have it either way.

1645
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:15,400
Because again, as the song is said over and over, we can open it up if there is no rain, but we can keep it closed if there is rain.

1646
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:21,400
And at this point, with the laser activation, this is where the opening of the dome begins.

1647
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:31,400
And the opening of the dome quickly reveals what anyone with the ability to look outside of the dome knew, which is it was raining very heavily.

1648
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,400
It was raining a lot.

1649
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:41,400
It was apparently, this whole thing was like, it'll keep us dry, but even when closed, the rain was apparently leaking through.

1650
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:42,400
Yes.

1651
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:51,400
So this now sets off discussion among the people who have put this event together over the course of seven years, who had the dream of Sky Dome.

1652
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:55,400
This is Sky Dome's grand debut, and it is raining.

1653
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,400
What do we do?

1654
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:58,400
Yeah.

1655
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:07,400
And where it begins is, here, I'll start revealing this, which is that I looked on the website of a man named Toby Simkin.

1656
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:11,400
Toby Simkin was the stage manager of this event.

1657
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:21,400
And Toby, I want to say bang up job, and I apologize that this event aged you presumably six years in a matter of two hours.

1658
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:25,400
So Toby reveals some behind the scenes stuff about it.

1659
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:30,400
They went into this event, as any smart production would, with backup plans.

1660
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,400
There was a dry version and there was a wet version.

1661
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:41,400
And the wet version was, we will open it up a little tiny bit just to show that it can open.

1662
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:48,400
And that'll be in the middle, which is mostly on the field, and we will not cause all the people in the stands to get super wet.

1663
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:58,400
And this will prove what the other, what the people from Stadco were worried about, which is like, what if we do this live broadcast and everyone in Canada is watching and then we don't open it up?

1664
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,400
And then people will say, it failed.

1665
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:01,400
It didn't open.

1666
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:02,400
It couldn't open.

1667
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,400
We have to show that it can open.

1668
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,400
This is bare minimum.

1669
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:10,400
Even if it's pouring, we got to open this dome up a little bit just to show that it can.

1670
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,400
So that is what this point of the broadcast is.

1671
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:22,400
They start opening it a little bit and jazz legend Oscar Peterson performs and it rains mostly on him.

1672
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:30,400
Yeah, this man towards the end of his storied career gets to play piano in the pouring rain.

1673
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,400
But you know what?

1674
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:32,400
But it's all right.

1675
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:35,400
And we're getting, you know, you're at the dome opening ceremony.

1676
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,400
You want to see the dome open.

1677
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,400
That's OK.

1678
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,400
And he does a nice performance.

1679
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:44,400
And then we go back to tux clad Brian Williams in the booth.

1680
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,400
And he gives us an update on the roof plan behind me.

1681
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:50,400
They are announcing that the roof will be closed.

1682
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,400
And I'm sure you'll hear the booze.

1683
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,400
Booze.

1684
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,400
Boo.

1685
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:59,400
Don't.

1686
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:08,400
We do have a look at the CN tower, though, they guess on how long it would take to open the roof was anywhere between 37 and say, 50 minutes.

1687
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,400
But as of right now, the roof was open a little way.

1688
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:14,400
It is going to close back because of the rain and lightning storms in the area.

1689
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,400
Stay with us.

1690
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:17,400
Dave Thomas will join me here.

1691
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:21,200
Just doing it live is wild, too, in hindsight.

1692
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,020
What's that?

1693
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:24,240
Doing it live is like airing it live.

1694
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:25,080
Yeah, really?

1695
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,680
Why would they do it?

1696
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:27,920
The hubris.

1697
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,120
Because we gotta get all eyes on this,

1698
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:33,280
so we gotta get people knowing you can come here tomorrow

1699
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,480
if you wanted to.

1700
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,080
I think there was a Blue Jays game,

1701
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,720
if not the next day, then the day after that.

1702
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,800
So they are, because they need this thing to get,

1703
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,520
they need this thing to get off the ground running.

1704
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:44,360
As I said, with the Hard Rock and the hotel

1705
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:46,400
and all that shit, they have spent so much money,

1706
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:50,240
so they need the gaudiest ad campaign ever,

1707
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,480
and they need to show that it can open.

1708
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:55,560
But then he comes on and he says, don't worry,

1709
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:58,160
we're gonna close it because of the lightning,

1710
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:01,600
and don't boo, obviously everybody's gonna boo,

1711
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,440
but we have to close the dome.

1712
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:04,520
The dome will be closed.

1713
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:05,880
Then it goes to a commercial break,

1714
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:08,240
we presumably learn more about renegades,

1715
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:10,880
and then it comes back to Alan Thicke's center stage,

1716
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,240
and it is pouring.

1717
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:15,800
It is like the rain has gotten two times worse

1718
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:17,120
just in that commercial break.

1719
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,680
We're illustrating the kind of crazy weather,

1720
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:23,440
which is why we have to have the retractable ceiling at all.

1721
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,200
So, you know, well, we gotta probably hold the show

1722
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,280
and just kind of air some pre-taped segments

1723
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:30,760
until we can fully close it up again.

1724
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:35,640
No, we are going full blast, and the procession,

1725
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:38,440
everybody go, get out there, and this is the part

1726
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:41,000
where everyone who built Sky Dome

1727
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,760
all have to walk around the field.

1728
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:47,080
And this is like the Olympics opening ceremony

1729
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:49,840
where the groups all arrive from the nations.

1730
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:52,440
Here's China, and here's Sweden,

1731
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:55,800
except it's just groups of people from boring companies

1732
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,920
who put the Sky Dome together,

1733
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:00,960
and my favorite part is when they introduce,

1734
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:05,120
here's this group, Trilon Financial Corporation,

1735
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:10,120
and as that is happening, they are showing a guy

1736
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:13,480
who took his shirt off and is revealing

1737
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:16,920
a full back tattoo of Sky Dome.

1738
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:19,840
Maybe it's painted on temporarily, I don't know,

1739
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,960
but again, it's pouring rain,

1740
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:25,360
and this guy takes his shirt off to reveal this.

1741
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:29,240
We're getting full close up on Coast to Coast TV

1742
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:34,080
of this guy's Sky Dome back, a guy presumably from Trilon.

1743
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,440
I thought he was from Team SIRS.

1744
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,280
Could have been, I mean, there and there.

1745
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:44,280
But I feel like there should have been some commentary on that.

1746
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:47,600
Like, I'm wondering, maybe there wasn't,

1747
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:51,880
like, Brian Williams was not by a live mic,

1748
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:53,920
because I'm like, wouldn't you just be talking

1749
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,400
about this man with the back tattoo?

1750
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,480
Oh, yeah, no, it's not, no, they just let it play out.

1751
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:01,200
Yeah, yeah, they just let the majesty of the sequence play out.

1752
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,760
You don't refer to the guy's bare back.

1753
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:07,640
It's a Sky Dome, and it has a perfect Sky Dome drawing.

1754
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:08,960
A lot is happening now,

1755
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:11,360
because there's not just, OK, we've got to introduce everybody.

1756
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:13,440
Everybody who made this, their thank you

1757
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:16,000
is that they get to march around in the pouring rain.

1758
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Now we've got to let Domer out.

1759
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,520
Domer's here, Domer.

1760
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:21,360
Who's Domer?

1761
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,680
Domer is the Sky Dome mascot.

1762
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:24,800
It's Domer.

1763
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:29,800
Domer, in this case, is an inflatable turtle

1764
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,880
who is let loose to fly up into the refters,

1765
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:36,240
but he struggles to fly because it's raining so heavily on him.

1766
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:39,360
It's just kind of like chipping around like a boat in a storm.

1767
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:42,080
Domer is getting his shit rocked.

1768
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:44,480
You can see the rain hitting Domer.

1769
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:45,440
He is wobbling.

1770
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,240
Domer's going to throw up.

1771
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:48,480
Pray for Domer.

1772
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,840
Pray for Domer.

1773
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:58,440
Confusingly, Domer is the mascot of the Dome, not the Blue Jays.

1774
01:25:58,440 --> 01:25:59,480
That doesn't make sense.

1775
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:01,360
They would have a Blue J, right?

1776
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:04,920
So when Domer comes out at a game, he does not speak for the team.

1777
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:06,880
He speaks for the Dome.

1778
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,560
His opinions are his own.

1779
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:12,040
The views of Domer do not reflect the views of Toronto Blue Jays

1780
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:12,520
baseball season.

1781
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:14,000
You heard I speak for the trees.

1782
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,160
I speak for the Dome.

1783
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:21,520
Domer, around this time, did some personal appearances

1784
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,480
to promote the Dome, including hanging out with Michelangelo.

1785
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:25,840
Yeah, baby.

1786
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,840
Wow, the two great turtles hanging out together.

1787
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:31,120
I love that suit, too, that Michelangelo suit.

1788
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,640
I would have loved to have been at this.

1789
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:33,720
The colors look great.

1790
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:36,440
And then Dave Thomas makes a joke about him being a Ninja Turtle.

1791
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:39,240
Oh, teenage, what's it said?

1792
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:41,160
He does these.

1793
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:43,760
One of his things was his Bob Hope impression.

1794
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,440
And I've seen better video of his Bob Hope impression.

1795
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,640
Boy, he just forgot.

1796
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:50,720
Maybe he just felt too much pressure.

1797
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,040
He's performing on a jumbo trill.

1798
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,680
Look, it would freak me out, too.

1799
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:55,280
I'd have trouble placing that impression.

1800
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:57,800
But what would your old pal Bob Hope have to say?

1801
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:01,560
Well, I'd say, hey, welcome to Sky Dome.

1802
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:04,320
We didn't really try too hard on that at all, did we?

1803
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,760
We didn't prep so much for that.

1804
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:08,120
But it's great to see Domer.

1805
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:09,160
I love Domer.

1806
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:09,920
Way we were.

1807
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,280
Katz has performed.

1808
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:13,000
And this woman really gives it her all.

1809
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,240
And then not until the end of the performance

1810
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:17,720
do we go wide and see that the whole time,

1811
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:20,240
this kind of dopey tall guy with an umbrella

1812
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:21,880
has been standing over her.

1813
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:23,880
And this is where it becomes clear,

1814
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:26,600
this Dome is not fully retracting.

1815
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:27,440
Yeah.

1816
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,840
Oh, wait, actually, I have the note

1817
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:33,280
somebody says they will now begin to close it.

1818
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:37,160
But as it goes and goes, it never closes.

1819
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:39,480
And the rain just gets more and more brutal.

1820
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:42,000
And I was thinking about a thing that we said on the tour.

1821
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,520
This is probably said in the Disney MGM tour, too.

1822
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:47,160
Very common kind of Hollywood tourist

1823
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:49,920
trivia, which is sometimes in the singing in the rain

1824
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:53,520
sequence, in order to make the rain appear more clearly

1825
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,800
on camera, they'd have to put milk in it.

1826
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,360
And I was thinking about that trivia

1827
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:01,040
and how like, ain't no rain, ain't no milk in this rain.

1828
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:05,200
I was thinking about 20 minutes ago, like, man, this rain

1829
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:07,160
is so hard, they don't have to put any milk in it.

1830
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:08,880
You thought of the milk in the rain, too?

1831
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:13,080
Well, because you can see the rain in grainy video footage.

1832
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:15,560
And it's like, it was so much rain.

1833
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:17,960
It is so glaringly clear.

1834
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:20,560
Coming up on camera so clearly.

1835
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:21,920
Makes you question the idea.

1836
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:23,880
What do you mean there would ever be a world

1837
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,000
where you couldn't see rain?

1838
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,200
This is the clearest rain I've ever witnessed.

1839
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:29,120
It's pouring.

1840
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,160
It's so bad.

1841
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:33,360
And you start to see that it is pooling on the stage

1842
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:37,680
and in the bottom, like down below the stage.

1843
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:41,200
And you really hope that they don't send out thousands

1844
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:44,840
more people to start performing on the very wet stage

1845
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:48,920
with the slick surface put down in order

1846
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:50,880
to protect the baseball dirt.

1847
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:51,960
Uh-oh, look out.

1848
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:54,640
1,300 people are coming out.

1849
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:59,680
And this is the part where it is the dancers

1850
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:05,960
who represent indigenous and international communities

1851
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:06,480
in Canada.

1852
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:12,840
Oh, the Folk Arts Council represented it from Jamaica,

1853
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,200
Serbia, Croatia.

1854
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:21,760
Everyone's doing dances from their home countries

1855
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:22,840
around the world.

1856
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:25,280
And it's a small world lineup.

1857
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:30,080
All comes out to celebrate and to do their local customs

1858
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:33,160
and dances, which all involve parts

1859
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,520
where they have to dip to the ground for a little bit.

1860
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:36,040
Yes.

1861
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:38,800
Yeah, every dance involves dipping to the ground.

1862
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,840
There's a bunch of people from the Philippines

1863
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:44,120
all doing some kind of like hopscotch with logs

1864
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:46,320
that they're like jumping in and out.

1865
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:47,800
Seemed hard to do, yes.

1866
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:48,440
Extremely.

1867
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:50,640
And they have to get really low.

1868
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:53,600
And now the limbo council from Croatia.

1869
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:58,440
Well, like it's so perfectly cursed for what should not

1870
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:00,120
be happening at this moment.

1871
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:04,120
Now we start getting into it.

1872
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:09,120
Let me go back to the behind the scenes of the guy who

1873
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,480
worked on it, Toby Simpkin.

1874
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:18,000
So he said how basically at this point in the broadcast,

1875
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,120
behind the scenes, there is discussion.

1876
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:23,600
It is like, OK, do you realize that this

1877
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:28,160
is where all of the indigenous outfits are going to come out?

1878
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:32,280
And many of these outfits are ancient.

1879
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:36,000
They are very old or like artisan, handcrafted,

1880
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,980
like maybe borrowed from, maybe taken out of museums

1881
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:42,160
and being worn for the first time in decades.

1882
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:44,660
That is what is coming up in this broadcast.

1883
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:49,240
This could ruin important artifacts.

1884
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:54,440
Not to mention, did I say that this was a suggested blue tie

1885
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:55,560
event?

1886
01:30:55,560 --> 01:31:00,280
So where people in the stands are in nice dresses in Texas.

1887
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:01,160
I didn't know that.

1888
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:04,680
So 50,000 people, lots and lots of them

1889
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:06,560
are dressed to the nines.

1890
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:09,680
But now we introduce the character skydome president

1891
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:11,480
Chuck Magwood.

1892
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:13,480
And he has been working on this for years.

1893
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:15,760
Everything is on the line for Chuck Magwood.

1894
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:19,040
He's like, I'm sorry, come hell or high water,

1895
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:20,480
this is what needs to happen.

1896
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,040
We have a national audience.

1897
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:23,280
We've got to open this dome.

1898
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,720
Are we going to not open the dome?

1899
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:28,680
And he basically kind of crazed movie president style,

1900
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:31,720
overrode everyone else to say, do it.

1901
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:32,480
Open it.

1902
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,880
Keep opening it.

1903
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:36,040
And I think there might have been some situation where

1904
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:37,880
the people actually pushing the buttons

1905
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:40,960
were ordered barricaded so that nobody could

1906
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:43,160
come in and stop the dome.

1907
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:44,840
It was very nuclear bomb.

1908
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:48,720
Three people in different rooms all across skydome

1909
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:51,240
had to open up the roof separately

1910
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:53,080
and all do it at the same time.

1911
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:57,280
And they all were told by David and Chuck Magwood,

1912
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:01,200
lock the door so that the process can't stop.

1913
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:01,720
Oh, wow.

1914
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:02,920
Lock the gates.

1915
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:03,800
Lock the gates.

1916
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,920
Lock the skydome gates.

1917
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:06,600
We're doing it.

1918
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:07,040
Fuck it.

1919
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:07,760
We're doing it.

1920
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:11,400
I didn't come all this way for a dome to not get opened.

1921
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:13,840
I'm Chuck fucking Magwood, OK?

1922
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,360
We're opening the fucking dome.

1923
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:16,520
You know he said that.

1924
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:17,440
That's not a joke.

1925
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:18,640
No, I am.

1926
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,240
I'm fucking Chuck Magwood.

1927
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:22,600
Tensions were very high.

1928
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:24,480
There's no way they weren't.

1929
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:28,560
The segment where the news reporter

1930
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:32,160
talks to someone who worked on designing the dome,

1931
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:36,440
and they get in a replica and show how it will retract.

1932
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:38,360
Yeah, they all stand in a tiny dome.

1933
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:43,360
He seems very shaken that designer or engineer.

1934
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:45,360
He seems very tired.

1935
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,440
And he alludes to it, too.

1936
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:50,440
The guy's also like, how has no one died making this thing?

1937
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:51,560
And he's like, oh, yes.

1938
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:52,560
There's a weird moment there, too.

1939
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:55,360
A big discussion of, yeah, it seems improbable.

1940
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:57,640
Well, that interview in which the notion of death

1941
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:01,680
is discussed is an interview with fucking Chuck Magwood.

1942
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:03,040
That is who is being talked to.

1943
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,280
He is interviewed.

1944
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:06,920
They cut to a prerecorded interview with this guy

1945
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:10,080
while his orders, given personally from him

1946
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:12,800
on behalf of STADCODA, open the fucking dome.

1947
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:13,600
It's happening.

1948
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,760
Everybody's getting rained on.

1949
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:18,480
Indigenous outfits are getting destroyed forever.

1950
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:23,200
History is being erased live on television.

1951
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:27,160
Canada, not terribly good about that sort of thing.

1952
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:28,120
They're not?

1953
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:28,880
No.

1954
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:31,520
Kind of par for the course that they would like.

1955
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:34,560
Let nature destroy it.

1956
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,920
I didn't know this about Canada.

1957
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:40,040
But anyway, as if that's not strange enough,

1958
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:43,360
then they ask him about a plain question about,

1959
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:44,680
how do you think it's going to go?

1960
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:46,120
And here's the response.

1961
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:50,120
Is it like you imagined it would be?

1962
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:52,120
Is it?

1963
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:53,880
You know, I guess in some ways I've

1964
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:57,760
been, like many of the rest of us, a bit afraid and not

1965
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:59,720
prepared to really imagine it.

1966
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:02,640
So we have not consummated that imagery.

1967
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:04,120
And why is that?

1968
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:05,400
Maybe it's a bit like sex.

1969
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:07,240
You're afraid it isn't going to quite work out

1970
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:09,440
the way you hope.

1971
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:13,040
One of the weirdest Android-like responses.

1972
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:13,720
What?

1973
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:16,040
Like, well, I don't know.

1974
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:17,240
I haven't imagined it.

1975
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:19,120
I haven't consummated that imagery yet.

1976
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:21,120
If you consummate the.

1977
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:23,160
You're walking along the road in the desert.

1978
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:26,560
You see a turtle on its back.

1979
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,800
Do you flip it over?

1980
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:30,480
I don't know.

1981
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:31,760
I'm worried it will be like sex.

1982
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:34,880
And it will never work out for me.

1983
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:37,480
And then his image flies away into a little fray.

1984
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:39,040
Do, do, do.

1985
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:39,560
What?

1986
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:40,640
It's so weird.

1987
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,080
Yeah.

1988
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:46,760
To keep his metaphor alive, it is actually what happened.

1989
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:48,160
Plans were laid in play.

1990
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:52,800
A plan to protect the dome was put in place,

1991
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:55,680
but there was a breach in the dome,

1992
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:59,320
thus allowing liquid to get through,

1993
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:02,600
thus creating kind of an accident in the scenario.

1994
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:03,520
Sure, yeah.

1995
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,840
That is, ironically, where we ended up here.

1996
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:11,280
That man has a quiet intensity in that clip as well.

1997
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:12,200
Plans.

1998
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:12,920
Yeah.

1999
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:18,480
Well, I mean, much like Oppenheimer, I suppose.

2000
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,720
Can we get a Noah's Oppenheimer movie

2001
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:22,560
about the man who invented Sky Dome?

2002
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:25,400
Yes, yeah, about that moment.

2003
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:26,960
I'd love an Oppenheimer style.

2004
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:28,400
I'd love to do it Sorkin style.

2005
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:31,760
That's all that took the 90 minutes real time leading up

2006
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:34,960
to the moment of pressing the button.

2007
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:37,160
But anyway, that decision is made.

2008
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:40,200
And what that leads to, per this guy's website,

2009
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:43,600
is 50,000 audience members in black tie

2010
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,920
getting soaked while the show did its best

2011
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,880
to perform in a leaky boat.

2012
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:51,360
Stage dancers sliding down ramps like waterfalls

2013
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:53,000
to the concrete floor.

2014
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,160
Roller skaters with metal rollers

2015
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:57,680
sparking on the steel plates, which

2016
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:00,240
are covering high voltage electrical traps

2017
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:03,520
in the stadium floor that are now covered with water.

2018
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:06,320
TV cameras are being covered in plastic sheets.

2019
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:08,200
Millions of dollars of audio lighting

2020
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:09,800
and other technical equipment scattered

2021
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:12,680
throughout the stadium being frantically shut down,

2022
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:16,040
either being successfully covered or exploding.

2023
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:18,320
There were electrical explosions

2024
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:19,840
during this live broadcast.

2025
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:22,080
Like a Bonvillain base now.

2026
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:24,040
It's like everything is treacherous.

2027
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:25,400
Magwood has gone rogue.

2028
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:25,880
Yeah.

2029
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:27,960
It's every man for himself now.

2030
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:30,760
And no more if you don't mind killing a few people on your way

2031
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:33,280
out, too.

2032
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,760
They shut down everything electrical

2033
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:37,480
that wasn't absolutely required for basic safety.

2034
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:39,440
Even our communication system failed.

2035
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:41,840
And they migrated to walkie talkies only.

2036
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:45,080
And they started conveying announcements for everybody

2037
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:47,560
just through the, they just had to go through the announcer,

2038
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:49,440
who earlier was going, ladies and gentlemen,

2039
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,000
David Clayton Thomas.

2040
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
And now he's saying, ladies and gentlemen,

2041
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,560
move away from the electrical gear.

2042
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,920
You will be fried to a crisp.

2043
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:00,080
Open up that, too.

2044
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:04,680
And yes, OK, so now that we've laid all of that,

2045
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:07,080
what does this line up with in the broadcast?

2046
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:10,120
This lines up with an even longer musical number

2047
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:12,840
with Alan Thicke and Andrew Martin and more people

2048
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:18,880
that is entirely about open up, open up the dome, open up.

2049
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:22,000
It'll haunt me because they repeat it so, so many times.

2050
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,280
But time to let the celebration begin.

2051
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:26,920
Open up the dome and let the people come in.

2052
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:30,200
And so it's a song that they have locked and loaded

2053
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:31,760
about opening up the dome.

2054
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,360
If I could go back to the beginning

2055
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:35,360
and say how this whole thing came

2056
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:38,920
from a bunch of rain pouring on a Canadian football game.

2057
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:42,040
And then a bunch of angry people from Toronto went to City Hall

2058
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:43,960
and said, we want a dome.

2059
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:46,080
We want a dome.

2060
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,600
Seven years later, they are now in the dome.

2061
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:51,000
The dome was built per their request.

2062
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,480
And there's a song about opening up the dome.

2063
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:57,200
And they are all yelling in unison, shut the dome.

2064
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:58,200
Shut the dome.

2065
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:01,280
Shut the dome.

2066
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:03,400
Be careful what you wish for.

2067
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:05,880
Be careful what you chant for, perhaps.

2068
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:08,480
That's the lesson to be learned from the Sky Dome opening

2069
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:09,080
ceremony.

2070
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:10,280
Careful what you chant for.

2071
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:10,800
Yeah, indeed.

2072
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:12,360
Careful what you chant for.

2073
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:14,240
There's lyrics in this song that are like,

2074
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:18,040
we don't care if it rains or pours.

2075
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:22,120
As they cut to angles where raindrops, thick raindrops,

2076
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:25,960
are all over the lens, it's rendering it like unviewable.

2077
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:29,240
But now, it's a bunch of open top cars

2078
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:31,520
with all the most important people in Canada

2079
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:36,280
being paraded in, many of whom are elderly, legends who've

2080
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:42,240
given their rights, their life to civics and transportation

2081
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:44,320
and getting great sports programs.

2082
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:48,840
Now, their reward is getting just poured on.

2083
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:50,840
And there's this endless, this also

2084
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:52,800
feels like it goes for 12 minutes,

2085
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:57,560
that there's all these really inane rhymes saying

2086
01:38:57,560 --> 01:38:59,880
who everybody is.

2087
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:01,720
She's a star on skates.

2088
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:04,680
Elizabeth Hanley, you are great.

2089
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:05,800
Open up the dome.

2090
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:10,600
This goes for so, so long.

2091
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:13,040
At some point, they cut back to one of the karate kids.

2092
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:13,800
What were they called?

2093
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:14,520
Karate children?

2094
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:15,080
Karate children.

2095
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:16,000
Yeah, karate children.

2096
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:16,720
Karate children.

2097
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:20,520
They cut to the saddest, coldest, wettest karate child,

2098
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:23,600
looking like, Mom, can I come back in, please?

2099
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:27,560
No, for the good of your nation, you need to stay out here.

2100
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:32,840
My favorite quote in that is, now that Metro man is cruising

2101
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:34,480
in, wave at him.

2102
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:35,520
It's Dennis Flynn.

2103
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:41,480
Wave at him, not to him.

2104
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:42,000
Yeah.

2105
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Wave at him.

2106
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,440
Wave at him.

2107
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:47,720
So luckily, then, there's not much more

2108
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:51,000
to do so that we can wind down the broadcast,

2109
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,000
and everybody could get dry again, and we can wrap up this.

2110
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:54,840
Nope, sorry.

2111
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:57,080
Time for skydivers.

2112
01:39:57,080 --> 01:40:00,240
That is now where the pre-planned part

2113
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:04,480
of this broadcast, where eight skydivers will drop

2114
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,680
into the top of Sky Dome.

2115
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:08,480
This part starts.

2116
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,680
There's no way to contact the skydivers,

2117
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:12,920
because they are in the sky.

2118
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:14,600
All the comms are going out, so there's

2119
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:19,840
no way to say, actually, hey, X-Nay on the skydiving part,

2120
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:20,960
they have to do it.

2121
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:22,040
There's no choice.

2122
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:24,560
So they just start, and the people filming the broadcast

2123
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,560
are like, oh, I guess skydivers are happening.

2124
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,760
OK, here we go.

2125
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:31,400
Does the rain stop, though?

2126
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,480
Footage made it seem like the rain.

2127
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:37,400
No, the rain's like, no, it's maybe a little bit better,

2128
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:41,000
but it doesn't stop, and they have

2129
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,680
to land in a couple inches worth of water.

2130
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:46,960
Yeah, someone falls on their bottom, I feel like.

2131
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:47,680
A couple of them.

2132
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:48,520
Right on their bottom, yeah.

2133
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:49,520
Flash right down.

2134
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:51,600
They slip off their tootsies and fall on their bottom.

2135
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:52,800
Right off their tootsies.

2136
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:55,480
Some of them might have twisted or broken their tootsies.

2137
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:58,040
Who knows what the state of these tootsies

2138
01:40:58,040 --> 01:40:59,120
by the end of this thing.

2139
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:04,120
Guy in the PA is saying, please keep the area clear.

2140
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:05,440
Open up that dome.

2141
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:08,040
Open up that dome.

2142
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:09,360
Fireworks start going on.

2143
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:10,360
They still do fireworks.

2144
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:12,920
I'm like, wow, you can do skydiving and fireworks

2145
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:14,880
in pouring rain?

2146
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:18,160
I mean, all of this, I guess I can't fault Chuck Magwood.

2147
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:20,080
He's not so incorrect.

2148
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:22,240
This was a spectacular.

2149
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:22,960
He was right.

2150
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:23,760
He was right.

2151
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:24,960
Magwood was right.

2152
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,960
Predating Prince at the Super Bowl,

2153
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:29,680
how much the rain added to that.

2154
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:32,000
Yeah, it just really, or the other day,

2155
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,320
Metallica performing with a perfect lightning

2156
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:35,240
strike behind them.

2157
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:36,960
Yeah, that's cool.

2158
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:39,800
We're allowed to say that this was a cool thing that

2159
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:41,960
happened that was cooler because of rain,

2160
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:44,760
because nobody got killed.

2161
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:45,280
People did.

2162
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:48,080
There were, I think, a number of lawsuits

2163
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:49,080
in the wake of this.

2164
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:49,720
Oh, sure.

2165
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:50,680
But that's no.

2166
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:52,440
But that's to any event there's going to be.

2167
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:54,480
There's going to be some quiet ones here and there.

2168
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:57,560
$500 stadium added to the list.

2169
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:02,200
Not to mention that by the time this thing is up and running,

2170
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:05,000
Sky Dome starts $40 million in debt.

2171
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,800
That is enough debt that it was estimated that in order

2172
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:10,120
to get back on its feet, Sky Dome

2173
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:12,440
would have to be functional and hosting events

2174
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:15,320
600 days a year.

2175
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:17,040
To me, that seems impossible.

2176
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:17,960
I think so.

2177
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:20,120
Yeah, but that's really the failing of the year

2178
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:23,440
for being too weak to have 600 days in it.

2179
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:25,360
The year could get its fucking act together.

2180
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:27,080
Yeah, no, you double book.

2181
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:30,040
Baseball game in the afternoon, baronet ladies at night.

2182
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:31,360
That's right.

2183
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:32,200
Yeah.

2184
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:33,640
And opera at 3 in the morning.

2185
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:36,560
Yeah, it's not like it's a major ordeal

2186
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:42,000
to flip a baseball stadium to a stage or baseball or football.

2187
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:42,520
Right.

2188
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:43,080
No time.

2189
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:44,040
Can't do it.

2190
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:45,480
Just slippery wet grass.

2191
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:48,560
The opera's going to have to happen on slippery wet grass.

2192
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:49,080
They did.

2193
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:52,480
So then a baseball game is being played two days after this.

2194
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:55,560
And because they didn't shut the dome,

2195
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:57,520
it was incredibly wet.

2196
01:42:57,520 --> 01:42:59,440
It was really muddy and bad.

2197
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:02,640
And they had to, whatever process it takes to dry dirt,

2198
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:05,480
they had to do to get ready for the Blue Jays' opera.

2199
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:07,080
I don't know anything about drying dirt.

2200
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:07,760
Jason, maybe?

2201
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:08,880
Yeah, that's your territory.

2202
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:10,560
A football manager might know about that.

2203
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:11,920
Yeah, the answer is tarp.

2204
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:16,880
And they could not do that due to the massive singing, dancing

2205
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:18,600
spectacle.

2206
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:23,760
So dirty games, lawsuits, costumes ruined.

2207
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:29,560
David McWood resigns in disgrace.

2208
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:31,480
I think he wasn't even in charge by the time

2209
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:34,480
this opening special was airing.

2210
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:39,000
Maybe James Dolan's fate at Sphere.

2211
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,360
Well, just come on after a year, maybe.

2212
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:43,720
A man ahead of its time.

2213
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:47,560
Sometimes you burn out bright and then fade away.

2214
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:51,720
Better to burn out than to fade away.

2215
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:52,560
A Canadian.

2216
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:53,560
There we go.

2217
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:57,400
Thank god he wasn't trotted out in this.

2218
01:43:57,400 --> 01:44:01,120
I just have one last ad hit, because this one

2219
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:04,360
felt like a personal attack.

2220
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:10,640
Close together, there were ads for Anbisol and Perp Plus

2221
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:12,000
pretty close.

2222
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,600
And I was like, oh, no, I have both of those

2223
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:17,400
in the house right now.

2224
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:18,280
That's an attack?

2225
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:19,400
What's the first thing?

2226
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:20,320
Anbisol.

2227
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:24,880
OK, Anbisol is an oral ointment that you can put on canker sores.

2228
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:26,240
Oh, I need that, actually.

2229
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:28,960
I swore I've recommended or given you Anbisol.

2230
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:29,880
Yeah, I probably tried.

2231
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:31,040
It probably doesn't work.

2232
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:34,200
New drop of what canker sore medication Jason is using.

2233
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:35,360
Let's fucking go.

2234
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:38,720
No, I haven't used this for like 10 years or so.

2235
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:41,560
And then just recently, I was putting Tari to wear together.

2236
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:44,160
I was like, I wonder if they still make Perp Plus.

2237
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:47,520
Well, these ads didn't say, hey, loser, do you use Perp Plus?

2238
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:50,600
But it was the logo I always liked as a kid.

2239
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:52,240
And I was like, it was a good attack.

2240
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:53,360
It was a nice thing.

2241
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:56,240
Are you a fuck up because you have canker sores in your mouth?

2242
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:56,720
Yeah.

2243
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:59,000
In fact, only losers get canker sores.

2244
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,800
If you're a loser, buy this, I guess.

2245
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:02,800
That's right.

2246
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:04,160
Then drink the whole bottle.

2247
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:05,920
Because what else do you have to live for?

2248
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:08,520
Anyway, it's just called Pert America now.

2249
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:11,560
It's had like three or four different owners.

2250
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:12,880
They took out the plus?

2251
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:13,920
They took out the plus.

2252
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:15,760
I think let it in internationally.

2253
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:17,880
Pert is no longer plus.

2254
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:18,960
Pert is normal now.

2255
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:21,200
Pert Plus has now took away plus.

2256
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:25,440
Pert Plus is some sort of a streaming service.

2257
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:29,040
That's my recommendation, Anbisol and Pert.

2258
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:31,240
You have canker sores, get Pert.

2259
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:33,640
No, don't get Pert.

2260
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:34,160
That's wrong.

2261
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:35,720
Yeah, don't put Pert.

2262
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:36,960
Don't put Pert on.

2263
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:38,760
Put Anbisol, it still works.

2264
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:40,320
Anyway, this special is a blast.

2265
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:42,960
If we didn't convince you to watch it already by doing this,

2266
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:45,720
I'm glad that we did a full deep dive here.

2267
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:50,360
I was so happy to get to go to Skydome myself in 2015.

2268
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:52,360
It was Roger's center by then.

2269
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:55,440
There was no way I wasn't calling it Skydome all night.

2270
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:59,280
Skydome had the most narrow seats I've ever experienced.

2271
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:02,320
It made me feel like a man twice my size.

2272
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:04,080
It was like an optical illusion.

2273
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:05,080
This is what I got?

2274
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:06,080
My god.

2275
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:08,960
What did you see?

2276
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:10,520
Blue Jays, I saw Blue Jays game.

2277
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:14,840
And it was a Blue Jays game where if they won,

2278
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:17,800
it would be the longest winning streak

2279
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:19,840
in the history of the franchise.

2280
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:22,160
They lost.

2281
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:24,920
When it was down to the wire, every pitch counted.

2282
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,560
Everyone is on their feet.

2283
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:30,680
The tension was so heavy in this room.

2284
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:33,760
The most tension, more tension than there

2285
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:35,400
had been years ago when everybody thought

2286
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:39,680
they were going to get electrocuted to death.

2287
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:43,000
And then just all of a sudden one pitch and that is it.

2288
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,520
Now I'm just watching everyone in town

2289
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:46,880
file out sadly and silently.

2290
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:48,200
I don't think they played any music.

2291
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:50,600
I don't think they said have a good night or drive safely.

2292
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:52,360
It was so sad.

2293
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:55,400
So I witnessed a very grim end of a game here.

2294
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:56,880
But I still had a great time.

2295
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:59,440
I was so happy to call it Sky Dome.

2296
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:02,480
And this quote, this is on a Reddit thread

2297
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:06,200
about this event, which I think this says it all.

2298
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:09,160
The youth today with their hyper cool synth wave

2299
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:11,440
aesthetic pop culture view of the 80s

2300
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:13,360
don't know the true 80s.

2301
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:17,280
This in all its cringe inducing agony was the true 80s.

2302
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:18,640
Wow.

2303
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:19,680
That says it all.

2304
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:23,280
And I love both sides of what he's talking about.

2305
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:27,680
I love the cool, I love the vapor wave reclaiming

2306
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:28,760
ends of the 80s.

2307
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:35,800
But I also love the skin meltingly embarrassing side

2308
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,560
of the 80s too.

2309
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:38,520
It was all there.

2310
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:39,200
Everyone was there.

2311
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:40,960
You called it in the Super Bowl episode the razzle

2312
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:43,360
dazzle crap of the 80s.

2313
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:43,920
Yeah.

2314
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:45,360
And this is some of the razzliest,

2315
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:47,640
dazzliest crap I've ever seen.

2316
01:47:47,640 --> 01:47:50,880
Listener, I hope you enjoy it if you check this thing out.

2317

We love talking about all of it and the commercials in it.

2325
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:13,840
If you know something as bonkers as the opening of Skydome 89.

2326
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:14,840
Let us have it.

2327
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:15,720
Yes, please.

2328
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:17,800
We don't want to go one day on this earth

2329
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:19,320
without knowing about it.

2330
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:23,600
I have to think there's something from the millennium

2331
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:25,560
that we haven't like a special like this.

2332
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:26,840
Listeners, let us know.

2333
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:27,360
Yeah.

2334
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:28,080
You know?

2335
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:30,760
And if there's an ad for canker sore medicine

2336
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:32,760
that attacks Jason, let us know about that too.

2337
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:34,840
Well, hey, but it helps you.

2338
01:48:34,840 --> 01:48:38,400
Well, nothing helps me with my canker sores.

2339
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:39,640
You and me both, brother.

2340
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:41,200
Amen.
