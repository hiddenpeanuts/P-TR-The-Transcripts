1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,400
Welcome to podcast the ride, the second gate.

3
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,240
We're here today to discuss a very important album about a character trait that

4
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,800
everyone knows about the legend Donald Duck.

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,560
He loves gadgets. My name is Mike Carlson.

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,800
Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan. Hi.

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,360
Scott Garner here today also to talk about this thing that we all know already,

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,680
but is, you know, is something that's explored in the album we're discussing today.

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,480
He's a digital duck. That's right.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,480
Which manifests not in apps because that's not the era that we're dealing with yet.

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,800
It's more like the sharper image kind of,

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,560
he likes a lot of do dads with digital components. Right.

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,600
We are of course talking about the 1983 album Splash Dance.

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,560
Mickey Mouse Splash Dance.

15
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,520
I think fully officially it's kind of presented as if Mickey Mouse is the artist

16
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,000
of the album Splash Dance, but he's on it very rarely.

17
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,320
It's kind of a little like laugh into it.

18
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,360
And then you're kind of on your own with anonymous singers.

19
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,240
Yeah. He presents it, I guess, in a way, I guess you kind of would say.

20
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,960
And he is on the presence in it.

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,760
A lot of the songs are about him or mention him and his friends, his good friends.

22
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,400
I wanted to start real quick.

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,440
You know, we always talk about the album art and I say we, I mean, like

24
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,440
record heads, vinyl collectors, music fans.

25
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,320
And this has a fantastic cover.

26
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,080
Let's just start there. Love this cover. Yeah, absolutely.

27
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,520
Mickey hitting a big wave.

28
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,440
Mickey is hitting a big wave. The curl.

29
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,400
The angle is fantastic.

30
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,760
There's a cool wave going the way that is rendered.

31
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't know if it's early CGI

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,160
or just drawn from kind of a digital feeling angle, but it feels very airbrushed.

33
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,080
This image was really big in a book that like I had a piano in the house growing up.

34
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,960
And there was a book like sheet music of Disney songs.

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,920
And this took over a full page of it before I knew the album Splash Dance.

36
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,200
And I would I would stop and stare at it.

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,120
It felt different to me. Yes.

38
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,800
Even just a few years down the road, like whether it's 3D or fake 3D, it's just it's it's rad.

39
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,600
This is like this is what is it 13 years before Mario 64,

40
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,040
where you would be get behind it would be you would finally get a 3D rendering

41
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,360
of the worlds that you played in video games.

42
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,280
And this feels sort of like that to me, where it's like

43
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,640
you're behind Mickey, you're on his journey, you're on his wave.

44
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,520
Yeah, even if it maybe it was not rendered in any 3D fashion.

45
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:04,760
Right. But if it was like it does give you that it's that angle that absolutely is exciting.

46
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,920
Like if you I would love for this to keep going into a video or into a video game

47
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,960
that I'm controlling, sort of surfing with Mickey scenario.

48
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,760
I completely agree. And of course, I think the number one thing

49
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,360
we have to talk about this and we really haven't talked about this topic in a while.

50
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:24,280
But I never noticed how good of a seat Mickey has before this cover.

51
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,080
Are you sure we have? Are you sure we have to go down this avenue?

52
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,320
I'm just saying I was looking at it and I go, look at Mickey's nice seat.

53
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,480
It's like that seat is featured so prominently on this cover.

54
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,960
I mean, you noticed it, Jason.

55
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,120
Yeah, it's like you're saying like it's Wednesday in my neighborhood

56
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,440
because there's a dump truck there, you know, it's trash truck dump truck.

57
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,920
Look, I'm not going to be like that.

58
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,640
It was clever, but this isn't club random, Jason.

59
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,200
You can't just be vulgar like that.

60
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,080
Oh, how many things can we mention in the first five minutes

61
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,680
to make me want to run for the door?

62
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,400
I'll keep it. You know, I got to find I got to find a, you know,

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,400
a ball right over the plate to smack at because I admittedly this topic.

64
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,280
You you can pretty quickly when this topic came up in conversation, we're like,

65
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,320
oh, well, splash dance. Yeah, splash dance.

66
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,200
And I'm like, mm hmm.

67
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,640
Yes, because I knew the pieces of this.

68
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,040
I did not know the whole.

69
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,200
Have we ever talked to be out?

70
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,320
Well, yeah. What was your level of your maybe you've seen this cover?

71
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,480
Maybe. Yeah, I think it was the the cover, the phrase, the phrase.

72
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,240
Disney was really milking splash in the 80s.

73
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,680
So, oh, yeah, splash mountain, the movie, splash, eventually.

74
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,640
Yeah, that's true.

75
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,800
No, no splash mountain really connection.

76
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,960
That's that's a few years away at this point.

77
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,840
But yeah, I didn't really know.

78
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,400
So I went in pretty fresh to this album.

79
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,440
Was this the first time you saw the photo of Mickey's iconic seat?

80
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,720
I think I've seen it in passing.

81
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,160
I think it's been like a lot of this album has been used in

82
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,800
either anniversary specials, birthday specials or like music videos.

83
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,680
Yeah, a lot of the songs have found homes elsewhere. Yeah.

84
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,000
It is this I don't know how to and maybe you guys can help with this.

85
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,600
Actually, what if you had to explain as a first time listener?

86
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,720
Yeah. What is this album to you?

87
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,480
Is there a way to like what's going on?

88
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,240
OK, I kept seeing I saw one or two plays

89
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,640
refer to it as a spiritual sequel sequel to Mickey Mouse Disco.

90
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,840
And I think there's similar writers and producer or same writers

91
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,560
and producers, I think, or some writers.

92
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,720
But it's the same entity.

93
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,120
Yeah, it's Walt Disney Records.

94
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,880
Some of this has gone over in the Halyx documentary,

95
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,600
which we appear in and help inspire, help inspire the Walt Disney

96
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,040
Records made a lot of books that were just telling the story of a movie.

97
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,080
And they did it even for non Disney movies for Star Wars and E.T.

98
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,400
And that was their bread and butter.

99
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,240
But I think the people involved wanted to shake it up and, you know, and rock.

100
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,960
They wanted to get rock and make it, which prompted the album

101
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,440
Mickey Mouse Disco, which was a sneaker hit after a bunch of,

102
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,760
you know, changing their promotional strategy and advertising it on TV.

103
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,160
But this is like an oddly huge album.

104
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,960
Eventually, this Mickey Mouse Disco, which I've never heard in.

105
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,960
Has anybody heard Mickey Mouse Disco?

106
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,520
I don't think I've heard it in full, but I've heard some songs and I'm into it.

107
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,600
I mean, I like every gimmicky disco album.

108
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,920
Well, and then this is the next decade.

109
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,320
So this is a lot of I don't know.

110
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,800
I like pop songs.

111
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,200
There's echoes of like trends of the time.

112
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,040
There's some synth in here.

113
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,440
There was one song where I was like, this kind of sounds like ABBA.

114
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,240
And then there was another song where it's like there's hints of Devo.

115
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:05,240
Uh huh. Like as if someone had heard Devo once or twice on the radio

116
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,080
and then went in the studio and tried to reverse engineer it.

117
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,160
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

118
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,480
Yeah, that's a lot of it to me.

119
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,880
It's I've seen it.

120
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,560
Someone might have even suggested that we do it as an episode

121
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,120
and might have framed it as when Disney did a new wave album.

122
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,720
That's not exactly right, because it's not we definitely aren't in

123
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,920
Duran Duran, Flock of Seagulls territory.

124
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,760
It's like much.

125
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,760
There's like a darkness, I feel like, to new wave.

126
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,080
And this is all very bright and goofy.

127
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,560
But it's in goofy, including goofy.

128
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,640
Goofy is on it.

129
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,360
It's kind of like, I don't know.

130
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,080
It's just like Disney trying to do an album with the trappings of 1982,

131
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:47,280
1983, which is delightful to me because I love so much music

132
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,800
from then, and it has the feel of pop songs from then that I like.

133
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,360
It feels like it's as like it feels like Disney's doing.

134
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,480
Let's use all of the methods used to make an Olivia Newton

135
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,800
John album with Minnie and Chip and Dale and such, which.

136
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,160
So I've always been very fond of it.

137
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,120
I haven't known this album forever, but whenever I stumbled on it,

138
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,280
it's an interesting mix.

139
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,680
There's songs that there's a couple of songs on it.

140
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,600
They're very important to me and some that I have zero thoughts on at all.

141
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,440
Yeah, there's and I will lean on you guys to have any opinions all over the map.

142
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,680
But there's certain things where I'm like, this might be the best Disney album.

143
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,640
I like the like the peaks of it, I think, are wonderful.

144
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,320
Yeah, the peaks are high.

145
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,560
There are a couple of songs that are like nothing and veer much closer to

146
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,920
kids like kind of mindless kids songs.

147
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,120
There's a couple that are like more like that, where you go,

148
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,040
yeah, this is sort of monotonous and whatever.

149
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,000
Sing songy. Yeah.

150
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But who knows? Those will be Jason's favorites.

151
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,080
But that could be Jason's favorite. We don't know about it.

152
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,080
I mean, I assume we're on a similar page about which ones are good

153
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,000
or which ones are very good.

154
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,280
We'll see. Yes.

155
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,080
I I'm going to try to I found out some history about this album

156
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,320
and I'll try to pepper it in as we go instead of front load it.

157
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,240
But here's the here's one thing to say about it is that most of the music

158
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,400
on this album is made by, I believe, a husband and wife team.

159
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,960
Michael and Patty Silver sure.

160
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,880
And I'll say a little more about them as we go.

161
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,600
But the main thing is

162
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
gummy bears theme is them.

163
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,960
Tailspin theme is them.

164
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,320
And a lot of the songs on this Disney afternoon album.

165
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,680
Do we have this?

166
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,560
I've heard it recently, but I have I did not have it as a kid.

167
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,320
Didn't have it growing up.

168
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,240
This was this was a like stuck in the car.

169
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,800
Mom and dad don't put any other tape in there.

170
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,480
I want I remember listening to it to go see the Disney afternoon overlay in 1990.

171
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,000
I loved the theme songs.

172
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,080
I love the main Disney afternoon theme song.

173
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,400
Yeah, yeah, certainly.

174
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,560
But there's all these other songs.

175
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,200
I don't even remember being on the shows.

176
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,800
I don't know if they're just inspired by Tailspin or gummy bears or whatever.

177
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,920
But I liked all of them.

178
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:59,520
I found these all to be like oddly sweet, angsty, touching songs at times.

179
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,480
And it makes so much sense to me that that album was like had a place in my heart.

180
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,920
And then everything I've heard from that, not everything,

181
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,000
but there's certain songs on this that have come up before that I feel odd emotion about.

182
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,440
I think I have to credit Michael and Patty Silvershire.

183
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,720
I think they did a good job.

184
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,960
The gummy bear song we've talked a little bit about.

185
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,440
And I never had any I honestly have no affection for the gummy bears.

186
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,240
They didn't watch the show.

187
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,120
But that theme is so good.

188
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,600
Boy, it's a it's a real it's a punch.

189
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,960
I don't think I knew that they wrote it.

190
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,120
This couple wrote it sung by Joseph Williams, son of John Williams

191
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,520
and often lead singer of Toto, which connects a lot of dots for me.

192
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,840
Like, why have I landed on Toto so hard as music?

193
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,400
I can't stop listening to it.

194
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,160
I think it's on some level.

195
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,080
Yeah, it is like, oh, so there's there were pop songs in this era

196
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,120
that essentially sound like the gummy bears song.

197
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,480
It'd be a little embarrassing if I'm just blasting the gummy bears song

198
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,160
in my car all the time.

199
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,680
But I can do if I, you know, I legitimize it slightly with six songs that are similar.

200
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,600
I play the gummy bears theme on Apple Music once every couple months, I think.

201
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,160
Good move. Two or three months, probably.

202
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,560
Yeah. Have I ever told the story of when I almost got kicked out of my dorm

203
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,960
because of the DuckTales theme?

204
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,840
No, no. Does this sound familiar?

205
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,120
I don't think so. If it's a five timer, I apologize.

206
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,240
And I don't remember here, but I don't think I've told this.

207
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,880
This was a discovery for like as soon as not streaming services,

208
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,840
but like Kazaa or audio galaxy or whatever.

209
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,520
Yeah, I was thinking this too.

210
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,960
I I feel like I didn't get to file sharing until college.

211
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,120
And I was like, remember a day where I was like, oh, my God,

212
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,640
people have TV theme, so I can get these.

213
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,400
I think our brains probably work the same way.

214
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,680
Yeah, you're like, well, here's full album stuff and that's cool.

215
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,280
Wait, but somebody took the time to upload Mr.

216
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,960
Belvedere. Whoa.

217
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,840
I can be interesting like that and play Mr.

218
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,560
Belvedere in the car on a mixed CD.

219
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,640
But anyways, my roommate in sophomore year,

220
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,440
we were very delighted to have just access to the DuckTales theme

221
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,120
whenever we want, because also a real like solid blat.

222
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,320
That's a jam. I think we're all fans of that.

223
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,880
And we had there had been one incident where somebody was kind of

224
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,120
stomping around a little bit and it bothered our our

225
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,840
is it already or like the guy who lives in the building?

226
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,240
Are a which in this case was this big brawny guy.

227
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,520
He kind of looked like Pete, the Disney character Pete.

228
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,960
I don't know how they landed on him as the guy who's going to live in the dorm

229
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,120
building, but he was kind of he was very mean and gruff and scary.

230
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,720
And he came up one day and kind of was like, I've been hearing a lot of sounds.

231
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,840
I don't think I like it.

232
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,320
And then he came up again and said, I think I know what it is.

233
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,640
And he had some other explanation that led us off the hook, but left it at like,

234
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,280
but if there's ever stomping again, I swear to God.

235
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,480
And then we had a kind of a late night

236
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,640
stomp around to the DuckTales theme as you do college. Right.

237
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,600
Oh, yeah. Going nuts. Blasting the DuckTales theme.

238
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,920
And it was literally right before we shut off the lights and went to bed.

239
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,240
So we did it.

240
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,680
And then with the main, the door had been left open.

241
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,000
So suddenly door, the lights are off.

242
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,480
Door slams open. Hey, what do I tell you?

243
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,960
And he's like, we this guy's screaming at us just bloody murder.

244
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,640
And then he calms down, gets himself together and says,

245
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,240
here's what's going to happen.

246
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,760
I'm going to write a letter.

247
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,320
And the recommendation of the letters that you guys fight somewhere else to live.

248
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,480
Whoa. Wow. We're like, oh, God. OK.

249
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,240
And we just kind of. All right. Well, let's forget about that.

250
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,760
Let's try to get some Z's and we'll see how this plays out.

251
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,600
But we have angered this guy, I guess, for the last time.

252
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,760
And then the dreaded day came in a couple of weeks

253
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,840
where we opened our school mailboxes and there was a letter to each of us

254
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,560
saying that we have been a nuisance and we need to find somewhere else to live.

255
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,760
And we looked at the letters and went, oh, no.

256
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,080
And then we thought, wait, does anyone but us have these letters?

257
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,640
I think this guy wrote a letter to us,

258
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,160
telling us to find somewhere else to live and not do any sort of board

259
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,240
or the school or anyone who could evict us.

260
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,880
So we're like, this big brawny Pete guy is so dumb.

261
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,440
He didn't. He wrote a letter to us.

262
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,160
What's that going to do?

263
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,640
So he stayed there and blasted ducktails and everyone.

264
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,960
And I come back.

265
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,440
No, we said we kept the stomping at a minimum and maybe we tried it.

266
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,240
Maybe after that, we made an effort to take ducktails out on the street.

267
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,720
Only in the car.

268
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,560
How only when only in the drop top.

269
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,880
We even hold up.

270
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,520
I'm not saying it's that weird, but how often were you playing ducktails and dancing?

271
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,320
This is the only time that it was ducktails, but it has really lit us up.

272
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,440
We for sure was, I said there was not YouTube yet.

273
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,640
YouTube was 18 months away or something.

274
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,680
So the ability to I can just pull up the ducktails theme whenever I want.

275
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,960
I don't have to buy a DVD to hear it.

276
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,320
It excited us so much.

277
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,040
So it was a go to to blast it.

278
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,720
So when you say stomping, were you like acting out the intro?

279
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,640
It was sort of no.

280
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,080
It was like truly just like stomping around like monsters.

281
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
My roommate and I both like Godzilla movies.

282
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,040
But what does Godzilla have to do with ducktails?

283
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,720
No, nothing.

284
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,080
No, it's just the stomping.

285
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,640
The spirit of Brian and I.

286
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,240
Did you stop? No, no.

287
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,000
I had a similar RA incident where my junior year

288
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,080
we were in the like the one dorm that was air conditioned

289
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,920
and everyone had their own bathroom.

290
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,000
And that was pretty nice.

291
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,360
But our room was next to the RA.

292
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,640
And my roommate and I were not particularly wild.

293
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,720
But one night, one Thursday night, I remember

294
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,320
he was going to his girlfriends and I we were watching like

295
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,320
the start of the Daily Show and we were kind of laughing at whatever.

296
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,520
You laugh and too loud at him going like

297
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,440
the classic Jon Stewart.

298
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,120
Yes. Yeah.

299
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,720
But not a cream pie dropped off the top of a ladder.

300
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,560
Yeah.

301
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,160
So we hear a knock at the door at like 11 p.m.

302
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:17,560
and we open it and it's like the RA and they start going off about like

303
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,240
it's so noisy, it's a Thursday night.

304
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,280
And I just I have study and I'm like, oh, sorry.

305
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,600
He was just late.

306
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,560
And we we we really apologize because he seemed very upset.

307
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,920
And then they started going into like

308
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,320
and I never see you guys at floor events at at the social meet.

309
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,760
And I'm like, we're both juniors and we're very busy.

310
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:47,160
Like we're in multiple like this school paper, the school TV station.

311
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,480
Like I was going to do laundry for the first time.

312
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,960
Yeah, I had to do my own fucking laundry.

313
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,680
I and I had to talk them down.

314
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,760
I talked to them for like an hour because I was I was like, oh, no,

315
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,840
they are going through something.

316
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,040
And and then they finally left and he was just like, what the fuck?

317
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,480
And I was like, I don't know.

318
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,360
I feel like we should tell someone.

319
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,240
But after that, I know they are at risk to themselves.

320
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,480
There's no we plan these floor events and they're for fun and for you.

321
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,600
And you don't even know they were they were perfectly nice.

322
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,040
But I don't think we were the problem.

323
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,120
A previous year, I remember there had to be a floor meeting once

324
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,160
because two guys got drunk and one of them took the fire extinguisher

325
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,040
off the wall and shot the other one with it.

326
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,680
And then the whole floor, that stuff just lingers in the air.

327
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,520
So everyone's eyes are burning.

328
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,000
And like so that seems to me more troublesome

329
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
than like a couple of guys being goofy to the DuckTales theme.

330
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,520
I think so like Godzilla.

331
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,600
Yeah. Yeah. OK.

332
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,720
Stomping like Godzilla to the DuckTales thing, combining IPs unnecessarily.

333
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,560
I had a blast is what I recall.

334
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,040
I do that and then lights off immediately.

335
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,240
But then a man comes in and yells at you.

336
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,160
This is one good thing that we have right now in our lives

337
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,880
that some man can't just bust down our door, start yelling at us.

338
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,280
Yeah, if not, it's if it happens, it's a man we chose to live with.

339
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,280
Yeah, I don't live with some mean man currently.

340
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,560
Luckily. Yeah.

341
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,320
So maybe when your son is older and you're 60 and you're stomping around,

342
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,000
he'll be like, what is this?

343
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,080
Shut up.

344
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,640
What is this song?

345
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,080
I don't want to hear the DuckTales theme again.

346
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,080
And actually, that probably is the most accurate way that it would go,

347
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,680
is that Aaron and I are blasting the DuckTales theme.

348
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,120
I like a symphony.

349
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,240
I like symphonies.

350
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,440
I like sophisticated music.

351
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,280
He does. You know, what's funny is that he does.

352
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,480
He's learned how to conduct because of the movie Soul.

353
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,320
So now I can say conduct.

354
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,160
And then he like, I played Beethoven on the bike today

355
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,480
to see if he would conduct.

356
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,720
So I think you're you've you've guessed something completely right about our kid.

357
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,920
A quick shout out. I'm not sure if he's on the Patreon.

358
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,000
My high school band teacher's son listens to this show.

359
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,280
And he reached out to me.

360
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,520
His father reached out to me.

361
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,640
Why did he ever scream at you?

362
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,880
You know, I don't think he ever screamed at me.

363
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,400
He was upset with the band a lot if we were we were being louder, whatever.

364
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,960
But yeah, anyway, high school bands are so pleasant to listen to.

365
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,680
How could that how could that put you in an agitated state?

366
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,560
There's there are I have albums with solos of mine on them and they're not great.

367
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,840
You mean Alba, the school band, Alred albums of our school band.

368
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,280
Well, yeah.

369
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,400
And what's the solo like on what?

370
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,280
That's a good question.

371
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,680
And what are you playing again?

372
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,360
Remind me the trumpet, of course.

373
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,520
OK, yeah, I'm a trumpet player.

374
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,640
We all know that was the word was was the audience.

375
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,880
I haven't played the trumpet.

376
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,440
You've been there for every episode.

377
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,000
You don't remember trumpet.

378
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,240
I can play.

379
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,840
I have not played the trumpet in many years, but I've yeah, it's

380
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,480
it was my first instrument.

381
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,280
Would you be playing it on like rock and roll part two?

382
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,840
Well, for the.

383
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,920
Yeah, for the for the basketball games, we would.

384
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,800
You would play.

385
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,160
Wait, no, we didn't play rock and roll part two.

386
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,000
We played like, give me some love in.

387
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,560
Oh, cool. And the horse.

388
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,720
It was fun playing and playing at basketball.

389
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,200
It was really fun because every like everyone would show up

390
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,640
I think we all had brainwashed ourselves thinking that we were helping.

391
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,840
Yeah, which was part of it.

392
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,240
You were. Yeah, they just looked into the sea of khaki pants and black t-shirts.

393
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,720
Yeah, we had a casual wearer.

394
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,240
And we had like dark red for the Saxons,

395
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,920
Schomburg Saxons.

396
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,440
So so we'll get those solos together.

397
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,160
We should want to hear.

398
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,600
I have I have I listened to it a couple of years ago and I was like,

399
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,160
you're not on the podcast or you're not on the Patreon.

400
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,520
You got to be. Well, it's cool.

401
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,960
They do extra topics that veer a little bit away from the first.

402
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,960
And you get to hear one of the hosts great trumpet solos from 20 years ago.

403
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,920
Freddie, he was like two decades.

404
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,200
He wasn't even an adult.

405
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,560
And he I mean, he was this guy was a true true virtuoso.

406
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,080
I was in. Yeah.

407
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,520
I wasn't in the good band, though.

408
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,680
I was like first chair in concert band.

409
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,960
Oh, I see. Which means I wasn't as good as like the symphonic band.

410
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,040
They go back and forth between telling nice memories and traumatic experiences

411
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,720
that still live with them.

412
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,240
That's true. Yeah. Plus years later.

413
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,320
One of them pretenses Godzilla.

414
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,840
Rarrar. Stomp, stomp, stomp.

415
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,800
I think we were probably shouting the woos really loud.

416
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,400
I love the idea of this.

417
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,520
This sounds like the most wholesome thing I've ever heard.

418
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,600
It really was.

419
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,800
I do. I for sure know that we were not drinking

420
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,520
on that particular night.

421
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,760
100 percent. No one assumed you were drinking.

422
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,120
Yeah, I know.

423
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,800
This is a sober dance along to DuckTales.

424
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,680
And I think this episode will be the equivalent of such

425
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,160
the only drinking going on is that the star shit.

426
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,480
No, it's star shit.

427
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,000
Cherry. So just regular full fat.

428
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,360
Harder to get the full fat.

429
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,000
Full sugar. Coca Cola.

430
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,800
Zero sugar. It's full.

431
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,440
Zero sugar. OK.

432
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,200
No, it's not. Yeah. Zero.

433
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,440
Let's start talking about these these songs.

434
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,880
Yeah, let's go through them.

435
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,680
I guess starting with the opening track.

436
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,520
Mike, it's really your call what you want to play.

437
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,480
Maybe we should hear a little of the first one, I guess.

438
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,240
The second music.

439
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,480
Well, you know what I could play really, really fast is this commercial

440
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,200
for Splash Dance, because this was this is apparently how they sold

441
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,320
a lot of Mickey Mouse disco and then they did the same strategy of kind of longer ads.

442
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,200
This is like a two minute ad on TV with a blue screen at the end.

443
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,560
From jazz and checker money order.

444
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,800
So here's this.

445
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,320
If this explains the premise of it, and I don't think it does really.

446
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,120
Here comes America's favorite mouse and he's splash dancing.

447
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,520
It's Mickey Mouse Splash Dance, the brand new record album

448
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,120
from Walt Disney Productions.

449
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,680
It's fun. It's exciting.

450
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,120
And it's a splash from coast to coast.

451
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,120
Come dance along with all your.

452
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,000
Well, I would say that doesn't explain it in any way.

453
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
He's very splash dancing.

454
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,080
Yeah. What does that mean?

455
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,160
Why is this?

456
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,200
The first song is specifically about splashing.

457
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,400
It is it is the title track.

458
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,080
They sing a lot about splashing.

459
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,320
Honestly, I think a more accurate name for this album would be robot dancing

460
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,280
because they seem to be leaning on that.

461
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,600
That is topical. Yeah. Yeah.

462
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,880
Well, here's here's some history I can unfold then.

463
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,120
A lot of this stuff is from a book called Mouse Tracks,

464
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,680
which is the history of Walt Disney Records.

465
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:44,160
And this husband and wife team, they were they sent a bunch of demos to Disney

466
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,840
and they got hired to put together the songs for.

467
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,280
OK, first off, Disney.

468
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,920
All right, we did disco. Now we're going to do Mickey Mouse Rock.

469
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,960
This is the first potential project.

470
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,040
And the only information I could find about that in this book is that

471
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,640
this same team wrote a song that said they said

472
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:07,000
we wrote a Bob Dylan type song for Donald Duck to sing.

473
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,960
Don't know what that means or how that could possibly work.

474
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,960
I would love to hear it. They wrote five songs.

475
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,960
The entire album was squashed.

476
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,840
Didn't end up happening.

477
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,640
But hey, we'll keep you in mind if we do anything else.

478
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,760
So they started working up something else, something that would use

479
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,520
all these synths that are in music all of a sudden.

480
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,800
And they started making an album called Techno Mickey.

481
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:32,200
So why are all these other songs about robots and androids and digital ducks?

482
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,920
Because it was it was about we're going to take synthesizers

483
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,760
and do a song about synthesized objects.

484
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,560
And then it became something called Mouse Tronics.

485
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,960
So we're still in that electronics area.

486
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,080
And then the movie Flashdance was a big hit.

487
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,680
And they said, sorry, guys, now it's splash dance, huh?

488
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,240
People are excited about Ashdance, but anything with Ashdance in it.

489
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,480
Doesn't matter what those first few letters are.

490
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,680
So we end. So it's got to be splash dance.

491
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,760
The people said, well, we wrote a lot of songs about robots

492
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,680
and we don't really have any songs about splashing.

493
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,120
And they said, better get writing then.

494
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,440
So then we ended up at we got a splash, splash, splash.

495
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,320
They were just handed this arbitrary phrase and had to make heads or tails of it,

496
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,280
to which I say, good work.

497
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,920
They follow the corporate mandate pretty well.

498
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,600
I think it's a catchy song.

499
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,560
If I had heard as a kid, I would definitely be like rewinding that cassette.

500
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,720
Yeah, yeah. Well, there's a lot of pep in a lot of these, I'd say.

501
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,920
You want to play the just the beginning.

502
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,800
I mean, we heard it in the in the ad there.

503
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,320
But this is kind of you can hear Mickey's appearance essentially in it.

504
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,440
One, two, three, four.

505
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,960
Hey, let's splash dance.

506
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,080
I want to start through the puddle.

507
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,960
Crash into the sea.

508
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,040
Dunk my head in the bubbles.

509
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,760
Get water all over me.

510
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,520
Dive like a sunrise, like a whale.

511
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,640
Fly up my flippers like a big fishtail.

512
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,200
Barely stop off the board, you bet.

513
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,200
Anything as long as it's land.

514
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,480
I'm going to splash, splash, splash.

515
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,640
Cause the water's cool.

516
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,400
Splash, splash, splash.

517
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,480
In the swimming pool.

518
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,320
Splash, splash, splash.

519
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,880
Everybody get wet.

520
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,640
Splash, splash, splash.

521
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,680
That's great.

522
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,400
I think we got I think we got some real like Kenny Loggins

523
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,880
pep going on.

524
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,120
We got some. I think one of my favorite things about this album is all of the really

525
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,640
earnest singing.

526
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,640
It is very serious.

527
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,840
The vocals are just because like, you know,

528
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,920
what stops me with a lot of these Disney albums from really given at the time of days?

529
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,000
I don't know if I want to hear these characters sing.

530
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,720
Remember when we talked about the rap one?

531
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,280
I do not want to hear them rap.

532
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,200
I don't want to hear them sing standards.

533
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,400
That album that came out, I flipped through it.

534
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,920
Not interested.

535
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,400
I would rather maybe they hand the singing duties to some guy I've never heard.

536
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,800
If the singing is going to be superior.

537
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,080
Now, I saw the Mickey Mouse credit on this is Pete Rennaday.

538
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,760
Yes. Disney Journeyman.

539
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,280
Who is Henry in Country Bears?

540
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,680
I think you are the host of it.

541
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,360
He is like Lincoln, I believe, at least in some iteration.

542
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,280
He's Lincoln.

543
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,800
In some iteration, he's on the Tomorrowland Transit Authority.

544
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,800
And he is,

545
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,680
what's it Nemo?

546
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,040
He's doing a James Mason impression.

547
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,240
Oh, the narration on the subs.

548
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,840
OK. 20,000 leads.

549
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,840
Interesting. I don't know if he was Mickey a lot.

550
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,720
So it's not that other. It's not Jack Way.

551
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,880
It's not, well, you asked for it.

552
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,640
So there's still a difference.

553
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,320
Mickey is the other Journeyman.

554
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,680
The other who is around.

555
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,240
Yeah. Go falsetto who we can force to do this.

556
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:56,040
So and again, I kind of miss this era where they weren't tracking who was Mickey.

557
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,160
Very well. Multiple Mickey's in its confusing.

558
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,400
There's a lot of sloppiness to it.

559
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,240
But what a nice song. What a sincere song.

560
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:11,080
Yeah. Yeah. Describing just being in a pool, I guess, really, or the ocean.

561
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,880
It's what all the kids were into.

562
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,120
What they took from Flashdance is that the kids are all

563
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:22,960
is Flashdance the one where she dumps the water at the end?

564
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,840
Is that why?

565
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,360
Yeah. That's the one that was a there was a show in the European Park.

566
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,920
Yes. Yeah. With the bucket. Right.

567
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,880
Or at the end.

568
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,040
So I guess that's what they were thinking.

569
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,640
People want it because that had a lot of pop songs in it

570
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,200
and it had splashing in it.

571
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,880
Well, that's true. It did.

572
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,280
It is very much of a piece of the current

573
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,640
birdbrain take that like, well, everything everywhere.

574
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,760
All at once was very people liked it.

575
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,080
They love the multiverse.

576
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,120
Multiverse movies are hot.

577
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,520
And it's like, was that what people?

578
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,520
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

579
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,920
No, I there's a yeah, there's a real cynicism.

580
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,680
My. Oh, yeah.

581
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,960
Everybody likes multiverse movies.

582
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,800
So let's all right.

583
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,560
All every every character we have in storage.

584
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,560
Bust them out. Throw them together.

585
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,760
Oh, yeah. Convoluted way.

586
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,880
Fast and Furious.

587
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,960
The Fast and the Furious was a big hit.

588
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,720
People love car movies.

589
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,240
Oh, yeah. You got to get some cars in movies, you know.

590
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,080
Well, that one follows a little more.

591
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,440
I guess it follows a little more.

592
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,680
I just feel like all movies are movies to some extent.

593
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,800
Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

594
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,760
I am. Most big movies have a big car race.

595
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,600
Yes. Yeah.

596
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,960
Strange to shift focus all of a sudden.

597
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,840
Well, but hey, they figured it out.

598
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,680
They did a song about skipping through the sprinkles.

599
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,000
Yeah. The lyric.

600
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,240
There's the the the sounds in this, the little like beep beep.

601
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,600
Like all that stuff is just so sad.

602
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,520
I can listen to that without even the vocals.

603
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,600
Yes. And the little if you those little splash sounds.

604
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,280
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

605
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:01,440
Our our synth samples, those do come out of like.

606
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,080
So it is kind of an interesting album in that regard that it has all these little

607
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,120
squiggles and bits of character.

608
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,200
The gyro gear, gear loose song has a lot of those just odd little like

609
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,600
blips and buzzes, which were pretty pretty new at the time.

610
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,400
So fun start. Good.

611
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,240
Let's talk a little about happy, happy birthday to you.

612
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,360
This is this is a big one.

613
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,000
This one, like, has a lot of life, I feel like outside of the album.

614
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,600
This is a different birthday song.

615
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,080
Yes. That was my very like 10 seconds in.

616
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,080
I'm like, oh, this is an attempt to make another birthday song.

617
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,800
Now, you heard this before. Huh?

618
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,000
Have you read you run into this birthday song before?

619
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,760
I it felt very familiar.

620
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,360
It was not glued in my mind like it didn't.

621
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,760
I didn't immediately recognize it.

622
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,240
Yeah, it's one of those.

623
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,840
It's like in my childhood somewhere.

624
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,600
Yeah. Did you have was this around for you?

625
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,000
I for sure recognize that I was it on like DTV or was it on Disney Channel

626
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,560
when we were a little probably right?

627
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:08,520
Some other use of it that they started using it in the parks after this.

628
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,920
And they amended the lyrics to be like it's Donald's birthday or or or

629
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,000
it's Mickey's birthday.

630
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,280
Birthday land, maybe.

631
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:22,120
Yeah. The the the main melody itself, I think is well here.

632
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,200
You know, I play it and I'll I'll say my take.

633
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,640
Yeah.

634
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,440
Happy birthday to you.

635
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,280
I want to do something special for you.

636
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,280
It's your birthday and you're special, too.

637
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,320
So I brought some wands from the outer wands.

638
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,880
You want to talk and squabble and sing just for you.

639
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,040
Happy birthday.

640
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,640
Happy birthday.

641
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,600
Happy happy birthday to you.

642
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,640
Yeah. OK, so this was used.

643
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,840
It was changed a little in 84.

644
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,920
To celebrate Donald Duck's 50th birthday used in a live parade

645
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,600
at Disneyland and Walt Disney World in Donald's honor and then used again.

646
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,240
It's for Mickey's 60th birthday

647
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:33,240
in the show Mickey's 60th birthday surprise performed at Disneyland at Disney.

648
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,320
Oh, OK, OK. Gotcha.

649
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,040
Yeah, there's a lot of stuff for the 60th.

650
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,400
So they want to celebrate these characters big, big birthdays,

651
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,840
but they're not given those Hill sisters a dime.

652
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,480
I say good riddance because this is this is better than the birthday song.

653
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,120
This is better than happy birthday.

654
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,120
Isn't it when it happens at a birthday party, aren't you like, oh, the song

655
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
garf, it's like embarrassing.

656
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,920
If it's your birthday, I would prefer not.

657
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:05,880
Now I have a birthday and then everybody has decided to sing happy birthday.

658
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,240
Happy birthday. I'm thrilled.

659
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,320
This is great news.

660
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,080
I want to I want to replace it.

661
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,320
I say, let's pass it the baton.

662
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,720
There's a couple. I mean, there's other birthday.

663
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,000
So I could Stevie Wonder, of course, has a birthday song.

664
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,840
I mean, any of these, I think, are good options for replacement.

665
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,080
Yeah, there's yeah, there's been a number, I feel like, where, yeah,

666
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,200
why not switch this?

667
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,720
I think we have perfected the model, but it's so it's so grandfathered in.

668
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,800
Well, I think the birthday song is like this awful US

669
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:38,520
Constitution type thing that prevents us from moving forward and changing.

670
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,720
And the traditionalists hold us back.

671
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,080
I say, I said, get rid of happy birthday.

672
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,440
It's time to replace it. I agree.

673
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,200
I mean, chain restaurants have all maybe already done it.

674
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,120
Some of them have their own signature birthday.

675
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,080
Like the band again, the whole thing.

676
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,120
Clat, happy, happy birthday.

677
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,440
Oh, yeah. Like, yes, you know, it's true.

678
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,520
Happy, happy birthday from Ben against to you.

679
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:01,880
Like, I don't you know, I'm not 100% on the start of that lyric.

680
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,000
I'm not 100%.

681
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,800
If anyone knows, please tell me.

682
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,560
I think we should all write our own new happy birthday song. Yeah.

683
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,920
That's I think what better it requires a little more work.

684
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,440
But what better gift can you give to your friends then?

685
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,080
All right. It's my birthday at the end of the month.

686
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,480
And I have written a new birthday song and I want you to sing this birthday song.

687
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,320
Do not sing the don't sing that would be a boring one.

688
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,600
Get practicing because it's complicated.

689
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,360
No pitchiness on the singing.

690
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:36,040
If you you won't be pitchy, if you practice, practice, practice.

691
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,680
I love it. And the earnestness of the vocals.

692
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,960
Yeah, I I brought this up to a friend who had this lodged in his head,

693
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,480
who just said, oh, yeah, the most like genuine song ever.

694
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,120
And then the lyric and backwards they sing.

695
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,520
There's a there's a weird little practice, practice backwards part.

696
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,120
I think maybe the big thing stopping this from becoming the main birthday

697
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,920
song is all of the specific mythology about Gwong's.

698
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,880
Do we really want to hear about Gwong's?

699
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,320
But I think that was all out by the time they did it for Donald and Mickey.

700
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,320
Sure. It's mainly about the chorus.

701
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,880
That's that's all I care. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

702
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,560
I think that's right.

703
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,960
We should see if there's the version of it for Donald.

704
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,720
I mean, it's probably has to live somewhere.

705
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,680
The the newer maybe the newer version for Donald is better.

706
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,000
Yeah. You just replace Donald's name with whoever.

707
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,520
Is there a Chuck E.

708
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,960
Cheese specific birthday song?

709
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,960
I want to say there was. Yes, I'm not coming up.

710
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,480
There might be a few of them.

711
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,240
I think they do.

712
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,480
They say it's your birthday.

713
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,640
Well, that's the Beatles, right?

714
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,440
OK, I feel like everyone agreed we're going to sing that.

715
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,920
Yeah. Instead, some people hate on that classic rock song.

716
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,200
And I don't I like it.

717
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,360
Classic Rock radio stations would always play that song

718
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:51,440
and then list what classic rock stars birthday was great.

719
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,200
Great fun. Good.

720
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,000
That's a good segment.

721
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,400
We're all going to write our own happy birthday songs.

722
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,040
That's the assignment eventually.

723
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,400
Yeah. Yeah. Change it up every year.

724
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,480
I mean, it makes you incentivized to keep going to birthdays,

725
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,360
to hear what the new song drop is.

726
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,080
Jason, you're going to have to write a song.

727
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,480
OK. OK.

728
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,920
I'll do my best.

729
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,000
I know. You wrote it.

730
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,720
Funny energy. You improvised the song.

731
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,040
I was not but six months ago or. Oh, yeah.

732
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,920
If you can call it that, sure.

733
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,040
I would call it that. Yeah.

734
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,880
Um, digital duck, digital duck, as mentioned at the top.

735
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,240
And now we're this is maybe the first that we fully arrived

736
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,720
in the initial premise of the album, which has nothing to do with splashing,

737
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,920
splashing near digital ducks and androids and robots.

738
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,680
Not a good idea.

739
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,000
I don't know why they put these premises together.

740
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,000
Right. They hold better than you'd think.

741
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,840
Digital duck.

742
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:54,040
This is about Donald Duck having a lot of these hordes of devices.

743
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,560
Love's devices.

744
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,920
We referenced it at the start of the episode.

745
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,040
Yes. Donald loves technology.

746
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,080
Born completely out of nothing.

747
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,200
Right. This is completely there.

748
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:12,240
Is there any short where Donald is like tinkering with a new TV or a new gadget?

749
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,640
Well, here's my thought is that at this time,

750
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:22,640
I feel like if you had a lot of gadgets, that was your that was a quirky little hobby.

751
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,280
Right. You were like a little like basement inventor kind of guy.

752
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,160
Yeah. And now we all have a million gadgets and their shackles and they burden our lives,

753
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,400
even though they're supposed to make it better.

754
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:38,920
But at the time, except for podcast devices and apps, this and Patreon.

755
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,240
So this this all is the enhancement.

756
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,720
I mean, we're coming up on like 20 years of podcasts.

757
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,760
So stuck around.

758
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,560
So that's got some saying.

759
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,560
Yeah. And profound.

760
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,000
The medium perfected right around now to 2017.

761
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,640
And now is really where it is.

762
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,720
Last five years, a golden age.

763
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,440
You know, really good for the industry.

764
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,040
And they they call them podcast feeds because you're like, feed me more.

765
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,400
Yeah, because of us.

766
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,400
Yum, yum. Say that to you next time.

767
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,040
It's the episode pop up.

768
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,400
And who's I think it used to be a little quirk, a little look at this weirdo.

769
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,640
And they, you know, like Wayne Zelinski, you know, but those are the inventor, though.

770
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,400
He is an inventor.

771
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,960
Yeah, inventor.

772
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,880
But Pete, well, or a peewee peewee had like Rubert Goldberg devices

773
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,720
to make like toast that the open up the one movie, right?

774
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,680
Not a gadget guy.

775
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,760
He I think he just like lives in a world of whimsy.

776
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,560
But they're both kind of like quirky weirdos.

777
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,480
And see what you're saying.

778
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,480
These are a little akin. Yeah.

779
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,280
Maybe that's maybe this was a phase of Donald's, you know,

780
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,040
and you're right that it comes from nowhere.

781
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,560
But why not? I love that.

782
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,720
A song with a big new trait about a character,

783
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,320
because what else are they going to say?

784
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,520
You know, again, do we want to hear a song?

785
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,320
You see, we do want to hear that.

786
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,480
I do not. Well, we we.

787
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,960
Jason, you're going to write a song about Donald Seat as well.

788
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,840
Happy birthday to Donald Seat.

789
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,840
Beep boop beep boop.

790
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,240
I did have to play it through twice because I was not 100 percent certain

791
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,640
that it was not Donald is a cyborg of some sort.

792
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,720
Like Donald is the gadget.

793
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,440
Yeah. You know what I mean?

794
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,360
He's a digital duck is what's said.

795
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,120
But then you have to hear the full context of

796
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,520
Donald loves his gadgets, even though they run amok.

797
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,680
He's a digital duck.

798
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:33,520
The chorus of digital duck is is a high point on this album, for sure.

799
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,360
Yeah. I guess I guess we should play a little bit of it.

800
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,480
But yeah, but you know.

801
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,800
Oh, yeah. Well, I guess we'll give you a little intro.

802
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,080
I am a man.

803
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,640
I'm not home.

804
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,840
Play with your machine.

805
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,080
I'm a song that you do.

806
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,960
So Donald has an answering machine, which is the first odd thing.

807
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,720
It was how when did the answering machine get invented?

808
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,520
I think, yeah, I think answer machines were there around pretty well in use

809
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,960
in the early 80s.

810
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,240
In the song of Donald using technology and it's an answering machine.

811
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,200
So that's the first thing.

812
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,280
Well, it's a big, you know, you start with a basic before you

813
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,080
you stretch it out to, you know, what's got this and crazy ones coming soon.

814
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,560
Yeah, well, I'll give a verse in the chorus. OK.

815
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,840
It's most gadgets, electric devices, a microwave blander

816
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:27,400
that cuts, chops and dices, chocolate detectors, a long takeover.

817
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,800
Donald has dozens in every room.

818
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,560
So he sounds paranoid, actually, when you listen to it.

819
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,880
He's got like detectors in every room.

820
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,920
Yeah, he's got like it sounds like he's kind of one of those guys

821
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,440
that thinks the government's watching him.

822
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,320
I think of all the like me like six

823
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,280
Disney characters, like the big six or whatever.

824
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,040
It's probably Donald, right?

825
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,960
He's like he's like Dale on King of the Hill. Yeah.

826
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,200
He's really paranoid about the deep state.

827
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:01,120
Well, but you also the flip side could be that he

828
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,240
you know, if you were the if you were the most paranoid,

829
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,320
you might not have any devices.

830
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:10,280
Maybe maybe maybe he actually trusts the government.

831
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,200
This is him being very patriotic.

832
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,120
Oh, that he because, yeah, you would get rid of all of it

833
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,120
if you really thought you were listening.

834
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,720
Yeah, it's either and you either have a full like army,

835
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,000
Navy surplus store in your house or you have nothing.

836
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,360
Yeah, maybe it's that he's trying to scramble the signals like the more

837
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,640
did I have interfering, creating like a digital interference wall.

838
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,880
Right. And they can't hear me because everything in my house is electric.

839
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,320
Yeah, we could do some really good bits if any of us could do this.

840
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,600
Donald voice. We are ultimately.

841
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,440
I can't. I was like, I'm like, can I try because I can't.

842
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,160
Where we go when we go?

843
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,360
I don't know. Yes, it's it's it's.

844
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
But I can't talk like that. Yeah.

845
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,320
Yeah. Now it's like like staring at like a like a ramp that you're like,

846
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,280
do I try to hit this on the bike?

847
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,320
And I think I will fall. I think I'm going straight into that chasm.

848
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,760
It's yeah. Evil can evil.

849
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,240
And you've you've never made the jump. No.

850
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,600
Now, try you've tried three or four times.

851
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,720
I know you made it out alive those times.

852
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,520
And I guess I just don't want it bad enough.

853
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,000
Yeah. Worry of the Donald impression.

854
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,040
I guess chocolate detectors.

855
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,320
His chocolate detectors.

856
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,120
Jason, did you catch that?

857
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,760
I'm liking that.

858
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:28,000
Well, I think I think an important thing to point out is that the gadgets run amok.

859
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,840
And I think this was another common like thing of like, oh, yeah,

860
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,240
they have a bunch of gadgets.

861
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,960
These gadgets, they don't even work.

862
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,760
You know, this this goddamn thing, this answering machine,

863
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,360
it reads as many messages as it records, you know?

864
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:46,480
Yeah. But he also has untested technology like chocolate detectors.

865
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,600
Yeah. I mean, that's a he made that up, I think.

866
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,160
They're sort of implying he invents, but they don't really.

867
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,000
He's trying like beta versions of things, right?

868
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,280
Because he's bought so much.

869
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,120
So now the catalog entity is offering him experimental.

870
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,800
Right. What would how would it how would a chocolate detector work?

871
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,960
I mean, is there any way?

872
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,680
I would assume like a metal detector.

873
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,560
It would be more if you were near chocolate.

874
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,480
Yeah. Yeah.

875
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,880
That might be a nice tool to alert you.

876
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,880
But would it be a scent based?

877
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:19,160
Is there something in chocolate that would that you could use to detect?

878
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,080
Or would it just be like you needed a dog?

879
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,080
This is yeah.

880
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:27,440
And is it is a digital version really going to be better than the biological one

881
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,080
that many cartoon characters have where it pulls them?

882
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,280
Yeah, they just like there is

883
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,520
in probably more cases a pie and then they are just they are flying.

884
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:40,000
They just are are in flight without even making the choice.

885
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,440
Maybe this is a way for Donald to attempt to get those Yogi Bear powers,

886
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,440
which he doesn't inherently have.

887
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,480
Oh, right, right, right.

888
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,640
Why not try to be able to smell? Yeah.

889
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,440
From so far away.

890
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,800
Maybe Donald has no sense of smell.

891
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,240
And this is really a tragic tale.

892
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,680
Oh, wow.

893
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,560
Do ducks need them?

894
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,040
Ducks have a prominent.

895
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,640
That's a good.

896
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,160
That's a good.

897
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:03,800
Prominent bill.

898
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,960
But how are their olfactory abilities?

899
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,520
I don't know. That's a good question.

900
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,760
Yeah, I don't.

901
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,240
In a way, does he not have a nose at all?

902
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,960
What's the I don't know anything about duck biology.

903
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,720
Can ducks Jason Google can duck smell?

904
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,440
I already have can ducks have chocolate pulled up?

905
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,840
And the answer is yes.

906
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,160
Stock chocolate is toxic to dust to ducks.

907
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,880
So oh, so maybe it's an anti chocolate.

908
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,240
He's trying to make sure he isn't around.

909
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,680
He figured it out.

910
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,920
And especially if he's got goofy or Pluto who comes over.

911
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,840
That's going to be a bad news.

912
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,920
On a later album, the Disney characters address a scenario

913
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,080
where Minnie makes a cake and then it is dropped.

914
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,120
I believe the word womb is involved.

915
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,280
I think the song is called Womp There It Went.

916
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,360
Right. And which now I'm realizing is actually a tragic tale,

917
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,120
not because of the waste of a cake,

918
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,600
but because if a cake was dropped in front of you and you could not

919
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,680
have chocolate, it was toxic to you.

920
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,160
That'd be a nightmare scenario.

921
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,280
It's straight to the hospital.

922
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,880
Jason Google can mice eat chocolate?

923
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,320
Because goofy, Pluto and Donald cannot have chocolate.

924
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,960
So if the if the dogs can't.

925
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,160
Yeah, dogs cannot have chocolate.

926
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,200
I mean, if you have a little milk chocolate, it's not that big of a deal.

927
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,720
But you do not want them eating chocolate.

928
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,720
OK, this seems like half a chocolate chip

929
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,720
or a few shavings from a chocolate candy bar won't kill your mousy,

930
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,800
although it won't do anything to contribute to his nutrition either.

931
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,280
This from animals stop mom dot com.

932
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,680
The mom that they jam a dot mom in there before the dot com.

933
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,600
I know you're mousy.

934
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,960
I thought you were subscribed to chocolate is only poisonous to mice

935
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,200
in large enough amounts, so it is possible for you to still occasionally

936
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,040
feed your mouse. They should all of Mickey.

937
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,280
Minnie should not be having trouble.

938
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,400
They should not have chocolate.

939
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,200
Hmm. None of these characters.

940
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,560
Well, this is why they have to splash dance because right there.

941
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,760
Robbed of the great joy.

942
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,080
So the chocolate detector makes a lot of sense now.

943
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,800
We cannot have chocolate in this house.

944
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,080
Yeah, this is this is what saves the lives of the big six or whatever.

945
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,280
The big the fab six.

946
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,840
All right, let's get to that course that I called a high point.

947
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,000
Gadgets, even though they're all about the.

948
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,760
Did you do that?

949
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,800
Wow.

950
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,800
And what?

951
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,000
I don't know.

952
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,440
Oh, what?

953
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,400
I have a Larry's in front.

954
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,760
It's it. Oh, it's a digital peanut butter spreader.

955
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,560
Oh, OK.

956
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,920
I think all the animals can have that.

957
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:45,960
Yeah, I think that's OK.

958
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:46,680
Oh, yeah, that's fine.

959
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,440
Dogs can. Good.

960
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,160
You know, there there's a marshmallow.

961
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,040
Toaster specifically for marshmallows.

962
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,720
There's a gravity sandals to climb up the walls.

963
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,960
Yeah, that's that's that's huge.

964
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,280
That's a big one. That is cool.

965
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,440
But I assume it malfunctions from time to time.

966
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,080
So it's it's I would like to see it.

967
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,920
This is like something where I would like to see this illustrated.

968
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,120
It would make sense of this was like a music video.

969
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,520
Mm hmm. But it's not as far as we know.

970
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,000
But like Donald doing all this crap and hurting himself, you know,

971
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,360
we'd love to see it.

972
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,960
I'm so confused by this.

973
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,040
Oh, ranch dressing.

974
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,400
Your child did not want.

975
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,360
He wanted nuggets and then he no longer wanted nuggets.

976
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,520
So now we get nuggets.

977
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,320
Leaving the sin.

978
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,320
I wanted to take a look at some ranch dressing.

979
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,000
I just have it.

980
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,120
No, I delivered to us behind me.

981
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:40,520
Yes. All of a sudden, a plate of chicken nuggets and organic ranch dressing

982
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,680
was placed on the table.

983
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,480
I think I could have dealt with the plate, but the ranch dressing just threw me.

984
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,200
And I keep you saw me.

985
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,680
Listeners can hear like I'm trying to push through it, too.

986
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,960
I was like, you know, I'm going to be very professional.

987
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,200
I just keep talking.

988
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,520
It's one of those things where I was talking.

989
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,480
I don't even know what I was saying.

990
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,680
I was just like, I'm just keep talking here and we're going to get through this.

991
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,880
This ranch dressing situation.

992
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,160
No, when ranch dressing delivered to you, Jason's chicken nugget

993
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,040
detector went off in his bag.

994
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:08,120
Damn it. No, I was going to say she put it down next to your existing plate

995
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,920
of chicken nuggets that you always have going for the show.

996
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,640
Yeah. Humans can eat chicken nuggets.

997
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,040
So that's good.

998
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,400
I mean, hey, feel free.

999
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,800
During the episode, that's clearly what's

1000
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,600
we'd be rude to not share with the listeners.

1001
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,200
Listeners. Yeah.

1002
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,400
You can make it here now while we're recording this, which is impossible.

1003
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,400
You'll be hearing it later.

1004
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,920
But you would if you found us, you'd be welcome to chicken nuggets.

1005
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,960
And ranch. That's digital duck.

1006
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:42,640
The though I'm not in a rush to get on to hoedown at the robot farm.

1007
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,000
I'm not a big fan of hoedown.

1008
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,800
I'm not a robot arm, but Jason, I think I purely like it for the title.

1009
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,520
You know, it's a good title.

1010
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,840
It's goofy singing.

1011
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:57,680
I go down at the robot farm is the most like you had this track.

1012
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,600
You were trying to hit 11 tracks and you got it in here.

1013
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,480
You farmed out one track, which is notable.

1014
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,920
Hoedown at the robot farm in the next song, One Little Android.

1015
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,280
I not my favorite songs on this album.

1016
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,640
Let me say this.

1017
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:16,520
My notes about I made the space for if I had notes about one little Android

1018
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,600
and the only road I wrote down was hmm.

1019
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,160
Yeah, yeah. So I'll hear.

1020
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,720
I'll just give it 10 seconds of each.

1021
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,480
We can go.

1022
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,840
This is where I wrote down they should have called it robot.

1023
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,240
Through them.

1024
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:26,960
Right.

1025
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,400
Think yourself a partner with plenty of charm is a hoedown at the robot farm.

1026
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,880
Now, hoedown the robot firm at least has like goofy

1027
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,280
like square dance calling and stuff.

1028
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,760
So there's something there's that element is good.

1029
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,200
He says swing your robot. Yeah.

1030
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,400
So I think the robot farm is a place.

1031
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,920
It's like a like

1032
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,480
I think it's a dating scenario for I think.

1033
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:54,040
I think Goofy is has set up some kind of sex robot

1034
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,000
and that's where it loses.

1035
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,200
Like, you know, you kind of here's the mixer.

1036
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,680
You kind of you choose your robot, you swing your robot

1037
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,560
and then you see where things go.

1038
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,200
And I don't know how he got into the shade.

1039
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,120
You swing like not a literal swing.

1040
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,960
Swing is in part different partners.

1041
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,360
Well, I I'm not sure.

1042
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,280
I mean, I think it is.

1043
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,160
I take him at his word that it is a square dance scenario.

1044
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:19,240
But it is like, here's the fun part where we dance before we,

1045
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,080
you know, get a little wilder before we get wilder.

1046
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:26,440
I think that Goofy has been suckered by some shady organization.

1047
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:30,000
He's being abused of his celebrity status.

1048
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:34,520
He's like he's so he's dumb and he's honored

1049
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,960
that he's been asked to endorse something.

1050
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,400
And then he's landed. Now his face is on this

1051
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,600
this place that's frankly not safe in a number of ways.

1052
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,640
If there's a malfunction, if these robots go run amok,

1053
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,120
much like Donald's gadgets, then you're dead.

1054
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,960
And you're dead in like a situation.

1055
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,760
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1056
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,680
Hold on at the robot farm or you end up like what's is the T 1000

1057
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:03,040
that you get like suddenly like a big like metal spike through your head.

1058
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,720
You're just trying to have innocent sex with a robot.

1059
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,840
Anything could go wrong.

1060
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,400
You know, your robot army could be defeated by a child

1061
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,640
that flies a star speeder into the central like nervous system

1062
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,000
of the control for like Phantom Menace, Anakin Skywalker.

1063
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,600
We need to feed the entire battle droid army.

1064
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,520
And they all shut down.

1065
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,840
They all shut down. Yeah, that could happen.

1066
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,120
Yeah. And they like clamp.

1067
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,400
They clamp down on your dick.

1068
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,800
Right. Then they shut down in the auto

1069
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,480
the shut off mode.

1070
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,040
Scrimmage. You would hope.

1071
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,720
OK, look, you would hope if you had a sex robot, that there is some fail

1072
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:44,280
safes to not like it's not going to just close it down like it's,

1073
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,760
you know, chopping it.

1074
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,120
Not like an airlock, like the way that people characters die in movies

1075
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,440
all the time because the airlock. Right.

1076
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,040
It cuts it. And now people now people are in like they get sucked into space

1077
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,200
or they're in a room where all the disease is.

1078
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,320
I don't want that to happen.

1079
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:01,680
You cannot. If let me just give this advice to future sex robot builders.

1080
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,760
You cannot even have that as possibility.

1081
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,320
No, if anything, it's got to be an airbag.

1082
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:12,480
This has to be a situation where something soft, such as people

1083
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,840
are going to get permanently damaged down there.

1084
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,960
Write it down if you're working on it.

1085
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,000
It can't be any thoughts on this one.

1086
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,200
Well, you know, I'm just thinking it could be a valuable way

1087
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,520
to teach people lesson about the hubris of man.

1088
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,200
Oh, no. You're clamping.

1089
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:35,280
Yeah, I might be taking a serling approach where it's just like folly.

1090
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:39,240
So you want to like play like the play dough thing where you just can cut it off

1091
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,960
and it'll fall.

1092
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,600
You know what I'm talking about?

1093
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,920
Oh, yeah. When you're slicing up like a play dough,

1094
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,960
they all eat like a bit of spaghetti or something.

1095
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,680
So you'll say it'll be like

1096
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,440
like an episode of HBO's perversions of science.

1097
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,440
You want to teach a lesson.

1098
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,840
I'm baffled by that one.

1099
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,320
But that HBO is just the real.

1100
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,120
No, no, I think that's a real show.

1101
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,880
It's the name of science.

1102
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,000
OK, do we not?

1103
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,480
If I never brought up the HBO Max featuring.

1104
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,840
Perversion of science.

1105
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:09,760
Yes, I am correct.

1106
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,680
This is the name of it.

1107
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,560
1997.

1108
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,600
This is a real.

1109
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,840
Danny Elfman.

1110
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,400
Whoa. Original Network HBO.

1111
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,920
Your brain was a sponge at this time for Sebastian

1112
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,360
Jackles and Deadly Games and perversions.

1113
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,080
Well, there is an episode of Crimes of the Future.

1114
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,560
Eastern promises perversions of science.

1115
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,720
There is classic Cronenberg.

1116
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,040
There is an episode of perversions of science starring Mr.

1117
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,240
Kevin Pollock about a sex robot.

1118
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,840
Is it him or is it Christopher Walken?

1119
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:45,920
My memory is it's him, but I maybe I wouldn't know in 97.

1120
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,840
Wait, so this is like an anthology.

1121
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,840
This is like a Twilight Zone kind of thing.

1122
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:53,440
Yes. I feel like Shatner was on one, but maybe that's a different anthology.

1123
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,240
Shatner and whoever Melanie Shatner is daughter.

1124
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,080
Probably daughter, but who knows, could be wife daughter.

1125
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:03,920
But Perversions of Science was like a sexy anthology show with like,

1126
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,080
I assume, some sort of morality component, but maybe that wasn't part of it.

1127
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:11,240
Oh, my God. There's one with Vincent Shiavelli, that crazy guy from Batman

1128
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:15,200
Returns that were like insane bulbous man, the character actor.

1129
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,760
And then ghost to be sent to another plane of existence

1130
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,880
where his murdered wife may still be alive.

1131
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,320
Murdered wife played by Elizabeth Berkley.

1132
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,840
Oh, my God. Where is the show been?

1133
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,200
All my favorite actors.

1134
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,880
I mean, look, is this a great show?

1135
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,400
Ray Newman, Needy McClurg, every episode I look at, it gets better and better.

1136
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,320
Let me read you the synopsis of the of the Kevin Pollock episode

1137
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:41,640
called Boxed in Sex Farce about a horny, faithful space ace who,

1138
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,240
after several years, finally arrives home for a tryst with his fiance.

1139
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:50,280
Unfortunately, her admiral dad forces them to wait until marriage.

1140
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,920
I think that's Shatner.

1141
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,760
Our admiral dad forces them to wait until marriage.

1142
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,320
So the pilot decides to use a sex bot.

1143
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,680
Big mistake.

1144
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,280
So these are written by David Goyer.

1145
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,040
Wow. Oh, my God.

1146
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,040
Toby Hooper directed. Wow.

1147
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,680
All right. We got to hang. OK, OK.

1148
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,360
We got to calm down. Barry Williams.

1149
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,440
Oh, my God. Every day I'm in blue in this Wikipedia.

1150
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:15,920
I was with somebody.

1151
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,120
It makes me want to stomp around the DuckTales theme.

1152
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,200
All I'll say is I was with somebody two days ago said,

1153
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,560
oh, I got to call Barry Williams and I'll tell you off. Oh, man.

1154
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:30,280
I think I've alluded to the fact that I could think I can get Barry Williams'

1155
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,360
phone number very easily. Whoa.

1156
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,680
Yeah, I don't want to brag.

1157
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,080
It's the most obvious.

1158
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:38,000
You see, you don't think my Rolodex is any good.

1159
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,360
I want you to skim down to W.

1160
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,880
Notice it.

1161
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,880
Recognize it. OK.

1162
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,200
One little Android.

1163
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,360
I have nothing to say.

1164
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,560
I wrote down I'm not a fan.

1165
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,440
Why don't we like one little Android?

1166
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,800
Because this one's the kid like this is just like a like a

1167
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,520
fell down and then we were.

1168
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,520
It's a.

1169
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,680
Sing along day.

1170
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,840
Yeah, this is a perfect song for kids.

1171
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1172
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,200
And the noises are good.

1173
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,800
The music is good, but it's like a little it's slow

1174
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,720
and there's not much going on.

1175
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,920
How many lyrics? Not much of a narrative in place.

1176
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,680
Yeah, boring. Yeah, yeah.

1177
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:21,280
Now the next track, Chippendales vacation.

1178
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,880
This has a real this this intro, you know, I it.

1179
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:28,200
I don't love hearing chipmunks sing.

1180
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,160
I'm going to be honest.

1181
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,720
I don't like I'm not dying to hear a lot of Alvin and the chipmunks

1182
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,200
covers or anything.

1183
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,880
So it loses me when vocals kick it.

1184
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:40,440
But this intro is this is real peppy. Yes.

1185
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:45,560
Wow.

1186
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,960
On vacation.

1187
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,240
My name is just one.

1188
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,240
We want to check the life.

1189
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,840
I watched the show.

1190
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,960
I just like fantastic.

1191
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,120
Yeah, they trip the light fantastic.

1192
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,240
That's stuck out to me.

1193
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,160
That in Mary Poppins returns.

1194
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,560
What's that? Isn't that a song in Mary Poppins returns?

1195
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,840
It might be thinking of that sounds right.

1196
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,760
I mean, it's just a phrase for dancing.

1197
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,760
There's a hat when this stuff hat go.

1198
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,120
The one that the notes go like half step up.

1199
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,600
I'm in heaven.

1200
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,560
If I mean like it's like, I don't know.

1201
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,000
I should really I'm not.

1202
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,320
My band is going to be upset that I didn't explain that better.

1203
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,160
I like when.

1204
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,880
This is what I'm talking about.

1205
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,520
Here we go.

1206
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,320
Done done.

1207
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,600
I said, and then it fully goes full steps.

1208
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,800
And it's very satisfying.

1209
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:01,320
I like when they each sing what they like and then they both start singing.

1210
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,960
Yeah, I was.

1211
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:03,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1212
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,040
I was too hard on their vocals.

1213
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,080
I think this is a good song.

1214
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,080
I was also I heard was listening to it yesterday and I go at first.

1215
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,040
I go, I don't know.

1216
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,960
And then by minute and I go, that's good.

1217
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,240
Yeah, I like it.

1218
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,000
I think it is a catchy song.

1219
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,520
It probably.

1220
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1221
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:20,560
That's a blast.

1222
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:25,600
You know, since that was a big hit of fun synth sounds, let me say

1223
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,960
my favorite thing that I discovered about this album.

1224
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:33,520
So these people who composed most of the songs, but not all Michael and Patty Silvershire.

1225
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,400
So they owned a keyboard store in Palo Alto.

1226
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,880
This is where they came from.

1227
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,520
So they would sell keyboards, but they also had early access to keyboards

1228
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,280
that were not being used everywhere.

1229
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:47,320
And they were particularly a fan of Yamaha keyboards.

1230
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:52,560
So they would make demos in their off time and then send them to Yamaha.

1231
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,240
Hey, what do you think?

1232
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,480
We use your keyboards only and we love them.

1233
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,160
Yamaha got in touch with them and said, you get better sounds out of our stuff

1234
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,440
than anybody we've heard.

1235
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,840
This stuff is amazing.

1236
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,640
What can we do for you?

1237
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,280
So they Yamaha started like put them in some artist development program

1238
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,800
and may have even made the connection to Disney or like giving them a little bit

1239
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,760
of money to make stuff that got Disney's attention ultimately.

1240
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,360
So that's the big thing with these people.

1241
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:19,080
Like they wrote fun songs and I think it's Michael who's singing on a lot of them.

1242
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:25,440
But the like the the the Yamaha aspect of it can't be overlooked.

1243
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,840
So they start recording this album proper.

1244
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,040
They're doing it at a Yamaha facility in Glendale.

1245
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,520
That's where this was recorded.

1246
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:38,440
Not a recording studio, but like a Yamaha plant, essentially.

1247
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:42,440
Where they are developing their new synth technology.

1248
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:48,200
And so they are they're literally like things are coming off the presses and handed to them.

1249
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,560
Hey, we have this new thing.

1250
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,680
Do you want to use it?

1251
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:54,080
And the biggest one of these was we've got this new keyboard.

1252
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,520
We're dying for people to use it.

1253
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,600
It's called the DX7, the Yamaha DX7.

1254
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,480
This is where I'm sent nerding out a little bit.

1255
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,280
Have you ever heard of the DX7?

1256
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:03,000
Is that a great thing?

1257
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,040
But major basically what happened is please use this.

1258
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,360
We need somebody to use it.

1259
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,360
This is 1983.

1260
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,640
The keyboard is brand new.

1261
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:14,920
So most of the sounds on this album are the Yamaha DX7.

1262
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:19,240
Within three years, it is the dominant keyboard on pop radio.

1263
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,960
It's so much of what anybody likes from that era.

1264
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:31,240
There's literally I saw like in 1986, they was on this keyboard was on 40 percent of the number one songs that year.

1265
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:35,480
So and at the time it was only this weird Disney kids.

1266
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,800
It was only Chip and Dale's vacation.

1267
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,400
Just to shout out a couple uses of it.

1268
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,920
It's a lot of like 80s ballad electric piano.

1269
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:45,920
That's that's a lot of it.

1270
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,520
Chicago hard habit to break or Whitney Houston.

1271
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,760
It's a big sign. I forget what against all odds.

1272
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,360
Phil Collins song.

1273
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,080
If OK, the very beginning of danger zone,

1274
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:02,560
but really, I think the base that is one of the big DX7 things is the really plunky base,

1275
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:07,440
which is also another part of me, the Michael Jackson song in Captain EO,

1276
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,320
Mr. Mr. Broken Wings that has the

1277
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,360
take on me is the big one that cracks it open.

1278
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:21,200
So like this thing is just all over all these incredibly iconic songs,

1279
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:25,560
including and one that I found yesterday as I'm digging down the rabbit hole,

1280
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:30,840
something I complained about on the show once that then then was a gripe.

1281
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,720
Then somebody was mad that I complained about.

1282
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,760
I complained about what I think is kind of a dopey keyboard solo

1283
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:39,640
on what's love got to do, right, right, which has this sudden harmonica.

1284
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:47,280
But I found out that is the Amadeus, that is the harmonica preset on the DX7.

1285
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:50,200
So things that I love, things that I find kind of goofy,

1286
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,640
but I like that that person said, hey, why don't you shut up and enjoy it?

1287
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:58,040
Just enjoy the goofiness of the and isn't that what all these sounds are on?

1288
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,880
Splash dance is some of its legit good.

1289
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:05,040
And then there's all these bloops and blips that are sometimes silly.

1290
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,720
Not every song is great, but that seems like the spirit

1291
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,480
of this great iconic keyboard, the Amadeus seven.

1292
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,520
Some dope and some silly, but it's all fun.

1293
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:18,160
I was just taking a look on eBay and I think those go for like seven fifty.

1294
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:23,200
But I have a my grandmother had an like a keyboard synth

1295
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,120
in the 80s in a basement that I have now and it still works.

1296
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,520
And that's a PSS four seventy.

1297
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:33,320
Yes, that's four seventy, which is similar.

1298
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,840
I think that the other one is like a higher end model.

1299
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,480
This was more of a like casual one.

1300
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:43,080
But some of the sounds on this I could I could make with this old piece of equipment.

1301
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,440
I almost use this to make the McGruff album,

1302
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:50,200
but then I could not figure out a way the music wasn't popping enough.

1303
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,560
And again, I'm not a good mixer producer.

1304
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,840
And I was like, it's going to be too tough to like make this like

1305
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,840
give yourself the digital crutch like there are the the analog.

1306
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,400
I guess it was not analog, it's a digital.

1307
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:07,720
Yeah, but it'd rather just go straight into the Pro Tools or whatever you're using.

1308
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,840
Yeah. And I was using like logic and stuff.

1309
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:13,560
But in a in another in another multiverse,

1310
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:17,320
there was a scenario where I would make a splash dance song for the episode today.

1311
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:20,160
But it's a busy, busy couple of weeks.

1312
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:23,320
Yeah, so but maybe in the future, if there's yeah.

1313
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:26,360
Hey, if you can find some sounds, yeah, dig into that.

1314
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,760
I bet there's some stuff in the family.

1315
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:32,240
Yeah, I have I have a little demo stuff to from this as well.

1316
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,440
So, oh, boy, great.

1317
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,360
Yeah, I would love to hear some stuff in the spirit of splash dance,

1318
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,200
because what a delight.

1319
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,600
And I think side two is maybe superior to what I think.

1320
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:43,040
I think the best stuff is coming.

1321
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,000
Yes, for sure. Including.

1322
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,200
Well, here we go.

1323
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,360
After that big tear about stuff that I like.

1324
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:53,720
Now we've landed on fucking Sparks, one of my favorite bands in the world.

1325
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:58,520
The only outside artist, I think, on this album, sort of inexplicably.

1326
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,840
With the song Minnie Mouse.

1327
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,160
That was a good talk.

1328
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,960
All is just a house.

1329
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,320
What a house.

1330
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:34,480
Minnie, Minnie, I like Minnie.

1331
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,680
Wonderful. Yeah, wonderful.

1332
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,000
What do you guys think of this song as not as like

1333
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,720
not as big of Sparks heads?

1334
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,240
How does it as this hit you?

1335
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:51,640
Yeah, Yellowstone, I have been every year meaning to get way into Sparks.

1336
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:54,920
I will. It's a big blind spot for me.

1337
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,920
I kind of always knew them as like

1338
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:01,920
the Velvet Underground or Joy Division of like influenced a lot of what came after.

1339
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,440
You know, yeah, yeah.

1340
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,240
I ran into that.

1341
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,840
I didn't know they were advertising that movie, the Edgar Wright

1342
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,600
documentary as your favorite band's favorite band.

1343
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,400
Yeah, and that does.

1344
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:15,000
I they were my favorite band when I was a middle schooler.

1345
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,080
But that sounds like very early.

1346
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,040
They might be a giant.

1347
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,200
Like it feels like there's a story line.

1348
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,280
Yeah, they're compared a lot in terms of and I don't know.

1349
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:25,440
They might be giants at all,

1350
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:29,840
but they're compared in terms of idiosyncratic themselves,

1351
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:34,120
no matter how much times they cover a zillion genres, that kind of thing.

1352
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,720
Yeah, they're like smart, funny guys.

1353
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:37,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1354
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,520
You can get that. And then, yeah.

1355
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:45,200
Which funny is a tough area if you're like it's always a dicey zone for our.

1356
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:50,080
It feels like either we want our music serious or we want it to be weird, Al.

1357
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:52,400
And it's just all the way funny. Yes.

1358
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:55,840
Occupying the middle space is because it makes you go, is this a joke?

1359
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,160
Is it a novelty?

1360
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,560
And I think people are always weirded out by this.

1361
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,560
I mean, because they're they are weird.

1362
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:03,680
They look weird.

1363
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,840
They've always been pretty aggressively weird.

1364
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,280
What I love about them.

1365
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:11,040
I mean, when I first looked them up, I think a few years ago,

1366
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:13,640
you guys saw them, is that right?

1367
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:18,280
What do you see? Yeah, I saw them at the Ace Hotel in 2015.

1368
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:19,240
That was the first time I saw them.

1369
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,840
And then I saw the trailer for that documentary.

1370
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:26,120
And I am sure people who don't know, I mean, I had to look it up.

1371
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:29,920
But one of them has a mustache is called a duster.

1372
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:34,440
It is a style mustache that was popular in the early 20th century.

1373
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:39,840
And the notable thing about that kind of mustache is it's just a little bit longer

1374
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:43,360
than a Hitler mustache. And I was like, what's going on here?

1375
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,880
Oh, are these guys pretty? Is this a British joke?

1376
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,920
It's like a John Waters kind of.

1377
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:48,960
Yeah, it's kind of like a job.

1378
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,000
That's a little longer way to.

1379
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,640
Yeah, that might be his style today.

1380
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,680
Yeah, that as well.

1381
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,680
What's that little Richard had that kind of thing?

1382
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,760
He had a little little pencil thin. Yeah.

1383
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,960
Well, so he's run both kinds of upsetting.

1384
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,720
But since he's done it, yeah.

1385
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:04,720
Oh, that's true. Yeah.

1386
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,760
Yeah. The pencil thin.

1387
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,720
Yeah. These are provocative mustaches.

1388
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,920
Jimmy Buffett song pencil thin mustache.

1389
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,160
He has a pencil thin mustache.

1390
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,640
I wish I had a pencil thin mustache.

1391
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,240
You want to stop in you, Jimmy?

1392
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:20,200
Go for it like Boston Black did. Mm hmm.

1393
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,560
Like pulp detective character Boston Blackie.

1394
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,280
Oh, of course. Of course.

1395
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,560
We all know. Yeah.

1396
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:30,160
It's like, well, that's yeah, that's that's Ron Mayall.

1397
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,960
It's brothers Ron and Russell.

1398
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:36,400
Ron is the mercurial, mostly silent keyboard player

1399
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,760
with a Hitler mustache for a long time.

1400
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:45,880
The Russell, the singer who very androgynous

1401
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,920
sounding for a long time, a little less so now,

1402
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,560
but he's always been falsetto, just the early stuff.

1403
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:54,880
You I mean, like it's very common for people to think it's a woman singing.

1404
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:59,080
And it was in kind of a glam rock era initially.

1405
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:06,720
A great part of that documentary is when John Lennon tells someone about Sparks.

1406
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:07,920
It's someone else impressive.

1407
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:12,080
And I can't recall now, but John was like, did you did you watch

1408
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,880
Top of the Pops last night?

1409
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,280
Mark Bolan was playing with Adolf Hitler.

1410
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:19,080
It's a pretty good breakdown.

1411
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,200
Mark Bolan of T-Rex.

1412
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:24,360
Yeah. So like glam guy mixed with silent

1413
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:29,720
Hitler, who just glares, who's just joyless and remains such

1414
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:33,480
it's a great part of their show now that he gets up and dances once

1415
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:37,400
and he's very tall and imposing and he's like Frankenstein.

1416
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:40,360
Or so that when he walks to center stage, it's kind of upsetting.

1417
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,120
Like, what's he going to do?

1418
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,880
And then like it loosens the tie.

1419
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:46,120
It's a big process, a big procedure.

1420
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:51,200
And then just does the most like simple, big flailing arm dance

1421
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,840
you ever seen. Everybody loses their shit.

1422
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:54,880
There's so much fun.

1423
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,280
I don't want to just go on and on.

1424
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:58,040
Oh, of course I want to go on and on.

1425
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,000
This is the opportunity.

1426
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,040
But let's talk about Minnie Mouse specifically.

1427
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:04,080
Oh, yeah. A spin off song, I guess you could say.

1428
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,720
That's correct. Yeah.

1429
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:09,040
So they did an album in the early 80s called Angst in My Pants,

1430
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,760
which has my favorite album cover of theirs where they're getting married.

1431
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,520
It's a nice brother wedding.

1432
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,000
It's very, very touching.

1433
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:21,520
And that is a song called Mickey Mouse, which I also highly recommend.

1434
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,400
Odds. Both songs are kind of like not.

1435
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,520
You almost imagine they wrote them with their vague knowledge of the characters.

1436
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,240
They are not exactly like, yeah, here's everything we know,

1437
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:36,520
especially Minnie Mouse feels like, all right, let's figure out how to intellectualize

1438
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,240
based on one foot. What do we know about her?

1439
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,520
She's a mouse. She's an address.

1440
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,840
She dates Mickey Mouse. She looks good.

1441
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,280
Yeah. Yeah. Mm hmm.

1442
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,800
Friendly. Nice. Nice.

1443
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:51,160
Yes. So Mickey Mouse, this very odd song on this early 80s

1444
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:55,720
and the album of theirs, Disney is initially upset about it

1445
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,680
and maybe thinking about how can we squash this?

1446
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:02,680
But then it starts getting some local airplay in L.A.

1447
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:06,800
They are they realize, oh, this might be a good thing for us, actually.

1448
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,440
As Russell said, if it helps them advertise their theme parks,

1449
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,160
suddenly they're into it.

1450
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:14,920
So this album was brewing at the time and they said, hey, would you want to do?

1451
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,760
Is there a companion song?

1452
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:19,880
Do you have anything else like, I don't know, Minnie Mouse?

1453
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:24,760
And they were like, how can we do this without breaking the bank creatively?

1454
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,000
All right, let's do exactly what they said.

1455
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,920
Let's make a song about Minnie Mouse, which is very delightful.

1456
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:34,280
This thing otherwise is like kind of a genuine.

1457
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,800
Let's make a nice album for kids.

1458
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,880
And then in this case, it's these like very subversive artists.

1459
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,920
They're like, how can we play Disney for some money? Sure.

1460
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,360
Which seems like a lot of their careers, like,

1461
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,880
how do we get our weird shit into movies and kind of keep this odd little engine

1462
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:56,840
afloat? So hats off to them for playing Disney, for reversing their initial.

1463
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:01,040
It is funny. Dislike of it like Devo does Disney stuff and then like

1464
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:04,560
they might be giants as a kid album, children's album.

1465
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,760
Yeah, there are two.

1466
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,800
Well, and they do the cover.

1467
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:10,680
OK, let me see if I can get this right off the top of the head.

1468
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,080
They might be giants to a cover of Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow

1469
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:18,560
that is on the soundtrack of that

1470
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:22,920
spacey CG animated Disney movie.

1471
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,760
Is it called Meet the Robinson?

1472
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,160
Oh, really? Yeah.

1473
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,400
Oh, that's weird. OK.

1474
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:33,000
So all these like similar kind of guys ended up with Disney.

1475
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:35,560
So well, it's a way to. Yeah.

1476
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:38,560
It's a way to make some dough for our band that doesn't like a lower

1477
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,600
naturally make a zillion dollars every year.

1478
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:42,200
It's a good point.

1479
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:45,040
Which that's what I love about all of the bands that you've listed.

1480
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:48,120
These are all like they are not like meant to be like these are not.

1481
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:52,760
This isn't what big bands are like, but they they stay afloat and they stay weird.

1482
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,880
And I love them. I got to see Sparta.

1483
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:58,960
It was my first concert back after all this time at the Disney concert

1484
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,480
all earlier this year.

1485
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,280
It was so emotional.

1486
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,920
The standing ovation went on forever.

1487
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,760
There's so much love in the rent, so much like we've missed you

1488
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:11,240
and we appreciate we love that you are like at a career height now

1489
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:14,440
with your documentary and with Annette, this big movie

1490
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:17,160
that they're spiking 50 years in.

1491
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,600
They will. I love them so much.

1492
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,600
I do that anyway. All I have to say, check out Sparks.

1493
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:25,080
And if this song may mess, it did kick Sparks back open for me

1494
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,160
because I knew a couple of the big I knew.

1495
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:31,520
Come on to my house, the big glam album and the Georgia Marauder sent the album.

1496
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:32,960
But I didn't know a lot.

1497
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:37,280
And then I stumbled on to Minnie Mouse and I was like, wait a sec.

1498
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:42,440
Because I didn't know about kind of the early 80s, kind of like breakfast club era.

1499
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,840
Like they have a song in Valley Girl, I believe.

1500
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,360
And then that was my way back in.

1501
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:50,800
And now I'm into like, oh, my God, I've missed like 17 albums that rule.

1502
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,560
So I credit Minnie Mouse for that.

1503
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:56,120
I wouldn't call it like one of their top 50 songs,

1504
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:59,240
but it has everything you want out of them, I think.

1505
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,000
And it's catchy and odd.

1506
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,440
And I don't know.

1507
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,680
But but also, I do I have blinders on is Minnie Mouse,

1508
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:09,120
an album low light, and I am missing it.

1509
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,440
No, it's not a low light.

1510
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:13,800
I will say I think I like the next two songs a little better.

1511
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,040
Oh, sure.

1512
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,440
I mean, we're coming up. Oh, I love the next two songs.

1513
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,280
This is just a great block of an album.

1514
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:22,600
Yeah, yeah. So so no, it's up.

1515
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:23,760
It's up and it's the second.

1516
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,880
It's toward the top of the songs I like in the album, for sure.

1517
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,400
Yeah, yeah.

1518
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,360
That line about that.

1519
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,840
You could say she's just a mouse, just a mouse.

1520
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,760
The Taj Mahal is just a house.

1521
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,200
What a house. Yeah, yeah.

1522
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:39,880
And the discussion of her dress, where did you get that dress?

1523
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,280
It's Parisian, I would guess.

1524
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:46,040
That's where I'm really like they looked at a picture is what they did.

1525
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,680
What do we what do we possibly how can we do?

1526
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,960
All right, we can get a stanza out of her dress.

1527
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,560
That's one fact that we know about her.

1528
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:54,760
Pretty good rhyme.

1529
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,200
They class her.

1530
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,320
This is, I think, a very classy portrayal.

1531
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:00,880
As is look, as is the next.

1532
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,080
So this is kind of the mini block. Right.

1533
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:05,120
That's true. Album, I would say.

1534
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,440
She really gets the time to shine, if not time to sing.

1535
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,120
But you're thinking about her. Yeah.

1536
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,160
She looms. She's on your mind.

1537
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,200
She was. I mean, she's always on my mind.

1538
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,440
That's what I think. But that's another story.

1539
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,040
What you always on my mind.

1540
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,880
How do you how do you feel about this next one?

1541
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,080
I love this song. Oh, boy.

1542
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:24,160
Mickey, she's got a question.

1543
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,400
It's all the time. This has come up before.

1544
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:27,560
This was in some special.

1545
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:31,360
We talked about it. I don't remember why, but it's that they do a version of it

1546
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,240
in some parade or something or other.

1547
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:36,920
But this is one of those also that you might know outside of the album.

1548
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,360
You want to you want to get a quick hit of it? Sure.

1549
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:07,400
I mean, does it get any better than that?

1550
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,360
Just basic.

1551
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:11,160
I feel like the Olivia Newton, John of it.

1552
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,000
I feel like Laura Branigan.

1553
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:18,360
This is just like a nice girl song from early 80s.

1554
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,560
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

1555
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,440
That's one of the best.

1556
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,360
You can tell that this keyboard is going to have pop dominance.

1557
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,960
Yeah. Off of that, if it can do stuff as catchy as that.

1558
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:32,880
Does how does it make you feel given your feelings about Minnie Mouse?

1559
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,560
Mick Mick is kind of a nickname for Michael.

1560
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:39,760
So you could call me Mickey.

1561
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,920
It's not out of the realm of possibility.

1562
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:46,960
So can I listen to this and imagine this lady is singing to me?

1563
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:52,240
You know, Michael, would it be better if she said my full name?

1564
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:53,800
That's not my birth certificate. Yes.

1565
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,200
But I can I can dream.

1566
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,400
Yeah, she's got it.

1567
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,560
She's like just this.

1568
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,720
It's like I'm imagining this woman is my friend.

1569
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:04,400
And she's like, come on, man, don't you see it?

1570
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,240
She's into you. Don't you get it, man?

1571
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:10,520
What Minnie Mouse? Are you crazy?

1572
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,920
Why don't I go to the moon or something?

1573
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:13,880
That's impossible.

1574
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:16,520
But a girl like Minnie would never be the guy like me.

1575
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,960
I mean, I'm a letterman jacket in this scenario.

1576
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,560
We're by my locker.

1577
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,160
And this letterman jacket has the marching band

1578
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:25,320
on the one breast.

1579
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,760
Well, it is tennis and marching.

1580
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:28,760
And it's a guy. Yeah.

1581
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,560
And then this will this girl, who's my friend,

1582
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,000
who's secretly in love with me, but I don't even know it.

1583
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,520
She's telling me about many.

1584
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,520
Yeah, I was going to say this song.

1585
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:41,560
It's like, oh, it would be a lot easier for us when we were young and stupid.

1586
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:45,120
If we've had written songs about who had crushes on us.

1587
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,400
It would, you know, it would have been a lot better even.

1588
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:51,000
Yes, because I was actively avoiding anyone who had a crush on me.

1589
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:55,080
Yeah, I think I imagine that this is how it would work,

1590
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:59,640
is that there would be a middle person who would spell it out.

1591
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:03,440
Yeah, I will always at any time and that, no, you're not going to have to

1592
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:07,880
feel out the vibes yourself, potentially land on your face.

1593
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:12,960
I like if only if only this song could have existed for us to point us

1594
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:18,920
in the direction of people that we dated or wanted to date or in your case, mice.

1595
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,880
It would have been high school would have been a lot easier

1596
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:26,120
if there were multiple songs explaining things to me.

1597
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:27,440
How did this?

1598
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,920
Mickey, here's how you kiss a girl.

1599
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,800
Here's how you kiss.

1600
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,280
Here's how you kiss a girl.

1601
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:35,720
What's the rest of that?

1602
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:39,360
Yeah, let me let me show you on this doll.

1603
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:41,720
Mickey, let me show you on the doll.

1604
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:46,720
You don't need to worry about what you're worrying about.

1605
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:48,480
It's not real.

1606
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:52,160
Your parents were just watching the local news too late and couldn't sleep.

1607
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,000
Yeah.

1608
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:58,920
Scott, don't waste your high school years on this long distance relationship.

1609
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,400
It's an excuse to not date in real life.

1610
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,280
These are these are all been very helpful.

1611
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,080
Yeah.

1612
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:11,080
What? Why did this has come up before?

1613
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,800
Do you remember the context of the song?

1614
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:17,560
Yeah, I think it's that it's in some special act it out in something.

1615
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,800
I can't recall what, though.

1616
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:20,880
Yeah, we definitely thought.

1617
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:22,240
We need to.

1618
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:24,920
Yeah, there's a little like sketch essentially.

1619
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:27,880
I don't I don't remember what or why we we watched it.

1620
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:30,920
But yeah, this again, this one like Happy Birthday

1621
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,880
kind of remained in the in the family a little bit.

1622
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,800
Yeah, they ended up with this nice pile of like updated songs.

1623
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:39,200
So we have things that aren't high.

1624
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,520
Ho, we've got I love that they're trying.

1625
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:47,280
Let's can we get some new Disney classics and standards into the mix here in 1983?

1626
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,440
And it almost works.

1627
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:49,680
These had legs for a little while.

1628
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,440
I think we've forgotten them now a bit.

1629
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,840
It doesn't have.

1630
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:56,360
Contempt is too strong of a word,

1631
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:00,160
but doesn't have the indifference to the Mickey rap album.

1632
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:03,160
Like the Mickey rap album feels very.

1633
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:04,920
What's the word? Yeah.

1634
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:09,040
Crass trying to take advantage of a moment.

1635
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,360
Crass is probably right.

1636
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:13,520
Sending. Yeah, condescending is probably like.

1637
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:14,280
What does he say?

1638
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:18,480
Mickey even on there, he's like, clean music squeaky squeaky clean.

1639
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,440
That's really patronizing.

1640
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:24,360
Just as as hair away from going rap more like crap.

1641
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:27,160
You know, here's how it's really done.

1642
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:30,160
This is what you need. It's one.

1643
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:31,120
I'm that's it, though.

1644
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,240
They don't have disdain.

1645
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,000
I mean, that's the other way.

1646
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,120
It's like we have to do a rap thing now.

1647
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:38,920
Somebody told us as opposed to we found this nice couple

1648
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:43,600
who sing so genuinely and who really care about getting cool sounds out of Yamaha.

1649
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:47,160
Let's take advantage of this and make some happy songs for the kids.

1650
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:48,920
Yes, it is. It feels.

1651
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:51,400
Yeah, it feels it feels pure, whether it was or not.

1652
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,200
Yeah, yeah.

1653
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,920
We just have to feel that way.

1654
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,720
Just like love.

1655
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,400
Like it could be not true, true.

1656
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,560
But as long as it feels that way, that's a lesson I should have learned.

1657
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:02,800
Yeah, great. Yeah.

1658
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:06,000
It could be a total sham, but if it feels all right, feels good.

1659
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:11,200
You know what? Love, love always starts with one of the two people

1660
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:14,520
being totally indifferent to you.

1661
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:17,400
Continue to pursue them through their indifference.

1662
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:19,880
We'll eventually do a 180 turn.

1663
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:23,120
All the media you've consumed has led you to that where you're supposed

1664
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:25,320
to like pine for someone for months.

1665
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,560
And destroy yourself.

1666
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:30,560
It's not that most media is written by people who used to be fucking losers.

1667
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:31,600
And now they're rich.

1668
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,920
They're writing the fantasies they didn't have.

1669
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:36,560
Yeah, that was a long tear in the Mickey voice.

1670
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,800
Yeah, you got it.

1671
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,160
Yeah, you ass whore.

1672
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,760
You ass whore.

1673
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:44,440
You losers.

1674
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:50,680
I'm going to talk about Gyro Gear Loose.

1675
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:51,160
Oh, yeah.

1676
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:55,480
Which again, it's tough on an album with Sparks and my favorite bands

1677
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:59,760
that it is possible that this lands at number one for me.

1678
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:03,920
And this has come up before listeners might recall that this is a song

1679
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,080
that I have genuine emotions about.

1680
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:09,520
Mm hmm. I feel I feel feelings about this.

1681
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:12,360
I don't know what they are exactly or why.

1682
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:15,640
Like lyrically, I don't understand why I have so many because I don't.

1683
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:20,960
It's a song about a Ducktales character who exists only in comic form at this time.

1684
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:24,840
Right. So why am I so moved by the tale of Gyro Gear Loose?

1685
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,800
And I think it's I think it's that music.

1686
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:27,360
Hmm.

1687
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:00,800
Oh,

1688
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:01,760
shiny line.

1689
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,120
It's so sincere.

1690
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,320
I'm just rolling this through.

1691
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:10,560
Yeah.

1692
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,000
It's a no rush.

1693
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,160
This is a thinky song.

1694
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:18,400
We're not driving to that chorus.

1695
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:22,640
We don't even have drums yet.

1696
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:24,000
Are you crying yet, listener?

1697
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,640
Crazy car.

1698
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:38,960
Digitators and solar skates that glow in the dark.

1699
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:42,560
Is escalator sneakers once you've.

1700
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,120
Good base.

1701
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,320
And it's a bumpy base.

1702
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,560
Up and down.

1703
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:47,920
So folksy.

1704
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:48,880
I do.

1705
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:54,320
I makes a teaching feel also in people's sleep.

1706
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,520
They learn to spell.

1707
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,760
Instead of counting.

1708
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:02,240
There we go.

1709
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:14,720
Wow.

1710
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:15,920
Now they're just cutting loose.

1711
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:22,400
I mean.

1712
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:22,560
That's the.

1713
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:24,800
What's OK.

1714
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:26,960
Why is this?

1715
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,400
Why do I OK?

1716
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,920
Well, emotions about the song.

1717
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:31,760
The synth is a lot of it.

1718
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:34,080
Obviously, I saw a lot of it.

1719
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:34,400
Yep.

1720
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:34,880
Yep.

1721
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:39,200
The little like Tomorrowland bloops and bleeps and like the.

1722
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:42,240
Little they hit every song like one of them is like it's like a snore.

1723
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:44,240
It's like a digital version of a snore.

1724
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:48,480
Also, when they're singing about gyro gear loose, they're making them sound like.

1725
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:53,520
Who's a pot like the greatest man who ever lived like the nicest.

1726
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:53,840
Yeah.

1727
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,400
Pure man, whoever duck, whoever lived.

1728
01:23:56,400 --> 01:24:01,760
This is like the you know, we want these billionaires and these tech people to save us from things.

1729
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:02,640
And it's never going to happen.

1730
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:04,320
We know how dark all these people are.

1731
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:04,560
Yeah.

1732
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:06,320
Gyro gear loose could do it.

1733
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:07,360
It sounds like it.

1734
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:08,800
He's like he's like humble.

1735
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:09,840
He's selfless.

1736
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,120
He's helping everyone.

1737
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:16,160
And makes a carbon remover that takes it from the sky.

1738
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:19,120
Saves the planet for every girl and guy.

1739
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:28,720
Gyro gear loose invented by Carl Barks created by Carl Barks invented in the Disney comics.

1740
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,720
And eventually shows up in DuckTales and the newer DuckTales.

1741
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:37,520
His first appearance was in the.

1742
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:42,480
OK, this name Sport Goofy and Soccer Media.

1743
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:45,200
It was a 1987 TV special.

1744
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:48,000
We get some sport in the next song too.

1745
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,880
That's what that's from.

1746
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:49,200
Wow.

1747
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:49,440
Wow.

1748
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,440
So predated DuckTales a little bit.

1749
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:51,680
Yeah.

1750
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:58,000
They clearly pulled him because it was this it's this robot tech oriented album.

1751
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:59,920
That must have been the idea.

1752
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:01,600
But yeah, I agree.

1753
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,960
It's like these these inventions are so nice.

1754
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:09,920
A smile suspender to keep people's faces up when they're feeling like.

1755
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:10,720
Clockwork Orange.

1756
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:12,000
Yeah, I guess a little bit.

1757
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:12,240
Yeah.

1758
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,920
But I don't think that's how he views it.

1759
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:16,240
I think he's like I see people frowning all the time.

1760
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:17,280
What can I do?

1761
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:17,520
Yeah.

1762
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:19,120
I think this is a big thing.

1763
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:23,840
There's a verse that's kind of about how there he makes mistakes.

1764
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,680
Sometimes the inventions don't go right.

1765
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:28,160
I think this is a very Rex like character.

1766
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:31,840
I think he's a guy who's trying his best with 80s technology.

1767
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:38,960
I think it's a lot of synth sounds surrounding this nice character.

1768
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,240
I just I don't know.

1769
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:46,160
It's I bet if and I look this up because sometimes I'm no real musician,

1770
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:50,640
but I will pick out chords on the piano and I will see something and go,

1771
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:51,360
oh, that's why.

1772
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:52,800
That's why that one hits like I like.

1773
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:53,120
All right.

1774
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,120
It's a F major seventh.

1775
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:58,800
Everything I've ever looked up with F major seven is something that hits me in the heart.

1776
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:04,160
And I bet if you did the notation of this, it would explain why this song I know I would

1777
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,360
look at and go, oh, there you go.

1778
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:09,520
That's why it's one of those or is that it's sustained or something.

1779
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:09,840
Yeah.

1780
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:14,400
Well, yeah, chord progressions certainly like the chord progression of gummy bears

1781
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:17,680
is so satisfying if you just play it on the acoustic guitar.

1782
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:21,840
Similarly, if you play the theme song to David the gnome on the guitar,

1783
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:24,560
it's a similar sort of vibe to it.

1784
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,560
We're so in that it's in the DNA.

1785
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:30,000
It's not about all this instrumentation, even though they have the cool Yamaha's.

1786
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:30,480
There's a walk.

1787
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:31,520
It's got to be in the song.

1788
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:35,440
I love a good walk up, which has is on like the Mickey.

1789
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:37,120
She's got a crush on you.

1790
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:37,840
Boom, boom, boom.

1791
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:38,560
Like it walks it up.

1792
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:39,120
This is your thing.

1793
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:39,680
Yeah, yeah.

1794
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:40,320
Talk about this before.

1795
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,440
Like I miss you on the Rolling Stones or in like any disco song.

1796
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,520
We're like, boom, boom, boom.

1797
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:46,480
Like it's one.

1798
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,560
It stays on the same note and then the other note.

1799
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:53,200
Like you play it bounces back and forth between the same note and then an ascending note,

1800
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:54,640
usually like a full step.

1801
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:56,240
You know, it gives it all lift.

1802
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:58,240
That's the and it lifts it up and I love it.

1803
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:00,880
I miss sucker for it almost every song it's on.

1804
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:01,920
Wow.

1805
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:05,520
So there are these weird little musical things that people love,

1806
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:08,960
whether they know what they are or not, or they can poorly explain them like I have.

1807
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:13,200
This is like, I don't know how sincere we are

1808
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,120
a lot, especially lately.

1809
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:19,440
You get me talking about you're talking about these these step ups,

1810
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:23,200
talk about chords, gyro gear loose and sparks and yama.

1811
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:24,320
This is what's in my heart.

1812
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,000
We've heard some of what's in your heart.

1813
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:26,640
Yeah.

1814
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:30,240
And it's funny the gyro gear loose is inspiring all of it.

1815
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:31,440
You know what I was trying to think of?

1816
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:33,920
Like, is there a song that does something similar to me?

1817
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:38,960
And I thought of one, which is, have you ever heard the album version of Thank You

1818
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:42,720
for Being a Friend, which we know is the Golden Girls theme,

1819
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:45,200
but is originally by the artist Andrew Gold?

1820
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:45,840
Right, right.

1821
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:46,240
Look it up.

1822
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:47,040
I have not heard it.

1823
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:51,280
This is like, I think it's got a similar where it's like you feel some feelings about it,

1824
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:54,480
partially because it's a theme song about some nice characters,

1825
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:58,640
but it's got a lot of inherent heart where it's a little cheesy potentially.

1826
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:02,720
And what it also has is a guy harmonizing with himself beautifully.

1827
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:05,680
This is something I think across music that I love.

1828
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:07,600
Michael Silver sure is doing it great here.

1829
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:08,080
Uh huh.

1830
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,760
Andrew Gold does it great.

1831
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:10,960
It's why I like Rundgren.

1832
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,560
It's why I like Queen.

1833
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,320
Anything with like really great.

1834
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:16,320
This guy is going to, Michael McDonald,

1835
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:20,160
anything where somebody that stacks on himself and sings really heartfelt.

1836
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,360
Uh, I'm a sucker for it.

1837
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,520
Is there a song, let me, let me really get real here.

1838
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:27,920
If we're talking about it, we're in the, if we're down here, uh, uh, is there a song

1839
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:32,160
that you just like, it's like a little too much emotionally for you sometimes to listen to,

1840
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:33,040
or all the time.

1841
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:33,520
Oh.

1842
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:35,840
There's like a song, there's one song that pops into my mind.

1843
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,240
It's more of a recent song or I like cry.

1844
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:38,960
I just cry.

1845
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:39,600
I don't know why.

1846
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:40,080
Oh.

1847
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:43,840
Not like uncontrollably necessarily, but I start to like well up.

1848
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:46,000
Uh, so not dude looks like a lady.

1849
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,200
It's not dude looks like a lady.

1850
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,120
It's, uh, uh, amazing by Aerosmith.

1851
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:51,360
Understood.

1852
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:52,560
Just push play by Aerosmith.

1853
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:53,680
I'm a crazy guy.

1854
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:54,480
Yeah.

1855
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:55,440
I like crazy too.

1856
01:28:55,440 --> 01:29:00,080
No, it's a song by Randy Neumann called Wandering Boy about a guy who's like son.

1857
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:03,680
Like, I don't know if he's like something happens to him and he hasn't seen him in years.

1858
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:05,600
And he's like imagining that he's okay.

1859
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,000
I don't know why this song gets me.

1860
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:08,240
Well.

1861
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:12,320
But like it really like immediately I'm even getting weird talking about it now.

1862
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:12,720
Wow.

1863
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:13,120
It's weird.

1864
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:13,920
I don't know what it is.

1865
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:14,480
Oh my God.

1866
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:15,280
It's strange.

1867
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:16,160
Look at those chords.

1868
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:17,120
It's probably all in there.

1869
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:18,640
It seems like lyrically thematically.

1870
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:19,680
I think it's thematically.

1871
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:23,040
I mean the music itself, there's a lot of Randy Newman songs that are so sad.

1872
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:24,480
Like I think it's going to rain today.

1873
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:28,080
There's like something like so devastating about him.

1874
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:28,720
I don't know this one.

1875
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:30,720
Maybe I haven't dug in a lot.

1876
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:31,840
Wandering Boy is newer.

1877
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,440
I know some Randy, but I, you know, I'll throw on.

1878
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:38,160
So I'll willingly put on I Love L.A.

1879
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:39,120
Of course.

1880
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:39,600
That's all that.

1881
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:40,000
Yeah.

1882
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:40,560
Oh, sure.

1883
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:40,720
Yeah.

1884
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:42,560
That's the song they play when the Dodgers win.

1885
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,080
I like guys.

1886
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:45,120
I like other guys.

1887
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:53,280
I like people that go from insanely sincere to just fucking sarcastic.

1888
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:57,520
Like Randy Newman is like goes wildly both ways.

1889
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:00,720
Just cutting and mean and sarcastic and evil.

1890
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:02,480
And then just the like saddest shit.

1891
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,520
It's a little Sparks tunes.

1892
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:04,800
A little Elvis Costello.

1893
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,800
You know, that's a bit with that Elvis Costello, Burbeck, or I can't handle all the time.

1894
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,440
That's a hell of an album.

1895
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:14,400
Boy, that is like, look, I'm not in a divorce scenario.

1896
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:15,600
I hope.

1897
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:19,680
But it's made me it's an album that made me understood what a divorce must feel like.

1898
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:20,320
Yeah.

1899
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:23,040
So it's such a heart ripper.

1900
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:24,720
That warren zeman song.

1901
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:28,640
The one he wrote when he died was dying to keep me in your heart for a while.

1902
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:31,040
That's a real sad one.

1903
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,520
Won't you listen to what's too much?

1904
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:34,880
I think I stop.

1905
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:40,960
I stopped right before getting too emotional, but that Ben Folds five song boxing,

1906
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:44,800
which is about like the interview with.

1907
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:49,680
Is it Howard Cassell and Muhammad Ali?

1908
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:50,080
Yeah.

1909
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:50,400
Yeah.

1910
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:55,840
Oh, I got to gear up if I'm going to listen to the song time, which is on a solo album,

1911
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,440
which oddly weird Al sings on.

1912
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:58,560
Sings like really good.

1913
01:30:58,560 --> 01:30:59,120
Oh, yeah.

1914
01:30:59,120 --> 01:30:59,840
Time is on.

1915
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:00,720
Background vocals.

1916
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:03,440
Time is on what's a song for Solomon.

1917
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,280
That's oddly my favorite one.

1918
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:05,840
Interesting.

1919
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:07,760
That's a heavy one for me, though.

1920
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:09,360
I'll avoid some Ben Folds.

1921
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:13,360
Another episode to do after this, but I'd like to just talk about music for a few hours.

1922
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:14,320
I'll be honest with you.

1923
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:15,440
All right.

1924
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:16,400
Back to the.

1925
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:17,040
Back to it.

1926
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:18,240
Back to Sport Mickey.

1927
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:23,440
Well, you know, here we end up at a now we're in an area of, you know,

1928
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:28,000
a band that we have some emotions tied up into and that's Halix because

1929
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:32,560
we're so proud of what's happened with Halix, the way Halix has exploded.

1930
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:34,560
In these last few years.

1931
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,880
And so this song, you can always be number one

1932
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:43,120
sung by Laura Mumford, who ended up being the singer of Halix.

1933
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:47,920
So she was in the Walt Disney Records, which, by the way, there's some shared personnel

1934
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:53,920
essentially like the people producing this thing were also working on Halix at the same time.

1935
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:58,400
These were the attempts of these people who were doing kind of boring read along

1936
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:00,880
albums to like, what if we could make some music?

1937
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:04,080
When you look at it that way, they're making this thing where they bring sparks in.

1938
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:05,040
There's a bunch of sense.

1939
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:10,640
And then they're making a band in Disneyland with a fake wookie and a guy driving a keyboard

1940
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:11,120
cart around.

1941
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:15,920
It's like these guys were getting trigger happy in a fun way.

1942
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:16,560
Yeah.

1943
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:16,720
Yeah.

1944
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:17,040
Yeah.

1945
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:19,440
It's I will say this.

1946
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:22,320
The person I was with who knows Mary Williams also knows Halix.

1947
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,440
You said that almost as though I don't want anybody.

1948
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,400
I don't want the neighbors to hear.

1949
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,720
I don't want to call Barry Williams.

1950
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:29,220
Yeah.

1951
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:33,300
When I first started listening to this track, I thought it sounded a little like ABBA.

1952
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:34,500
Extreme.

1953
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:34,820
Oh yeah.

1954
01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:34,820


1955
01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:38,100
Like your opening sounds like take a chance on me.

1956
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:39,620
They're starting to take a chance on me.

1957
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:42,580
Not necessarily.

1958
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:45,620
You can always be number one.

1959
01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:48,340
You can always be a winner.

1960
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:51,380
Even if you play the game for years.

1961
01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:52,420
Yeah, that's an ABBA.

1962
01:32:52,420 --> 01:32:53,220
Yes.

1963
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:53,220


1964
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:53,220


1965
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:53,300
Yes.

1966
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:53,380
Yes.

1967
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:53,460
Yes.

1968
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:53,540
Yes.

1969
01:32:53,540 --> 01:32:53,620
Yes.

1970
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:53,700
Yes.

1971
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:53,780
Yes.

1972
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:53,860
Yes.

1973
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:53,940
Yes.

1974
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:54,020
Yes.

1975
01:32:54,020 --> 01:32:54,100
Yes.

1976
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:54,180
Yes.

1977
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:54,260
Yes.

1978
01:32:54,260 --> 01:33:04,260
Yeah.

1979
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:16,180
Really powerful part.

1980
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:16,980
Yeah, that's pretty good.

1981
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:17,220
Yeah.

1982
01:33:17,220 --> 01:33:18,820
The world of sports is.

1983
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:19,940
So yeah.

1984
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:21,380
World of sports.

1985
01:33:21,380 --> 01:33:21,620
Yeah.

1986
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:26,100
Yeah, I think it maybe wears the ABBA a little too much on its sleeve.

1987
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:28,020
It's nice.

1988
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:28,580
I think it.

1989
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:29,140
Yeah.

1990
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:32,020
That's a big queen kind of breakdown though a little bit or not.

1991
01:33:32,820 --> 01:33:33,060
Yeah.

1992
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:33,380
Yeah.

1993
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:34,660
Yeah, for sure.

1994
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:36,100
I like it.

1995
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:36,740
I like it.

1996
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:37,860
Yeah, I like it too.

1997
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:38,820
It's coming after it.

1998
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:42,980
This is a tough run, but it's again in the superior second half.

1999
01:33:42,980 --> 01:33:47,540
I feel like a lot of albums that we've talked about end up falling apart a little as you speed up.

2000
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:48,500
But here we go.

2001
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:54,020
We're going on and on because all the emotion is here in the second half of Splash Dance.

2002
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:55,700
Yeah, we're talking about Harry's House.

2003
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:58,900
I've been listening to Harry Styles' album and the first half is so good.

2004
01:33:58,900 --> 01:34:01,540
And the second half is good, but maybe I just haven't gotten to it enough.

2005
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:03,460
But this I feel the opposite.

2006
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:03,700
Yeah.

2007
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:05,220
So we'll see.

2008
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:08,740
That's the case with you can always be number one.

2009
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:09,620
We just have to.

2010
01:34:10,580 --> 01:34:11,940
Or we got to like work out to it.

2011
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:13,540
We got to go do a big run with it.

2012
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:14,260
Yeah, we should.

2013
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:15,780
We should work out to it.

2014
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:15,940
Yeah.

2015
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:16,180
Yeah.

2016
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:21,700
I like the I don't know the melody of it, but I wrote down the lyrics in my head.

2017
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:25,540
It's like Goofy has been known to goof.

2018
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:28,180
That's how he got his name.

2019
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:30,820
Yeah, I guess that's true.

2020
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:35,780
It was not his first name, but yeah, that's how we got.

2021
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:36,260
Oh, that's right.

2022
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:36,580
That's it.

2023
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:37,940
Yes, he did have to get his name.

2024
01:34:37,940 --> 01:34:38,900
Dippy Dog.

2025
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:40,340
Who's Dippy Dog first?

2026
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:41,860
Yeah, Dippy the goof.

2027
01:34:41,860 --> 01:34:42,260
Oh, yeah.

2028
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:43,220
And then Dippy the goof.

2029
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:44,580
Dippy the goof.

2030
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:48,260
George Lucas schooled us about he educated us about some of this.

2031
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:48,660
Oh, yeah.

2032
01:34:48,660 --> 01:34:48,900
Right.

2033
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:49,300
Right.

2034
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:52,020
So that's how he got his third name.

2035
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:54,340
It should be really the line here.

2036
01:34:54,340 --> 01:34:54,820
Yeah.

2037
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:57,540
So points for lost for accuracy.

2038
01:34:57,540 --> 01:34:58,040
Yeah.

2039
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:00,020
Mousekamania.

2040
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:03,620
You know, I think this album is similar to the what's the last song on the McGruff Smart

2041
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:04,580
Smart Kids album.

2042
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:05,620
It's like a real hyper.

2043
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:11,060
I'm I'm glad I'm me.

2044
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:11,540
Oh, yeah.

2045
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:12,180
I'm glad.

2046
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:13,780
That's the one that has that kind of Devo.

2047
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:14,280
Right.

2048
01:35:15,620 --> 01:35:19,860
Everything is super duper much like a robot he's talking to that comes out of nowhere.

2049
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:25,860
Similar to this, I feel this ends with this like, all right, let's go out with just a

2050
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:28,100
lot of tempo and a bunch of sounds.

2051
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:31,300
So let's just get a quick hit of sure Mousekamania.

2052
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:33,000
Yeah.

2053
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:36,020
Oh, Devo.

2054
01:35:42,180 --> 01:36:07,460
Wow.

2055
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:09,620
Yeah, really a high energy.

2056
01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:12,020
This was for this is for the Mosh pit, I guess.

2057
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:17,460
This is the way that this has like, you know, because some of those Halyx songs are pretty

2058
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:21,060
good and just genuinely sound like what the radio sounded like then.

2059
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:23,460
I think we're not too off with with Mousekamania.

2060
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:29,140
The only difference being that it's about collecting Mickey stuff materials.

2061
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:30,200
Yeah.

2062
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:37,380
It was when they first saw the signs of like, Disney and I think the collection.

2063
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:37,940
It might be.

2064
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:38,740
Yeah.

2065
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:39,240
Yeah.

2066
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:41,060
This stuff is getting out of hand.

2067
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:43,140
Hopefully they do less of it.

2068
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:43,860
You freaks.

2069
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:44,660
Thank you.

2070
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:49,860
And then the next year, the year after this, a fella named Michael Eisner shows up at the

2071
01:36:49,860 --> 01:36:52,180
studio and things change forever.

2072
01:36:52,180 --> 01:36:52,740
Things change.

2073
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:56,820
I think that this and like, it's a pretty muddy era, right?

2074
01:36:56,820 --> 01:37:02,100
Between 66 Walt's death and 8 or the new King's arrival.

2075
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:09,140
There's a lot of missteps, a lot of not great movies and weird live action.

2076
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:10,340
What the fuck is this?

2077
01:37:11,220 --> 01:37:12,980
Condor Mans and what have you.

2078
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:18,980
But this is really, I feel like a nice gentle product of pre Eisner.

2079
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:21,620
We're not micromanaging these things to death.

2080
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:26,660
Let's let the guys down in records do whatever they want because they made us some money with

2081
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:29,380
disco, which was them doing whatever they want.

2082
01:37:29,380 --> 01:37:30,260
It's just a, I don't know.

2083
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:32,180
This is a really earnest project.

2084
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:32,680
Yes.

2085
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:33,180
Yeah.

2086
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:36,260
I think produced an earnest episode.

2087
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:37,060
I think so.

2088
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:38,500
I feel there were jokes.

2089
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:39,060
Sure.

2090
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:41,700
But crying songs.

2091
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:42,420
I like that.

2092
01:37:42,420 --> 01:37:43,620
I think we got to mix it up.

2093
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:46,100
We got to be ourselves at some point.

2094
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:52,420
And you know, actually one funny thing about this too, that so that's a song about hoarding.

2095
01:37:52,420 --> 01:37:52,980
Right.

2096
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:55,140
And then I feel like this just came up in an episode.

2097
01:37:56,180 --> 01:37:59,620
Were you, Mike, talking about the new Mickey Mouse cartoons?

2098
01:37:59,620 --> 01:38:02,340
And there's an episode about where Mickey's a hoarder.

2099
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:04,500
I think Jason was talking about that.

2100
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:08,900
I, yeah, I think that's right.

2101
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:10,660
Or did we just find this independently?

2102
01:38:10,660 --> 01:38:14,580
I'm trying to remember because there's the cartoon made for Hollywood studios

2103
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:19,220
that I watched that references other episodes of the car.

2104
01:38:19,220 --> 01:38:22,420
Like there's pictures and there's, there's little reference,

2105
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:24,420
but I think there might be a hoarding.

2106
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:26,180
It's like that kind of sounds right.

2107
01:38:26,180 --> 01:38:29,220
One of those things is called the wonderful, wonderful spring of Mickey Mouse.

2108
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:35,300
And it's about Mickey as a hoarder and Mickey has all this shit he's not willing to get rid of.

2109
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:38,420
And a lot of the stuff we would all kill to have, which is like old ride vehicles.

2110
01:38:38,420 --> 01:38:42,420
So it's a good Easter egg episode for, oh, I was one of the old sky buckets or whatever.

2111
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:47,220
But when he's kind of in a rush to sell, like am I getting rid of this or not?

2112
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:51,380
One of the items he holds up quickly is a pristine non-drawn,

2113
01:38:51,380 --> 01:38:56,340
just a photo put on top of animation copy of Mickey Mouse splash dance.

2114
01:38:56,340 --> 01:38:57,060
Oh, yes.

2115
01:38:57,060 --> 01:39:04,580
So these new cartoons that we like nod to this album and Mickey on the digital wave with his seat.

2116
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:07,220
It is, it's part of the history.

2117
01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:10,740
They nodded to it and it's, it's nice.

2118
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:13,940
I'm glad it's still, even if it's just as a snarky reference,

2119
01:39:13,940 --> 01:39:16,580
I'm glad Disney is holding on to this.

2120
01:39:16,580 --> 01:39:16,820
Yeah.

2121
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:21,220
I feel like the people making those Mickey cartoons have a genuine affection for some of this.

2122
01:39:21,860 --> 01:39:22,500
I would assume.

2123
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:23,700
I think so in the history.

2124
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:23,860
Yeah.

2125
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:25,860
I know it's a good way to like tie together.

2126
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:30,580
That's like a genuine, okay, we have all these properties around and bits of Disney lore.

2127
01:39:30,580 --> 01:39:32,420
How do we spend something new out of it?

2128
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:33,140
Yeah.

2129
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:39,460
It should be like Disney was relying on Turner and Hooch for their reboots,

2130
01:39:39,460 --> 01:39:44,340
but don't you think, you know, splash dance should come back more in some sort of way?

2131
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:44,980
Well, as what?

2132
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:45,620
I don't know.

2133
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:48,260
Like, is it a jukebox musical of all of these songs?

2134
01:39:48,260 --> 01:39:49,540
Or yeah, jukebox musical.

2135
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:50,340
Sure.

2136
01:39:50,340 --> 01:39:54,100
Well, you know, with the sparks connection, they just, you know,

2137
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:56,180
they just did all the songs for Annette.

2138
01:39:56,980 --> 01:39:58,740
Why can't Disney do Annette?

2139
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:01,380
Why can't Disney do Annette?

2140
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:03,460
Something exactly in that tone.

2141
01:40:03,460 --> 01:40:03,960
Yeah.

2142
01:40:05,060 --> 01:40:06,820
And people, people out there are probably also saying,

2143
01:40:06,820 --> 01:40:10,420
why can't podcast The Ride of the Second Gate do an episode about Annette,

2144
01:40:10,420 --> 01:40:12,660
Funicello and her singing career?

2145
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:17,940
It's so, well, yeah, those club three results, we had to start deleting how many people were

2146
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:23,940
begging for the Annette, Al, but once the gates were open to the public, it's like enough.

2147
01:40:23,940 --> 01:40:24,340
People just screaming.

2148
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:26,340
Like I had to start screaming and deleting.

2149
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:27,140
Fine delete, fine delete.

2150
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:29,300
Hawaiianette, Italianette.

2151
01:40:31,780 --> 01:40:35,060
Well, we've already, look, there's other music ones we talked about on this episode,

2152
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:36,340
even we've got to end up doing.

2153
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:37,380
So it's still there.

2154
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:38,820
It's still, it'll happen one day.

2155
01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:44,740
Well, and isn't this episode a nice example of what happens when we talk about music that

2156
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:47,380
isn't Aerosmith and Green Day?

2157
01:40:47,380 --> 01:40:49,620
Right. It is, it is interesting.

2158
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:56,100
When we stretch outside of our, well, when we stretch outside of your comfort zone.

2159
01:40:56,100 --> 01:40:57,140
That's where I like to live.

2160
01:40:57,540 --> 01:41:02,580
You'll go back, you'll get back in the car and crank up honking on Bobo.

2161
01:41:02,580 --> 01:41:03,060
Oh yeah.

2162
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:04,660
Forget all this ever happened.

2163
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:06,340
Baby, please don't go.

2164
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:07,700
Yep. That's the first track.

2165
01:41:10,980 --> 01:41:14,980
I was in this morning, I was doing a long, boring interview with a guy who directed a

2166
01:41:14,980 --> 01:41:18,980
lot of those Aerosmith videos and he was asked honestly what he thinks of Steven Tyler.

2167
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:20,020
And he's like, don't like him.

2168
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:22,580
A lot of demons.

2169
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:25,140
You know, I think he's a lot.

2170
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:27,700
Steven Tyler, I will give you that.

2171
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:30,660
So wait, this was not a new interview?

2172
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:32,420
I don't know.

2173
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:34,020
Okay. I was going to say it's a new interview.

2174
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:39,540
It's like kind of no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

2175
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:40,820
between demon battles.

2176
01:41:40,820 --> 01:41:41,320
Okay.

2177
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:44,020
Okay. Anyway, so very nice.

2178
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:45,860
Nice to talk about all these things.

2179
01:41:45,860 --> 01:41:47,300
You survived podcast, the ride.

2180
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:48,980
Thanks for subscribing to the second gate.

2184
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:03,060
This is, it's nice to break these things down.

2185
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:09,540
If there's an album you want us to listen to, but any and all topics we are always open to.

2186
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:16,980
Can I ask just maybe for a little blast of the end of Mickey, she's got a crush on you

2187
01:42:16,980 --> 01:42:20,580
because I think this is actually one of the catchiest things on the album.

2188
01:42:21,380 --> 01:42:25,300
Very like these calling response vocals.

2189
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:27,220
I like nice heartfelt wedding.

2190
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:55,700
Oh, my goal.

2191
01:42:56,740 --> 01:42:59,060
My goal, my goal.

2192
01:42:59,060 --> 01:42:59,860
Not Mickey.

2193
01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:03,140
The crush is on my goal.
