1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:13,240
Warning, the following podcast may contain treacherous tales of photoventury, secret log

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,660
sock exchanges, and the stonifying of Usumate.

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,360
Mary Holland takes us to a bear-themed land containing no bears.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:47,600
It's Grizzly River Run on Podcast The Ride.

7
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,440
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast hosted by three men who have not signed

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,560
up for Disney Plus yet, but would do it immediately if they announced a show based on an anthropomorphic

9
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,660
river rapid that lives in Grizzly River Run.

10
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,840
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

11
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,440
So wait, if a rapid is anthropomorphic, that's just like a splash?

12
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,100
Yeah, well, it's a piece of the river in my mind.

13
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,880
So it's like it has a face and two eyeballs.

14
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,880
Oh, I see.

15
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,880
Okay.

16
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,880
A rapid.

17
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,880
A single rapid, yes.

18
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,880
A single rapid.

19
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,880
All right.

20
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,040
So you're a friend of the rapid, and you root for him.

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,640
And he's friends or enemies, or enemies maybe with a different rapid, with the other many

22
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,640
rapids, I guess.

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,880
Yeah, obviously, like we're going to explore his relationship with the other rapids.

24
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,360
That's Scott Garner talking.

25
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,880
Do extreme sports in me, but don't film me with garbage.

26
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,880
That's how that's you.

27
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,240
By the way, you do the voice for the show.

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,240
What's his name?

29
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,240
Like, Rivy or something?

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,240
It was your pitch.

31
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,240
Yeah.

32
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,280
Well, I'm just saying we're all working on it now.

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
We're all in this together.

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,760
Actually, future guest of the show, Danny Jelenek and I were working on an idea about

35
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,600
a bunch of alive waves called wavies.

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Really?

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
So it's the same idea.

38
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,600
We haven't picked that idea up in a while, but...

39
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Wow, it's the same idea.

40
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,640
We can ship that over to being rapidies.

42
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,600
Yeah, well, let's bring our guest in to pitch on this great idea.

43
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,560
You know, well, she's from coming into...

44
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,600
The show is coming out on Comedy Central.

45
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
You know what?

46
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
She's coming.

47
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,960
It's coming out on TV soon.

48
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,760
It's a Comedy Central show called Robbie.

49
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,880
She's here to talk about bears and water.

50
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,880
It's Mary Holland.

51
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,880
Hello.

52
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
Hello.

53
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,880
You know me from the future.

54
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,600
I always say, you know me from, and then I was like, no, it's a future credit.

55
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Wow.

56
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Horses, UCB.

57
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
That's true.

58
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Yes, yes.

59
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
I'm around, folks.

60
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Yeah.

61
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,600
You didn't just step off the bus this week?

62
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
No, no, no, no.

63
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Like 11 years ago, like...

64
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Oh, boy.

65
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Yeah.

66
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Oh, I've been just chugging along for a long time.

67
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,600
In a minute.

68
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
And so many Google results in the meantime.

69
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
That's right.

70
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Everyone can check it out.

71
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,600
I love this writer's room that I'm stepping into.

72
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Yeah.

73
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
We're pitching on this idea.

74
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Yeah.

75
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
What do you think the rapids name should be?

76
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
I think it should be Grizzly.

77
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Okay, Grizzly the rapid.

78
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Yeah.

79
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
But is Grizzly sort of playing against the type?

80
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Because I feel like it's maybe a meek rapid.

81
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Yeah, yeah.

82
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
You know what I mean?

83
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Oh, yeah.

84
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Yeah, it's not like a crazy, you know...

85
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,600
No, it's not like white water rapid, you know.

86
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Right.

87
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
It's like when a little character is called...

88
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Yeah, or like Joe or something.

89
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Yeah, it's a teeny tiny...

90
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Yeah, it's a tiny little rapid.

91
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
It's making up for the lack of aggression.

92
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Yeah, when he was in the rapid high school

93
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,600
and like the jocks would be like, come on, Grizzly.

94
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
And they would say it all sarcastic,

95
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
but now he sort of wears it as a badge of honor.

96
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,600
That's right.

97
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
He's embraced it.

98
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Yeah.

99
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
That's pretty good.

100
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
I like that.

101
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Take the power back.

102
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,600
So we would sign up for Disney Plus if the show would exist.

103
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
So just throwing it out.

104
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Does a rapid...

105
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Does it have to be like...

106
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,600
So I picture it sort of like mid peak, like it's bubbling.

107
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,600
It's like in the middle of it's foaming up and at its height.

108
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,600
So how can a rapid exist when it's not in the middle of a splash?

109
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
It's a very good question.

110
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
It's a question we're facing on wavies as well.

111
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
So I'm just...

112
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Should we outsource this question to your listeners?

113
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,600
How we would be able to like this,

114
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,600
the distinction between just the normal water

115
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
and the characters that are water.

116
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Because the water itself might not be.

117
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
It's a rapid is...

118
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Right.

119
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,600
The rapid is a talking, thinking thing,

120
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
but the water is what the rapid lives in,

121
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
even though they are both water.

122
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Yeah.

123
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Sometimes there's a little rapid.

124
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Like sometimes that's what like the ones that surprise people.

125
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Like you went past the waterfall and then there's a little splash

126
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
and that's when you actually get wet.

127
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
But it's like a little trick.

128
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
So it's a little trick.

129
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
It's a little trick.

130
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
So the character is a little trick.

131
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Rapids are water tricks.

132
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Rapids are water tricks.

133
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,600
So that I guess that makes them all mischievous.

134
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Yes.

135
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Yes.

136
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
They're all...

137
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
They're up to hijinks.

138
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
A lot are sneaking behind,

139
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,600
like they're trying to hide in a place where you wouldn't know a big splash was coming.

140
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Maybe it's just that they're like darker blue.

141
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,600
The water is lighter blue and they're darker blue.

142
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Or they're lighter because they're like white.

143
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
They're white water rapids.

144
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Oh, good point.

145
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Yeah.

146
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
They might have to be light.

147
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
That might set them apart from the blue color.

148
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
And so this room, we're here for eight hours.

149
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Is that right?

150
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Yes.

151
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
We got a crowd going today.

152
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
This room is lasting.

153
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Okay.

154
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Yeah.

155
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,600
You've signed a free contract to develop a Disney series.

156
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,600
That is the future for sure.

157
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Like the podcast and they're just like, well, we own everything you said today.

158
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Yeah.

159
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
That's true.

160
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Oh, God.

161
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Yes, you're right.

162
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,600
I keep all my brilliant ideas to myself.

163
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,600
That's why you haven't heard any brilliant ideas yet is because I'm just aware that you guys will claim ownership.

164
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Oh, yeah.

165
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Keep it flat.

166
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
You can say stuff, but just, you know.

167
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Keep it super mundane and flat.

168
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
The rapids ride exists.

169
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
That's your observation today.

170
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Don't ascend to brilliance.

171
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,600
Any joke you were to say today, you would catch like you would hear from somebody else.

172
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Like we were using them like out on the town.

173
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Out on the town.

174
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
We were just to entertain in a bar.

175
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,600
If anybody uses any more of my jokes out on the town, I'm going to flip my lid.

176
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Yeah.

177
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,600
People are just out on the town all the time using my jokes.

178
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Yeah.

179
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
That's so funny.

180
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
Walking across a bridge, hailing a cab.

181
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Yeah.

182
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Hailing a cab with one of your jokes.

183
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Yeah.

184
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Just running errands with my jokes.

185
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
They're for fun and not for commerce.

186
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,600
I don't like the thought of it.

187
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,600
All right.

188
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Well, we're going to talk about Grizzly River Run today.

189
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,600
You were talking about California Adventure in general.

190
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,600
Let's just get your feelings in the theme parks, Disney, all of it.

191
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
Where do you start with all this stuff?

192
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
I am pro all of it.

193
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Good.

194
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
You passed the first test.

195
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,600
I love them so much.

196
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,600
I remember my first Disney experience when I was four years old.

197
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
I had severe asthma.

198
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:17,600
My mother had to stay in the hotel with me for the most part.

199
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:24,600
There were a few days when I was in good enough health where I could go out into the park with the rest of my family.

200
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,600
I had never experienced anything like it.

201
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
It was life changing, truly.

202
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,600
It was magical.

203
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:38,600
I remember I had a real breakdown heading into it's a small world after all.

204
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:48,600
I still like I can almost remember the smell of the building that I don't even know if it's a building actually.

205
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,600
The line going into where you get into the boats that then go into this dark tunnel.

206
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:04,600
I remember I saw people getting in boats and going into darkness and I lost my damn mind.

207
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,600
I really like it's like the worst tantrum you can imagine a child having.

208
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,600
I was like flailing my body around.

209
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
I was screaming.

210
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
I was crying.

211
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
My poor mother.

212
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,600
I don't know how they didn't were just like let's get the hell out of here.

213
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,600
We got onto the boat.

214
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
I was freaking out.

215
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,600
We went into the darkness and then I was like this is great.

216
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,600
I was having the best time.

217
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Anyway.

218
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
That could have been a cave.

219
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,600
They could have been just like a big knife slicing you up.

220
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
You didn't know what that was.

221
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
Exactly.

222
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
This was in Florida, right?

223
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Yes.

224
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,600
The small world where you get in in Florida is an enclosed building but it's kind of outside.

225
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,600
It's got very high ceilings and it does kind of trap that deep water smell.

226
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Yes.

227
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
I remember the smell of it for sure.

228
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
That's why.

229
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:01,600
That is a very distinct first memory I have of an amusement park.

230
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,600
I love them all so much.

231
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,600
I try to go at least once a year more if I can swing it.

232
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,600
I just think it's perfect.

233
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,600
I think everything about it is perfect except for the prices and except for the line.

234
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,600
I'm sure you guys have talked about that.

235
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Sometimes the food is very good but sometimes you got to pick right.

236
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
You got to do your research.

237
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:33,600
That's a perk of California Adventure I think is that good food.

238
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
You can get drinks.

239
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:43,600
It's like I think California Adventure is a nice sweet spot where it's still Disney feeling.

240
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:54,600
There's still like Disney-esque-ness to it but it's also got an adult tinge to it that's like,

241
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,600
oh, this is sort of an in-between of like we're just out in the world and we're at a theme park.

242
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
You know what I mean?

243
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
It's got a leisurely pit.

244
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
There's not a million rides.

245
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,600
I mean there was hardly any when it first opened.

246
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,600
This Grizzly River Run was an opening day attraction February 8, 2001.

247
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Thank you.

248
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
I've seen it over the years though.

249
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,600
There's really this ride I think is the first thing that worked really well.

250
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,600
It's like the thing that's had the least changes that like that whole this whole area I think was off to the races.

251
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,600
The Rapids Zone and Soarin' right by it.

252
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Separate but relate and now like part of the same district.

253
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,600
But if you went to California Adventure and just went off to the right and did all that and then had to leave,

254
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
you would think this is a great park.

255
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,600
I love that they've embraced the sort of national park feel to it all.

256
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,600
They have that Rambler out there which is I think my favorite car I've ever seen.

257
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Do you guys know what I'm talking about?

258
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
The car that's like parked outside.

259
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Of Soarin'.

260
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Of Soarin', yeah.

261
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
It's like a cross.

262
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,600
It's like geared up for like a camping road trip or whatever in the 70s.

263
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,600
And it's got like a canoe on it and it's got all this like binoculars and cameras and maps and everything inside the car.

264
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,600
It's just it evokes this like, oh, we're like we're in a national park.

265
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
It's just got that feel to it.

266
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Sure.

267
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
It's really special.

268
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
And it smells different in there.

269
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
We're only talking about smells.

270
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:35,600
But I feel like California Adventure smells different than Disneyland even though they're like they share the same like.

271
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Is there a specific area of smell that you think is the best in California Adventure?

272
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,600
I would, I mean honestly all around that area.

273
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Yeah.

274
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
It's like pine.

275
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Pine, yes.

276
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
They're pumping like pine in.

277
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
It smells like woods.

278
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
It smells like the forest.

279
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Right.

280
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
It's like aged so well because the trees have all grown out.

281
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Right.

282
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
They were all saplings when they were planted.

283
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Now it's been 18 years.

284
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
So they're starting to fill out.

285
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Right.

286
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,600
And with the hotel in the background, the hotel always looked good.

287
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,600
But like as they've like gussied up this area, it just looks nicer and nicer.

288
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Have you guys ever been in that hotel?

289
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
I've stayed a couple of times.

290
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
You have?

291
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Yeah.

292
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
I'm so jealous.

293
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,600
I've only been in the lobby and have just salivated over it.

294
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Or just that.

295
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,600
I think it's in that lobby for, you could do it any time you want.

296
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Just go down there.

297
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
Just go down to that lobby because it is special.

298
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Yeah, yeah.

299
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,600
A couple of us may have done some work in there, that lobby, like writing.

300
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Oh, yeah?

301
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Yeah.

302
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Oh, you may have, huh?

303
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
That's how weird we are.

304
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
That's so great.

305
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,600
It's so, yeah, it's a really warm inviting space.

306
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Yeah, it's very tall.

307
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,600
It's meant to, like they're going for like an indoor tree vibe, I think.

308
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
That's what it feels like.

309
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,600
It's like being at the bottom of a redwood forest.

310
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:59,600
I love the Tiffany lamps too, the sort of like, those lamps, great choice by whoever designed that interior.

311
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
Yeah, that is a very strong component.

312
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
I got a Tiffany lamp at home.

313
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,600
I'm very proud of my Tiffany lamp.

314
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,600
We have Tiffany lamp night lamps.

315
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,600
Night lamps, you know.

316
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
For night, when light is needed.

317
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Lamps you only use at night.

318
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Yeah, not night yet.

319
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
Turn it off.

320
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
I love them too.

321
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
I love them.

322
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
It's just such a nice glow.

323
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,600
Yeah, what is so, and those thick little frames you're putting on about Tiffany lamps.

324
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,600
There's a husk in here.

325
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,600
I'm attracted to them, I guess.

326
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Yeah, I know.

327
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
I'm attracted to them.

328
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,600
The most amorous voice I've ever heard.

329
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,600
Yeah, I've never been so breathy on the show.

330
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,600
The arts and crafts style of all of this.

331
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Right.

332
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,600
The arts and crafts style in that whole area has, again, aged so well.

333
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
I feel like that never really goes out of fashion.

334
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
I agree.

335
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,600
They say on the tram from Mickey and Friends, they're always like, it's based on the arts and crafts movement of California.

336
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,600
Which I always thought, what is that?

337
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
What is the arts and crafts movement?

338
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,600
I never heard of that.

339
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,600
Arts and crafts movement in the early 20th century, I believe.

340
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
You don't know what you're talking about.

341
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Craftsman style goods?

342
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,600
Craftsman houses.

343
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,600
I always pictured it like people with popsicle sticks and glue.

344
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Like arts and crafts is what I think of in a child's project.

345
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,600
That's what the modern terms mean.

346
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,600
But it came about as a response to machine produced goods.

347
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,600
It was a response to that, of people making stuff more by hand.

348
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,600
That's information.

349
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
Now that's information.

350
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,600
Yeah. Now that I like.

351
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Maybe that's the thing with the Tiffany lamps is that they're clearly like hand set and the patterns are random.

352
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,600
They aren't pumped out by some lamp machine.

353
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
Right.

354
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
That's why the breathiness.

355
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
That's why I'm attracted to them.

356
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,600
People made them with their hands.

357
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,600
You see. Lovingly caressed.

358
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,600
I don't think we've ever talked about Tiffany lamps on here before.

359
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
I know what you're talking about.

360
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,600
I don't think we have. We don't have any, but I like them.

361
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:14,600
I don't know that it's the same style, but also I was always very fond of the lamp work in any 80s Pizza Hut.

362
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
Yes. And those are Tiffany lamps.

363
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
They are Tiffany lamps.

364
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Because it's like stained glass basically is what it looks like with a.

365
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Ice cream parlors too.

366
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
Yes.

367
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,600
Well that Feral's style, the original Feral's.

368
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Not the weird like failed comeback Feral's.

369
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Yeah. TGI Fridays I think had a cool vibe as well.

370
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,600
Mary, did you ever have a Pizza Hut buffet where you came from?

371
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Where you're hometown?

372
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Yeah, we had a Pizza Hut.

373
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Buffet though specifically.

374
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,600
Is that a different chain?

375
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
No, it's the same chain.

376
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
It's just they have a buffet.

377
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
It's just at lunch they would just set a bunch of pizzas out.

378
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Yes, we did have that.

379
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Okay.

380
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Because we've talked a little bit about that and I want to get deeper into that eventually on the show.

381
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Yeah.

382
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
That's a topic I'd like to.

383
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
You got to do a deep dive on it.

384
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,600
Pizza spin-off podcast deep dish.

385
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Pizza Hut did used to be kind of a themed experience.

386
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
I do remember it going.

387
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
I remember that too.

388
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
And it was like a thing to do.

389
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
Yeah.

390
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Yeah.

391
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
And you can still see those huts.

392
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
They're usually banks now.

393
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
They're banks.

394
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:22,600
There's those big, those odd tall roofs spotting this country and no longer delivering pizza anymore.

395
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Yeah.

396
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
It's a bummer.

397
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
It is a real bummer.

398
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,600
What's happened to this nation of ours?

399
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
See?

400
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,600
We're falling apart.

401
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,600
First the Pizza Hut.

402
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
Go vote 2020.

403
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,600
I'll vote for any primary candidate who vows to bring back the Pizza Hut buffet.

404
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Sit down, Pizza Hut.

405
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Tiffany Lamps.

406
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
Tiffany Lamps.

407
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Pro-Lamp, pro-Tiffany Lamp candidate.

408
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
Yeah.

409
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,600
So you were a Disney, you were, you were East Coast, so you were a Disney World.

410
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Yes.

411
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
A kid.

412
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
Yes.

413
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,600
That's right.

414
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
You know what?

415
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Really quickly, but this is a tangent, but this is a themed thing.

416
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
You worked in my hometown.

417
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
I did.

418
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Is my recollection.

419
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
That's right.

420
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,600
At a very highly themed place called Medieval Times.

421
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,600
Oh baby.

422
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
Oh, Ocasianburg had a Medieval Times.

423
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Yes.

424
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,600
It still does.

425
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
Okay.

426
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
I worked there.

427
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Yeah.

428
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
Whoa.

429
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
So could we do a little side, slide, Joanne, to make no idea.

430
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,600
I was thrilled to dig in to that.

431
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Yeah.

432
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Because we, well then we also, four dough boys, we all went on a little group call a little

433
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,600
while ago, of like a year ago, and you knew someone who was working there.

434
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,600
I knew, get this, the Lord Chancellor.

435
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
Oh man.

436
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Hold on to your pants.

437
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Hold on to your shoes.

438
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,600
He was the Lord Chancellor at the Schoenberg.

439
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Right.

440
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
And he transferred to Braena Park.

441
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
And he, yes.

442
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:52,600
And he transferred there and was working, was wanting to, I feel like he was living

443
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,600
in, when I talked to him years and years ago, when he first started working at the one down

444
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,600
here, he was saying that he lived in West Hollywood.

445
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,600
And I was like, wow, that's a commute.

446
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,600
But nothing compared to the commute I did in Illinois.

447
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
What was that?

448
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,600
Were you living in Rockford or something?

449
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,600
I was living in DeKalb.

450
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
DeKalb, yeah.

451
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,600
It was 100 miles round trip.

452
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,600
And I did that commute because, and this is how much I love medieval times.

453
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:30,600
I did that commute every Friday, Saturday and Sunday and for $6.50 an hour to get paid

454
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
$6.50 an hour.

455
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,600
Plus commissions, which I never made.

456
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
How do you make commissions?

457
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,600
Well, I was a photography wench.

458
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,600
Whoa.

459
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,600
And you have to sell.

460
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:50,600
I feel like the one here in California has like, or what park is it in?

461
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Not Anaheim.

462
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Buena Park.

463
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
Buena Park.

464
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Yes.

465
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,600
I feel like they do it a little bit different, but how it was in Schomburg at the time I

466
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,600
worked there, what we did was people would come in and they would be like, okay, get

467
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,600
in front of this backdrop and hold up your table number.

468
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,600
And that was truly just so we could, once the pictures were printed, find them in the

469
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
arena and then try to sell them the picture.

470
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,600
But the pictures were so bad.

471
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,600
It was like, it would be like you come in, we would get the top of your shoulders, your

472
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,600
head, a picture of your table number, which is like, why do you want a memory of that?

473
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,600
And then seven feet of backdrop above you.

474
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
Like it was of just blue sky.

475
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Like it was, uh, that's all it is.

476
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,600
It's not like some more Nate's, uh, tapestry.

477
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,600
No, no, um, sky.

478
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,600
Yeah.

479
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Fake sky.

480
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,600
I mean, there was stuff on the edges, but like, like no one knew, no one was a professional

481
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
photographer.

482
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:50,600
Um, I say that maybe someone was, but, uh, I was definitely not.

483
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,600
And so I would like, uh, you know, and they, we were encouraged to sort of have, you know,

484
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
British accents.

485
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
And so, uh, you know, I embrace that.

486
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,600
So I was like, my Lords, my ladies, I'd like lead people in and, and like have them take

487
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,600
their picture and then right this way, enjoy your turn.

488
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Some sort of weird accent.

489
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,600
And then they would all go into the arena and we would go up to the, to the, like our

490
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,600
lab or whatever, and they would print out all the pictures and they'd print like one

491
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,600
that we'd put in the frames and then print one we put in the key chain and, and you'd

492
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,600
make a little packet and then you'd get loaded up with packets.

493
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,600
And then over the course of the show, you would like, uh, like you'd have a little

494
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,600
flashlight and I'd be like, oh, okay, I'm looking for this guy.

495
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,600
He's wearing a red shirt and they're in the blue section row three.

496
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600
And so I just sort of walk along.

497
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,600
Like you see the, you know, the people working there sort of weaving their way in, in and

498
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,600
So we, I just looked to find that person and then I'd come up to them and be like $20 for

499
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
this.

500
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,600
And some people would buy it.

501
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,600
But if they didn't buy, would you then just throw all these printed pictures in the

502
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
garbage?

503
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
Yeah.

504
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,600
Well, well, if they didn't buy it in the arena, they have one more chance after the show

505
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,600
is over, we, we like had a booth or a little section set up where we displayed all the

506
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,600
pictures and then they could come by them after the show on their way out if they decided

507
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
to.

508
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
But, um, but yeah.

509
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:16,600
Uh, and so I would do that commute 50 miles each way and I would not take any of the freeways

510
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,600
in Illinois.

511
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,600
I would only take state roads like through the back because, and I would listen to the

512
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,600
Lord of the Rings soundtrack.

513
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:35,600
Every time I was deep in it every time, cause it like got me in the mode of like, Oh, I'm

514
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
medieval.

515
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,600
You know, it was really crazy to get into character.

516
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,600
Wow.

517
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,600
We're saying is your picture.

518
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
Yes.

519
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,100
I, well, I just loved the whole vibe of it so much.

520
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,600
I'm very into atmosphere.

521
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
Like I'm really into that.

522
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,600
And that's, I think why I love amusement parks so much is that you, you get to just walk

523
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,600
into, you can believe that you're in a whole other world.

524
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,600
And you're like, you just entrenched in this atmosphere.

525
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,600
Um, and also Illinois is quite beautiful.

526
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
So you didn't mind taking these routes.

527
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
You chose to take these routes.

528
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,600
I did.

529
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
I chose.

530
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
It was fun.

531
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
Yeah.

532
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
I liked it.

533
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
How often, how many people on average would buy the photo?

534
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
Like pretty percentage wise.

535
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
From me?

536
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
Sure.

537
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,600
Yeah.

538
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,600
Well, the thing is, is I think like, because we worked on commissions, I remember there

539
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,600
was one guy who was in the, in the, in like our department who every night would sell

540
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,600
like $300.

541
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,600
He would get $300 in commission or something.

542
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,600
He was, he would go out with a massive armful of packets and would sell them all.

543
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,600
And I would maybe sell one on average.

544
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:45,600
I feel like my, my success rate was, uh, maybe I would get two or three a night and he would

545
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,600
just sell hundreds.

546
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
I don't know.

547
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,600
I think I also, I didn't, I sort of didn't believe in the pictures.

548
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,600
Like I was like, I was like, this is.

549
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Well, you were just a simple scullery made.

550
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,600
You were not committed.

551
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,600
I was not committed.

552
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
And I also felt like consumption.

553
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,600
I wanted to advise the person don't buy this.

554
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Why are you spending your money on this terrible picture?

555
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,600
I'll take a picture of you right now.

556
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,600
I'll take a picture of you right now.

557
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,600
That's like much better and like more dynamic than this.

558
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,600
Check the dumpster in an hour and you can get it for free.

559
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,600
Exactly.

560
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Did you ever do another job or were you just the photography wench?

561
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,600
I was just a photography wench.

562
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
I just did it for a summer.

563
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,600
Cause then, uh, I had to go back.

564
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,600
College started again into Calvin.

565
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,600
I couldn't do that commute when I was once that started.

566
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,600
It was over the summer that I worked there.

567
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,600
But, uh, do you ever buy a picture of yourself?

568
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,600
I think we bought the one when we, when we went with doughboys, I think, uh,

569
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,600
I think we bought that one.

570
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,600
Maybe, um, nod, nod to your past.

571
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
Yeah.

572
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,600
But my dream was to be in the show.

573
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,600
My dream was to be at the time, the princess, but now they have a

574
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,600
whole bunch of, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

575
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,600
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

576
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,600
at the time, the princess, but now they have a queen. Yes. Oh yeah. That's good.

577
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,600
So do you think you would make the, it's less, it's a less of a commute for you.

578
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,600
Honestly, it takes everything. If they offered me the role of queen,

579
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,600
I would drop everything. Let's see. I mean, including my current relationship.

580
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,600
Just kidding, Matt. Just kidding.

581
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,600
For any excuse. It sounds like I got a job. I can't offer me something.

582
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,600
If they offer me something, a pirate's dinner adventure, I'll take it too.

583
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,600
I've never been there. I hear that's very fun.

584
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,600
Uh, yes, it is fun. So listeners, if anyone has a connection to medieval times,

585
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,600
email us, offer the job to Mary and we'll see what happens.

586
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,600
We'll see what happens. You are offer only at this point.

587
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Exactly. I am offer only.

588
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,600
When it comes to medieval times, I'm offer only.

589
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,600
I do like the idea of them putting out offers like a movie or show.

590
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,600
I think it would be smart for like, if you know,

591
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,600
pirates dinner adventure is like, we want Paul of Tompkins for seven weeks.

592
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,600
We want like, we need like a novelty. Like, let's, let's get a star in here.

593
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,600
Phoenix. Oh man. Whoa.

594
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,600
Who would have to like commit and be a method.

595
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,600
Chancellor for gravelly talking about,

596
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
bring out the shrimp kebabs. Like,

597
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
exactly.

598
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,600
Kind of unhinged pretty quill, the master like sort of voice.

599
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,600
Like,

600
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
yeah,

601
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,600
this is going to, but he's going to like,

602
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,600
this is going to be bad for all the medieval incels out there.

603
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,600
They're all going to.

604
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,600
And hacked up.

605
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
Yeah.

606
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
This performance.

607
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Tuned in.

608
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,600
I am a polling a master reference when this,

609
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
this is a,

610
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
this is a,

611
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,600
this is a,

612
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
this is a,

613
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
this is a,

614
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
this is a,

615
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,600
I'm not counting a master reference when this podcast will come out right around

616
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,600
the Joker movie.

617
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,600
Oh yeah.

618
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
The Joker move.

619
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Yes.

620
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,600
Perfect.

621
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
Time to that beautifully.

622
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
We'll all know.

623
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,600
We'll know when it happens.

624
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,600
Yeah. Any, any final,

625
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,600
like was the,

626
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,600
was there a great day at medieval times?

627
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,600
Was there a weird day or was it always the same pictures and.

628
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
Yeah.

629
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,600
Yeah.

630
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:30,600
I mean it was, but I, I guess my whole vibe that I didn't really hang out with anybody

631
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,600
because I had to drive 50 miles.

632
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,600
I didn't really get to know anybody really that I worked with.

633
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,600
I sort of was like on my own journey with medieval times.

634
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,600
Like I'd show up and then once the show started and I was selling the pictures,

635
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,600
I was really just enjoying the show.

636
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,600
And again, the smell, I love the smell of medieval times.

637
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,600
And just being in that world and, and like the lights and the sound,

638
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,600
I just sort of, I almost treated it like I was,

639
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,600
I was getting to go to medieval times every night was how it felt to me.

640
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
That's fun.

641
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,600
And then, and that's probably why I didn't sell any pictures.

642
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
Did you ever get any local Illinois,

643
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,600
like the Rob Blagojevich and family ever come in or something?

644
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
I bet he did.

645
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,600
I know, not that I know of, but I also, I didn't have the finger on the pulse.

646
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Nobody really talked to me.

647
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Honestly.

648
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,600
Yeah.

649
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,600
It was like Dennis Rodman didn't come in one day.

650
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,600
He did.

651
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,600
No, he didn't.

652
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
Not that I know of.

653
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,600
Must have fortune gambling on the rock and not you.

654
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
Yeah.

655
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,600
But it was a great, it was, it was great.

656
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,600
I really loved it.

657
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
Yeah.

658
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,600
That's wild.

659
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
Yeah.

660
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
So like Schomburg, you, did you go a lot?

661
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,600
You were there.

662
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,600
I honestly think I went once or twice in the whole time I was living there,

663
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,600
which was many years of my life.

664
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,600
I also saw an independent wrestling show at medieval times.

665
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
They just set up.

666
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
They held a separate thing at medieval times.

667
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,600
What?

668
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
In the dirt?

669
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
That's a pretty big venue.

670
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
That's a pretty big venue.

671
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
Wow.

672
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,600
I saw Tatanka wrestle, a former WWE 90s wrestler, Tatanka.

673
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,600
Wow.

674
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
Wow, that's cool.

675
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,600
Wrestling obviously is cooler, but I like it when,

676
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,600
my dream is that they hold like a religious service in there,

677
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
that there's a mass at medieval times.

678
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,600
Honestly, I don't, it felt like they were renting it out so that it may have happened.

679
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,600
I don't know that to be a fact, but it may have happened.

680
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,600
It's a big space with seats.

681
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
So you got to do something with it when they're on it.

682
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,600
That being said, it's actually real close to a mega church called Willow Creek.

683
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
Okay.

684
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,600
Which honestly we should do on the show too, because it has like a massive,

685
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,600
In Schomburg?

686
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Yeah.

687
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,600
It's a massive budgeted, like big production Christmas show type place.

688
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,600
Oh, wow.

689
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
Really?

690
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
Animals?

691
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
Oh, I don't know about animals.

692
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,600
In Lancaster, there's a place called the Sight and Sound Theater,

693
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,600
and they would do the Christmas like story with live animals.

694
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,600
Wow.

695
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,600
This is, yeah, Willow Creek is like a mega church,

696
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
and it's looked right by medieval times.

697
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,600
So maybe that, maybe they didn't want to infringe on Willow Creek.

698
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
But anyway, we'll look into that.

699
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,600
And other medieval times could consider religious services.

700
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
Yes.

701
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
Sure.

702
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,600
We could rent the Buena Park medieval times out for a religious service.

703
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
We should.

704
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,600
Yeah.

705
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,600
We have so many religious services we've been wanting to do.

706
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Yeah.

707
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,600
So many ideas, so many mass ideas, so many Psalms we will never get rid of.

708
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,600
Podcasters are the new gods.

709
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Mm-hmm.

710
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
We are the prophets now.

711
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,600
Jason says he's rubbing his hands together.

712
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,600
I know, he's truly literally rubbing his hands together like an evil genius.

713
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,600
Yeah, weird.

714
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
What were you doing there?

715
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,600
Were you putting cream on or something?

716
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,600
No.

717
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,600
Cream.

718
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,600
I don't know, hand cream.

719
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
He put cream.

720
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,600
He creams up before the show.

721
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,600
Definitely creaming while recording.

722
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
Oh, Jesus.

723
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,600
Creaming out.

724
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
Creaming out.

725
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,600
Look, even Edwin's sick of this.

726
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,600
Edwin does look like he's rolling his eyes a lot of the time.

727
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
He gets it.

728
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,600
All right, so let's go back to the forest.

729
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
Let's jump.

730
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,600
We're back in the forest.

731
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
To the west.

732
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,600
Are you a fan of national parks?

733
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,600
I was wondering, like, does that make you, did that make you, like, especially have affinity for this area?

734
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,600
I am a fan of national parks.

735
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
Yeah, I love Yosemite.

736
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:32,600
I've only been a handful of times, but I really, I just love that sort of immersion in nature that's so overwhelmingly big.

737
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,600
Like, there's something about California national parks in particular.

738
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:50,600
I guess I haven't been to that many outside of California, but like I'm thinking of the Redwoods and the Sequoias, like, where there's like, it's just so massive and overwhelming and all these, like, the big boulders and the big waterfalls.

739
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,600
All of that is just very soothing to me.

740
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,600
Yeah, I feel like intimate.

741
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
That's not the word.

742
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
Infinite.

743
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
Yes.

744
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
It feels like it goes like a Joshua tree or something.

745
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,600
It's like it goes on literally forever, it feels like.

746
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,600
Yes, and it always changes my perspective.

747
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:16,600
Like it always, and there's something about stepping into that area of California adventure that gives me a little bit of that where I'm like, oh yeah, there's this whole other world out there.

748
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,600
Sure, yeah.

749
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,600
In this theme park.

750
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:29,600
Well, and there's this weird, in talking about this being the first area that worked with California Adventure, the idea of like encapsulating the California experience in one little place.

751
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:41,600
Some of that is inherently silly because Hollywood, you can go to real Hollywood up the road and that's all kind of stupid, like Hollywood tourism's all cheesy and shouldn't be recreated really.

752
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:51,600
And then like a seaside amusement park, like that area has gotten a lot more charm and it feels more like the 20s, 30s now, but when it opened, it was just kind of like chintzy carnival.

753
00:31:52,600 --> 00:32:01,600
So the national parks felt like the only thing that they were like recreating that felt elevated and where they did it justice, like they actually did get some of the national park vibe.

754
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,600
That's how I feel about it.

755
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:15,600
And even the Route 66, like over by Cars Land and everything, like the Radiator Springs and all of that, like it, I feel like they really did it right where you, it does feel very California.

756
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,600
That like ties it all together in a nice way.

757
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,600
Now there's multiple types of national parks.

758
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:26,600
There's the more Kenyan-y, red rock type and then the more pine tree, redwood sort of vibe.

759
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,600
And a large hotel in the background.

760
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:38,600
Like I haven't really gone to any of the California state or national parks, but I do like the appeal of like, and there's a really nice hotel in the middle of it.

761
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,600
These crazy old lodges.

762
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,600
The lodges, yeah, because we didn't really have those in Pennsylvania.

763
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:53,600
Like the state parks were perfectly nice and we would camp in them and all, but there wasn't like an 80 year old like, you know, luxury hotel.

764
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
Sure.

765
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
Places are nuts.

766
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,600
Like the Shining Hotel, but not scary.

767
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,600
You would like, from what you were saying, I was thinking you wanted like a hotel just right in the middle of Joshua Tree National Park.

768
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,600
Like a massive full lodge.

769
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,600
Just in dead center.

770
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,600
Oh yeah, there's not really any lodge.

771
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,600
The desert landscape, all the hotels and stuff are pretty flat.

772
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Like three or four stories maximum.

773
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,600
But like where the trees are taller, where the cliffs are taller, you make the buildings taller.

774
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,600
Joshua Tree, though, should be like a rock, a fake rock hotel.

775
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,600
That's a great idea.

776
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,600
We talk a lot about on the show about fake rocks, how much we love fake rocks.

777
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,600
I love fake rocks.

778
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,600
What is that?

779
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,600
We're not exactly sure.

780
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,600
We did a whole bracket, a tournament to determine what the best fake rocks were.

781
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
Tournament.

782
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:45,600
Sadly, Grizzly Peak did not win.

783
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,600
Sorry to tell you.

784
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,600
Grizzly Peak didn't win.

785
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
Very cool fake rocks though.

786
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,600
Radiator Springs area, Ornament Valley won.

787
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,600
Incredible.

788
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:00,600
So, but yeah, so there should be like a big fake rock hotel that looks like they just sort of carved the hotel out of a bunch of big rocks.

789
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,600
Yeah.

790
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,600
That'd be great.

791
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
Yeah.

792
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,600
Maybe that's a land, upcoming land.

793
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
To actually stay in fake rocks.

794
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,600
To stay in fake rocks.

795
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,600
That's actually the next level of our fake rock love.

796
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
Yeah.

797
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,600
To actually sleep inside one.

798
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,600
In the Madonna Inn.

799
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,600
I was just going to say Madonna Inn.

800
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,600
Madonna Inn, yes.

801
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
There's a lot of rock work.

802
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,600
I'm not even sure.

803
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,600
They're fake.

804
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,600
I think there's a lot of real rocks around.

805
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
Yeah, maybe they have real rocks.

806
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,600
But you can go, at least in the men's restroom, you can go just pee into rocks.

807
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,600
Oh yeah, we did that.

808
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,600
Yeah, your dream.

809
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,600
We did that around the same time, like at the same time, I think, when we were there.

810
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,600
We were there for a wedding.

811
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,600
Oh, okay, yeah.

812
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
And it was weird.

813
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,600
That whole, I'll be honest with you, I didn't care for it.

814
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,600
You didn't care for Madonna Inn?

815
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,600
The Madonna Inn was weird?

816
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,600
No, no, not the Madonna Inn.

817
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,600
For what?

818
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
No, the bathroom, specifically just the bathroom.

819
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,600
Oh, I see.

820
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,600
It was weird.

821
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,600
It felt like peeing into an open shower or something.

822
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,600
Yes, that's true.

823
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,600
It didn't feel like a lush waterfall.

824
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,600
It felt like a leaky pipe.

825
00:34:53,600 --> 00:35:00,600
It felt like there was a big shower in a high school gym and we were just pissing in it.

826
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
Yeah.

827
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,600
And it was like light rocks.

828
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,600
And look, I love doing everything around fake rocks.

829
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,600
You love a round of grab ass and locker room.

830
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,600
If you know me, I love a round of grab ass.

831
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,600
You love a round of grab ass.

832
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,600
That's the thing.

833
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,600
A real towel snapper.

834
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,600
Grab ass.

835
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Jason also has been working as a high school gym coach on the weekend.

836
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
Oh yeah.

837
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,600
That's why he's got that terminology in his head.

838
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,600
I love it.

839
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,600
I love telling everyone to try their best.

840
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,600
I love picking the scrawniest nerds out there.

841
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,600
I love picking the scrawniest nerdiest guys and saying, come on.

842
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,600
Come on.

843
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
Pick it up.

844
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,600
God, that's all you say?

845
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,600
I'm just doing what I learned.

846
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,600
You can't compliment them on being stronger fast.

847
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
I can't.

848
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
Because they're not.

849
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
That's true.

850
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,600
You don't want to lie.

851
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,600
You don't want to lie.

852
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,600
Yeah.

853
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
A good coach doesn't lie.

854
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,600
So that's a no on the drip drop of Madonna.

855
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,600
Yeah.

856
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,600
Well, I'm sorry to tell you, Grizzly Peak didn't fare that well in the final four.

857
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,600
I understand.

858
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,600
One of the issues, at least that I had, I might have poisoned the water, is that I've

859
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:09,600
felt a lot of confusion about whether the, even though we, if you know it's called Grizzly

860
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,600
Peak, then you know that the big rock is supposed to be a bear.

861
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,600
Yes.

862
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,600
But I've heard confusion over is it in fact supposed to be a coyote or a wolf or a wolf.

863
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
Interesting.

864
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:25,600
And this is compounded further by the story behind Grizzly Peak, the mountain.

865
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,600
Right on.

866
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
Amazing.

867
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,600
Amazing transition.

868
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,600
That was a story time.

869
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,600
That was gorgeous, Jason.

870
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,600
The legend of Grizzly Peak.

871
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:40,600
Long ago, Ah-ha-lay, the coyote, met Oosu-ma-tee, the grizzly bear on top of the mountain.

872
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,600
Seeing the grizzly was powerful.

873
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,600
The coyote asked him to watch over and protect the land.

874
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:52,600
Then one day people came and tried to chase Oosu-ma-tee from the mountain.

875
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,600
But grizzly was strong and held his ground.

876
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:00,600
When the coyote saw the brave bear standing alone against so many, he turned Oosu-ma-tee

877
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,600
into stone so that he could never be driven away.

878
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,600
That almost made me cry.

879
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
Yes.

880
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:12,600
When you said when you saw the brave bear, I'm gonna cry.

881
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,600
The idea of a brave bear is great.

882
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:19,600
I don't know why that's making me so emotional.

883
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,600
I think brave applied to an animal.

884
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,600
It's just really nice.

885
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,600
I know.

886
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,600
Brave dog.

887
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,600
We can take a minute if you need.

888
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,600
I need a second.

889
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,600
No, that is beautiful.

890
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:39,600
I mean, what a, it's kind of a strange way to force a creature to stay.

891
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:45,600
Yeah, that's my, that's why I'm not tearing up about it is that I have my concerns about

892
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:52,600
freezing a bear in stone state, petrifying him forever so he can't move.

893
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,600
Right.

894
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,600
This is what Putin did to that one guy.

895
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,600
He turned that guy to stone.

896
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,600
Remember?

897
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,600
Remember?

898
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:06,600
Yeah, there's a guy, there's like an enemy of Putin who he injected with some drug and

899
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,600
then his face popped up.

900
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
A bark bench in London?

901
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
Ew.

902
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
Oh, God.

903
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,600
No, man, I don't, it's a little too exaggerated to say Putin turned someone to stone, but

904
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,600
that's a more fun way to put it.

905
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,600
But a guy got like a, he got like a big craggy face.

906
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Oh my God.

907
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
He got poisoned.

908
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:27,600
I mean, he claims he didn't do it, but, and I, you know, I should, I should like our president

909
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,600
choose to believe him, but I tell you, he didn't do the stone thing.

910
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,600
But I don't know, he said he didn't do it.

911
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,600
But I don't know, I think there's something a little malicious about a coyote turning

912
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,600
a bear to stone.

913
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:47,600
Well, and that the bear was frozen in a position that I associate more with wolves than coyote,

914
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,600
which is howling upwards at the sky.

915
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,600
Right.

916
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Maybe perhaps howling, don't turn me to stone.

917
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,600
Please, please don't do this.

918
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,600
Right.

919
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,600
It's like the Vesuvius.

920
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:06,600
I do sort of feel like, though, coyote dogs and bears are similar looking in their snout.

921
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,600
In their snout, for sure.

922
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:13,600
I could see, I see a semblance there where, you know, if you're not seeing the rest of

923
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,600
the body, you know what I mean?

924
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,600
We're just going off face.

925
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,600
Which we are.

926
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,600
We don't see a big old bear butt.

927
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,600
No, there's no bear butt.

928
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,600
And there's no coyote tits.

929
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,600
You know, what are you going to go off of?

930
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
You got to go off the face.

931
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,600
No big jiggly coyote tits.

932
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,600
Jiggly.

933
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,600
I think those are two, we usually do like a plus up at the end, but for this area, those

934
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,600
are two plus ups I wouldn't mind.

935
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
Yeah.

936
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,600
The butt and the tits.

937
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,600
Yeah, some coyote tits.

938
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
Teeths, I should say.

939
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
Teeths, yeah, yeah.

940
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
We shouldn't be so crude.

941
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:54,600
So proud of the brave bear that the coyote raised their tits in celebration.

942
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
And that to the legend.

943
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,600
Yeah, it is.

944
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,600
It's a good, like, if you know what you're looking at, it's a very cool rock structure

945
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,600
thing, but I can see, yeah, it's a little bit obscured, which I like.

946
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,600
I think I made the point that I kind of liked that there was mystery surrounding it.

947
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,600
I like that too.

948
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,600
So then you can, and you can see it more when you're on the actual ride.

949
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,600
It's always sort of in the distance, which I like, which is cool.

950
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,600
It's like not such a visible thing.

951
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:27,600
Well, some articles have pointed out, as Jason said, the trees have grown very much in the

952
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,600
20 years that California Adventure has been open.

953
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:34,600
So you could see the bear a lot better upon opening, but now those trees have climbed

954
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,600
and climbed.

955
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,600
And I haven't said, I think it was on this website, Yesterland, that somebody said that

956
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,600
it looks like, they think it looks like a bear drowning in a sea of trees.

957
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
I'm not sure I agree with.

958
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
Jesus Christ.

959
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
Yeah, I think he's doing OK.

960
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:51,600
I think it's a proud, brave yell, but that was their take.

961
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:58,600
Also, the presence, you get a whimsical bear next to this attraction too at the entrance.

962
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
Oh, he's funny.

963
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,600
This is fun.

964
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,600
This is the best.

965
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:07,600
Now, this is him in his present state with more, leaning more towards the national parks

966
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,600
vibe.

967
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,600
You can see he's got a wooden oar.

968
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,600
A number of years ago, he was a little more of an extreme sports bear.

969
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,600
That's a very modern aluminum wood.

970
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,600
He's got a cool logo, 90s logo.

971
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,600
Wow.

972
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,600
Yeah.

973
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,600
He also, this bear, sports bear.

974
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,600
This bear is fantastic.

975
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,600
First of all, I just want to say that on record.

976
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,600
He's about what we say, 30 feet tall.

977
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,600
He's very large.

978
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,600
Is he 20 or 25?

979
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,600
He's very tall.

980
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,600
He's a big boy.

981
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,600
I do appreciate that he's wearing a life jacket because I think that's a good message.

982
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,600
Even a bear.

983
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
Even a bear.

984
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
Yeah.

985
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,600
Needs a flotation device.

986
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,600
Even a bear.

987
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:51,600
I mean, you see some of those nature shows and they eat it in the rivers a lot.

988
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,600
They're fine, but they're swatting for fish and they'll fall in sometimes.

989
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,600
Yeah.

990
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,600
They need a life jacket.

991
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,600
Safety first.

992
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,600
That bear right now is holding a Halloween bucket.

993
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,600
What?

994
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,600
Is he?

995
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,600
I saw a picture of it last night.

996
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,600
He's holding a little trick or treat bucket.

997
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,600
And then at Christmas, they take the vest off and put a Christmas sweater on him.

998
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,600
And this is the greatest bear other than the country bears in the Disney parks.

999
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,600
Does this bear have a name?

1000
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,600
I looked for it and we couldn't.

1001
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,600
I don't believe so.

1002
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,600
They haven't given him any backstory.

1003
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,600
It's odd that Disney names everything.

1004
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,600
Why does this bear not have a name?

1005
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,600
He has no backstory.

1006
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,600
He must have a name.

1007
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,600
I Googled pretty thoroughly.

1008
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,600
Is he supposed to be the bear from Grin and Barrett?

1009
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,600
The goofy?

1010
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,600
Is that Donald or Goofy?

1011
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,600
That's Humphrey.

1012
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,600
That bear is portrayed elsewhere.

1013
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:45,600
That's Humphrey the bear and he's in those like drying stations that they put out sometimes.

1014
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,600
Oh, yes.

1015
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,600
He wasn't always.

1016
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,600
He is now.

1017
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,600
He's not always.

1018
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,600
Yeah.

1019
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,600
So this is a nameless bear.

1020
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,600
We could name the bear on the episode, I guess, today.

1021
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,600
I want to name the bear.

1022
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,600
Okay, Mary.

1023
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,600
Oh, I don't.

1024
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,600
This is an idea for a name.

1025
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,600
We can debate.

1026
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,600
We should all throw out names.

1027
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,600
I'm willing to let you just do it.

1028
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,600
The first one that came to my mind, Canoe.

1029
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,600
Canoe the bear.

1030
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,600
Canoe the bear.

1031
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:12,600
Is it spelled like canoe or is it like kind of like a K-A-N-U?

1032
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,600
Closer to Keanu.

1033
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,600
Oh, yeah.

1034
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,600
I guess in my head it was spelled like canoe.

1035
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,600
Okay.

1036
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,600
What do you guys think?

1037
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,600
What's a good name?

1038
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,600
Canoe.

1039
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,600
Ansel?

1040
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,600
In honor of Ansel Adams, nature photographer?

1041
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,600
No.

1042
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,600
You don't want to call him Ansel?

1043
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,600
That's a great name.

1044
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,600
Or John.

1045
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,600
John or Muir.

1046
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,600
John or Muir?

1047
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,600
There's John Muir references everywhere.

1048
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,600
That's cute.

1049
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,600
We call the bear Muir.

1050
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,600
Muir.

1051
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,600
Okay, so far in the pile is Muir and Canoe.

1052
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,600
Those are the two ideas we have.

1053
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,600
Scott, do you have an idea?

1054
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:55,600
What about, would you be spelled different, but like the star of the show you're on, Rory.

1055
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,600
Rory.

1056
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,600
You could be Rory.

1057
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,600
That's cute.

1058
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,600
You could maybe put an A in there.

1059
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,600
Oh, that's good.

1060
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,600
Well, this is a little inside reference.

1061
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,600
When we first got Edwin, I would call him Edwin and then when he was bad, I would call

1062
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,600
him Rory.

1063
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:13,600
And as I'm saying this, he's hawking up a hairball.

1064
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,600
Mic by him.

1065
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,600
Are you okay, pal?

1066
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,600
I guess he's okay.

1067
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,600
Whoa.

1068
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,600
Wait, sorry.

1069
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,600
You.

1070
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,600
I'll wait.

1071
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,600
That's the anecdote again.

1072
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,600
Yes.

1073
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,600
Yeah.

1074
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,600
Because it was so good.

1075
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,600
Edwin, I used to call Edwin Rory when he was bad when we first got him.

1076
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,600
He had two personalities.

1077
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,600
Really?

1078
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,600
No.

1079
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,600
He was Rory when he was bad.

1080
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:41,600
So my cat Brenda is usually a little bit feisty, a little bit of a, we call her a moody teen

1081
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,760
because she usually wants to be by herself and to try to pet and she bites.

1082
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,600
But if she decides to be affectionate, then she is frienda.

1083
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:58,360
So I also have a dual pet nature and a naming system to acknowledge this.

1084
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:01,360
Mary dual pet naming structure at all.

1085
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,360
Oh, nope.

1086
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,360
Just in one name.

1087
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,360
All right.

1088
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,360
Whatever.

1089
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:13,480
Because that one name, well then whatever.

1090
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:18,560
That one name just, pets are complicated and just like humans and just like my name, Mary,

1091
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,920
encompasses all sides of me, the dark and the light.

1092
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,280
So too do my pet's names.

1093
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,600
We contain multitudes.

1094
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,080
We contain multitudes.

1095
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,080
Yeah.

1096
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:36,060
It's nice to have a sort of like clear, okay, now she's frienda and now she's safe to approach.

1097
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:41,240
It's like, I consider it almost, it's like the plus, it's like a, like a different state

1098
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,720
of Mario, like Tanooki suit.

1099
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,720
Now you're super Mario, right?

1100
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,720
Right, right.

1101
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,720
Yeah, that makes sense.

1102
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,720
That's funny.

1103
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,720
Yeah.

1104
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,720
The treat to meet frienda.

1105
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,120
My name for the bear would be Michael.

1106
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,120
Well wait a minute.

1107
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,120
My God.

1108
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,120
Awfully selfish.

1109
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,160
This is no, no, no.

1110
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,160
I will not let this stand.

1111
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,160
Wait, okay, did I want to name the bear Mary?

1112
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,160
Okay.

1113
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,160
No.

1114
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,160
This is what you were bound to unleash.

1115
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,160
Now I gotta throw Scott in the mix.

1116
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,160
Do I want it to be named Scott?

1117
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,160
I don't know, but Jason still wants Ansel.

1118
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,160
I'm doubling down on Ansel.

1119
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,160
Jason's going to win just because we all got split up.

1120
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,160
Yeah.

1121
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,200
Yeah.

1122
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,200
You also though want us to call you Ansel in real life.

1123
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,200
Yeah, it's not catching on.

1124
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,200
I'm like cousin Greg on Succession going, I'm Greg right now.

1125
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,200
No one listens to him.

1126
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,200
So that bear is fantastic.

1127
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:46,200
Yeah, like I take a photo of that bear every time I walk by.

1128
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,200
Yeah, and that Christmas sweater is great.

1129
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,200
That's a great idea.

1130
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,200
I love that.

1131
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,200
Jason, you brought up Humphrey the bear.

1132
00:46:54,240 --> 00:47:03,240
So this is a really specific like these like 50s era Disney cartoons set in national parks

1133
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:08,240
where there was a bear who was like it would not be a bear.

1134
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:14,240
It's the Pluto goofy rules where it's more of an animal than a Humphrey doesn't really

1135
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,240
talk, right?

1136
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,240
Right.

1137
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,240
Humphrey is more animal than anthropomorphized.

1138
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,240
And I always liked these things.

1139
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:27,280
And they featured another guy who's in the parks, who's featured now as the narration

1140
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,280
on the Grizzly River Run ride.

1141
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,280
This fellow, this park ranger.

1142
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,280
Oh, yeah.

1143
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,280
See Ring a Bell?

1144
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,280
He's seen this dude and his name.

1145
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:41,280
He's very rarely named, but only in one thing is he named Jay Audubon Woodlore.

1146
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,280
He rocks.

1147
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,280
Great name.

1148
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,280
Yeah, I really like him.

1149
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,280
It really takes you a bit.

1150
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:51,280
Like there was this era of like, I think we've talked about like the domestic Disney characters.

1151
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:57,320
You have a little statue in your home of domestic Mickey with a yellow polo shirt.

1152
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:01,320
Like when he became a homeowner, he said he wasn't like struggling and working little

1153
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,320
odd jobs anymore.

1154
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:06,320
He bought a house, he settled down and like Chip and Dale are causing problems in his

1155
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,320
house, but he's mellow.

1156
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,320
Right.

1157
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:13,320
This was filled with like, you know, goofy's taking all these trips and trying out sports.

1158
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,320
I think Donald's version of it was going to these national parks.

1159
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:19,320
I really liked all these commercials, all these commercials, all these, all these shorts.

1160
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:23,360
But there was this one, there's one moment with Jay Audubon Woodlore.

1161
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,360
Does anybody know this offhand?

1162
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:30,360
When I Googled him, there's this one moment that stands out and it's on YouTube and hopefully

1163
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,360
it's queued up correctly.

1164
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:37,360
But he's giving Donald the rules of his visits to the national park.

1165
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,360
And here is this.

1166
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,360
Welcome to Brownstone National Park.

1167
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,360
Now a few rules.

1168
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:48,360
No hunting, no fishing, no swimming, no drinking, no fires, no going over the end bed if you

1169
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,400
don't do that.

1170
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:54,400
And remember, don't molest the bears.

1171
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,400
Don't molest the bears.

1172
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,400
I think a more common everyday word back then.

1173
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,400
We just say bother.

1174
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,400
Like molest star, like the Spanish for molestar.

1175
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,400
Yeah, yeah.

1176
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,400
It just today really stands out and really jumped out of me in the Google imaging for

1177
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,400
Jay Audubon Woodlore.

1178
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,400
But just as true today.

1179
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,400
Don't molest the bears.

1180
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,440
Don't molest anyone.

1181
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,440
Yeah.

1182
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,440
Or anything.

1183
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,440
Yes.

1184
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,440
That rule applies to all species and maybe especially bears.

1185
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,440
Not especially bears, it's all legal.

1186
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,440
But bears will retaliate in a way that maybe.

1187
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,440
Yes.

1188
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,440
Yeah, you're really asking for a mauling if you.

1189
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,440
You're asking for a mauling.

1190
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,440
That character was ahead of his time, maybe.

1191
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,440
Yes.

1192
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,440
I like to think that.

1193
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,440
Like just getting out of, yeah, getting out in front of it.

1194
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,440
Wait, I don't recognize him though from the ride.

1195
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,440
When does he come up?

1196
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,480
Will you hear his voice now?

1197
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:51,480
If you've gone recently, he does the safety instructions.

1198
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,480
Oh, OK.

1199
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,480
Apparently it used to be.

1200
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,480
This is wild.

1201
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,480
This is what?

1202
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,480
Extreme sports guy.

1203
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,480
I don't know.

1204
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,480
What was he?

1205
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,480
He was a rafting safety.

1206
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,480
He was a rafting instructor.

1207
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:07,480
Named Bumper McFerrin.

1208
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,480
What?

1209
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,480
This might be the bear does it.

1210
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,480
The bear, whoever one takes pictures of, doesn't have a name, but they named an unseen voice

1211
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,520
Bumper McFerrin.

1212
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,520
Bumper is a great name.

1213
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,520
So pretty good.

1214
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:23,520
Think to 2001 as this park is opening, the X Games still popular.

1215
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,520
They did X Games stuff in the park.

1216
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,520
In the park.

1217
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:33,520
And so the queue had a lot of like extreme sports kind of paraphernalia, even as it's

1218
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:39,520
surrounded by like giant trees and like a craftsman style hotel.

1219
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,520
Yeah, weird.

1220
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,520
That was Bumper McFerrin.

1221
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,560
Bumper McFerrin.

1222
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,560
And why sounds like that?

1223
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,560
Like he had that kind of.

1224
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,560
Yeah.

1225
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,560
Why McFerrin?

1226
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,560
Are they trying to reference Bobby McFerrin?

1227
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,560
Don't worry.

1228
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:54,560
Be happy.

1229
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:58,560
That seems like that sort of writer's room kind of like create.

1230
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:02,560
It's the name, the uncanny valley of names.

1231
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,560
You're like, you come up with the first name, like, what do we call this guy?

1232
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,560
Like, yeah, Bumper.

1233
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,560
Yeah.

1234
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,560
OK.

1235
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,560
Bumper Johnson.

1236
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,600
Well, and Mick is very comedy.

1237
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,600
That's like very comedy.

1238
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,600
Like Mick's silly face.

1239
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,600
That's like a random naming mechanism.

1240
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,600
Yeah.

1241
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,600
But McFerrin's pretty specific.

1242
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,600
Yeah.

1243
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,600
They were probably all Bobby McFerrin fans.

1244
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,600
I mean, aren't we all?

1245
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,600
Sure.

1246
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,600
They like the message.

1247
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,600
So that's probably it.

1248
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,600
Yeah.

1249
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,600
Will, you know, like how they've put Rex on something else, will Bumper McFerrin ever come

1250
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:40,640
back in the parks?

1251
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,600
Because like they've taken now in Star Wars land there used to be the pilot of Star

1252
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,600
Tours Rex.

1253
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,600
That's a toy of him.

1254
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,600
He's now DJing in the Cantina.

1255
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,600
Will Bumper.

1256
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,600
Oh, that's cool.

1257
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,600
Really nice reference to an old thing.

1258
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,600
Will.

1259
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,600
But like maybe it'll take 20 years for Bumper to come back.

1260
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,600
But like he'll show up in a new ride eventually.

1261
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,600
I hope so.

1262
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,600
Yeah.

1263
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,600
Seems like he'd be a good DJ.

1264
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,600
Yeah.

1265
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,600
DJ for the Rapids ride.

1266
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,600
Yeah.

1267
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,600
When they do the DJ, the Rapids club.

1268
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,600
When you get on it, you are on a big turntable.

1269
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,600
Oh, it's so cool.

1270
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,600
I love it.

1271
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,600
Those things weird you out though.

1272
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:20,600
The like when you step on and off, it's like that like ghostly.

1273
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,600
Yeah.

1274
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,600
Like getting on an escalator that's not moving.

1275
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,600
Yeah.

1276
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,600
I think it's super.

1277
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:31,600
I think I almost think that's part of the ride is like getting on that turntable and

1278
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,600
timing it perfectly so that you get into your raft.

1279
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:39,600
You have a little like job that you step off the stairs and then you got to like scurry

1280
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,600
over and not let the weird motion sickness get to you.

1281
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,600
Yeah.

1282
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:49,600
And you got to get on your in your raft efficiently before it like goes.

1283
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,600
Like you have a lot to do.

1284
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,600
You got to stuff everything into that little space in the middle.

1285
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,600
Yeah.

1286
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,600
And like eight people's worth of stuff and purses and bags and backpacks don't necessarily

1287
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,600
fit.

1288
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,600
Yeah.

1289
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,600
It's a little stressful I think getting on these things.

1290
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,600
But you like it.

1291
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,600
I like the interaction with it.

1292
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,600
Like I feel the same way about food.

1293
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,600
Like I like interacting with food.

1294
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,600
I love crab legs.

1295
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,600
I love Korean barbecue.

1296
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,600
I like I like working with the food.

1297
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,600
Oh, sure.

1298
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,600
And and I feel the same way about rides where I like have a job to do.

1299
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,600
I like that.

1300
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,600
I love a moving platform.

1301
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:25,600
Like I think that is my natural state of being is stepping onto a moving platform or like

1302
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,600
at an airport.

1303
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,600
Natural state.

1304
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,600
Oh, the moving sidewalks.

1305
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,600
I'm like, oh, moving.

1306
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,600
I got to get on the moving sidewalk.

1307
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,600
Never miss it.

1308
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,600
He's calling to me.

1309
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:39,600
It's man wants to be near flowing water, which I do.

1310
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,600
But also I want to be by those moving walkways.

1311
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,600
Yeah.

1312
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,600
I got to get on motion.

1313
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,600
You want the floor to be taking you where you have to go at all times.

1314
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:52,600
I given me a little extra boosts, like a little a little help along the way.

1315
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,600
It's like having bionic implants.

1316
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,600
Like you feel like you're 10 percent robot when you're on a moving sidewalk.

1317
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,600
Feels great.

1318
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:04,600
I mean, I probably just have positive childhood memories of like you usually was at an airport

1319
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,600
or a theme park.

1320
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,600
I'm going to somewhere I like.

1321
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,600
I'm excited to go to.

1322
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,600
Yeah.

1323
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,600
Yeah, I know.

1324
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,600
It has positive.

1325
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:16,600
And also there's something we were drawn to, like kinetic energy, like movement is like

1326
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,600
very it's it's I don't know.

1327
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,600
It's exciting.

1328
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:25,600
It gets you like, oh, we're moving like it's that's I think one of the appeals of this

1329
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,600
area is there's a lot of greenery.

1330
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,600
I think like a lot of green space goes a long way.

1331
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,600
Yeah, I agree.

1332
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:36,600
A lot of kinetic energy from the rafts and the flowing water.

1333
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,600
I mean, there's lots of look at there's multiple lookout points where you can just watch the

1334
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,600
ride.

1335
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,600
You can watch the river.

1336
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,600
So far, a big conveyor belt and the windmill.

1337
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,600
And yeah, the milk.

1338
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,600
There's a beautiful I mean, there's that little trail.

1339
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:53,600
I don't know what if they call it Grizzly River Trail, Grizzly.

1340
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:58,600
There's a big sign that says Grizzly Peak Pass, but you can go behind the ride and follow

1341
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,600
this trail.

1342
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,600
That's the best secret.

1343
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,600
That's one of the best places to go in California Adventure.

1344
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,600
And I say secret just because I feel like nobody goes back there.

1345
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,600
Right.

1346
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,600
Because it's like added more and more details and stuff over the years.

1347
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,600
Carts and quiet.

1348
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,600
It's quiet.

1349
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,600
It's quiet.

1350
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,600
Quietest part, I feel like of the whole place.

1351
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:21,600
And then at night, it's like you can just sit out on that or you can like stand on a

1352
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,600
little like plat.

1353
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:26,600
There's a couple different like little bridge type platforms.

1354
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,600
I, my best friend and I went to Disneyland and we spent the whole day there.

1355
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:34,600
And it was like, I think California Adventure was closing at like 10 or something.

1356
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,600
And we had gotten dinner in California Adventure.

1357
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,600
We had some more.

1358
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,600
And we it was like nine o'clock and we were like, oh, the rides are still open.

1359
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:47,600
That's my favorite time to do rides at Disneyland or California Adventure because they're

1360
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:51,600
definitely not as crowded and they're they're a whole different experience.

1361
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,600
Like like Big Thunder Road at night is like the best.

1362
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,600
The best returns in Grizzly River runs the same way.

1363
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,600
It was empty.

1364
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:06,600
It was just me and Catherine and we just like it was so fun, like weaving our way through

1365
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:11,600
the line and then there are the like where the line is and you're like in this canoe

1366
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,600
shack or whatever as you're going through to get to the platform.

1367
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:18,600
And then we got in the raft and we went around.

1368
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,600
It was just us in the raft.

1369
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,600
There was no one else in the raft in front or behind us.

1370
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:26,600
And then when we came around to like get off, we were like, can we just stay?

1371
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,600
And the guy was like, yeah.

1372
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:32,600
And so we just did the ride over and over and over.

1373
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,600
Yeah.

1374
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:38,600
It was either Catherine took a picture of me once from it and it's the happiest I've ever lived.

1375
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,600
It was the most fun.

1376
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,600
Do you know how many times you went on total like three or was it more?

1377
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,600
I feel like five.

1378
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,600
Wow.

1379
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,600
Because you just like, why not?

1380
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:55,600
And it's like normally the line during the day, especially during a hot day, it's like two hours or something.

1381
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,600
It can be really bad.

1382
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,600
And there's like not a lot going on in that line.

1383
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,600
It's super boring.

1384
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:04,600
So to feel like you're getting that for you don't even have to do it.

1385
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:05,600
You don't even have to get out.

1386
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,600
You don't have to walk.

1387
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,600
Wonderful.

1388
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,600
It was fun.

1389
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,600
Rapids are one of the easiest ones to like, can we go again?

1390
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,600
Yes.

1391
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,600
Because it's such work getting in and out.

1392
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,600
Totally.

1393
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,600
It's really rewarding.

1394
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,600
But it's also like pretty easy.

1395
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:27,600
Like you're not going to hit like, no, you can't stay in the pass a steel beam before it gets loaded again.

1396
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,600
Right.

1397
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,600
It just is.

1398
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,600
Yes.

1399
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,600
It's a cycle.

1400
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,600
So yeah, you couldn't just stay on the Haunted Mansion.

1401
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,600
I don't know what happens between the unload and the load.

1402
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,600
I don't know.

1403
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,600
Decapitating machine.

1404
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,600
Yeah.

1405
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,600
That's where they get the ghosts.

1406
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,600
There's no stove.

1407
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,600
That's where they get the ghosts.

1408
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,600
It's a ghost maker.

1409
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,600
Oh my gosh.

1410
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,600
That's so funny.

1411
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,600
Do you think they get all those ghosts?

1412
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,600
Yeah.

1413
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,600
Do you do poncho or no poncho?

1414
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,600
What do you feel about a poncho?

1415
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,600
No poncho.

1416
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,600
No poncho.

1417
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,600
Do you think that's a sign of weakness if you need a poncho on a ride like that?

1418
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,600
Honestly, no.

1419
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,600
No, I don't.

1420
00:57:54,600 --> 00:58:07,700
Because I get it if you're wearing something like, or if you got like a

1421
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,740
expensive camera or whatever.

1422
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,620
I understand that.

1423
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:18,780
But I think that's part of the, for me, I definitely don't judge other people if they're

1424
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:19,780
doing it.

1425
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:27,260
But for me, I'm like, I'm no poncho because that's the experience of it.

1426
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:32,180
That's the fun of it is getting wet and then getting dry after by being out in the park.

1427
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:35,540
So you don't have the germ concern.

1428
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:36,540
There is the-

1429
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:37,540
Love germs.

1430
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:39,380
I'm here to welcome them here.

1431
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:44,660
Yeah, I have zero germ concern, maybe to a not great degree.

1432
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:49,420
But I'm not even worried even a little bit.

1433
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:53,340
And part of me is like, why not strengthen my immune system?

1434
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,340
Like I'm sort of-

1435
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:57,740
You drink a little of the water too every time?

1436
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:58,740
Yeah, I drink a little bit.

1437
00:58:58,740 --> 00:58:59,740
Some of that's getting in your mouth.

1438
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,740
Some of that water is probably going in your mouth.

1439
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:02,740
100%.

1440
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:03,740
If you're laughing, you're having a good time.

1441
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:04,740
If you're laughing, you're drinking.

1442
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:12,020
If you are on the Dower Rapids ride, if someone's like, imagine someone upset looking on a water

1443
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:13,020
ride.

1444
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:15,020
I don't just have my mouth open the whole ride.

1445
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:18,180
I would if I could.

1446
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:22,660
But I've never caught a stray drop in my mouth.

1447
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:27,780
But even if I did, I don't know.

1448
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:32,380
You've gotten mist though, probably in your mouth because the mist is all over the place.

1449
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:33,380
Sure, sure.

1450
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:35,020
That's still some water.

1451
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:36,020
I'll take it.

1452
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:37,020
I'm fine with it.

1453
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:38,020
I love it.

1454
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,460
I mean, I'm good with it.

1455
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:44,860
I have to say one of my other natural states is being soaking wet in full clothing.

1456
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:48,820
So I don't mind walking around.

1457
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,940
These are natural states.

1458
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:55,780
Just from being, I feel very serene just from going to so many theme parks.

1459
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:59,860
If I took you out on the balcony here and soaked you with the hose, would you be upset?

1460
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:00,860
Soaked you?

1461
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:04,100
If it came without warning.

1462
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,500
But if I was prepared, I would just come back in and continue the show.

1463
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:10,260
The image of you hosing down jazz.

1464
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:13,380
Oh, I know.

1465
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:14,700
There's a hose right there.

1466
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:15,700
It's so tempting.

1467
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,180
Yeah, we can hose them down right now.

1468
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:20,500
I mean, I have some errands to run after this.

1469
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,500
So you'll be wet for them.

1470
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,500
You'll be in your natural state.

1471
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,620
I know, but other people might be surprised.

1472
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:28,900
Like, you can get away with it on property.

1473
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,980
I don't want to unnerve people.

1474
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:35,300
I mean, context, context is king.

1475
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,340
You think people might be scared.

1476
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:41,380
Oh, a wet man like a soaking wet man in a CVS.

1477
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:43,620
Like, I don't know. I might be a little concerned.

1478
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:44,980
I saw that. I would be a little.

1479
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:47,180
Because what if it's gasoline?

1480
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:49,580
Well, yeah, I don't know.

1481
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,820
Now you're writing.

1482
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:54,980
What if he looks like you're writing falling down to like,

1483
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:58,100
I don't know what's as a crazy gassed up guy

1484
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:59,180
walking in every store.

1485
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:01,140
I think the CVS employees would be like,

1486
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:03,420
oh, my God, there's a soaking wet man here.

1487
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:06,380
But he looks like he's the happiest a man could be.

1488
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:08,740
Yeah, he's either having a great day or a bad day.

1489
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,180
So serene.

1490
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:13,180
Hi, everybody.

1491
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:14,180
Hi, everybody.

1492
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:16,620
Just throwing water everywhere.

1493
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:20,100
This is all why Jason voluntarily did the ice bucket challenge

1494
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,180
hundreds of times.

1495
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:23,180
I didn't record it.

1496
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,820
Yeah, yeah, not all for camera.

1497
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:25,620
Record it.

1498
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:28,140
Stop challenging more people.

1499
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:28,660
Just for fun.

1500
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,220
I challenge Jason.

1501
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:36,060
And it's himself back infinite loop of ice bucket challenge.

1502
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:38,940
Oh, man.

1503
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:40,380
What else is part of this experience?

1504
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:42,580
You know, what doesn't happen on this particular rabbit ride

1505
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:46,100
is the thing where people like pay a little bit of money and then like blast

1506
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:50,260
you like fire cannons or make geysers go off.

1507
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:53,460
Like sometimes water rapids rise.

1508
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,540
Or other flu.

1509
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,940
Dudley Do-Right does that in Orlando, an Islands of Adventure.

1510
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:02,620
And then you could sort of do it on the new way.

1511
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,500
I'm blanking on what the knots right now.

1512
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:08,460
Calico Calico River Rapids and Knotsberry Farm.

1513
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:11,020
Very fun. If you're looking for even more.

1514
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:12,180
I've never been to Knotsberry Farm.

1515
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,860
Oh, we got to go.

1516
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:14,900
Big recommends.

1517
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:18,700
And same manufacturer as this ride Intamin

1518
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:19,580
Oh, really?

1519
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:21,380
Constructed both of these rides.

1520
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:25,540
The Collie River Rapids in that Disney's Animal Kingdom.

1521
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:27,580
And California Screamin and a ton. Yes.

1522
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:30,100
Yeah, they've constructed a lot of stuff.

1523
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:34,340
But they made the first rapids ride at Astro World.

1524
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,740
Oh, yeah.

1525
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:39,900
I think they may have made all rapids rides like I've always been like,

1526
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:41,860
oh, rapids rides have this and this and this.

1527
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:46,620
And that may partially be because one manufacturer makes the ball.

1528
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:51,140
But I find I don't get super wet on this ride a lot of times.

1529
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:54,540
Yeah, I go through.

1530
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,180
I have gotten very wet.

1531
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:59,420
Yeah. And then I have also escaped unscathed.

1532
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:01,900
They can turn it up if they want.

1533
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:03,620
That's the that's the secret.

1534
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:04,460
Is it? Yeah.

1535
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:06,300
And the hot in the hot days.

1536
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:07,820
Also, it's not that much of a secret.

1537
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:11,940
In the hot days, they can crank the water level up so it'll soak everybody more.

1538
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:14,220
And if it's colder, they can turn it down.

1539
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,900
I think Splash Mountain does that, too. Right.

1540
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:16,860
It does. Yeah.

1541
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:20,100
It's the same. Like there's levels of how wet they will get everybody.

1542
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:24,340
I think in California, especially they they scale it back when it

1543
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:26,100
because it does get colder out here.

1544
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:28,820
All of them. All water. Jurassic World, too.

1545
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:31,100
My question about Splash Mountain would be

1546
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:37,100
that like they turn it up and down, like on the last big drop.

1547
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:42,100
But the real place you get soaked is that like second to last drop

1548
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:45,460
because it just a gallons of water slowly enters.

1549
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:47,020
It's like a soup into the.

1550
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:49,940
Yeah, it soaps in and soaks your pants like crazy.

1551
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:51,420
And I feel like they can't.

1552
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:53,260
I feel like they can't turn that off.

1553
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:55,060
Yeah, I feel like that's not a setting.

1554
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:56,180
I think that's just like a thing.

1555
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:58,020
That's just where water has gathered.

1556
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:02,380
And you're going to just go to displacement and volume like.

1557
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:05,300
Yeah, exactly. A tennis ball in a bucket.

1558
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:08,180
Yeah. So like the end is like they can change it.

1559
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:12,380
But I feel like that souping of your pants, that's going to be forever.

1560
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,300
Mike. Hmm.

1561
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:17,500
Be honest. Did you soup your pants?

1562
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,100
It's not the right.

1563
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:19,740
It's not the right.

1564
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:24,140
Is it? I guess I will admit I did soup my pants.

1565
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,900
Soup my pants is such a.

1566
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,420
The drop is scary.

1567
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:29,460
Is it scary? Is souped them?

1568
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:30,500
I end up souping.

1569
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,900
Mom, I souped my pants again.

1570
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:35,100
Michael, it's every day.

1571
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:36,820
I we don't know what to do.

1572
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:42,260
We're going to have to send you somewhere.

1573
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:45,220
We've talked to every psychologist in the Schaumburg area.

1574
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:48,100
He won't stop souping his pants and we're at our wits end.

1575
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:57,460
Oh, that's the way you got to have a T-shirt, I guess, about the longs in the toilet.

1576
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:59,300
Soot my pants.

1577
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:01,780
Hashtag soup my pants.

1578
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:04,260
Have you souped your pants?

1579
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:06,260
Tweeted us with a hashtag.

1580
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:08,860
My pants. I'm a super hashtag.

1581
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:10,060
I'm a super.

1582
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:14,340
I think, OK, if you're talking getting wet,

1583
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:19,020
if you're talking soupings, the I think the most.

1584
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:21,020
Unpleasant. OK, there's all right.

1585
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:23,060
This poncho is right. And that that helps.

1586
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:24,740
I've done these rides with ponchos.

1587
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:27,020
I'm not dying to get wet on these things.

1588
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:30,420
But really, the big problem enters with the feet.

1589
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:36,380
I think if there was an easier way to prevent your because wet socks,

1590
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:38,500
I think it's nobody.

1591
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,420
Yeah, nobody likes that.

1592
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:41,460
And I can maintain.

1593
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:44,940
You just said he likes wet socks and shoes.

1594
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:48,260
Is that that's not true.

1595
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:49,700
I don't mind.

1596
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:53,300
I don't mind is different than like if we hook you up to a lie detector,

1597
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:54,860
would you pass?

1598
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:56,060
I might.

1599
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:57,980
I don't want to walk around with it.

1600
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:01,660
You know, this is a contrarian opinion.

1601
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:06,340
Maybe because I have some contrarian opinions, but I don't like wet socks,

1602
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:10,500
which is why I mean, if a sudden rainstorm comes in that I wasn't expecting.

1603
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:14,220
But again, if I know I'm going on a water ride and I had fun,

1604
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:17,020
it's a nice memory that I had fun.

1605
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:19,780
But you can have a memory without your

1606
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,540
you don't have to wear a memory.

1607
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:24,380
Can I get at least?

1608
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:26,980
You've got like 20 memories.

1609
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:31,140
You have family albums of pictures of your wet socks from going on rides.

1610
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:35,020
Like, oh, remember on his mantle, just different socks that are wet.

1611
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:39,540
Oh, you they've just crusted over 15 years.

1612
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:42,940
They dry.

1613
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:44,940
It takes forever for your socks to dry.

1614
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:46,940
It does. Yeah, it takes a lot longer.

1615
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:49,940
Sort of the thickest, potentially thickest fabric you're wearing.

1616
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:52,700
I and I don't know if I've revealed this on the show before,

1617
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:55,300
but there's a bit of a confession.

1618
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:58,860
So on Splash Mountain, I say the last five times I've gone on,

1619
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:03,220
I will covertly take my socks off in the log.

1620
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:06,460
You sneaky.

1621
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,540
Oh, my gosh, that's so smart.

1622
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:11,260
This is the end of the ride.

1623
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:14,380
I'm furious about this confession secretly when he's going like,

1624
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:16,420
I'm taking my socks off.

1625
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:18,140
I'll do it low key.

1626
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:21,820
I will just kind of go and then I put one in the pocket

1627
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:26,060
and I put the other two so no one notices his sock off song.

1628
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:28,500
But I'm wanting to throw people off.

1629
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:31,500
You know, they're they don't know this guy's just obviously he's having a nice day.

1630
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,820
My shoes, they're still on.

1631
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:36,940
I'm going to go like this sock over here.

1632
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:38,700
You narrated.

1633
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:41,220
Mm hmm. You announce it that you're doing.

1634
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:43,460
You're like, because it's a little trick.

1635
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:45,540
You mean I've been in the log with you.

1636
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:48,300
Yeah, I let you in on all the weird shit I do.

1637
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:49,580
Why do you keep that secret?

1638
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:51,300
What's the problem with that?

1639
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:55,260
Because I feel like if I feel like people are weird with bare feet in general.

1640
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:57,420
Got it. Oh, you take you take care of it.

1641
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:00,300
I guess in my head, what I was of course, that makes more sense.

1642
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:03,260
And my head, what I was picturing was you have you like slip your shoes off,

1643
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:05,220
take your socks off, put your shoes back on.

1644
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:06,860
Yes, you do.

1645
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:07,980
But then you put your shoes back on.

1646
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:09,420
I put the shoes back on on the ride.

1647
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:11,380
Yeah, I'm not bare feet in the log. Right.

1648
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:13,980
So but then you're just you got a rubber.

1649
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:16,460
Barefoot exposure weirds people out.

1650
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:20,540
Yeah. So I feel like it, especially sometimes you're in the log with strangers.

1651
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:24,060
You know, sometimes you're like, this guy taking his shoes off.

1652
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:27,580
You're solo and sometimes you're all it's otherwise children.

1653
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:29,660
Sometimes you're behind a bunch of children.

1654
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:32,100
That is happening a couple times.

1655
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:35,620
Although I don't think I was doing the shoe trick then, but I was with.

1656
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:38,540
It's a hack. I like to call it a shoe hack.

1657
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:40,740
Did you know shoes come off?

1658
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:44,620
Shoes can come off and your socks also can come off and go into your pockets.

1659
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:49,620
Mom, the man behind me in the right started taking his gloves off.

1660
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:51,900
No, that's not what happened.

1661
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:55,660
The shoes are fine, but he started telling it to me like it was a little trick.

1662
01:08:56,140 --> 01:09:00,620
Then he sang and then I asked him why and he said, I don't want to get souped.

1663
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:04,300
Hello, boys. Did you know that your shoes can come off?

1664
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:05,980
Oh, God.

1665
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:07,940
Take your shoes off if you don't want to soup it.

1666
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:10,180
Yeah, I'm a cool adult.

1667
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:12,500
I like that hack. I think that's a good hack.

1668
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:15,380
Yeah, you can wear a slip on.

1669
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:19,020
I don't I don't do that at Disney yet, but that's a good idea to wear slip on,

1670
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:22,100
slip on off and then your shoes dry a lot easier.

1671
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,180
And then you go to the bathroom, you put your socks.

1672
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:27,780
I think the pre putting on the flip flops is maybe the way to.

1673
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:29,380
That's good. You did.

1674
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:31,300
So that means you have to throw them into knots.

1675
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:32,900
Flop. Yes, unfortunately.

1676
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:35,300
Yeah, but listen, they're I mean, they're flipping the floppy.

1677
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:37,620
You know, you flip and flop them.

1678
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:38,980
They fold up. You're not careful.

1679
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:40,580
Flip flop right away.

1680
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:43,140
That's right. You got to keep your flip on.

1681
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:47,780
But when they flip a flop and you just fold them up and put them somewhere

1682
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:49,540
like they're not like regular shoes.

1683
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:51,460
I saw. Yeah.

1684
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:53,340
There's no dimensionality.

1685
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:55,100
Easy. Yeah.

1686
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,460
So that's my hack.

1687
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:58,740
I shove flip flops in between.

1688
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:01,380
Yeah. Under my belt.

1689
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:03,500
All these hacks.

1690
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:06,820
Maybe I could I leave them like dangling on like a belt loop.

1691
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:08,660
Yeah, like get a little chain.

1692
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:10,300
Yeah, like a chain wallet.

1693
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:12,700
But they're chain flip flops.

1694
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:15,700
That would be the strangest thing.

1695
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:19,500
Or I go to downtown Disney Sandal Store, Sanuk.

1696
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:20,860
Of course, you know, Sanuk.

1697
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:24,700
I've been learning about anticipation of the downtown Disney ordeal coming soon.

1698
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:26,860
You go to Sanuk by your flip flops.

1699
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:29,300
Then as soon as you're off the ride, return them.

1700
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:32,220
And hopefully they don't care that they're soaking wet.

1701
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:35,380
Sneaky. I like that.

1702
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:37,660
It's not the plastic act that doesn't work.

1703
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:39,180
Yeah, I would imagine it doesn't work.

1704
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:42,340
But if you put them into the drying station

1705
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:47,380
and Humphreys dry, you know, hold the shoes right up to the hottest part.

1706
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:49,180
Now, this is a lot of work.

1707
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:51,780
You really got to you're really engaging.

1708
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:55,460
And I'm spending a lot of money because the drying station costs five dollars.

1709
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:58,660
It does. It costs. It's a very.

1710
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:01,300
Their ponchos are pretty prohibitively expensive as well,

1711
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,300
because I thought about doing it late at night one time.

1712
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:06,300
And my wife would only do it if we got ponchos and the ponchos were like

1713
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:08,380
$15, $15.

1714
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:11,140
Ridiculous. It's just plastic that's been gathered.

1715
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:13,060
Yes, that's like two cents worth.

1716
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:16,420
And you end up wet anyway because you are sweating

1717
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:19,700
because of the sheet of unbreathable plastic you're wearing.

1718
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:20,780
Good point.

1719
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:25,260
Also, the plastic we got, we, Lindsey and I got a poncho in Animal Kingdom.

1720
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:29,540
And the fumes from the plastic were toxic.

1721
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:32,940
Yeah, we were getting headaches from it wearing it for 25 minutes.

1722
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:36,020
So I don't know if they're the same ponchos as the California Adventure ones.

1723
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:39,060
But we were like it was pouring rain and we just took them off.

1724
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:40,940
And we're like, we can't do this.

1725
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:43,420
It's crazy. I don't know why.

1726
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:46,940
Who knows? We somebody chime in on what kind of plastic they use.

1727
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:47,860
Somebody out there knows.

1728
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:50,780
Question just occurred to me, why don't you take your socks off

1729
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:52,540
before you get on the ride?

1730
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:55,380
Uh, nobody's looking at your feet.

1731
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:57,220
Yeah, I feel like that's.

1732
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:59,300
People are all like ringing stuff out.

1733
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:02,260
No, people are there's benches like by the entrance and actually people.

1734
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:03,020
Oh, you're right.

1735
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:05,220
But that's actually that feels more, I guess.

1736
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:07,540
OK, I could probably do the bathroom.

1737
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:09,020
But because I don't want to be in a bench.

1738
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:11,740
Clothes essentially on a ride

1739
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:13,700
and having to sneak and sing your song.

1740
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:17,620
I guess probably the answer is I like doing it on the ride.

1741
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:20,180
I think the answer is I get some sort of enjoyment on it.

1742
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:22,140
Oh, God. Here we go.

1743
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:24,060
Now this is the confession part.

1744
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:25,980
Now Mike's the weird one. Yes.

1745
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:31,220
Well, no longer the image of me on a moving platform soaking wet.

1746
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:33,860
I didn't. I don't forget about your love of wet socks.

1747
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:35,780
Yeah, that's the weirdest thing.

1748
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:37,820
We've moved on entirely. Squash, baby.

1749
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:39,060
That's the way.

1750
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:44,780
The bathroom is the only other place I think you could do it.

1751
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:46,820
And I think just sometimes, well, you got the fast pass,

1752
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:48,980
you're running a splash and I'm not going to hold everyone up

1753
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:51,260
when I know I can do it in the log.

1754
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:52,820
And that I hold everyone up.

1755
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:54,340
I mean, I go to the bathroom.

1756
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:58,860
There's also you got to go past for help for because also there's not.

1757
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:01,140
You pulled everyone up every time you go to the bathroom.

1758
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:04,820
Plus changing shoes in a bathroom like is not ideal.

1759
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:06,540
Yes, it is. There's no where to sit.

1760
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:09,300
And let's like to put the toilet down and sit on the toilet.

1761
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:11,900
Yeah. Yes. No, I don't want to do that.

1762
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:14,300
Many bathrooms have chairs. They're called toilets.

1763
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:17,100
I don't care for that. Honestly.

1764
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:20,460
And you refuse to do it on a bench

1765
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:23,180
because you don't want the general public to peep your feet.

1766
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:26,580
Who are also doing that, who are already there doing that.

1767
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:30,020
The general public is already doing what you're doing.

1768
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:33,340
Yeah, I guess you do it in the log.

1769
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:35,140
Let him do it in the log.

1770
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:37,860
Just say you don't want to end up on wiki feet, Michael.

1771
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:39,860
I know you already are.

1772
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:42,340
I guarantee all of you guys are on wiki.

1773
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:43,420
I know I am.

1774
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:47,620
I would be honored if somebody would put me on there, honestly.

1775
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:50,940
I'd like on wiki feet.

1776
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:55,020
Change in your shoes from the I mean, a security camera has to have it.

1777
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:58,580
And there used to be the website called Flash Mountain,

1778
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:02,060
where they collected every time somebody flashed their boobs

1779
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:03,820
going down the road.

1780
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:07,180
That was a very like early internet and the site still exists.

1781
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:10,420
And there's honestly like, you know, six photos on it.

1782
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:13,260
Like it never really happened.

1783
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:15,620
So this, I think, is the new thing.

1784
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:17,620
Log feet, log feet.

1785
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:22,340
So maybe I should like put my feet in the air on the photo part.

1786
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:24,900
Like I should. That would be an.

1787
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:27,180
I would be worried about you.

1788
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:29,620
What would happen to your body?

1789
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:32,300
Maybe they're like even just hitting the splash.

1790
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:33,460
What would you like?

1791
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:35,900
Crunch your lumbar or something like that?

1792
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:39,580
I wouldn't seem safe because there's no belt.

1793
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:41,700
It's a reason why. That's right.

1794
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:44,540
You could you just tumble right out, but you'd land feet first

1795
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:49,500
and you'd slide down the railing like, whoa, which would be really fun, honestly.

1796
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:52,740
Flipping out of the car, flipped up

1797
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:55,860
and out of the car on Splash Mountain and slid down.

1798
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,860
And then and then like

1799
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:03,180
and then like through your hands up in a shocker was like tubular.

1800
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:06,620
I would definitely use some beach slaying, some beach

1801
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:08,660
surfers slaying on the way down. You have to.

1802
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:11,860
And then you and then you're being loaded into the ambulance after all this.

1803
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:13,100
And they ask, are you OK?

1804
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:14,580
And you say, I'm more than OK.

1805
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:17,940
I'm I'm coming to wiki feet.

1806
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:21,100
Please, please do not get us kicked off

1807
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,860
Patreon for your weird wiki feet.

1808
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:26,380
It's flat around wiki feet business.

1809
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:27,660
You think that'll happen?

1810
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:28,660
Spatial would ban us.

1811
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:33,020
They're going to kick us off because because of Mike's adult activities.

1812
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:34,900
Adult activities.

1813
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:36,940
As Mike's adult,

1814
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:40,980
all the head adult pervert business, the nun who runs the school is here

1815
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:42,540
to give me rules.

1816
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:45,540
I'd like to start an adult pervert business, please.

1817
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:47,060
You know, Patreon is like porn.

1818
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:48,380
Yeah, it was paid.

1819
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:51,340
But then it's like hidden, like your page gets hidden.

1820
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:53,860
Then for if you market explicit.

1821
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:55,340
Oh, yeah.

1822
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:56,460
Oh, so it's not searchable.

1823
01:15:56,460 --> 01:16:00,340
I'm making a joke that you're you're doing like pervert feet stuff.

1824
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:03,180
Pervert feet stuff.

1825
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:04,540
I guess I am. No joke.

1826
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:06,340
He likes it. That's what we've determined.

1827
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:08,940
We've discussed the dirty foot on pirates.

1828
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:12,140
Yeah, doing it in the log.

1829
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:18,300
Dear Pet House Forum, you'll never guess what happened to me in a log.

1830
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:22,860
It's the thrill.

1831
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:26,140
It's like getting a quickie in like, like, yeah, like, hey,

1832
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:28,900
can we do we have sex really fast, like in this public space?

1833
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:31,100
You're like trying to see how quickly you can.

1834
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:32,900
It's exactly the same thing.

1835
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:34,460
Yeah, it's exactly.

1836
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:36,260
Yeah, totally the same.

1837
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:37,980
Yeah, yeah, completely.

1838
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:39,900
And our Patreon is fucked.

1839
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:44,300
It's yeah, our Patreon is screwed now because I take my socks off.

1840
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,460
And our log.

1841
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,020
We are pervert content.

1842
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:50,140
This has been let's put the warning.

1843
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:54,100
It will use the real warning at the top of the adult content.

1844
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:55,300
It's all.

1845
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:58,020
You have to use it at the top of every episode of every show.

1846
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:01,340
It always goes there.

1847
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:02,900
It is your fault.

1848
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:04,420
I know. This is sort of your fault.

1849
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:06,700
Actually, it is. Yeah.

1850
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:12,260
But I would not take my socks off like that on the rapids

1851
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:13,540
because it's so visible.

1852
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:15,780
I would not on Grizzly River Rapids.

1853
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:17,380
The fact that people would see you do.

1854
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:19,460
Because they got to pay, right?

1855
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:24,820
I'm not putting on my show.

1856
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:25,780
You don't work for free.

1857
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:29,540
I'm not putting on my pervert foot show unless I get paid for it.

1858
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:34,340
Oh, man.

1859
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:35,780
Gee whiz.

1860
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:36,820
Jason's laughing.

1861
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:38,900
I don't think he's going to be able to get himself back here.

1862
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:40,540
We got to cover.

1863
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:41,580
We got to cover him.

1864
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:42,660
Yeah, what else?

1865
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:44,540
Talk about the signage.

1866
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:45,460
I don't know. I don't know where else.

1867
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:47,020
I don't know where to go from there.

1868
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:49,020
Let's talk about this.

1869
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:52,020
We've thrown this out and I want Mary's opinion on it.

1870
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:54,580
Sometimes we've said, and I'm wearing the shirt kind of accidentally,

1871
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:57,820
but we've said the country bears are no longer in Disneyland.

1872
01:17:57,820 --> 01:17:58,660
They took them out.

1873
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:00,180
The bear is there now.

1874
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:05,740
We've thrown the idea out of throwing some country bear robots on this ride.

1875
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:07,220
Do you think that would be blasphemous?

1876
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:08,620
Do you think that would ruin the ride?

1877
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:10,980
Do you like it pure like this or are you open to?

1878
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:12,420
Oh, I'm open to it.

1879
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:14,740
I mean, absolutely open.

1880
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:17,940
Because that line, you sort of weave your eye.

1881
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:20,140
I actually love this line because you're like,

1882
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:25,860
it feels like you're like going through like canoe sheds and like you're seeing like it.

1883
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:31,860
It feels very like camp esque to me, which I really like.

1884
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:39,580
But it's true that there's not much going on besides getting to look at old coffee tins and that kind of thing.

1885
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:45,980
So I think putting up putting some of those country bears along the way couldn't hurt.

1886
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:48,100
I think that'd be really fun.

1887
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:53,180
And I don't feel like there's it's enough of a specific.

1888
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:55,460
There's not a narrative to it.

1889
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:56,180
You know what I mean?

1890
01:18:56,180 --> 01:19:00,580
Like you're you're just like you're in Grizzly River Rapids and that's the story.

1891
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:04,380
Right. So I don't think there's any clashing of stories that's happening.

1892
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:09,460
Right. There's nothing necessarily that like the country where it doesn't belong in this story.

1893
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:11,180
It doesn't really matter. Yeah.

1894
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:16,460
Well, and that's been one of our complaints about the ride is for a ride with a bear at the entry,

1895
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:18,220
a bear mountain in the distance.

1896
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:19,740
There's no bears. There's no bear.

1897
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:20,820
Yeah, we're the bears. Yeah, that's true.

1898
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:23,740
You go through a cave. There's a roar.

1899
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:26,060
There's a roar. So it's a just bear.

1900
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:26,780
That's fun.

1901
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:32,140
That's that's said to possibly be the ghost of Usiwawi.

1902
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:34,540
What's the name of the bear? The stoned bear.

1903
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:36,500
I go back and get the name.

1904
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:39,260
Ozzy Mada Ozzy Mada.

1905
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:42,060
Usumati or Matei.

1906
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:43,340
Usumati. OK, great.

1907
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:45,780
OK, so that's his roar, but it's a ghost bear.

1908
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:49,020
Yeah, I think I saw somewhere referring to that.

1909
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:50,740
It's a ghost bear, which is cool.

1910
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:53,740
Yeah, it would be fun, though, to have them like along the ride.

1911
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:56,860
That would be fun, like in like in Splash Mountain, where you see all those characters.

1912
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:58,300
Yeah, right. That's really fun.

1913
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:03,100
At the very least, like more like ghost bear or have like a hitchhiking ghost bear

1914
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:05,540
or something like Haunted Mansion.

1915
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:06,980
Hitchhiking ghost bear.

1916
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:08,260
That's a nice thing.

1917
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:09,020
Well,

1918
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:13,820
getting to see them.

1919
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:16,740
I mean, we've talked about this, putting the country bears there, but why are they there?

1920
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:17,860
Are they on vacation?

1921
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:22,580
Is that where we like witnessing little like their like, is it little vacation

1922
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:26,100
tableaus because one of those country bear shows was the vacation hoedown?

1923
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:27,580
And it's still in Tokyo.

1924
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:31,420
So are we seeing that's this is what it's like when the bears are not

1925
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:33,780
where because they or should they be singing to you?

1926
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:36,500
They could be the spokes bears

1927
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:40,420
for like conservation or the park for whatever.

1928
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:45,460
REI. I feel like that seems a little less fun than them having like a hootenanny.

1929
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:50,220
But well, like like they're no, they can still have a hootenanny.

1930
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:52,660
But they're also explaining park rules as well.

1931
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:54,940
Like they're doing.

1932
01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:57,820
What do they call it? Like influencer spawn con?

1933
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:00,540
They're doing like sponsored content for the.

1934
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:02,580
Oh, I know you a little.

1935
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:06,500
They tell you a little about the parks in line and then they do the show

1936
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,860
like the ride is the show.

1937
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:12,820
So they're not explaining stuff in the ride or they are.

1938
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:14,620
Well, maybe Henry can.

1939
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:17,660
So Henry's zooming past these characters.

1940
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:19,900
You can't really like listen to him talk for more than.

1941
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:22,140
No, you can get a little music.

1942
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:24,260
Music, but they can't explain. That's what I mean.

1943
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:26,740
I'm saying in line, they can tell you about the parks a little.

1944
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:30,500
Which is what, like square footage?

1945
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:32,260
What? Like what are they?

1946
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:33,260
What are they telling you?

1947
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:35,540
The way all the conservation.

1948
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:37,660
I love the defensive.

1949
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:40,260
Well, they could still have a hootenanny.

1950
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:41,740
I don't know.

1951
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:44,660
Just that tone with that word is just very funny.

1952
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:45,460
It's a little mix.

1953
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:47,300
I still have a hootenanny.

1954
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:50,180
The songs with a message going by.

1955
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:53,220
I think that they should all be.

1956
01:21:54,260 --> 01:21:56,300
They should be having a woman.

1957
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:57,860
No more rules.

1958
01:21:57,860 --> 01:21:59,700
No stats, no rules.

1959
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:01,340
Hootenanny.

1960
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:02,940
They should be on vacation.

1961
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:04,100
Step one, Hootenanny.

1962
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:06,300
Step one, Hootenanny.

1963
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:11,180
Number two, no statistics, no rules, no explanations.

1964
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:13,580
Like the X games before them, no rules.

1965
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:16,500
OK, wait, never mind.

1966
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:17,820
No Hootenanny.

1967
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:20,500
Country Bears performing X games.

1968
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:22,500
Oh, we found it.

1969
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:23,780
Now I like this.

1970
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:25,060
I like where this is going.

1971
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:26,940
Together. OK.

1972
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:29,540
So so Henry is snowboarding.

1973
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:32,780
Liver Lips McGraw is, I don't know,

1974
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:36,580
skateboarding, skateboarding with a sword or something.

1975
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:38,780
That's an X games thing, I assume.

1976
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:42,500
The three sisters are all like they're all on separate motorcycles

1977
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,300
spinning endlessly around a scared tourist.

1978
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:48,420
Yes. Not letting them go.

1979
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:50,060
I'm trying to think.

1980
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:51,780
Trixie is or no.

1981
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:56,100
Why am I having a brain fart about her name?

1982
01:22:56,540 --> 01:22:57,540
Teddy Swingin.

1983
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:58,740
Swingin Teddy Bear.

1984
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:00,460
Swingin Teddy Bear on the right there.

1985
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:04,420
And she's, of course, in being lowered from a helicopter.

1986
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:06,820
Wow. Yeah.

1987
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:07,900
It's in its very dangerous.

1988
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:10,660
She's there to rescue a hiker who got trapped under rocks.

1989
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:13,180
And then to seduce him as well.

1990
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:15,060
Oh, cool. Yeah, that's fun.

1991
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:17,100
She's like the Mae West Bear.

1992
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:19,180
Yeah. So, yeah.

1993
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:21,980
We always need a Mae West Bear.

1994
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:25,060
All of the bears, all of the female bears are

1995
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:27,300
like Mae West types, honestly.

1996
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:29,140
They're just different ages.

1997
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:30,220
Yes. Yeah.

1998
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:33,820
There's like teenager Mae West types, the Sun Bonnet Trio.

1999
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:36,260
There's Teddy Bear, who's crying.

2000
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:38,740
And then there's no, no, there's Trixie who's crying

2001
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:40,980
and then Swingin Teddy Bear who comes out from the ceiling.

2002
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:42,980
They're all kind of like handkerchief blowers.

2003
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:44,740
Hello. Right.

2004
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:47,300
I wish we had a video.

2005
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:49,380
Oh, there's a GIF of you doing hello.

2006
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:50,620
Hello.

2007
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:53,340
I'll happily recreate it and I'll put a foot up too.

2008
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:54,540
I'll put it on WikiFace.

2009
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:56,660
I'll wave a handkerchief with my foot.

2010
01:23:56,660 --> 01:24:00,100
We are getting on that goddamn site now because we've talked about it so much.

2011
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:01,420
You sure are.

2012
01:24:01,420 --> 01:24:03,100
Our dream.

2013
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:03,940
Hi, Edwin.

2014
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:04,780
So, yeah, there.

2015
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:07,300
I think we'd be the first men on it.

2016
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:08,300
And that might be. No way.

2017
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:09,900
No, I'm sure it is, man.

2018
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:12,980
I feel like the ratio is going to be like 99.5 percent.

2019
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:16,180
The Monty Python foot is probably on there.

2020
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:21,780
You think they just put up like classic foots of lore?

2021
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:22,620
Yeah.

2022
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:26,540
Any Giants foot from.

2023
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:30,900
Yeah. So so like Knott's just recently put on all put all these like they did

2024
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:34,620
a very nice job of putting on all these different like woodland creatures

2025
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:37,060
on their raft ride, at least they didn't do like a crazy.

2026
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:39,420
Except for there's an old man with a musket, which is great.

2027
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:42,140
But everything else is just sort of like animal robots.

2028
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:44,420
Cool. So. I love robots.

2029
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:46,020
Yeah. Yeah.

2030
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:48,660
I think all we want out of this ride is get some robots on the.

2031
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:50,980
Get some robots. Yeah.

2032
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:52,260
I like going through the.

2033
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:53,260
Coyote.

2034
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:55,020
Oh, yeah.

2035
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:57,500
Hello. Hello.

2036
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:01,020
To Mills, Eureka Gold and Timber Company.

2037
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:04,780
There's a very intensive back story about Eureka

2038
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:08,380
Gold and Timber that the Imagineers have.

2039
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:12,020
The Bears could tell you that the Bears could tell you about Jacob Probst,

2040
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:14,500
who discovered their gold there.

2041
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:17,540
The fictional gold prospector.

2042
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:18,820
Oh, that's fun.

2043
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:22,700
Yeah. Related to an ancestor of Mark Probst or Jeff Probst.

2044
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:24,220
Jeff Brass. That's what I meant.

2045
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:26,900
TV. Not Mark. Best host on TV.

2046
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:28,540
Sorry, I got his name wrong.

2047
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:30,940
Is there a Mark Probst somewhere?

2048
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:32,380
I don't know.

2049
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:34,580
I think I might have just fucked that up anyway.

2050
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:36,140
You were thinking of Mark Summers.

2051
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:37,860
Yeah. I mean, always.

2052
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:39,620
Yes. Your favorite host.

2053
01:25:39,620 --> 01:25:42,060
Mark Summers. Jeff Probst is survivor though.

2054
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:43,420
Yeah. Yeah.

2055
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:46,500
I think Mark Probst is he on what we do in the shadows.

2056
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,220
The actor Mark Proche is what I'm.

2057
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:49,180
Yes. Yeah.

2058
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:50,780
From the from the Dickerverse.

2059
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:53,260
Mary, best animatronic at any theme park.

2060
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:54,140
What's your opinion?

2061
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:55,260
Boof.

2062
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:56,620
Favorites, just some favorites.

2063
01:25:56,620 --> 01:25:58,700
Some favorites. Let's see.

2064
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:04,180
Oh, I love the hippos on Jungle Cruise.

2065
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:05,820
I like the hippos.

2066
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:08,540
I like the elephant on Jungle Cruise.

2067
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:10,620
Some of the OGs. Some of the first era.

2068
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:14,780
Those are some favorites. Let's see.

2069
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:16,100
I'm trying to think of what.

2070
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:18,780
I might need reminding of what all the animatronics are.

2071
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:21,260
I mean, there's a go down Big Thunder and there's.

2072
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:26,380
There's like the dancing animals and splash, you know.

2073
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:28,500
Yes, of course, those guys.

2074
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,300
The riverboat animals.

2075
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:32,100
Yeah. The.

2076
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:35,300
Yeah, that's the geese or the ladies who are dancing.

2077
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:36,740
A little like kick line. Yeah.

2078
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:38,940
Yeah. Are they geese that kick line?

2079
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:40,700
People are yelling at us now.

2080
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:42,540
They're listening in their cars.

2081
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:44,060
Are there geese that kick line?

2082
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:45,700
Oh, come on.

2083
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:48,060
You know what they are.

2084
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:51,020
Stay away from the.

2085
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:53,020
What does that lady sing?

2086
01:26:53,020 --> 01:26:55,700
Yeah. She's a awesome. Right.

2087
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:56,580
She's like a pod. Yeah.

2088
01:26:56,580 --> 01:26:58,660
She's a possum. Possum mom.

2089
01:26:58,660 --> 01:26:59,980
Yeah. That's my favorite part.

2090
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:01,380
The laughing place. That's right.

2091
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:03,140
That gets so serious.

2092
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:05,300
From the laughing place.

2093
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:08,140
It really is so scary.

2094
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:09,540
That's one of my favorites, too.

2095
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:13,180
And all the all the little ones are like, oh, oh.

2096
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:14,740
You're auditioning for.

2097
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:17,220
It seems like you're auditioning right now for playing that character

2098
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:18,660
on a Disney plus show.

2099
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:22,340
Mm hmm. And also hurry back.

2100
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:23,940
Oh, yeah.

2101
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:26,340
Back. That's good.

2102
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:29,860
Thank you so much. And also and also.

2103
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:32,940
Uh. Um.

2104
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:33,940
Uh.

2105
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:37,860
The hesitant robot.

2106
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:39,740
Uh.

2107
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:43,140
Can't think of a single.

2108
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:44,780
I'm so sure.

2109
01:27:44,780 --> 01:27:47,500
Jay Audubon Woodlore when he's at a loss for words.

2110
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:52,340
Bumper McFerrin.

2111
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:53,740
Oh, he's never at a loss for words.

2112
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:55,140
No, no, no. He's always he's.

2113
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:56,540
He knows just what to say.

2114
01:27:56,540 --> 01:28:01,700
A lot of 1950s like cartoon characters had that kind of voice.

2115
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:03,220
Well, like a droopy dog.

2116
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:04,460
Though this person.

2117
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:06,300
Wait, let me get the name right, because I was looking at I was like,

2118
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:07,820
why is that voice familiar?

2119
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:11,220
But that voice of that of Jay Audubon Woodlore,

2120
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:14,460
it was not always, but most of the time droopy.

2121
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:19,980
One of the original group and then and also the White Rabbit and Smee.

2122
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:21,860
Yes, I believe that's me.

2123
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:24,020
That's a do be more.

2124
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:25,020
Did I?

2125
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:29,180
I don't know if I talked about this on the show, but when I saw Once Upon

2126
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:32,820
a Time in the Hollywood at the Vista, which is like a one screen,

2127
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:36,980
an old one screen movie theater here in Hollywood.

2128
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:42,260
And they played a droopy dog short before it that killed.

2129
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:44,460
Well, people were laughing.

2130
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:47,900
They applauded at the like it played better than some UCB shows

2131
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:50,020
I've seen in the last five years.

2132
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:51,540
I don't believe that.

2133
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:55,420
So, yeah, droopy dogs still got it.

2134
01:28:55,420 --> 01:28:56,740
Still got it. Still got it.

2135
01:28:56,740 --> 01:28:59,260
Still laughing after all these years.

2136
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:01,140
You got to love droopy. Yeah.

2137
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:05,060
We were in the clip that I showed earlier where the signed

2138
01:29:05,060 --> 01:29:07,660
Don't Molest the Bears, then it cuts to Donald,

2139
01:29:08,020 --> 01:29:10,540
who is a really funny expression on his face,

2140
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:13,300
almost as if he wanted to molest the bears.

2141
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:16,780
It's kind of like, well, and I it was making us.

2142
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:20,140
I'm sure that is not why, but I was making us

2143
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:23,340
my wife, I just fleshed to like, yeah, Donald's funny.

2144
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:26,740
You forget these characters are just around and they exist

2145
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:29,380
mainly as like photo opportunities and theme parks.

2146
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:31,860
And you go back at some of these shorts and forget

2147
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:34,780
they are like really super funny.

2148
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:36,180
Yeah, they're funny.

2149
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:38,500
Yeah, Donald is funny. Don't forget it.

2150
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:41,420
And it sounds like droopy is too.

2151
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:44,500
I'm trying to think there's an old I got this

2152
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:48,180
IDW collection of old Mickey cartoons and they are,

2153
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:50,820
you know, problematic in some ways.

2154
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:55,660
But Mickey is a maniac and he says crazy stuff like constantly.

2155
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:58,860
Like he threatens like to he hopes somebody dies in one of them.

2156
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,700
Really? Yeah.

2157
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:06,820
And then like he says something really not like cancelable to many.

2158
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:10,460
He says like many are I'm trying to think.

2159
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:13,780
Oh, yeah. Many are a peach for looks, but you've got applesauce for brains.

2160
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:18,020
Which is like crazy.

2161
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:20,780
Like these characters used to be insane.

2162
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:22,180
These characters.

2163
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:25,980
This you've got apples famously

2164
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:28,620
superior to apples.

2165
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:32,220
Yeah. So looking like a peach, you want these characters like an apple.

2166
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:32,820
Hell no.

2167
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:35,180
They used to have these characters say crazy shit.

2168
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:36,460
Yeah. All the time.

2169
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:39,140
Yeah. Because why why why not?

2170
01:30:39,220 --> 01:30:42,380
Sure. I mean, I guess also over the time, it was like that was just a normal thing

2171
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:43,380
for a man to say to a woman.

2172
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:46,860
That was just a turn of phrase that everyone was saying out on the town.

2173
01:30:46,860 --> 01:30:48,300
Right. Right.

2174
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:50,420
And when you were out on the town, you're always talking about

2175
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:54,940
who was a peach for looks, who had applesauce for brains.

2176
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:57,980
And she's great, but she's got that fucking applesauce for brains.

2177
01:30:57,980 --> 01:30:59,860
Oh, boy. That applesauce for brains.

2178
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:00,860
Oh, jeez.

2179
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:04,260
If you got sick, you'd say you've got an applesauce.

2180
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:06,180
You've got applesauce for an immune system.

2181
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:08,620
Mm hmm. Yeah. Any negative quality.

2182
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:11,020
Right. Which luckily that's changed.

2183
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:12,580
And applesauce is good.

2184
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:15,340
And the because it's delicious.

2185
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:18,780
And the greatest compliment you could get is you're a peach for looks

2186
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:20,700
and you have brains for brains.

2187
01:31:21,660 --> 01:31:23,300
No higher praise. Yeah.

2188
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:25,460
Both. Imagine that. Yeah.

2189
01:31:25,540 --> 01:31:28,660
What about like you're a peach for looks and you've got a peach for a brain?

2190
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:31,100
I don't. That's hmm.

2191
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:33,140
Sounds a little bit. Sounds pretty soft.

2192
01:31:33,140 --> 01:31:34,180
Pretty quickly.

2193
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:34,540
They get more.

2194
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:36,580
You want to look like a peach, but not think like one.

2195
01:31:36,580 --> 01:31:37,980
Yeah. Right.

2196
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:39,060
That's so crazy.

2197
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:42,020
All right. I'm going to go through all the fruits now.

2198
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:43,540
What is the smartest fruit?

2199
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:44,700
You have to think of a lot of stuff.

2200
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:47,820
We have to still crack that show idea at the start of the episode.

2201
01:31:47,820 --> 01:31:49,180
We have to figure this out.

2202
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:50,660
There's a lot of work we have to still do.

2203
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:52,980
Add it to the whiteboard. Yeah.

2204
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:54,460
Better start that hose up.

2205
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:57,380
I'm thinking I got a natural state.

2206
01:31:57,380 --> 01:31:59,420
Very well. Put a hose on.

2207
01:31:59,420 --> 01:32:00,060
All right. What else?

2208
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:02,060
So what else do we have not talked about here?

2209
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:05,660
There's a logistical thing I never knew about this ride.

2210
01:32:05,660 --> 01:32:10,900
So apparently when rapids rides are not in operation and in California

2211
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:14,540
and I think even in Orlando for there's a few months of the

2212
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:17,420
colder months of the year, they shut it down to do work on it.

2213
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:20,300
Usually like this pride is usually closed like what?

2214
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:23,220
January to like March or so.

2215
01:32:23,220 --> 01:32:25,540
A little refurbished a little refurbished.

2216
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:30,020
But regardless, they need somewhere even when it's running.

2217
01:32:31,340 --> 01:32:34,460
But when it's not pumping, like at night, when the ride's not running,

2218
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:36,780
they need somewhere to put the water.

2219
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:41,340
So they were trying to figure out what to do with that.

2220
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:44,140
And they were going to build an underground basin to do it,

2221
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:46,420
which would have been very expensive. Basin.

2222
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:50,060
Basin. Yeah. OK.

2223
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:54,900
And so they realized that there was a large body of water

2224
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:59,420
they were going to build at the at the wharf area, the other part of the park.

2225
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:04,060
So that's where the water drains to sometimes,

2226
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:07,380
which they wanted that to be like a tidal basin to simulate

2227
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:09,940
like rising and falling water anyway.

2228
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:15,780
So they needed a place to sometimes store water from this ride.

2229
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:18,700
So I guess they connected the two underground.

2230
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:20,540
They are genius. Yeah.

2231
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:23,620
So all of the California Adventure bodies of water connect.

2232
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:25,340
Not all of them, but those do.

2233
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:28,380
And that's why I don't mind having it in my mouth.

2234
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:31,180
Yeah. It's been all over that park.

2235
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:33,540
And it's taken care of. They take care of the water.

2236
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:36,500
And I know they take care of that water.

2237
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:38,820
They put thought into that water.

2238
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:40,180
I think. I love it.

2239
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:42,980
We should take a cup, an empty cup, when we go on these rides

2240
01:33:42,980 --> 01:33:45,340
and have a little scoop of a little drink.

2241
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:47,900
Have a little scoop. Have a little scoop of water.

2242
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:49,740
Yeah, we should see.

2243
01:33:49,740 --> 01:33:52,780
You should get a little scoop and then go get it water tested.

2244
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:55,420
See, see how dangerous it actually is.

2245
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:57,660
Although you probably would get sued for that. Right.

2246
01:33:58,740 --> 01:34:00,700
I don't know. I think it's OK.

2247
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:03,420
I mean, how? Like, if I don't know, how would they sue you?

2248
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:05,500
What would be illegal of it?

2249
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:09,660
That you. That you.

2250
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:14,740
You did it and we didn't say you could.

2251
01:34:14,780 --> 01:34:17,100
You didn't ask. Yeah.

2252
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:21,980
I think if you do it, as long as you don't publish like a lid blower,

2253
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:23,340
as long as you're not like.

2254
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:25,700
Because they're not claiming that that water is drinkable.

2255
01:34:25,700 --> 01:34:28,060
So there's nothing that you would. Yeah.

2256
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:31,540
It's probably on the warning signs, too.

2257
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:33,340
Yes. Don't drink. Yes. I think you're right.

2258
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:34,860
Don't drink this water, idiot.

2259
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:37,500
Yeah. Don't drink this water. Why would you? You suck.

2260
01:34:37,660 --> 01:34:40,660
Yeah. What you need the country bears around to mourn about.

2261
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:44,660
Right. And one of the country bear the river in that version, they would stop

2262
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:48,140
the rap. The actual raft would stop in front of a bear for a couple of minutes.

2263
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:50,220
Well, explain why the water wasn't drinkable.

2264
01:34:50,220 --> 01:34:52,980
We had it tested recently. Right.

2265
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:55,140
Let me get into this.

2266
01:34:55,140 --> 01:34:56,060
Alkali level.

2267
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:59,660
The pH specific, the pH specifics.

2268
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:01,740
Swipe didn't go well.

2269
01:35:01,740 --> 01:35:04,060
Jason's dream ride.

2270
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:05,740
All right.

2271
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:08,460
Hillbilly bears talking about pH. Yeah.

2272
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:12,340
What else you got?

2273
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:16,020
You know, what's the fact about the thing we haven't talked about is this is one of the best.

2274
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:20,900
This region, the Grizzly Peak Recreation Area is one of the best places to see

2275
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:24,780
Disneyland feral cats in and around.

2276
01:35:24,780 --> 01:35:27,100
Oh, yeah. Like in and around the brushes.

2277
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:30,620
At least that's one of the spots that I have seen the cats.

2278
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:34,580
And especially a shout out to Francisco, a long haired tortoise shell.

2279
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:38,940
Say hello to Francisco if you're there, because the cats all have names.

2280
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:40,260
Do you know any of this about?

2281
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:44,980
There's an Instagram account, I believe, that tracks the Disneyland cats

2282
01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:46,820
and knows who all of them are.

2283
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:47,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2284
01:35:47,860 --> 01:35:49,700
There's there's consistent characters.

2285
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:53,620
So this is one of the places because they want to be near

2286
01:35:55,060 --> 01:35:57,260
nature or a simulation thereof.

2287
01:35:57,260 --> 01:35:59,540
And it's still there's quiet parts of this area.

2288
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:01,700
So it's not necessarily quiet parts.

2289
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:04,980
So trafficked so they can have a little break.

2290
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:09,860
A cat would not want to hang out in Radiator Springs because every five seconds.

2291
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:11,540
Oh, my gosh. Yeah.

2292
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:11,940
And all that.

2293
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:14,540
Not a place for a cat to hang out.

2294
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:16,380
All that rock and roll music.

2295
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:18,700
Cats hate rock and roll. Yeah.

2296
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:20,260
Yeah, it's a fact.

2297
01:36:20,260 --> 01:36:21,540
That's a fact.

2298
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:23,140
Cats love jazz.

2299
01:36:23,140 --> 01:36:24,380
They love the acoustics.

2300
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:25,700
Flucking. Yeah.

2301
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:27,220
Yeah. They love bright bass.

2302
01:36:27,220 --> 01:36:29,940
They love Spanish guitar.

2303
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:31,020
Right. Which is California.

2304
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:33,420
Spanish guitar. Tons of California flamenco.

2305
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:36,020
Guitar is everywhere at California Adventure. Yeah.

2306
01:36:36,020 --> 01:36:38,220
Yeah. And to well Puss in Boots

2307
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:40,020
loves flamenco guitar.

2308
01:36:40,020 --> 01:36:43,980
Oh, right. He's but he's not an Antonio Banderas puts in boots.

2309
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:45,500
Mm hmm. Yeah, that's true.

2310
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,140
Yeah. Dreamworks. Yeah.

2311
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:48,340
I know. You can't be in the park.

2312
01:36:48,340 --> 01:36:50,140
I'm just saying. No, I'm just saying.

2313
01:36:50,140 --> 01:36:52,220
If he sets one foot in that park.

2314
01:36:54,220 --> 01:36:56,380
The train set him on fire.

2315
01:36:57,380 --> 01:37:01,100
I will personally tie some fake rocks to his little kitty legs.

2316
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:03,180
You go into the bottom of that tidal basin.

2317
01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:05,180
Oh, too hard, Jason.

2318
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:06,180
We don't have to.

2319
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:07,020
We don't have to.

2320
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:09,980
I was setting them on fire, but I would never do that.

2321
01:37:09,980 --> 01:37:12,660
OK, all right. No, my drowning is more in.

2322
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:15,660
You know what would be the simulation of the rising and falling tides

2323
01:37:15,660 --> 01:37:19,060
when the water drains into there, you know, you don't want it draining.

2324
01:37:19,060 --> 01:37:20,900
And then like, what is that? Right.

2325
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:22,740
You know, exactly.

2326
01:37:22,740 --> 01:37:24,180
Then got to bury it.

2327
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:26,740
You got to draw some in the castle, the castle moat.

2328
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:28,740
That's all that's deep and dark.

2329
01:37:28,740 --> 01:37:31,220
Nobody ever goes into the castle. Don't drain that.

2330
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:33,380
Don't drain that.

2331
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:35,700
Yeah. I don't even want to know what you'd find.

2332
01:37:35,980 --> 01:37:38,340
Enemies from from the 50s.

2333
01:37:38,540 --> 01:37:40,740
Yeah, he kept them all communists.

2334
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:42,340
It's just full of communists.

2335
01:37:42,340 --> 01:37:43,460
Communists.

2336
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:46,580
He built Disneyland as a place to hide the body of communists.

2337
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:48,060
Communist. Yeah.

2338
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:51,820
Anyway, the police can't come looking if it's my own the lake.

2339
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:52,740
That's true.

2340
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:55,100
Former Disney head E.

2341
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:58,460
Card Walker got up to some real shady business in the 70s.

2342
01:38:00,020 --> 01:38:02,860
Nixon, Disney, let Nixon hide some of his enemies.

2343
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:05,100
Sure. Well, Orange County buddies.

2344
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:06,580
Got to. Got to.

2345
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:07,980
Why they built the submarines.

2346
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:10,300
That's why he was there overlooking it.

2347
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:12,780
So here's where you can hide them in the reef. OK.

2348
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:16,460
God's cut this monorail ribbon.

2349
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:18,580
So what have we missed?

2350
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:21,900
We've missed that there's a big drop and the drops pretty fun.

2351
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:24,220
You're not 20 feet. 22 feet, I think.

2352
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:27,300
Wow. Is it? I've heard 21.

2353
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:30,660
Word on the street is there are different numbers around 20.

2354
01:38:30,660 --> 01:38:31,780
We know that for sure.

2355
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:33,820
So it's not a complete fact yet.

2356
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:36,940
And the rafts, this is unique to this ride.

2357
01:38:36,940 --> 01:38:39,500
I feel that they spin as they go down that track.

2358
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:41,020
Raph spin. Yes, that's fun.

2359
01:38:41,020 --> 01:38:42,100
Designed by that.

2360
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:45,780
Not every like a lot of rapids rides have that sort of drop,

2361
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:47,100
but they don't all spin.

2362
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:49,260
They found a new thing in this genre.

2363
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:52,380
If you look at the list of all the rapids rides that there ever were,

2364
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:55,500
it's a weird genre of ride that existed outside of the major.

2365
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:58,620
But there wasn't they didn't have them at Disney, didn't have them at Universal.

2366
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:01,340
And they were all like mostly Six Flags and Hershey Park

2367
01:39:01,340 --> 01:39:02,460
and those kind of places.

2368
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:06,380
But once Disney finally got on board this trend, they reinvented the wheel.

2369
01:39:06,740 --> 01:39:07,940
Yeah. Added a big mill wheel.

2370
01:39:07,940 --> 01:39:09,620
I love it. Twirl. Yeah. Yeah.

2371
01:39:09,620 --> 01:39:10,860
It's so fun. The twirl.

2372
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:12,500
It's really fun. It's so fun.

2373
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:14,900
Because then you get to be on all sides of it.

2374
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:19,020
You get to be facing down and then you get to be backwards going down.

2375
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:20,700
It's really fun. Yeah.

2376
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:23,500
I love that moment, too, like

2377
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:27,900
right before you go down the drop, you can see where you just were.

2378
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:30,660
Yeah. And like it's like a little bridge going over.

2379
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:32,740
I like that, too. Yeah.

2380
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:34,460
It's really, really great.

2381
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:37,420
It's also like a ride like every other ride.

2382
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:40,740
It positions you in a certain spot in a certain direction.

2383
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:43,580
So it is like if you went on, you'd have a different experience,

2384
01:39:43,580 --> 01:39:45,620
technically a different experience every time.

2385
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:46,740
Sometimes you go over backwards.

2386
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:49,180
Like imagine sometimes you went backwards on Big Thunder.

2387
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:50,740
That would be amazing.

2388
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:52,420
But it's impossible, unfortunately.

2389
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:54,780
I mean, it's not impossible, but you get in trouble.

2390
01:39:55,060 --> 01:39:57,100
You just whip your head around a lot.

2391
01:39:57,100 --> 01:40:00,020
One time I rode Big Thunder Mountain and

2392
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:05,620
me and my friend were in the last seat.

2393
01:40:07,940 --> 01:40:09,980
Right. It's two, two at a time. Right.

2394
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:13,020
Yeah. And the woman in the little cart in front of us

2395
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:18,820
had hair that went that like truly was like skimming the gears.

2396
01:40:18,820 --> 01:40:22,740
Like it was like this long gray hair that was.

2397
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:25,700
Oh, my God. Truly when she got off the ride, it was like down to her

2398
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:27,420
like knees or something.

2399
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:32,220
And I was like she it was almost like she wanted something to happen.

2400
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:35,820
Like she was like just like waving her hair around like it.

2401
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:40,780
Catherine and I were both like clutching the sides of the cart the entire time.

2402
01:40:40,820 --> 01:40:42,380
I mean, are we going to are we going to see a head come off?

2403
01:40:42,380 --> 01:40:43,980
Are we going to see a head come off?

2404
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:49,300
But the workers were like not worried, didn't tell her to tie her hair up or anything.

2405
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:52,780
But I was like, why on earth would you even toy with it?

2406
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:55,340
If you had hair that long and great have hair that long.

2407
01:40:55,340 --> 01:41:00,260
I love it. But but why would you even want to even play with the idea

2408
01:41:00,260 --> 01:41:04,380
that it could get caught in something like, oh, it's so scary.

2409
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:05,820
Yeah, that's very scary.

2410
01:41:05,820 --> 01:41:09,940
I also to lesser degree, I don't really want to be touched by strangers hair.

2411
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:12,460
So yeah, that long. Yes, it didn't.

2412
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:14,340
It wasn't blowing into our face.

2413
01:41:14,340 --> 01:41:18,300
OK, that's good. It was just sort of waving down like below.

2414
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:22,220
It's like giving the track clean, giving a little sweep.

2415
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:24,940
It was so crazy. Wild.

2416
01:41:24,980 --> 01:41:27,660
Because you I'm sure like I guess it's probably just something

2417
01:41:27,660 --> 01:41:31,540
they don't come in contact with ever that severe of a length.

2418
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:35,300
I'm not how I would assume there have to be like safety regulations.

2419
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:37,380
You would think I was like.

2420
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:41,020
Because that's like such a like if somebody came on the ride with a veil,

2421
01:41:41,060 --> 01:41:45,220
like a bridal veil, they would say you can't wear that, I assume.

2422
01:41:45,660 --> 01:41:47,340
I'm just trying to think something that's not long.

2423
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:49,300
It's also then hair ish.

2424
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:50,260
Yeah. Yeah.

2425
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:51,660
I'd be like, well, excuse me, you can't.

2426
01:41:51,660 --> 01:41:54,820
That's going to drag. Well, excuse me.

2427
01:41:55,620 --> 01:41:56,900
Excuse me.

2428
01:41:56,900 --> 01:41:59,860
Oh, I also I know we're not talking about this.

2429
01:42:00,140 --> 01:42:05,340
Oh, actually, can we talk about the wardrobe of the people who work?

2430
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:07,540
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Really love it.

2431
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:08,940
Yeah. Yeah.

2432
01:42:08,940 --> 01:42:12,260
In favor of I also love the wardrobe on Big Thunder Mountain.

2433
01:42:12,260 --> 01:42:14,700
I actually think it's very stylish.

2434
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:18,740
Grizzly River Run, if I am right, what do they wear?

2435
01:42:18,740 --> 01:42:21,260
They wear sort of like like kind of gingham.

2436
01:42:21,620 --> 01:42:23,420
Am I right about that?

2437
01:42:23,420 --> 01:42:26,540
I don't know. Is it like what a what a national parks employee would wear?

2438
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:28,620
Is it a little like like a ranger?

2439
01:42:28,620 --> 01:42:30,740
I feel like a scoutish.

2440
01:42:30,740 --> 01:42:33,740
Which I am so in love with.

2441
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:35,460
Do you have a bandana on as we speak?

2442
01:42:35,460 --> 01:42:36,460
Do they wear a bandana?

2443
01:42:36,460 --> 01:42:37,860
Is that I don't really call it a.

2444
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:38,860
I feel like they might around their neck.

2445
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:39,820
I think it's.

2446
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:41,580
Which those can be those can be cool.

2447
01:42:41,580 --> 01:42:42,500
Those are very cool.

2448
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:45,180
If you're yeah, like correctly styled,

2449
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:46,700
they don't have to be stiff like J.

2450
01:42:46,700 --> 01:42:48,500
Audubon and Woodlore. Right.

2451
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:50,380
Oh, they can be hip.

2452
01:42:50,660 --> 01:42:54,300
Paul Lind or Charles Nelson Riley would wear them on Match Game.

2453
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:56,900
Sure. That's my thing with the bandana.

2454
01:42:57,260 --> 01:42:58,660
So more of a neckerchief.

2455
01:42:58,660 --> 01:43:01,500
And more of a neckerchief. Yeah.

2456
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:03,540
Yeah. So that's good.

2457
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:05,020
I like those. I would wear that.

2458
01:43:05,020 --> 01:43:08,380
I do think maybe I'm like 10 years away from wearing like a neckerchief.

2459
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:11,340
I think that's right. I think that's right.

2460
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:15,940
I worked on the thing in Oklahoma this summer and a lot of the people in the crew,

2461
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:19,860
the young, the young, cool people there, like in their early 20s, they

2462
01:43:20,540 --> 01:43:21,460
like the key grip.

2463
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:26,980
She was so cool and she wore a bandana tied around her neck,

2464
01:43:26,980 --> 01:43:33,460
like like where it was like not like a kind of like a railroad

2465
01:43:33,820 --> 01:43:35,180
esk feel to it.

2466
01:43:35,180 --> 01:43:39,700
But I was like, oh, yeah, no, it was that it was like tied around her neck.

2467
01:43:39,700 --> 01:43:41,020
And she was just working.

2468
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:43,500
And I was like, that is so cool.

2469
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:46,060
She looks awesome.

2470
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:47,820
Anyway, so so bandanas are in.

2471
01:43:47,820 --> 01:43:49,380
So bandanas are in.

2472
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:52,900
Yeah. So this outfit is very stylish right now.

2473
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:55,140
The Grizzly River employee.

2474
01:43:55,140 --> 01:43:58,820
I have to like I want to I want to like look up a picture of like what it

2475
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:01,900
what it actually is so that we can really critique it,

2476
01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:05,740
because I'm going off of memory and I don't know if it's accurate.

2477
01:44:05,860 --> 01:44:10,540
Some costumes, some employee costumes seem a little like mortifying.

2478
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:13,460
Like if you had to wear that every day, be a tad embarrassing.

2479
01:44:13,460 --> 01:44:16,860
But there are some yes, sometimes in my wife, and I'll especially point out,

2480
01:44:16,860 --> 01:44:18,380
like that's that's pretty sharp.

2481
01:44:18,380 --> 01:44:20,420
That's pretty Foxy uniform. Right.

2482
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:22,900
Yeah. Sometimes they get Foxy.

2483
01:44:22,900 --> 01:44:24,940
I love. Oh, go ahead. Oh, no, I was just saying.

2484
01:44:25,020 --> 01:44:28,300
Just you go. Indiana Jones.

2485
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:29,420
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

2486
01:44:29,420 --> 01:44:31,540
And those clothes are cool. Yeah. Uh huh.

2487
01:44:31,540 --> 01:44:34,220
I was just going to say which one specifically has been referred

2488
01:44:34,220 --> 01:44:36,500
to as Foxy by you or Erin.

2489
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:39,020
I'm not I can't I can't recall off.

2490
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:43,620
But this genre for sure of like outdoorsy, like

2491
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:46,620
beige khaki. Yeah.

2492
01:44:46,620 --> 01:44:48,380
Like for women, especially.

2493
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:50,500
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Some are pretty cool.

2494
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:53,540
Like a lot of some feel like Karen Allen and yeah.

2495
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:55,300
Yeah. Yeah.

2496
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:56,580
Yes. Everyone loves it.

2497
01:44:56,580 --> 01:45:00,540
As it not like the Little Mermaid ride where they're wearing like little sailor suits.

2498
01:45:00,820 --> 01:45:04,180
Yeah, I'd say that's not good or anything where you're in like a, you know,

2499
01:45:04,180 --> 01:45:06,780
I wouldn't want if I was working in a park, I wouldn't want to dress in anything

2500
01:45:06,780 --> 01:45:10,740
where I had to wear like a big floppy Renaissance hat or anything with like

2501
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:14,460
the big big shoulder puffs.

2502
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:19,940
I would love to wear the maid's outfits in Haunted Mansion.

2503
01:45:19,940 --> 01:45:21,140
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

2504
01:45:21,140 --> 01:45:23,100
Those are so cool. Those are pretty cool.

2505
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:25,220
What were you wearing in the what was medieval times?

2506
01:45:25,860 --> 01:45:27,540
We were like it was similar to that.

2507
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:31,500
It was like a peasant's blouse and like a skirt.

2508
01:45:31,540 --> 01:45:35,820
And they gave us like a little corset, cinchy thing that we sort of tie.

2509
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:37,500
Sure. All right.

2510
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:38,540
It's great. Huh?

2511
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:41,260
I would like to wear the cars racing outfit.

2512
01:45:42,140 --> 01:45:44,780
The like that's the pit crew jumpsuit.

2513
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:46,740
I love the pit crew jumpsuit.

2514
01:45:46,740 --> 01:45:48,540
That's fun. Yeah.

2515
01:45:48,540 --> 01:45:49,220
That's good.

2516
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:51,740
You look kind of like Joel on Mystery Science Theater.

2517
01:45:51,860 --> 01:45:53,900
Original Mystery Science Theater.

2518
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:55,300
That's right. Yeah.

2519
01:45:55,300 --> 01:45:58,980
And then Duffy has that my Duffy has that same outfit.

2520
01:45:58,980 --> 01:46:01,420
So Duffy and I could wear the same clothes.

2521
01:46:01,420 --> 01:46:02,380
Should we get another drink?

2522
01:46:02,380 --> 01:46:04,060
Ten years away from that, too. Right?

2523
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:06,100
Oh, boy. I don't know.

2524
01:46:06,340 --> 01:46:07,580
Yeah, we know.

2525
01:46:07,580 --> 01:46:10,380
How do we? Yeah, we might be ten minutes as soon as we leave.

2526
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:15,020
He puts the clothes he puts on a jumpsuit that matches his tiny stuffed bears jumpsuit.

2527
01:46:15,940 --> 01:46:17,540
And then Ed would get one, too.

2528
01:46:17,540 --> 01:46:20,300
You know, Duffy, the Disney teddy bear.

2529
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:21,940
I had the name sounds familiar.

2530
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:24,660
It's just a sort of a personality list.

2531
01:46:24,660 --> 01:46:26,860
Teddy bear they sell in the theme park.

2532
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:28,380
His traits are no traits.

2533
01:46:28,380 --> 01:46:31,100
And he he mini made this.

2534
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:34,580
The backstories that mini made Duffy for Mickey,

2535
01:46:34,580 --> 01:46:39,740
because Mickey is a sea captain and then he was going on a long sea voyage.

2536
01:46:39,780 --> 01:46:40,940
I see. So Duffy.

2537
01:46:40,940 --> 01:46:42,460
He's also kind of a cipher.

2538
01:46:42,460 --> 01:46:46,060
Mickey has had a million jobs or can do whatever you want him to do.

2539
01:46:46,260 --> 01:46:51,220
Yes. After he after they said maybe he shouldn't be insulting mini like that.

2540
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:52,460
Yeah. Yeah.

2541
01:46:52,460 --> 01:46:54,060
Let's keep you busy.

2542
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:55,620
Maybe you shouldn't be a misogynist.

2543
01:46:55,620 --> 01:46:58,340
Or like some of the maybe some of the older Mickey's.

2544
01:46:58,340 --> 01:47:00,700
He's always like an arms reach away from a gun.

2545
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:04,420
And some of those old shorts and comic strips.

2546
01:47:04,540 --> 01:47:07,180
He was always he wields a gun in the comic.

2547
01:47:07,180 --> 01:47:08,380
These comics I'm reading.

2548
01:47:08,380 --> 01:47:09,780
So, yeah, yeah.

2549
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:11,220
So he was a wild man.

2550
01:47:11,220 --> 01:47:14,660
So anyway, mini knew he needed to be kept busy at sea.

2551
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:18,140
And of course, a teddy bear was going to keep him company.

2552
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:20,340
And Duffy was born.

2553
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:23,460
And now you can get Duffy and his his friend,

2554
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:26,380
Shelly May, and dress them in all sorts of fun outfits.

2555
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:31,340
And this is what I'm describing to you, Mike's teddy bear, who he dresses.

2556
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:33,180
And he's up. I have him upstairs.

2557
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:35,700
Very fun. And he has a full cars jumpsuit.

2558
01:47:36,380 --> 01:47:39,620
So as soon as we leave, he has his own bed.

2559
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:43,180
As soon as we leave, you'll put on Duffy's shoes and socks and then

2560
01:47:43,580 --> 01:47:46,660
and then discreetly take the shoes off and take the socks off

2561
01:47:46,820 --> 01:47:48,260
and then put the shoes back on.

2562
01:47:48,260 --> 01:47:49,140
That's right. In the bath.

2563
01:47:49,140 --> 01:47:50,820
We'll be in the bathtub.

2564
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:52,460
It'll simulate the log.

2565
01:47:52,460 --> 01:47:54,860
Yikes. It's OK, Duffy.

2566
01:47:54,860 --> 01:47:56,420
No one is looking.

2567
01:47:58,780 --> 01:48:01,700
Who is going to come out of this episode looking weirder, me or Jason?

2568
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:04,260
Is it me? For once, you maybe. OK.

2569
01:48:05,180 --> 01:48:08,060
Don't forget, I was moaning about Tiffany Lamps a while back.

2570
01:48:08,060 --> 01:48:09,100
That feels like it was yesterday.

2571
01:48:09,100 --> 01:48:10,140
Yeah, I know. Yeah.

2572
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:11,580
It's been so much creepiness.

2573
01:48:11,580 --> 01:48:13,140
Covered so much since.

2574
01:48:13,140 --> 01:48:16,460
So we really have any closing thoughts about this ride, about California

2575
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:19,660
Adventure, about theme parks, love, love, love.

2576
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:22,220
I support I'm in favor of.

2577
01:48:22,220 --> 01:48:22,980
I love it.

2578
01:48:22,980 --> 01:48:27,500
I would just highly recommend going at night to any of these rides.

2579
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:29,500
I think that's a great experience. Sure.

2580
01:48:29,620 --> 01:48:34,420
And listen, just.

2581
01:48:35,620 --> 01:48:40,980
Hey, get a little of that river water in your mouth and see what happens.

2582
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:43,780
And let us know your immune system.

2583
01:48:43,780 --> 01:48:45,340
You'll never get sick again.

2584
01:48:45,340 --> 01:48:46,940
Cold and flu season is coming.

2585
01:48:46,940 --> 01:48:47,580
That's right.

2586
01:48:47,580 --> 01:48:49,820
Teach your teach your innards to fight.

2587
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:51,900
Yeah, in shape.

2588
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:54,340
Better than a vaccine, better than a flu vaccine.

2589
01:48:54,340 --> 01:48:54,780
Sure.

2590
01:48:54,780 --> 01:48:56,780
Drinking a little grizzly river run water.

2591
01:48:56,780 --> 01:49:01,540
And I say like, turn up the water, especially when I think so, too.

2592
01:49:01,540 --> 01:49:02,180
Turn up the water.

2593
01:49:02,180 --> 01:49:05,380
I've been there during heat waves and I still haven't gotten that way.

2594
01:49:05,380 --> 01:49:08,860
I want them to turn up the water and let's get a few more robots in there.

2595
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:10,500
I think we all can agree on that.

2596
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:11,660
We can all agree on that.

2597
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:13,940
Whatever genre of robot they put in.

2598
01:49:13,940 --> 01:49:14,940
Yeah. Yeah.

2599
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:16,020
We'll love it.

2600
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:18,260
All right.

2601
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:20,020
Well, great tips.

2602
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:21,500
Great episode. Thanks for hanging out.

2603
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:23,540
Mary Holland, you survived podcast the ride.

2604
01:49:23,780 --> 01:49:25,260
Thanks so much for being here.

2605
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:26,860
Let's exit through the gift shop.

2606
01:49:26,860 --> 01:49:28,860
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2607
01:49:28,860 --> 01:49:33,420
Oh, as I exit the gift shop, well, take this key chain of the picture of us.

2608
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:37,780
And you know, what's the thing I forgot to mention is that the the little store,

2609
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:41,460
I think it's called a Russian River Outpost or something.

2610
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:43,780
Oh, yes. Love Russian River Outpost.

2611
01:49:43,780 --> 01:49:46,540
Oh, wait. OK. Well, that's literally the gift shop.

2612
01:49:46,540 --> 01:49:48,780
Fabulous. Seemingly. Very fun.

2613
01:49:49,140 --> 01:49:50,700
Very fun. A lot of fun odds and ends.

2614
01:49:50,700 --> 01:49:51,540
You know what? You know, it's weird.

2615
01:49:51,540 --> 01:49:51,940
They have a bunch.

2616
01:49:51,940 --> 01:49:54,580
There's they have like grizzly puppets and the puppets,

2617
01:49:54,780 --> 01:49:57,660
despite being a different kind of Disney bear than Duffy,

2618
01:49:57,660 --> 01:50:00,860
also have a little mouse ear shape in the paw.

2619
01:50:01,060 --> 01:50:02,380
Oh, interesting.

2620
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:04,420
You can get those. Those seem pretty cute.

2621
01:50:04,420 --> 01:50:05,780
And you can get thermoses.

2622
01:50:05,780 --> 01:50:08,340
You can get all kinds of camping goods there, which is really fun.

2623
01:50:08,340 --> 01:50:11,780
You can also take a scoop and get a big big bag of gems.

2624
01:50:12,020 --> 01:50:14,180
You can buy. Yeah. When I was a kid.

2625
01:50:14,180 --> 01:50:16,020
Oh, yeah. Forget it.

2626
01:50:16,020 --> 01:50:17,340
You see those at a gift shop.

2627
01:50:17,340 --> 01:50:20,980
You're like, yeah, you know, it's not a matter of which if I've got to get it.

2628
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:23,220
What size bag are they going to let me get?

2629
01:50:23,220 --> 01:50:26,820
It's so funny how like you love that so much.

2630
01:50:26,820 --> 01:50:30,580
Yeah. Bag a bag of hard plastic.

2631
01:50:30,580 --> 01:50:32,580
Plastic. Yeah. But what a dream.

2632
01:50:32,580 --> 01:50:34,100
Gems. We're like children.

2633
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:38,980
I think Snow White trains us all that like that looks that's money, I guess, too.

2634
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:40,100
It looks like treasure.

2635
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:41,260
It looks like treasure.

2636
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:43,940
So anytime you see it, even if it's plastic,

2637
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:46,660
I think I thought it was worth money, though.

2638
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:49,740
I think I because there used to be that when the Wisconsin Dells,

2639
01:50:49,940 --> 01:50:51,860
you could sift and find them.

2640
01:50:51,860 --> 01:50:54,260
They did a whole show. A great idea.

2641
01:50:54,260 --> 01:50:58,660
Yeah. So we would like sift through and find the plastic gems

2642
01:50:58,660 --> 01:51:00,020
and then put them in an old bag.

2643
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:03,300
And I remember being like, you know, with money, like I'm going to be rich.

2644
01:51:03,300 --> 01:51:06,140
And at that young age and an entrepreneur. Yeah.

2645
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:08,980
Looking for it, looking to make a buck.

2646
01:51:09,820 --> 01:51:12,420
For me, I'm in it for the magic.

2647
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:17,300
I love the they also look like candy, which I think is very appealing.

2648
01:51:17,300 --> 01:51:19,420
Yes. Want to put them in my mouth.

2649
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:21,140
Yeah. When I eat.

2650
01:51:21,140 --> 01:51:22,420
Oh, I knew we couldn't.

2651
01:51:22,420 --> 01:51:25,460
I knew we couldn't make an episode about you saying something

2652
01:51:25,740 --> 01:51:27,860
that's something putting in your mouth.

2653
01:51:27,860 --> 01:51:30,420
Put it in your mouth, Jason.

2654
01:51:30,420 --> 01:51:31,820
I knew we couldn't.

2655
01:51:31,820 --> 01:51:33,180
God, we were so close.

2656
01:51:33,180 --> 01:51:34,620
We almost made it. We almost made it.

2657
01:51:34,620 --> 01:51:36,620
What are the things? What's going on?

2658
01:51:36,620 --> 01:51:38,020
What are you doing? What's going on?

2659
01:51:38,020 --> 01:51:40,580
I'm perform at UCB.

2660
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:43,900
I'm there a lot with with various groups.

2661
01:51:43,900 --> 01:51:45,180
So come check it out.

2662
01:51:45,180 --> 01:51:49,100
Wild Horses and JV and NASCAR and all those guys.

2663
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:52,220
If you're in L.A., come see a show.

2664
01:51:52,220 --> 01:51:56,820
And then in general, what I'm up to, I'm on that show, Robbie.

2665
01:51:56,820 --> 01:51:59,100
That's going to be coming out on Comedy Central soon.

2666
01:51:59,540 --> 01:52:02,340
And then a movie with Betsy Sodaro.

2667
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:06,140
We don't know when that's coming out.

2668
01:52:06,140 --> 01:52:08,540
But that's called Golden Arm. And that's coming up.

2669
01:52:08,780 --> 01:52:11,700
So yeah, there's a lot of fun stuff happening.

2670
01:52:11,780 --> 01:52:14,500
That's great. So I guess just keep your ear to the ground.

2671
01:52:14,820 --> 01:52:18,260
Can you plug a Twitter maybe that you get or stuff?

2672
01:52:18,260 --> 01:52:19,460
Was that what you put things?

2673
01:52:19,460 --> 01:52:25,980
I post updates on Twitter at M Holland 85 and on Instagram at Mary Holland days.

2674
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:28,820
Like the sauce. Of course.

2675
01:52:28,820 --> 01:52:31,500
Great sauce. Great sauce.

2676
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:34,660
You don't say it. Just plug that in general.

2677
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:39,380
Yeah. And as for us, hey, live shows coming up.

2678
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:41,820
Those are those will still be in the future.

2679
01:52:42,020 --> 01:52:45,020
Chicago, Orlando happening.

2680
01:52:45,060 --> 01:52:48,820
Come see us if we're coming to your town or come to another town.

2681
01:52:48,980 --> 01:52:51,420
If those aren't your towns, go to one of those two.

2682
01:52:51,420 --> 01:52:53,460
Don't just go to any town.

No gems and no feet stuff either. Michael, what is that?

2689
01:53:12,940 --> 01:53:14,020
What would that even be?

2690
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:15,020
I don't know.

2691
01:53:15,020 --> 01:53:16,420
You're an entrepreneur.

2692
01:53:16,420 --> 01:53:18,180
Yeah, I don't know.

2693
01:53:18,180 --> 01:53:20,420
Like hoes, hoes, hoes, hoes.

2694
01:53:20,420 --> 01:53:22,460
Buy Jason's old wet socks.

2695
01:53:25,060 --> 01:53:25,780
Forever wet.

2696
01:53:25,780 --> 01:53:29,580
Directly from our WikiFeet page, which doesn't exist as we record this,

2697
01:53:29,740 --> 01:53:32,180
but will exist by the end of the episode having aired.

2698
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:35,020
Very good. Go to WikiFeet.com slash podcast.

2699
01:53:35,780 --> 01:53:40,300
Could we add a Patreon tier where, like, if we come to your come to a town,

2700
01:53:40,820 --> 01:53:43,020
we can set you up in a dunk tank.

2701
01:53:43,820 --> 01:53:45,460
Sounds like your dream.

2702
01:53:45,460 --> 01:53:48,260
Yeah, the logistics of getting a dunk tank, though.

2703
01:53:48,460 --> 01:53:50,540
I got to imagine that's a pain in the ass.

2704
01:53:50,700 --> 01:53:52,780
Why just get a big tank full of water?

2705
01:53:52,780 --> 01:53:55,420
I got you. It's local ordinances.

2706
01:53:55,420 --> 01:53:57,220
She's right. It doesn't matter.

2707
01:53:57,220 --> 01:54:00,060
Let's just get a Rubbermaid and then you can sit in a chair above it.

2708
01:54:00,060 --> 01:54:00,740
That's it. OK.

2709
01:54:00,740 --> 01:54:01,660
Just need a rubbermaid.

2710
01:54:01,660 --> 01:54:04,220
And then the listener will be able to just push you into the Rubbermaid.

2711
01:54:05,460 --> 01:54:06,020
There's no.

2712
01:54:06,020 --> 01:54:06,740
He's genius.

2713
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:09,940
And we make a big sign that says put Jason in his natural state.

2714
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:11,540
That's true.

2715
01:54:11,540 --> 01:54:12,820
Natural state booth.

2716
01:54:12,820 --> 01:54:15,060
Yeah. All right. That's easy.

2717
01:54:15,060 --> 01:54:16,380
Done. All right.

2718
01:54:16,380 --> 01:54:18,420
That'll do it. Check us out next week.

2719
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:19,220
