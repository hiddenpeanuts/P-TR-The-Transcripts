1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:12,480
Warning, the following podcast may include arbitrary lightsabers, youth groups under siege,

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,600
lasers that spread the gospel, and the most obscure streaming platforms known to man.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:25,840
Plug in your headphones of righteousness as we talk religious superhero Bible man on Podcast

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:46,840
the Ride.

7
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:53,040
The most solemn Good Friday to you on Podcast the Ride, a show about theme parks hosted by

8
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,200
three good boys who just want you to learn about a good book.

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,240
I'm Scott Gardner, one of them, Mike Carlson.

10
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,240
Hello.

11
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,880
Michael Sollum Carlson.

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,880
Hello.

13
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:09,960
Yes, we were just, usually we want you to read the Sumner Redstone book, but today it's a

14
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,120
different book that we want you to read.

15
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,960
There's plenty admirable about him, but I think, but you know, but all lessons in how

16
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,960
to live.

17
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,960
Right.

18
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,960
Operate your empire.

19
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,960
Yes.

20
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,400
And yeah, Jason Chert, ran out of that.

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,400
That's that's okay.

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,400
Well, hard wall.

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
You were thinking about Sumner.

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,400
I was getting choked up about that.

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,400
We've lost him.

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,760
He you know, he is a Christ like figure and you have a lot of reverence for him and it

27
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,760
makes sense.

28
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,760
A prophet.

29
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,520
Well, he's a guy he's he in many times in his life said he would never die, which feels

30
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,000
did he say, oh, kind of akin to I got to read this GD book.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,960
I'm not gonna say it because it's the episode.

32
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,680
That's a bit of the wrong episode to say it.

33
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,160
I'm glad you're starting to say yes.

34
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,160
Good.

35
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,320
No, he they opened a building on the Paramount lot named after him.

36
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,600
They opened the Redstone building and he said, I don't know how I feel about this because

37
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,720
buildings are tributes to people who die and I will never die.

38
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,640
Look I admire that Arrested Development narrator soon after he died.

39
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,520
Oh man, I got to read this book.

40
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,520
It's a good one.

41
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
I'll lend it to you.

42
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,800
But there's a more important book.

43
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
It's the Bible.

44
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,320
There's a more important book back here in our timeline.

45
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,360
It's Palm Sunday as we record.

46
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,280
So this is the sort of day where a Protestant pastor would say, let us rejoice.

47
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,560
This is the day the Lord has made.

48
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,920
Let us rejoice and be glad there in.

49
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,920
Okay.

50
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,760
Especially with this topic we have lots to be glad about.

51
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,320
Oh, so much.

52
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
Obviously.

53
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,080
I mean, we can be extra glad that there was never an opponent of Bible man who weaponized

54
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,160
or electrified Palm Sunday poems to use against churchgoers.

55
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,440
That would have been a terrifying ordeal for everyone.

56
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,000
No, no.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,880
The villains when I were growing up was usually more like school board members embezzling.

58
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,440
Teacher who needs to stop in the middle of class because someone needs to escort them

59
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,360
out as an affair with a student was discovered.

60
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,760
Well, yeah, that happened at our school.

61
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,440
That happened at a lot of schools.

62
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,440
Yeah.

63
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,680
Well, hold on to those thoughts.

64
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,960
Maybe some similar notions coming up at some point as we deconstruct the figures involved

65
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,040
in Bible man.

66
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,840
That's what we're talking about today.

67
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,220
The series of religious videos or if you want to call it a show, I think it was a purpose

68
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,280
to be a show that aired in various forms on television.

69
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,680
But the main headline, a religious superhero.

70
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,880
And if you aren't tracking it, just to remind you, typically we think we've done this three

71
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,880
times now.

72
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,640
There's been a Good Friday tradition heading into Easter weekend of covering religious

73
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,640
theme parks.

74
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:57,720
There's an odd pile of those all mildly unpleasant and dispiriting.

75
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,160
But we've plowed through and we've talked about them.

76
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:07,040
We've reaped the garden of religious theme parks and tried to sow rewards for you, the

77
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,040
listener.

78
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,600
But we're really running low on that, I would say.

79
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Yes.

80
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
I was going to say that's true.

81
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,200
We were running low on that.

82
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,280
But I will say this, if you're if you're looking at this topic and you're thinking, oh, this

83
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,800
doesn't have anything to do with what the boys have covered before.

84
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,440
Untrue because they did Bible man live.

85
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,800
There was a live and touring spectator.

86
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:36,560
This is absolutely this is the live show was a source of more traffic and attendance, I'd

87
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,760
say than a number of live presentations we've talked about before.

88
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,760
Yes, absolutely.

89
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,120
We've done, you know, we've covered Power Rangers and Ninja Turtles and Mortal Kombat.

90
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:54,520
This very much resembles your 90s songs and stage show with this type of like little boy

91
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,520
IP.

92
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,600
I shouldn't gender it, but you know what I'm saying?

93
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,520
Like action adventure IP.

94
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,880
They would gender it.

95
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,880
That's true.

96
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,880
You're right.

97
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,180
This is this entity, a very Christian entity would be the first to proudly gender it.

98
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,820
They wouldn't remove females from the audience, but they might remove them from the first

99
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,820
few rows.

100
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,820
Very good point.

101
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,820
Yes.

102
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:20,780
But I think a big remaining park is what's the one that they like?

103
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:26,300
Well, the Righteous Gemstones had a lot of theme park content in the most recent season

104
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,640
for their park.

105
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,260
But the real was it Jim and Tammy Faye or was it another?

106
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,820
We did that.

107
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,820
We did that.

108
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,820
That's what we did last year.

109
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,820
The park.

110
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,820
Uh huh.

111
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,300
But I swear we did.

112
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,300
We did.

113
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,300
We did.

114
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,300
I feel like there was another one.

115
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,300
I got to look this up now.

116
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,020
I feel like there was another even shittier one that I'm forgetting.

117
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,700
There's one in Connecticut seemingly and you start looking into it.

118
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,500
One of the main headlines in the wiki was when like somebody was murdered there and

119
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,140
you're like, all right, skip, let's turn the car around.

120
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,020
Maybe we don't need to learn about that.

121
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:08,020
That's actually, that's a recurring theme with some malls that go downhill really fast.

122
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:13,100
It's like body found in the parking lot or stabbing in the parking lot.

123
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:18,380
Oh, there was a, there was a shooting in one of my favorite childhood malls last night.

124
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,380
Yes.

125
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,380
Fallbrook Mall.

126
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,380
Yeah.

127
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,380
In the valley.

128
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,100
Uh, it was referred to as a narcotics based incident.

129
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,100
Jesus.

130
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,100
Kind.

131
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,100
Uh, so yeah, I don't pay.

132
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,300
They're becoming the, you know, the ones that aren't so lucky or odd.

133
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,020
Places and these things happen.

134
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,060
I believe this religious theme park in question was abandoned.

135
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,060
I don't remember the rest.

136
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,780
So that'll happen to an abandoned theme park.

137
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,780
We'll do it.

138
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,780
Do as taught us.

139
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,020
Uh, there's, there's bound to be bad news going on there.

140
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,340
So we'll get there, but this one has a live show and it's got characters and we can say

141
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,500
more fun than the abandoned place where somebody was killed.

142
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,500
Yes.

143
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,220
Um, yeah, we're going to, we're going to have a fun time here.

144
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:01,180
And I think, and this is paying off, I think a lot of years of mentioning Bible man here

145
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,700
and there, I don't remember why, but I know it's come up and I feel like Mike was the

146
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:11,220
first to bring it up and I was delighted because I was vaguely aware of Bible man.

147
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,140
Maybe just to do a little bit of archeology here.

148
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:20,420
Do you remember why it came up before or your previous experience or awareness of Bible

149
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,420
man?

150
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,780
I have no memory of why it came up before.

151
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,940
I know we were talking about Fibler and flabber.

152
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,940
Yes.

153
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:34,180
I think Fibler, uh, flabber, um, classifying what each clarifying what each one was.

154
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,180
Yes.

155
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,060
Fibler is the villain from a Bible man.

156
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,620
And the other is, which I keep, did I say him right?

157
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:45,140
Flabber, flabber, which we've, we've teased an episode about that eventually too.

158
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,380
Who looked like, who looked like Jaylen, who looked a lot like Jaylen.

159
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:55,440
Um, I think my first Bible man, I think I was at, I want to say like Western university

160
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,880
in Illinois, my visiting some friends and it was like a Saturday afternoon in the middle

161
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:07,400
of nowhere and we were just cruising around and was what 2005 or something 2004 and we

162
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,760
were like, what is this?

163
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,760
And we got so excited because it was a religious superhero show.

164
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,760
You found the tape somewhere.

165
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,760
It was on TV.

166
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
It was on, just on TV.

167
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,120
I don't know what network, who knows what network it was.

168
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,440
I think it aired on TBN on Trinity.

169
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,360
It for sure aired places, but yeah, I don't know what network it was.

170
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
This has happened a lot.

171
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,920
I remember I would go to a college town where my, with like one of my friends or something.

172
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:35,360
And this is where I found out that NASCAR was started by like bootleggers and learned

173
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,760
about the character, the real life man, popcorn Sutton, who was a big influential popcorn.

174
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,000
So like, I feel like you would go there and on Saturday afternoon you would get networks

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,740
that you didn't get near the big city.

176
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,680
So you would learn, you would learn about things and we were the right age at that point

177
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,380
to be very intrigued by Bible man.

178
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,380
So we enjoyed.

179
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,380
Absolutely.

180
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,760
You see one image and you fall in love with it.

181
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,760
Yeah.

182
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,080
So like, I'm sorry, there's what now?

183
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
Yeah.

184
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
What exists?

185
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,200
And it's like a bad, my memory is we saw like the bad, one of the bad, like fake lights

186
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,320
or like lightsaber fights, which is essentially they have.

187
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,320
Yes.

188
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
Yeah.

189
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,280
So that was my, I believe that was the first time I ever heard about it.

190
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
Yeah.

191
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,940
I, you, you and your friends found that and I, me and my friends found a very similar,

192
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:26,780
on the same level, which is the home shopping, the sub home shopping network.

193
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,900
It's not even of knife show.

194
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,700
You're talking about, are we talking about Don West?

195
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,700
No, not Don West.

196
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:39,780
There's just a reoccurring show on like the early cable numbers where it's like, and you

197
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,420
get, you get like 50 knives.

198
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,420
Okay.

199
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,260
You spend $50 and you get fit.

200
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,620
That's dollar knife and you get all these knives.

201
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,620
Yes.

202
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,620
Knife.

203
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,620
I've seen that.

204
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,420
Don West's sports memorabilia show he used to do on, I forget, it was not home shopping.

205
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,420
It was like four down the list of, he first did sports collectibles.

206
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,020
They made fun of it on Saturday Night Live with that Mark Hamill sketch where they were

207
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,980
like selling Mark Hamill essentially.

208
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,380
But then he, then Don West switched to Beanie Babies.

209
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:16,960
So you had Don West, this is glory bear and we're selling it for $30.

210
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,740
Are you sure?

211
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,860
Are you sure?

212
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,260
Princess Bear and Glory, you're getting both of them.

213
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:27,420
And he was just shouting like he's doing a wrestling promo, which he went on to do wrestling

214
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,420
announcing.

215
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,420
Yeah.

216
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,420
Yeah.

217
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,420
And we love this.

218
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,740
We were obsessed with it and they're all on YouTube and they're so great.

219
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,980
And rest in peace, Don West, like as of a couple, like a month or two ago.

220
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,980
Yell himself to death?

221
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,300
No, I don't think so.

222
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,340
I think the yelling was good for him.

223
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,460
I think the yelling was power, was power.

224
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,900
It wasn't, he didn't know he was going to die and he was auctioning off his own kidneys

225
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,060
and other body parts.

226
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,300
I don't believe so.

227
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,340
Everything must go.

228
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,340
But he was insane.

229
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,340
We saw him live.

230
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,340
I'm not going to need a skeleton anymore.

231
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,660
My soul's going to be out of this thing.

232
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,820
He would do it like you would go up to him at a con and you could be like, Hey, Don, could

233
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,980
you like, like do your pitch for this?

234
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,860
And it would be like the Wolf of Wall Street thing where like, show me this pencil and

235
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,180
Don could just do it.

236
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,180
Great.

237
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,940
Don would just yell and convince you to buy it.

238
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,940
You ever have the chance?

239
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,940
No, but we saw it happen.

240
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,260
I saw it happen live in Schomburg at a convention like 2018.

241
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,900
It was a mile away from where you were.

242
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,740
You heard it faintly through the restaurant window.

243
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:33,540
So yeah, all this like sleepy, like sometimes regional TV is just, it's the best.

244
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,540
Sure, sure.

245
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,660
I want to say, I don't remember where I found it, but it seems possible.

246
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:43,780
I was, I found a lot of oddities at the 99 cent only store in high school.

247
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,500
That became a delightful place for particularly.

248
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,620
I just remember that they had, I mean, my fair thing was that they would, they just

249
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:57,820
have like a absolute bulk, like every, for a while, every 99 cent only store in Los Angeles

250
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:05,220
had at least 50, if not more copies of Hulk rules, Hulk Hogan's, Hulk semi rap.

251
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,220
Maybe.

252
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,220
Oh no, no, that's what was a DVD.

253
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,220
Sorry.

254
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,220
Yeah.

255
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,220
Okay.

256
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,220
No, I believe it was, unless it was Hulkster.

257
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,620
No, I think there was a DVD of Hulk still rules that I was thinking of.

258
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,980
There was, they clearly, whatever deal was, this, this was kind of an ET landfill situation

259
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,500
where we got to move these things.

260
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:26,020
Like we promised Hulk, like Larry, let me, you're going to make a million of these brother.

261
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:31,940
I need to see them all lined up to know that you did it or else I put you in the ground.

262
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,700
And then like he checked and they did.

263
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,700
And then like, what do we do with these CD copies?

264
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,700
We have to move it.

265
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:42,460
So I would go buy them like dozens of time, which I might've pared it down to one, but

266
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,140
there were times where I would like, I'm all right, I'm going to go buy 20 Hulk Hogan

267
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,140
albums for $20 for knife prices.

268
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,460
So it's possible to me that Bible man was at the 99 cent only store.

269
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:58,100
It seems especially likely that, so I remember a tape and then I remember that I found party

270
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,100
invitations.

271
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:05,380
That was the, which might still be in my drawer at home, uh, uh, which I don't think I ever

272
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:10,420
made good on actually having a Bible man themed birthday party and using those as the invitations,

273
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,700
but I might still have them.

274
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,180
But mainly, I mean, I know for a fact, it was the one you mentioned.

275
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:23,940
It was the six lies of the fibler, which gives you a lot of information on the cover.

276
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:32,900
You see the fibler who is this wild face paint caked on, although what you see on the cover

277
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:38,380
looks far better than what is in the episode itself.

278
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:44,260
But kind of like, you know, nobody did a bad job on this costume.

279
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,780
Did it like complete?

280
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:50,820
Look, you're assigned, you're given a small budget and you are assigned to make a superhero

281
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,340
costume, but it's still, it is very hokey.

282
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,340
It is just hokey.

283
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,500
That's what it is.

284
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:01,200
And then a very important detail, um, starring Willie Ames of eight is enough and Charles

285
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
in charge.

286
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Of course.

287
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,260
So, which hit me not because, Oh, I remember that guy, but because I've never heard of

288
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:13,180
this guy, I know those shows, but that he does not fall into any nostalgia lane that

289
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,420
I care about.

290
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,620
It is no draw for me that Willie Ames is Bible man.

291
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:25,140
It kind of came watching when he's like in his alter ego, when he's the regular guy who

292
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,140
is really klutzy.

293
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:32,140
He's real like when, when Clark Kent is a doofus, he's doing that a lot.

294
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,220
He falls down a lot in the big, big book.

295
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,340
The first one drops boxes.

296
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,420
Yeah.

297
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:43,580
And so when he was dressed in a polo and khakis, I was like, okay, I kind of remember him as

298
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,740
Charles's friend.

299
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,740
Okay.

300
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,220
Was he a dorky friend or was he also cool?

301
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,980
Not as cool as Charles.

302
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,980
Yeah.

303
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,380
He is not as cool as Charles.

304
00:14:54,380 --> 00:15:00,060
And I think they were both always looking to get rich quick or score chicks like any

305
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,060
eighties guys.

306
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,060
Sure.

307
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,060
Sure.

308
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,740
I think I was sort of heartthrob ish.

309
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,140
Yes, I guess.

310
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,980
I mean, he's always a little bit like doofy looking, but he did have that Leif Garrett

311
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:22,300
hair and he, he, look, his bod was in good shape according to photos from the movie Paradise

312
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,020
from 1982 with Phoebe Cates.

313
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:32,340
This was some sort of like post blue lagoon, like sexy abandoned on a desert island kind

314
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,460
of to my eyes.

315
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:39,800
He is no match for Phoebe Cates, one of the most attractive people in the history of earth

316
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
and time.

317
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,020
Well, why do we have to compare?

318
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:51,020
So I don't line them up at some, someone at a studio thought these, these two were a match.

319
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,740
So what else do we know about Willie Ames?

320
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,540
I guess, you know, I guess so sort of heartthrob.

321
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,420
He had a, he had a band coincidentally called Paradise also.

322
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,420
Oh wow.

323
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,420
I missed this.

324
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,420
Yeah.

325
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,420
They performed on the Merv Griffin show.

326
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,740
They were, they were trying to convince people that Willie Ames and Paradise was something

327
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,100
his real name, Willie Upton.

328
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:14,260
And he changed it at the advice of an agent who said, if you put, if you make your name

329
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:19,360
something with two A's in it, you'll always be at the top of any credits.

330
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,980
That's some old school Hollywood advice.

331
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,540
That's like Hank Kingsley's agent advice, like a 90 year old man.

332
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,540
Yeah.

333
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,540
I got that thing for you.

334
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,620
It's the school of thought that leads like Tobias Funke to put glitter in.

335
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,620
Oh, the headshots.

336
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,620
To casting agents.

337
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,620
Yeah.

338
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,620
Yes.

339
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,620
With this little, they'll remember.

340
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,620
The different looks.

341
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,620
Yeah.

342
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:46,180
So, you know, something of a schemester with a name change like that, that doesn't, that

343
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,140
doesn't line up with the future righteous man we see later.

344
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,700
Neither does his at one time, three gram a day cocaine habit.

345
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,500
I think he, it was pretty extreme for this fellow.

346
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,060
I think it was a rough for him.

347
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,060
Yeah.

348
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,340
And I think the career kind of went down the tubes.

349
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,300
I think he experienced some, some real trouble in his life.

350
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,500
And then I don't know what exactly brings him back to, brings him to this Bible man

351
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,520
role in the mid nineties, but it is presented to him and his own words.

352
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,000
He said, I thought it was the worst idea I'd ever heard.

353
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,080
So he was not on board, but I, but presumably somewhere in his travels, there must've been

354
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,880
a born again kind of situation where he was led to believe this could be more than just

355
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
a show.

356
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,880
Right.

357
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,320
It could be a ministry because that's something you might not know as you're looking at our

358
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,320
episode Arter.

359
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,300
If you know that there is a religious superhero that there was, there's a whole operation

360
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,600
here in the live tour.

361
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Yeah.

362
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,860
Certainly part of that.

363
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,800
But he pairs up with Pamplin media.

364
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,920
Yes.

365
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,120
The entity that produced this is a guy, Robert Pamplin Jr. who was at one point, one of the

366
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,680
40 richest men in America or the world.

367
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
I don't know.

368
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,980
Uh, I was trying to find out, uh, is there anything expressly evil about this guy?

369
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,960
And I, I couldn't find it for a little bit until he, like, he basically owns a lot of

370
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,440
like a gravel kind of companies in Portland, which he made him so much money.

371
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,680
He started buying up like a lot of media in Portland.

372
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,580
And again, didn't find anything too evil until the last year where there was a big

373
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:25,320
article about how he's maybe going to ruin all his employees' pension funds by tying

374
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,240
his own real estate holdings into the pension funds, which might sink the whole thing for

375
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,120
people who've worked for him for many decades.

376
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,720
Yeah, it's like, it's like the sly evil.

377
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,640
It's like, uh, you know about the U line psychos?

378
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,360
No, what's wrong with you?

379
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,480
You line that they, they have those big phone books of like boxes and packing peanuts and

380
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,640
all this stuff.

381
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,280
They are crazy.

382
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:54,720
They are crazy Christian, like talking about traditional values and Trump and all that

383
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,720
psycho stuff.

384
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
Okay.

385
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,640
I was, you know, I really thought that somebody involved in Bible man, I will do a search

386
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,800
next to the word Trump and I'm going to find something really damning, but not so much

387
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,080
the case really.

388
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,160
You're just fed straight into William's co-star, Scott Bayo.

389
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,160
Right.

390
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,880
One of the craziest Trumpers there is.

391
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
Yeah.

392
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,000
Um, but I, so I, at least everybody, I mean, we know that every single person on screen

393
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,600
in any of the videos we're going to talk about is an ardent supporter of Donald Trump.

394
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,120
Of course, but they've done a good job of hiding any Google history that would lead

395
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,120
you to that.

396
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,120
Yeah, it's, it's a lot more under the surface.

397
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,120
Yeah.

398
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:41,880
I sometimes with ones like this, I will just type in like the phrase in this case, like

399
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Bible man scam, Bible man, money laundering, Bible man, prison, and nothing really came

400
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,920
up this time.

401
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:58,360
Probably because it seems like on a certain level, these people like the Bible man shows

402
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:05,400
themselves, there's a little boring, pretty, there's some real boring stretches of a lot

403
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,400
of this.

404
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,520
Some, some stretches where it's like Bible man is giving unsolicited notes to children

405
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,920
pageant performers to children's skit performers.

406
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,040
Yeah, there's, there's a pretty, there's a boring stretch that you'll find that runs

407
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,880
from 1995 to 2010.

408
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,280
So then returns later.

409
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,840
Returns in an animated fashion.

410
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,640
And it really makes you go like, this was made in 2016.

411
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,640
Okay.

412
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:37,440
I miss the, uh, the glory to the charisma of, of Willie Ames, who I've kind of found

413
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,680
myself slipping into a Willie Ames kind of.

414
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,840
Oh, yeah.

415
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,000
In the last few days as I've mainline Bible man.

416
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,600
It's you know, you've got two.

417
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
All right.

418
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:54,080
So there's, there's Bible man, but like any good superhero, there is of course the alter

419
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,440
ego and then who he, he came from.

420
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:04,120
And the origin story that you get some iteration of in every episode is he's a miles B Peterson,

421
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,040
a wealthy man who turns to God and the Bible in his most desperate hour.

422
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,800
You hear in various intros, they say how it, for some reason it's screamed at you.

423
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,480
There's a voice, a very Don West like a cool young Don West.

424
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,480
Yeah.

425
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
He had it all.

426
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:25,160
He had fair and riches and so that I don't know.

427
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:30,000
Like it's like, uh, that reminded me of the start of the song blue.

428
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,680
There's a story of, I don't know.

429
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,680
I guess he's not gonna get that.

430
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,680
You up.

431
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,680
It's a hype song.

432
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,400
What was the Eiffel character we discovered again?

433
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,400
Yeah, that's right.

434
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,640
There were, there was original IP and blue.

435
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,640
Yeah.

436
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,640
And I forget the name.

437
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,640
Oh man, this is embarrassing.

438
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,800
You can keep all of it up and you guys.

439
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,800
Okay, great.

440
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,600
Um, but uh, from, from then on, so he, he discovers God in the Bible or really it's,

441
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:00,520
it's a very intense sequence where this guy is like wandering through a forest in the

442
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,520
rain.

443
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,760
He's got a, like, he's got a hat like Bruce Wayne would have had in the theater.

444
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,400
You got to have these like he's dressed like the forties, even if it isn't the forties.

445
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,960
But this tells you that he's wealthy, that he's got a businessman's hat.

446
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:21,040
And then he'd like, we don't really know the torment, but he's just screaming to no one

447
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:28,800
and nothing and then just falls into soil where thank God at that exact point in the

448
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,920
forest, this unmarked for he just kind of like starts digging through dirt and finds

449
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,920
a Bible, a Bible that I saw referred to in some places as a radioactive Bible.

450
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,920
Oh really?

451
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,920
I didn't see that.

452
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,400
I only saw that I didn't pick up on that myself.

453
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,880
I guess they made, if it was glowing and green, it was either too subtle or I had stopped

454
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,520
paying attention during that watch down.

455
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,560
I have to give them credit.

456
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,600
You know, I feel like Mike and I have complained about like so much superhero TV or movies.

457
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,160
They have to, they feel obligated to the origin story first.

458
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,480
Bible man just kind of the first one gets into it and I feel like rolls out the origin

459
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,000
later, you know, and rolls out a supporting cast, rolls out their equivalent of the Batman

460
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,960
family later on, you know?

461
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
Sure, sure.

462
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
Yeah.

463
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,200
You don't need to 10 episodes to get to the point where Miles Peterson puts on the costume.

464
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
We're right in it.

465
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
Let's get it going.

466
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
We've seen these tropes before.

467
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Yeah.

468
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
Yeah.

469
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
You know what?

470
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
I do appreciate that.

471
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:35,240
I think it's also important that they just cut to the chase because when you talk about

472
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:41,480
an origin story is meant to show you how these and I want to see how heroes unusual powers

473
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,960
were attained.

474
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,280
But now I pose to you both, please describe Bible man's powers.

475
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:53,360
Oh, well, I have a clip and a list here.

476
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,760
You want me to play this clip?

477
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,760
Sure.

478
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,040
Let me try to pull it up.

479
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,400
I don't know which episode this one.

480
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,640
This is standalone on YouTube and this is sort of Bible man armoring up.

481
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

482
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,840
With his sometimes assistant, Cypher.

483
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:16,480
He's like guy in the chair, as they say in the Spider-Man, the recent Spider-Man movies,

484
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,480
the guy in the computer.

485
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,480
Now this is what I call dressing for success.

486
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:35,760
We got a breath play to righteousness.

487
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,760
Breath play to righteousness.

488
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,760
Wow.

489
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,760
Shoes of peace.

490
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,760
Shoes of peace.

491
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,760
Starting to lose it.

492
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,760
Shield of faith.

493
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,760
OK, let's go back.

494
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,760
We're back.

495
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,760
Helmet of salvation.

496
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
Helmet of salvation.

497
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,600
OK, kind of unrelated concepts.

498
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,600
Full armor sequence complete.

499
00:24:53,600 --> 00:25:00,600
And the sword of the spirit.

500
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,600
Cypher, do I look OK to you?

501
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,600
Yeah, you look like a superhero, which is what you are.

502
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,600
Why?

503
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,600
Oh, no reason.

504
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,440
No reason.

505
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,440
What?

506
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,720
That's and that's you know, they're talking to you, Ness.

507
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,840
That's the Bible cave computer.

508
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,840
Yeah, of course.

509
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,840
We know.

510
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,840
Yeah, yeah.

511
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,120
Wait, Eunice stands for I'll get to it later.

512
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,560
The focus on working intelligence computing entity.

513
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,560
Great, great.

514
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:37,560
You know, that's one of those acronyms where it's a it's clunky, but then it all comes

515
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,320
together to form a name that is not a name anyone has.

516
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,320
Eunice.

517
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,360
It's all worth it in the end to get to.

518
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,360
Well, I think you got some Eunice's, you know, one hundred and fifty years ago.

519
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,640
But that's that's with an E.

520
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,320
You got an extra E at the beginning.

521
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,520
I don't think you got no Eunice with a U out in the world.

522
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,360
I'm so Eunice.

523
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,200
If you're listening with a U, I apologize.

524
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,600
I don't apologize to any Eunice's with an E out there.

525
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Eunice.

526
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,800
Yeah, I think it is a thing of like this year in this year, the Dust Bowl, the name Eunice.

527
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,640
Like that's you know, that's an old fashioned name.

528
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,320
That was in Disney Adventures.

529
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,560
What's hot and not.

530
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:23,320
That was in Disney Adventures where it was still mostly about Oswald and like Flip the Frog or whatever.

531
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,240
The pre that sort of era.

532
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,680
It was the cover where Clarabel Kao poses with FDR.

533
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,320
So, OK, now I'm glad you played that.

534
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,200
I like that sequence.

535
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,240
That it does not, however, answer the question, because those are items that he had.

536
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:51,440
There is some magic, certainly, in the way that it all just kind of appears in rays on his body.

537
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,480
I'll give him that.

538
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,200
But really now we're still in the territory of I mean, there's a precedent of Batman, not really a powers god.

539
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,240
Batman is kind of an owner of cool stuff.

540
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,360
Yes.

541
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,760
Mike, do you can you answer the question?

542
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,880
What are Bible man's powers?

543
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:12,120
Well, I know what I've seen him do, which is recite Bible verses.

544
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,440
You got it. Yeah.

545
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,360
His power is knowledge of the Bible.

546
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,600
He's very good at the Bible.

547
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:25,080
A power that anybody could have if they wanted it, if their hearts were open to it.

548
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:31,920
He's a swordsman to of some kind, but I don't know that he's actually getting any powers from any of the things that Jason listen to.

549
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,400
Yeah, he.

550
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:44,240
First of all, I should say, well, I'll post that clip online because there is a very grotesque wireframe graphic that like they're showing the like armor going on,

551
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,080
like a 3D figure, but it's like a weird bulbous.

552
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,640
There are a lot of deadly games era CGI graphics on this show, too.

553
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,760
That's accurate. Yeah.

554
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,920
It's pretty transparent.

555
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,000
I think what happened if you go to 1995, it's like, OK, they went.

556
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,560
We need an evangelical power rangers.

557
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,920
There's all these power.

558
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,040
There's power rangers.

559
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,400
There's all the knockoffs.

560
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,560
There's the bootlegs of the super sentai stuff.

561
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:14,600
But so they said, yes, the man whose power is he knows the Bible back to front.

562
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,240
He knows it. Yeah. Yeah.

563
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,520
Once in a while, he's Eunice will remind him.

564
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,960
Yeah, this that. Yeah. Let's be clear about that, too.

565
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,920
His power is knowing the Bible hit the supercomputer's power is knowing the Bible also.

566
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:32,040
Yes. With a little bit with like maybe he knows that ninety nine point seven percent of the time she fills in that.

567
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,800
Right. She's got that computerized full one hundred to bring to the table.

568
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:42,440
It's sort of weird when the MacGuffin of like this is the thing that gave you, you know, this is the radioactive spider.

569
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,960
This is the, you know, oh, they they became adolescents.

570
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,680
They're mutants. They have powers.

571
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:56,640
You know, it's weird when the MacGuffin that they draw their powers from is the word like the good book.

572
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,840
Honestly, here's what I'll say.

573
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,040
It all makes sense. This part makes sense to me.

574
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,040
Yeah, it's simple.

575
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,360
And you're like, yeah, it does.

576
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,760
It's Bible man is a good concept.

577
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,600
Honestly, you can quote Mike Carlson on that.

578
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,960
I'm not saying it pulled pulled off well.

579
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,080
Well, they they they got the like transformation.

580
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,320
They got the morphing sequence. Right.

581
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,280
They got they got this.

582
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:29,160
I think a big stumbling block for the evangelical media or voting block, whatever you want to call it,

583
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:36,280
tends to be like, OK, you when they're teaching these children's lessons,

584
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,440
they're forgetting to be entertaining and normal.

585
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,320
Like they're normal.

586
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,800
They're only hanging out with each other in youth groups in church.

587
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,880
And begrudgingly, they show school or they mention school occasionally.

588
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:56,120
But it's like, I don't know, why don't they go to a movie or go to a ballgate or like do something?

589
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,080
That's not just this.

590
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,840
You mean like a religious ballgame?

591
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,000
Where scripture is quoted before the bat is swung?

592
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,880
I mean, we did have occasionally have like sack races or a picnic on a.

593
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,000
You wait, wait, wait, wait. You had a sack race in church.

594
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,920
Well, there was like family fun days occasionally.

595
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,080
OK, but would you participate in sack races?

596
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:23,360
Yeah, yeah. Do sack races or like horseshoes or something like there is a barbecue.

597
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,120
I think I've had a sack race at a church.

598
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,600
I think I was OK at sack races.

599
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,520
We never went to church, but I think my grandmother once in a while would take us to her church.

600
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,320
And I do think I participated in a sack race.

601
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,400
Wow. Is that a themed?

602
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,320
Is that something we could talk about on the show?

603
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,840
Sack races, sack races.

604
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,160
Do sacks count as ride vehicles?

605
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,720
Yes. I think family fun day.

606
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,560
I think a lot of the in the in the San Fernando Valley, at least a lot of the parishes

607
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:55,360
that have like schools attached to fundraising carnivals this time of year in the spring.

608
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,520
All right. Well, maybe we'll find your local.

609
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,840
Maybe learn a little bit while you're there, too.

610
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,760
Yeah, and have a sack race.

611
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,120
Getting a sack race.

612
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,960
But a solemn sack race.

613
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,560
Yeah, yeah, I don't get too joyous.

614
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,440
You got to reflect after you see a sack race.

615
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,640
Think about that there would be no sack if it weren't for the sacrifices of our Lord Jesus Christ.

616
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,560
Wow, that is smooth.

617
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,600
See, I got I got Willie on the brain.

618
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,720
He really wormed in there, which I get.

619
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,400
So this is the other the other big thing about bio which you've alluded to.

620
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,360
The power is awareness of the Bible, but also swords.

621
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,280
Also swords are involved and specifically lightsabers.

622
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,280
It is lightsabers.

623
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:43,200
I remember this being a real shock in the first one I ever saw, the six lies of the fibbler where like,

624
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:51,040
OK, I guess I can see a lightsaber show despite I might argue that this is not an up for grabs weapon

625
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,280
and that this is associated with one particular franchise and can't just be borrowed.

626
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,440
But OK, I know I like some fun thievery too.

627
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:08,240
But then kind of a gloppy faced poor man's poor man, Caesar Romero Joker pulls out a lightsaber.

628
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:19,280
Is a funny and the then the lightsaber fights always happen like in front of a church or in a gymnasium.

629
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,760
In front of in front of a school with a gymnasium in it.

630
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,280
Yeah, yeah, possibly.

631
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:29,440
Yeah, if they got a football field, that's a fine place for it might happen in a warehouse

632
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,200
that when you look close at the ground is a repurposed school gymnasium.

633
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:38,080
Maybe they try to not light those clearly basketball court lines on the ground.

634
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,400
Right.

635
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,640
Maybe you won't notice there was one that happened in just kind of like a

636
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,520
mid sized elementary school principal's office like.

637
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:47,840
Wow.

638
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,040
Yeah, it wasn't.

639
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,200
I mean, there was room for a lightsaber fight, but I was worried at all times

640
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,960
that a big printer was going to get pushed over.

641
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,440
Yeah.

642
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,480
Yeah, those were very expensive back then.

643
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,240
Only a couple in the school, you know.

644
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:00,720
Oh, yeah.

645
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,240
So one goes down and then you got to shut down operations.

646
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,320
You're going to pull the mimeograph out of storage.

647
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,240
If the photocopier goes down, you're going to be had to make those purple.

648
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,440
Those purple worksheets.

649
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,720
Why are these purple today?

650
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,200
Don't ask.

651
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,360
None of your concern, kid.

652
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,600
But so it is Bible scripture and swords.

653
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,360
And you might be asking how does this work together?

654
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,480
And they're kind of these premises are kind of laid on top of each other.

655
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,240
Like I don't have anything memorized specifically, but it'll be kind of like

656
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:40,080
they they do fight, shoo, shoo, and then they get in kind of like they lock up.

657
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:47,120
And and then he Bible man will say, like Psalms three says that there is great

658
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:52,000
power in the Lord and once accepted into your heart, you can do all things.

659
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,200
And what I'm going to do is send you back where you came from.

660
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,120
And that's about the energy register that it'll stay at.

661
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,800
It's all very odd passages where mostly about the power of the Lord.

662
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,280
Sure.

663
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:13,600
Very few metaphor or like, and hey, kids, this turn the Lord said, turn the other cheek.

664
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,000
And that's how you could deal with the bully at your.

665
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,280
They're not they're not making the leap.

666
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,480
They're not going the extra mile.

667
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,280
They're not using metaphors seemingly because, well, as everyone knows,

668
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,280
you occasionally go to school, but mostly for youth group events or church.

669
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,200
It's mostly going to be church.

670
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,320
A lot of this could be church.

671
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,160
We're not really acknowledging like restaurants or community centers or like.

672
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:42,240
Well, now I think you're you're correct about this, Jason.

673
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,560
But there's there's there's one aspect of it that is maybe agenda

674
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,920
and that's bringing things to church.

675
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,280
But there's another aspect that is maybe if they go to a restaurant

676
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,760
or a baseball game, that is a new location.

677
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,720
Oh, yeah, that's a big part of it.

678
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,400
That's a big part of it.

679
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,880
Often the small scope of the Bible man universe might be dependent on

680
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,240
number of days of writing and lack of company moves.

681
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,680
And and let me also throw out the idea because you are correct.

682
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,520
Sometimes they're not the lessons maybe don't apply to a very specific

683
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,320
passage from the Bible, but maybe they don't know how to write television

684
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:24,240
in an entertaining way or know what would keep a kid's attention for two seconds.

685
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,360
So that also is something that's going to prevent prevent what you're talking about.

686
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,720
What would a child like to see besides the sword fights?

687
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,000
Well, probably a successful performance of a youth group.

688
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,880
Maybe they could put on poodle skirts and nod to the 1950s.

689
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,960
That's an era that could get anyone hopping.

690
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:50,640
That is also very funny that the imagined happy days version of the 50s are immediately like,

691
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,720
all right, poodle skirts and mall shop.

692
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,600
That's wholesome.

693
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,880
That's wholesome.

694
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,680
That's good.

695
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,720
Yeah, the none of it.

696
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,320
There was no 50s.

697
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:04,640
Youth culture was not all like under the surface was everybody's fucking.

698
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,640
Everybody's fucking for the first time and rock and roll is fueling the fucking.

699
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:15,040
Everyone's in cars like fondling each other or they're dying in the muddy Korean

700
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,560
war battlefields like there's none of that.

701
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,520
There's none of that.

702
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,280
There's no seriously reflected in the silly songs of the time.

703
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,320
Yeah, rock around the clock has no reference to the Korean War.

704
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:27,780
No.

705
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,200
So yeah, a lot of like slow.

706
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,080
Oh, wait, wait.

707
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,920
Actually, exactly what you were saying, the lack of metaphor and like kind of, you know,

708
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,720
thinking a little creative step beyond that clip that you played of all of the suit up.

709
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,120
I at least was like, these things are a little like, are they trying to be funny with shoes

710
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,600
of peace and breastplate of righteousness?

711
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,480
Then I found out that is all from the Bible.

712
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,560
Not all of it.

713
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,320
I think they might've made up shoes of peace, but breastplate of righteousness,

714
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,960
I'm pretty confident is to literally.

715
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,680
I don't know the passage, but I really rolled my eyes and I realized, oh man,

716
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,880
they didn't even make this up.

717
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,120
And there's something that they I don't think they felt very much permission to like

718
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,720
cut loose and take liberties where they're like, we know we want to sort.

719
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,320
We have just let us have a sword.

720
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,320
There's going to do something in this.

721
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,520
And how do we justify it?

722
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,400
Well, the Bible refers to the sword of the spirit, which like, okay, so even that is a

723
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,040
is a literal Bible quote.

724
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,520
We cannot just have the fun of their swords in it.

725
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,520
Oh, it looks like yet having our feet fitted with the shoes of the gospel of peace.

726
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,480
This is part of the armor of God.

727
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,200
So I think, yeah, I think shoes of peace are real.

728
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,720
Armor of God is a big, they kind of hide in that.

729
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:55,440
And I even, I found articles that are like, we're going to go visit the bioman live tour

730
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,120
and they're going to end and the reporters say, but isn't it contradictory that you're

731
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,720
doing this religious message, but then it's also a violent show.

732
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:02,880
Yeah.

733
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,640
And the bioman actors will say, well, the Bible was violent as well.

734
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,000
And it refers to the armor.

735
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,360
So as long as the arm, like they're really concerned with having everything,

736
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,960
having a biblical justification.

737
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,720
So they're very much tied to the lore.

738
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,880
They're taught, you know, they really respect the original source material.

739
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,800
It's not like this Marvel universe cinematic universe where they're

740
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,320
changing stuff around from how we read it in the comics.

741
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,120
It is devoted to the Bible.

742
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,520
They're not going to stray for any reason.

743
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,160
You're finding another point in its favor.

744
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,720
I think you just found thing number two that you like about Bible.

745
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,600
Number two sticks to the source.

746
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,520
Good concept sticks to the source.

747
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,080
Yes.

748
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:51,680
You, this is all reminding me of, as I say, like, why didn't they talk about real life?

749
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,520
It's like, oh, because they're insular and shelter.

750
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,320
Like I was thinking, did you watch the HBO series?

751
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:58,880
The long way.

752
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,240
What is it called?

753
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,840
The way down.

754
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,840
Val Gwynne Shamblin.

755
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,600
She was that kooky preacher.

756
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,080
Like with the giant hair, like that whole thing.

757
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:15,920
It's like, there is a town in the south and most of the people who live in this town

758
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,720
are in this church and their businesses, they don't go outside.

759
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,200
The church congregation for the business owners.

760
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:29,040
So the house painter, the construction people, the grocery, like that's why.

761
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,960
And people, people in the rest of America see stuff like this and go like, oh, yeah,

762
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,400
you're a weirdo.

763
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,000
Like this is weird.

764
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,640
I go to church too, but I don't go to your church.

765
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,880
Like I don't go to this weirdo church, you know?

766
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,320
Well, I guess, and you can sense that, I mean, this era that Bible man comes from is clearly

767
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:56,000
they're gearing up a fight in terms of there's the internet now and the internet is a

768
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:02,320
lifeline to outside of the little insular community and kids could find, you know,

769
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,960
other entertainment or songs that say crap or something.

770
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,200
So we need to start like really, you could tell that the 90s are a big time for building

771
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:17,920
up a lot of Christian media because if we can build a wall of our own stuff and we need to

772
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,760
get up the Bible man going so they don't start straying to, well, at that time, I don't know,

773
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,680
Batman and Batman forever.

774
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,560
Batman forever.

775
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:31,680
It's sinful, you know, with it like lighting the lust of young boys like Mike Carlson.

776
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,800
Chace Meridian removes her coat.

777
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,200
You see her bare arms.

778
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,800
And Chace Meridian proved that, you know, at least in crazy liberal Gotham City that a female

779
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,160
can have a job.

780
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,280
That's very true.

781
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,800
She doesn't focus full time on looking pretty.

782
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,800
She also has a smart person job.

783
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,960
She has an advanced degree.

784
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,720
And she's outwardly horny too, which they don't like as well.

785
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,640
She's outwardly horny, the most aggressive sexual character in the movie.

786
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:08,400
And she's also a past 18 and is not focusing on her children.

787
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:08,960
She doesn't have seven kids.

788
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,280
That's right.

789
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,080
She wasn't married.

790
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,240
She's 28 years old and doesn't have seven kids.

791
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:18,560
She's not married and you're going like, wait, so if they met when the husband was this

792
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,080
and she was so she's this age and you're just doing it.

793
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,960
It's in God's eyes.

794
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,680
It's all fine.

795
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,880
There's no math to be done.

796
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,880
Chace Meridian maybe is not celebrated as the ultimate feminist icon as much as she

797
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,680
should and could be.

798
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,160
Well, right.

799
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,880
And we will in my Batman forever to script.

800
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,200
We will celebrate her.

801
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:37,920
That will happen.

802
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,120
And you, well, not you personally, but a carrot.

803
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,400
Carl Michaelson will.

804
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,080
Well, I look, the script is not finished yet, so I could end up changing the character's

805
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,920
name to my name and marry me to chase.

806
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,640
You're worried that the notion of a character called Carl Michaelson, who's a stand in for

807
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,360
you might, it might go over some audience members heads.

808
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:57,600
Yeah.

809
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,320
I want to make sure they know that it's me.

810
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,360
All right, let's flip it back around.

811
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:05,120
I'm not saying it's going to happen, but it's still a thing that could come to you in the,

812
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,000
in the writing process.

813
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,040
The script isn't done yet.

814
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
So if I, I mean, you know, we can go any direction we want with this, but I'd like to talk a

815
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,320
little about the, the six lies of the fibler.

816
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:17,920
Yeah.

817
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,200
The one that, that I, the only one that I knew for, you know, a number of years and,

818
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,120
you know, Mike's brought it up.

819
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:33,280
This, this is mainly about, as you alluded to Jason, the disruption of a youth group

820
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:33,920
performance.

821
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:41,280
There's a girl who is tasked with certain mundane pieces of putting together a show,

822
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,040
which has almost as many audience members as participants in the group will be performing.

823
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:55,280
And she fails to, I don't know, like bring the music or something, but it's not her or

824
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:01,520
her head is getting invaded by the sinful thoughts of the, of the fibler.

825
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:01,760
Yeah.

826
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,480
Who tells at least six lies, according to the title.

827
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,400
I don't, I never watched it counting to know if six was accurate.

828
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:08,640
Yeah.

829
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:16,240
But you know, he like kind of blows smoke, green smoke into her brain, which causes hurdle.

830
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,600
And then she kind of goes into a like poison ivy and bad man and Robin.

831
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,640
Oh, that's right.

832
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,120
Yes.

833
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,880
But none of, but it doesn't inspire full sexual desire.

834
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,120
Yeah.

835
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:25,840
Yeah.

836
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,960
Just lies.

837
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,680
Right.

838
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,760
And the girl herself seems confused.

839
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,680
I don't know.

840
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,840
I didn't, I didn't have time.

841
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:38,160
Like she herself is baffled by the lies that are coming out of her own mouth.

842
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,880
And you feel for her.

843
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,040
I actually think it's a good performance, young girl.

844
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,240
And I don't know what, I guess maybe the big thing to ask about all this is what,

845
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,080
what do we think of the fibler really?

846
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,360
We're finally there.

847
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,560
We've referred to him and looked at pictures of him and listener, you should please look

848
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,360
up Bible man fibler so you can get eyes on him.

849
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,840
Do we like the fibler?

850
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,280
Does he remind you of the Batman villains that he's supposed to remind?

851
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,360
I mean, he's a, he's definitely a nasty little, little creep.

852
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:22,640
He, he reminds me a lot of there was, there was a guy who addresses a Joker on Hollywood

853
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:28,880
Boulevard, but I think he lived in like East Hollywood.

854
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,600
So I think he would walk to Hollywood Boulevard because every now and then outside of the

855
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:41,440
old UCB building, I just see a guy in full Joaquin Phoenix Joker outfit walk like a block

856
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:41,760
away.

857
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,680
And I'm like, I don't like this.

858
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,720
I don't, you don't want to see the Joker in daily life.

859
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,880
And this wasn't just a contestant in one of your tournament of nerds.

860
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,680
No, no, this is broad daylight.

861
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,360
Like you see a Joker in broad daylight, welcome by the bus stop in the McDonald's.

862
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,280
You're like, Oh God, what's this guy's, what is this?

863
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,960
Like, yeah, that's a pretty, that's as big of a red flag as they come.

864
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,440
Yeah.

865
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,960
You got a Joker walking around.

866
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,600
But then at least like, I think I saw him in a different, like that part of Hollywood

867
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,080
first.

868
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,840
And then I was at Hollywood Boulevard.

869
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,800
I'm like, Oh, there he is.

870
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,680
He's taking pictures.

871
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,000
Okay.

872
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,560
He's a Hollywood Boulevard type.

873
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,240
So now you can trust him.

874
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,040
Yeah, that was good.

875
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,600
Or any of the Hollywood Boulevard guys.

876
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,160
Yeah.

877
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,040
He's like the, like the nasty Jack Sparrow.

878
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,600
He's like the dirty Jack Sparrow you see eating at the Cabo Wabo canteen.

879
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:32,560
Yeah.

880
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:40,400
Fibler, he really, he there, he's so nineties in like his, the picture of him, like this

881
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,080
like promo image of him.

882
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,280
I don't know if that's what you would call it.

883
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,400
Like, do you see what I'm saying there?

884
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,280
It's so like, it is like, it reminds me a little bit of like

885
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,200
Drop Dead Fred.

886
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,160
Sure.

887
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,360
Or, meet the Deedles, I guess the hair.

888
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:56,640
Yes.

889
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,200
Although that's a big misconception about meet the Deedles.

890
00:45:59,200 --> 00:45:59,600
Oh, right.

891
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,600
Don't have hair in the movie.

892
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,080
That's great.

893
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,440
If I said this on the show before.

894
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:03,680
Yeah.

895
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:03,920
Yeah.

896
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,360
That people, is that the movie with the guys at the surf air?

897
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:07,600
Yeah.

898
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,080
Yeah.

899
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,080
No, not the, not the point.

900
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,200
I don't, he's not my favorite Biowall Man villain.

901
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:13,920
I'll say that.

902
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:14,160
Really?

903
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:14,880
Oh, interesting.

904
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,560
But I, yeah, I can enjoy him.

905
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,200
And honestly, even though the, even though the show is unwatchable, it's awful.

906
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:21,760
Yes.

907
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:27,200
But I can, I, it's fun to watch it in some way.

908
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,840
There is something to be enjoyed by zooming through it on YouTube.

909
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:37,520
I still, in finding new ones that I hadn't seen before, I still kind of preferred Fibbler

910
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,640
ultimately, because you've got bad songs that break it up.

911
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,480
But at least bad songs is better than like dreadful scenes in the,

912
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,720
the headquarters.

913
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:46,960
Right.

914
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,560
Where they're making meta jokes.

915
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,720
And like, I'd rather this not have meta jokes.

916
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,360
Yes, I agree.

917
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,960
You see, I watched some live videos that are full of meta jokes.

918
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,560
That bomb at each.

919
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,120
Oh yeah.

920
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:01,360
Does not help the, you know, there's one for the parents to not laugh at either.

921
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,560
That's pretty rough.

922
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:08,240
Like that feels like a, you would think a pretty warm crowd, a pretty like safe crowd.

923
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:13,600
Like, oh, they're going to laugh about the joke about the Philistines or whatever.

924
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,120
But potentially also a humorless crowd.

925
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:17,840
Humorless.

926
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,160
Yeah.

927
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,040
And weird.

928
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:24,560
Like, like not used to seeing live normal entertainment.

929
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,040
They're used to more like sermon type mega church.

930
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,720
Is that what you're saying?

931
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,680
That's good.

932
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,360
And now they're seeing this high octane superhero show.

933
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,320
Laser filled.

934
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:34,640
Yeah.

935
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,760
And they're like, oh, what?

936
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,440
With rock adjacent music.

937
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,000
What the hell is this?

938
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:46,800
And not the later mega church with like that the Righteous Gemstones poke fun at where

939
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,040
it's like there is a production value.

940
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,880
There's a Starbucks in the lobby.

941
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:51,760
Sure.

942
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,000
Yeah.

943
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,640
Oh, you'd be lucky to get the value of that.

944
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:54,960
Sure.

945
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,120
Yeah.

946
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,120
Some of that's more produced than theme park stuff.

947
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:57,680
But yes.

948
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:06,560
I, yeah, the, I mean, I like kind of the hokeyness of Fibbler and I, it, you know,

949
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:12,080
you're, I guess I like this version of the show better than when it is kind of a cheapo

950
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,880
sci fi, you know, like a 10 times lower budget space cases.

951
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,800
The Fibbler one feels like a super it's grazed with superhero genre,

952
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,200
but otherwise a five times lower budget Degrassi, Jr. High.

953
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:33,280
It's, it's more akin to a kind of slow, I'll say Canadian.

954
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,240
I know it was not filmed in Canada, but it has that fit, has that feel.

955
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,200
Um, and you, I like that.

956
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:47,440
Well, another thing to say is that, so this is the only one I knew for a long time.

957
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:47,920
Yeah.

958
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:52,560
And I thought, okay, so there's that one where that's about the disruption of a

959
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,160
youth group performance.

960
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:59,440
Then I've been doing research over the last week and I realized every one of them is about

961
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,840
the disruption of a youth group performance.

962
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,360
That's what all of them are.

963
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:10,080
I, because I feel like a lot of like, let's say after school specials, it was like, here's

964
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,280
what to do at school.

965
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,640
If someone's stealing from your locker, here's what's to do.

966
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,480
If there's a bully, here's what's to do.

967
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:22,320
If someone offers you drugs or says like, get in my, my, I was terrified growing up

968
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:26,000
that I would be presented with conundrums of like, Hey, it's me.

969
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,200
Your neighbor, your mom was in a car accident.

970
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,400
She said to pick you up.

971
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,240
I drilled this all the time.

972
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,240
Drilled this so much.

973
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,160
We had a secret word in case my mom had to send someone that I didn't know.

974
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:39,520
Oh, right.

975
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,560
I think this happened.

976
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,040
Word.

977
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:41,840
You say the word now.

978
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,960
Green popcorn.

979
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,240
Really?

980
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:52,880
That was the code word in case someone was sent to pick us up, but we didn't recognize them.

981
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,040
Do you feel like you exposed something?

982
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,280
I did feel a little weird saying it, I'll be honest, but I scanned my brain and went,

983
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,800
there's really no scenario where I'm going to need that word.

984
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,200
Now somebody listening to the show could pull up.

985
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,640
What'll be your mom said?

986
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,360
I could pick you.

987
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,280
Your mom said I should pick you up.

988
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,400
I want to take you.

989
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,160
I'm going to take you to her.

990
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:14,400
Yeah.

991
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,880
She was, oh, and by the way, green popcorn.

992
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,280
That is going to really, that's like mission impossible.

993
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,640
What's the one where he like, it's like a, that's the code word.

994
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,360
That's cause somebody's going to say that to me out in the wild.

995
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:25,920
And I'm going to forget.

996
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,720
I said it here and I'm just going to go with them.

997
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,520
You got to remember.

998
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:29,760
Yeah.

999
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,200
I'm just going to get in someone's van.

1000
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,840
It's a Manchurian candidate activation phrase.

1001
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,000
Right.

1002
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,160
And now that people are going to be activating me constantly,

1003
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,240
that's what's going to be happening.

1004
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:43,120
And either if I'm there, I will try to say, wait, Mike, remember I was there.

1005
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:48,160
You said green popcorn or I'll let it happen because maybe you deserve it.

1006
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,280
Cause you're, you're dumb.

1007
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:50,160
Maybe.

1008
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:50,960
Forgetting.

1009
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,880
And I just kind of want to see how this plays out.

1010
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,840
I shouldn't let you go somewhere bad because the weaponized by the word green popcorn,

1011
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,960
but it depends who it is.

1012
00:50:58,960 --> 00:50:59,280
We'll see.

1013
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,760
We'll see if, if a fiddler like entity blows green smoke into my ears,

1014
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,480
then, then I'll let you take off onto the, into the green popcorn car.

1015
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,360
All right.

1016
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:09,920
That's fair.

1017
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:15,920
Um, this is if I have my shoes of peace on, that'll be fine.

1018
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:16,720
Whatever happens.

1019
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,640
Breastplate of righteousness might help the most.

1020
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,280
Yeah.

1021
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,560
Cause it's harder to put that on.

1022
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,240
I put my shoes of peace on every day.

1023
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,400
The breastplate is something you have to really just fix and it looks odd if you're wearing it.

1024
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,320
You don't want to always go out on a breastplate of righteousness, but shoes of peace,

1025
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,440
you can wear those all the time.

1026
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:31,680
Yeah.

1027
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,000
True.

1028
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,040
But you know, it's good.

1029
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,800
You should put on your, it's like sunscreen.

1030
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,240
It's like, I should really put on my breastplate of righteousness every day, but I like,

1031
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,040
Oh, you forget.

1032
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,520
And I know the door is pain in the ass.

1033
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,240
Oh, yeah.

1034
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,040
Oh God.

1035
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:43,280
Yeah.

1036
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,760
Um, what were you getting, what were you getting about it?

1037
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,280
Like afterschool special morals?

1038
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:54,080
Oh, I I'm saying like there, there was, um, kind of a more, uh, direct like,

1039
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,000
Hey, here's a problem you might encounter.

1040
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,040
That's very common in, in Adelaide since, you know, school life or daily life.

1041
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,680
Uh, for this, it's mostly about like, okay, this is church related.

1042
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:13,120
And I understand that evangelicals like make their shit a lot more centered on the church,

1043
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:18,400
you know, but it's like, okay, well, those kids are going to encounter this stuff,

1044
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,360
even at youth group.

1045
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:23,360
Like there were assholes at youth group or like whatever, you know,

1046
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,280
but if they, if there are assholes, it's because of villain, uh, gave them smoke or

1047
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:36,560
one case and you like a, uh, an early digital, uh, laser that's like spun around their head

1048
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,440
and made them doubt things themselves.

1049
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:45,600
There are some of the problems these kids encounter are like, well, isn't that just

1050
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:49,760
part of growing up like lying or doubt or pridefulness?

1051
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,080
Ooh, they're really, they do not want your children to be prideful.

1052
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,040
Yeah, do not.

1053
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:55,280
Yeah.

1054
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:55,760
Yeah.

1055
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,240
How do you, uh, um, only the, only the hideous, but was there, is it, who's the, uh,

1056
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,880
is it like the pied piper of, of pride?

1057
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,360
Oh yeah.

1058
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,160
Of pridefulness.

1059
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,120
I have the sense.

1060
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,880
I don't remember who the pride villain is.

1061
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:11,200
At some point, maybe I don't want to jump ahead to the cartoon too much, but the,

1062
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:19,360
the Sultan of success, which, uh, so most of the other villains are, uh, weird, uh,

1063
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,080
just like a cheap makeup or just a kooky wig or something.

1064
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:24,720
Mm-hmm.

1065
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:29,440
Uh, the Sultan of success is like, okay, it's a, it's a foreign guy.

1066
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,320
It's like, uh, well, you might have keyed into, look, I'm going to avoid saying a

1067
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:39,440
lot of specifics, but if you find yourself looking at a number of Bible man villains,

1068
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:44,800
you might start occurring to you that the villains have traits resembling, let's just

1069
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,640
say non-Christians.

1070
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,520
Non-Christians.

1071
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,240
This is a, maybe something.

1072
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,680
That's gotta be a mistake.

1073
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,880
It has to surely be.

1074
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:58,640
They're just trying to portray, uh, you know, characters with strange features.

1075
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,200
Sure.

1076
00:53:59,200 --> 00:53:59,920
Or.

1077
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,480
Fibbler gets away clean cause he's just kind of a generic cool, but when you get to the

1078
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,760
gossip queen, which was the one I saw flagged pretty quickly.

1079
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:08,900
Yeah.

1080
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:14,480
Well, or the, or the character, they end up on the, uh, on a talk show of a, of a

1081
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,040
character called Sammy Davey.

1082
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,800
That's that's in the gossip.

1083
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,440
Right.

1084
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:19,760
Right.

1085
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,800
Episode.

1086
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,120
And he's, he's not a villain, but he's portrayed as a, you know, a roadblock, a

1087
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,120
problem for Bible man.

1088
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:31,520
And there's kind of only one quality you can ascribe to this character from what you

1089
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,000
see of him.

1090
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,920
And that quality is Jewish.

1091
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:42,080
There is something a little bit dicey about some of the, you also, you meet the evil

1092
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,560
equivalent of Eunice the supercomputer.

1093
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:44,800
Right.

1094
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:51,280
That character's name is Lucy and Lucy is exactly like Eunice, except the voice

1095
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,640
sounds Jewish.

1096
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,440
Hmm.

1097
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,200
I'm reporting facts here.

1098
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,120
I don't like the fact.

1099
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:02,080
Let me please illustrate how much I don't like the facts, but it's kind of impossible

1100
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,840
not to notice about Bible man.

1101
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:10,240
If you jump ahead to, I believe this was either Bible man, Genesis or Bible man power

1102
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:14,480
source, the stupid subtitles they give it eventually the same as the Terminator

1103
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:14,640
movie.

1104
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,360
I think they use both.

1105
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,200
That is true.

1106
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,480
Terminator powers.

1107
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:24,160
This one actually, the, the, the stupid renaming of the exact same thing that is similar to

1108
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:29,600
the armoring up that that is a trade of power Rangers, VR trooper, that kind of thing.

1109
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:29,920
Sure.

1110
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:30,160
Sure.

1111
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:36,720
But in the episode in the presence of enemies, when you see a bunch of the villains

1112
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:42,000
together, it's like, Ooh, kind of, kind of weird how they all have weird noses.

1113
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,160
That's interesting.

1114
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,960
That's, you know, and they're all just annoying in different way.

1115
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,680
They're all just annoying character.

1116
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,400
Like they're mostly, they're like, we have to stop Bible man.

1117
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,000
Let's upload a fake Bible.

1118
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,480
Like it's like that's, that's their trick.

1119
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:06,000
And that is a reasonable tactic when all Bible man mostly does besides the

1120
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,960
occasional sword fight is he just stops whatever he do he's doing and kneels down and starts

1121
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:11,360
praying.

1122
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,160
Like that is the solution to a lot of these problems.

1123
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:16,880
There it is.

1124
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,760
Like real life.

1125
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:19,520
Geez.

1126
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,280
Come on.

1127
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,320
And what are you talking about?

1128
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,920
There's nothing you can't solve.

1129
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,640
Even if you're in the heat of battle, brief moments of prayer based clarity.

1130
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,840
There's a lot of, there's a lot of just like that.

1131
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,960
We find out the stakes of the episode and then like,

1132
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,800
well, I'm going to pray for her.

1133
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:41,360
But in the meantime, I'm going to test some samples at the Bible cave.

1134
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,600
It is the Bible cave.

1135
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,320
The Bible cave.

1136
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,720
It's the we're dealing with the Bible cave in this.

1137
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,400
I thought I got that wrong early.

1138
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,480
I was like, there's no way they call that.

1139
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,680
Yeah, they absolutely do.

1140
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,800
Two first thought.

1141
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,160
No, it's the Bible cave.

1142
00:56:54,160 --> 00:57:01,280
The Bible cave kind of looks like an extra big living room, but with some rock and more

1143
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,240
stained glass.

1144
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:09,200
And sometimes you'll see tableaus of like, you know, it is like microscopes and like

1145
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,520
zappy orbs, like science stuff.

1146
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,080
Yeah.

1147
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,640
And then mainly a Bible.

1148
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:14,880
Yeah.

1149
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,480
Beakers with like a thing of dried ice, trapped in water.

1150
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,160
So it smokes a little, you know, science science is all about.

1151
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,920
But also kids don't read too much science.

1152
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,760
So don't look too much into that.

1153
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,680
Science is for visuals, mainly.

1154
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:34,320
Science is if you have a lab type, say if you want to have a neat room in your house,

1155
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,480
get some test tubes going.

1156
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:41,680
Did we say that his house though is the Eagle Gate Manor?

1157
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,240
I didn't know.

1158
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,040
I didn't get that part.

1159
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:43,520
Okay.

1160
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:47,840
I just want to make sure you know, Eagle Gate Manor and then the Bible cave under it.

1161
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,200
So it's same deal.

1162
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,960
It's exactly the same like where it's it's millionaire.

1163
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,760
He didn't turn his back on being the millionaire, but he developed this other persona in order

1164
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,840
to help with youth group problems.

1165
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:00,160
Yes.

1166
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,880
This is one of my favorite things.

1167
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:07,360
And I've recently there's a comic that I was recently rereading that's I shouldn't even say

1168
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:10,480
because it's a sexy comic I read when I was little or when I was little.

1169
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,680
It's called Danger Girl.

1170
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,440
You read it when you were little?

1171
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,240
Well, young, you know, teen, preteen, teenage.

1172
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,560
And it was about like, it was basically.

1173
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,640
You deserve to get green popcorn.

1174
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,560
Well, I know I do deserve it.

1175
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:26,240
And it is look, it's it's we've talked about this artist who's a really great artist

1176
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:31,760
named J. Scott Campbell, and he draws like now he's like you can buy like sexy Disney.

1177
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:39,920
He'll do he does like really sexy princesses not for Disney and then normal sexy princesses

1178
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,560
for Disney.

1179
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,240
Yeah, you can find them at the Wonder Ground.

1180
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,800
You can get like officially licensed prints and stuff.

1181
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,200
And I don't even know if he's drawing comics anymore because he probably makes so much

1182
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,080
money doing this.

1183
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:53,840
He had a he had a comic that was called Danger Girl and it was like an action adventure thing.

1184
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,280
And it was full of sexy ladies.

1185
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:03,200
But when you when I'm reading this, I'm just like this is absolutely one to one Indiana

1186
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:03,840
Jones.

1187
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:09,360
There is no there is no other than the fact that like he is a great artist and even people

1188
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:13,120
will say I'm just talking about it because the ladies would like be in a hot tub or something.

1189
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,280
But he is a legit great artist, I think.

1190
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:20,400
But I'm just like this is there's no they didn't even take a second thought of like

1191
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,360
maybe we can go A to C on this, not just A to A.

1192
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,920
And this is what I love about Bible, man.

1193
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,240
No thought Batcave.

1194
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:28,720
Great.

1195
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,440
He's rich.

1196
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,720
Great mansion.

1197
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:31,440
Same thing.

1198
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,320
Fibbler Joker.

1199
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:32,880
Fine.

1200
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,720
Do not think about this too hard.

1201
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,320
It's when anytime I see that now, I'm kind of delighted by just like doesn't even matter.

1202
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,560
We're not going to hide that we ripped this off completely.

1203
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,440
I salute you.

1204
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,880
Just keep it lazy.

1205
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:45,440
Why not?

1206
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,200
You know, they should I'm mad about that.

1207
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:52,320
They should keep the pale imitations of the Indiana Jones franchise to the Indiana Jones

1208
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,280
franchise itself.

1209
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,760
Let them do it.

1210
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,960
They have earned it.

1211
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:03,360
Look, they can't they they're not going to directly adapt Cheesecake India.

1212
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,200
The comic is like Cheesecake Arts.

1213
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,520
It's like Betty Page, Indiana Jones.

1214
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,560
Look up Danger Girl issue two and I'm sorry.

1215
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,000
I'm sorry to do this to you.

1216
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,120
Video game like PlayStation 2 cover like.

1217
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,480
And just look at the cover and see what I'm dealing with here.

1218
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,440
And I apologize to bring my own eye to it.

1219
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,560
But she is naked under all that stuff that's covering up her nudity.

1220
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,480
Yes, that is correct.

1221
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,160
But what are you going to do?

1222
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,840
This is not I'm not still like obsessed with this comic or anything, but I was rereading it

1223
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,960
because it's fun to revisit stuff you looked at when you were younger.

1224
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:41,200
Yeah, but compared to Bible man, like the Bible man creators would probably try to make

1225
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,160
this stuff illegal.

1226
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,600
Well, that's true.

1227
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,040
Throw it in a big fire.

1228
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:45,840
Yes, that's true.

1229
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:46,720
Yes.

1230
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:53,920
The yeah, the like you like the the Bible episode would be like the pickle of the

1231
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:54,800
pornographer.

1232
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,360
And it's just it's not pornography.

1233
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:00,080
It's just a comic store and then a little Michael equivalent.

1234
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:03,760
Like, yes, I notice you haven't been reading your Bible lately.

1235
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,080
Is there another book that has your attention or something?

1236
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:11,120
Are there characters you're more interested in girls that go on dangerous adventures?

1237
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:16,000
You know, Corinthian says leave the leave danger to men.

1238
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,440
Women should number one fruits and the number one problem with danger to them is that they

1239
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,200
were going on adventures.

1240
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:23,440
Yeah.

1241
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:31,840
Women in danger should never mix the sex men are for to prevent that.

1242
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:32,400
Yes.

1243
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,920
To provide them with babies to keep them out of dangerous messes.

1244
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:36,160
Yes.

1245
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,320
Another just on the topic of that voice.

1246
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:46,480
Here's OK, just to Miles is the original that the Bruce Wayne of this.

1247
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,280
So Miles Peterson will walk in the room.

1248
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,560
Hey, kids, how's your youth group rehearsal going?

1249
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:53,680
OK, good.

1250
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:54,560
Well, I'm going to go.

1251
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,400
I think you might see Bible man soon.

1252
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,480
By when it comes back.

1253
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,640
Hey, kids, how's your youth group rehearsal?

1254
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,400
There's not even kind of like a little bit of a let's get into here.

1255
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:08,640
Right.

1256
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:09,600
Let's get the rasp.

1257
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:14,240
It is just the same just charisma suck of Willie Ames.

1258
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:22,720
Um, he really the vibe of Willie Ames and therefore Bible man, it's kind of it's like

1259
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:29,440
a guy who you've worked with for many years, like, you know, he's been a co worker for

1260
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:29,840
10 years.

1261
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,200
And if anybody asked you what's up with that guy?

1262
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,000
Oh, he's a nice guy.

1263
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,120
Really nice guy.

1264
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,280
Would you ever want to like go hang out with him outside of what?

1265
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:35,600
Never.

1266
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,160
No, no, no.

1267
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,800
I would not absolutely not do that because he's a creep.

1268
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:39,680
No, not even.

1269
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:44,080
No, just I'm out of conversation with him and two exchanges at the coffee machine.

1270
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,440
But nice guy, really nice guy.

1271
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:49,280
That's our superhero energy.

1272
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:54,400
So much of this too is just it's still I think they think they're doing 60s Batman.

1273
01:02:55,360 --> 01:03:01,520
Yeah, and they think that any amount, any type of humor next to in superhero costumes

1274
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,360
equals 60s Batman.

1275
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:03,840
Yeah.

1276
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:09,120
But the last does not have the charisma of the performers on that show nor the commitment.

1277
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,600
They they sell it all out with the little meta.

1278
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:17,440
I'm even trying to think of what's an example of it'll be like, you know, how did you know

1279
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,200
the fiddler was going to be there?

1280
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,480
Because I wrote it that way.

1281
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,800
Yeah, no one.

1282
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:23,680
No one likes it.

1283
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,200
Yeah, that's just that's humble.

1284
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,040
We'd will rolled by as I said that.

1285
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:27,540
Right.

1286
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,280
So they shouldn't be doing that.

1287
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,080
And I like that again.

1288
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:35,600
That's why I like the more like Degrassi version of things.

1289
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:40,400
Other episodes that you guys found in your travels, anything you want to call out?

1290
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,040
Jason, do you have a clip or no?

1291
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:46,560
I know I that was really the only clip I call.

1292
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:50,080
I mean, well, I kind of I watched the big, big book, the first one.

1293
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:56,960
The big, big book is the one that is entirely about youth group performances.

1294
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:57,760
Yeah, really.

1295
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:03,120
And it seems like it's yeah, they're worried they're not going to be polished enough for

1296
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:07,680
people who are coming to a garage or a shed common room to watch it.

1297
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,760
And then at least by the time the Fibler, they got a second location.

1298
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:16,800
Someone in the congregation gave them keys to get in a second location.

1299
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,800
That was the biggest hurdle of this production.

1300
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,360
I said they add a second location.

1301
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,440
It's like, guys, good news.

1302
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:33,520
We can get in a boat storage area because the the millionaire who owns the boat dock

1303
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,360
like has joined the church.

1304
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:40,560
So he'll lend it to us, but only during the cold season.

1305
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:44,240
He thinks that giving us this location for free will absolve him of his sins.

1306
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,600
Which are plentiful.

1307
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,600
I'm sure that's not for me to add.

1308
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:48,800
That's for the Lord to judge.

1309
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,920
My episode, I like the character Luxor Spondroth.

1310
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:54,800
Yes.

1311
01:04:54,800 --> 01:05:00,160
And that episode was or his debut was on the defeating the shadow of doubt.

1312
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,680
He's a very recurring villain.

1313
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,160
I feel like he shows up in the live tours as well.

1314
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,040
He certainly does.

1315
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:14,080
And he looks like he's kind of got like a Gary Oldman Dracula face, like painted face.

1316
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:19,200
But then he has like a Borg Star Trek Borg kind of implant sort of on the side of his head.

1317
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,320
And he's got a cape.

1318
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,640
He looks kind of cool in certain.

1319
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:26,480
There's many versions of him, but the version I'm looking at now, which is tiny.

1320
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:30,000
So I don't know if you can see him, but the version here, he kind of has this like this

1321
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,440
fun suit of armor thing on.

1322
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,160
Mike, you just showed us pictures of Danger Girl again.

1323
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,080
You didn't even realize it was on your screen.

1324
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,840
He showed your cards there.

1325
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:42,560
I should reveal I also own Danger Girl action figures.

1326
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,440
They were so cheap.

1327
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,200
They were so cheap on eBay though.

1328
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:51,040
And I want to get all the, there was an imprint called Cliffhanger, which had my favorite

1329
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:55,200
artist, Joe Matarera with his comic Battle Chasers, but they don't have toys of that.

1330
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:59,520
And they do have Crimson Toys, which was Humberto Ramis's vampire teen comic,

1331
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,400
which I also read, which I need to get those figures too.

1332
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:07,120
You know, Michael, you brought this degree of specific knowledge to instead your knowledge

1333
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,400
of Psalms.

1334
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,440
I think you'd find the opportunities to open up for you.

1335
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,920
This is a good moment to cut in.

1336
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,920
And I was searching Bible.

1337
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,840
There are Bible man action figures.

1338
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:18,480
Are there?

1339
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,120
Oh, yeah.

1340
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,120
So spawned with figures.

1341
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,160
Spawned on this one.

1342
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,240
Yes, but Fibler does not.

1343
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,080
I couldn't find a Fibler one.

1344
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:29,760
This is some of the stuff where I'm saying it's not so well documented of like, because

1345
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,520
I did find some other things and there's newer figures too from the animated.

1346
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,000
Yeah.

1347
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:40,960
I think the figures were produced under the jurisdiction of the second owner of the franchise.

1348
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:41,120
Right.

1349
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,880
His name was Tommy something.

1350
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,640
Tommy Nelson.

1351
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:45,520
Yeah, there you go.

1352
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:46,000
Yeah.

1353
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,320
Tom, I believe somehow I now this is information in my brain.

1354
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:54,400
Tommy Nelson's ownership is what made the Bible man action figures possible.

1355
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,760
Beloved childhood memories getting yanked right out of there.

1356
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,440
This fact lives here now.

1357
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:03,360
No fib.

1358
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:03,600
I don't.

1359
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,880
I haven't seen a Fibler.

1360
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,480
I think so.

1361
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,200
That's what I'm saying.

1362
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:12,240
I think Fibler was early on, which is also why you don't see representations of the youth

1363
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,040
group kids.

1364
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:13,360
Right.

1365
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:18,320
If you don't see Kyla, the girl who's sad because her parents are fighting.

1366
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:24,320
That's a story in the third one of these that's about youth group disruptions.

1367
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:29,680
That one, I don't even know if there is like somebody breathing bad magic into her head.

1368
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:34,480
I think she is not performing up to snuff because her parents are fighting.

1369
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:34,720
Okay.

1370
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,280
And everybody's mad at her, including Bible man.

1371
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:41,280
That is a recurring, that is something they do address.

1372
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:48,800
In fact, it's part of the origin story of Josh Carpenter, the second guy to wield the Bible man.

1373
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:50,720
Like introduce that.

1374
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,160
It wasn't always Willie Ames.

1375
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,720
Eventually a second Bible man shows up.

1376
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:54,960
Right.

1377
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,240
And that's the way the alter ego is Josh Carpenter.

1378
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,120
Carpenter Robert T. Schlipp is the actor.

1379
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,160
Robert T. Schlipp.

1380
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,840
Pastor Robert T. Schlipp.

1381
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,280
We'll all flesh that out later.

1382
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:12,480
But yeah, he, he is, this is from Wikipedia is depicted as someone who never understood

1383
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:18,480
the Bible until his darkest day, parentheses when his parents were arguing.

1384
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,840
What the hell are you talking about?

1385
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:27,360
And his dad, the pearls from his mom's necklace while they were arguing fell and broke

1386
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:28,240
on the ground.

1387
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:30,320
And that was the traumatic origin story.

1388
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:35,680
By the time like I was in middle school, they had already had to explain like

1389
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:40,480
the Challenger disaster, the Oklahoma city bombing, the first world trade center.

1390
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,880
It's like, what do you mean his darkest day?

1391
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:47,360
Like I knew there were worse things than my parents going like, well, you were going to get

1392
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:47,840
for it.

1393
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,680
I don't know what that, you know.

1394
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:55,360
In this world, in this world, in this little town, wherever this show takes place, the

1395
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:59,840
worst thing that's happened to anyone is the day that the Carpenters were fighting.

1396
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:05,920
Only to only to be doubled by when Kyla's parents, this is so rare.

1397
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:06,240
Right.

1398
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:10,080
And of course, in both cases, it's Josh's fault that his parents are fighting and it's

1399
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,760
Kyle's fault that her parents were fighting.

1400
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,600
Well, that's it's your fault.

1401
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:14,880
That's terrible to put on.

1402
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:17,120
That is legitimately terrible to put on children.

1403
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,520
That was a reoccurring anxiety of me.

1404
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,720
I have caused all these.

1405
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:23,760
I have caused any problems in the world.

1406
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:24,960
And that's great, Jason.

1407
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:30,080
Have you thought about how these may be stemming from your lack of my lack of picking up the

1408
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:30,880
good book?

1409
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,560
Yeah, he has.

1410
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,320
You've read it a little bit, but you don't read it every day.

1411
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:42,000
It's like you're never going to learn how to play guitar like me and my band Paradise.

1412
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,560
Unless you pick it up every day.

1413
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:49,360
It's the very short lived you through when I went to church.

1414
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:55,120
I think the most exciting thing we ever did was go see Prince of Egypt at the mall.

1415
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:55,520
Cool.

1416
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,520
Prince of Egypt was released.

1417
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:03,200
Can be miracles when you believe Jeffrey Katzenberg.

1418
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:03,920
Yeah, that's right.

1419
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:05,600
Wow.

1420
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:10,320
I realize there's two different Luxor toys, different outfits.

1421
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,120
Which one's better?

1422
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,440
I think the one with.

1423
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:14,400
Well, I don't know.

1424
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,120
I think this green one is better if you can see it.

1425
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:19,520
This one.

1426
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:21,680
What about it?

1427
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:23,360
I don't know.

1428
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,800
I like it better than the red one.

1429
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,960
He'd say it's a standard Bear Guy look.

1430
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,880
There's no stereotypes involved.

1431
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:29,760
They don't look honestly.

1432
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:33,200
They don't look as good as that picture I was showing you with the little kind of Borg outfit

1433
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:34,000
that he had on.

1434
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,360
That looks cool to me.

1435
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:43,120
I think that the action figure of the latter day silver version of Bible Man is kind of good.

1436
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,000
I think silver Bible Man's all right.

1437
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:48,480
Here's a little bit of trivia.

1438
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,960
I saw this in the credits on one of the live videos.

1439
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:57,920
There might be a reason why one of the only coherent aspects of Bible Man is the suit.

1440
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:02,480
Because at least at some point in time, they had the suit made by the Kyoto brothers.

1441
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:04,320
Is it Kyoto?

1442
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:11,280
Who made killer clowns from outer space and Team America and Ernest scared stupid.

1443
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,760
Those creatures that lodged into your brain.

1444
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:14,480
Of course.

1445
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,080
So yeah, that's it.

1446
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:21,120
It like jumped off the screen to me because I'm like a name I know of.

1447
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:26,240
That's not a latter day sitcom cast member like Willie Ames.

1448
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:30,240
I was well, oh, let me issue a correction and then I'll jump back to that point.

1449
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:33,360
I believe that this the red Luxor is actually misidentified.

1450
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,960
He's actually El Furioso.

1451
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,840
Well, well, so that makes actually more sense.

1452
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,080
The red character is El Furioso.

1453
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:43,760
Not must have been the work of the dastardly name scrambler.

1454
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:47,440
But back to that there.

1455
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,680
There were so many like offshoots.

1456
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,720
It's hard to figure out.

1457
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:51,760
I don't know.

1458
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:57,200
I'm sure you if we have more time, but there was a Bible Man kids version in the 90s as well.

1459
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:58,400
I don't know if you came upon this.

1460
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,440
Oh, yeah.

1461
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,800
And to speaking of names of people that jumped out at you.

1462
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:03,440
Yeah.

1463
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:07,520
All of a sudden you're looking at Dick Van Patten and Jim Varney.

1464
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,040
I missed Dick Van Patten.

1465
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,160
That's that's an eight is enough person as well.

1466
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:12,400
Yeah.

1467
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:12,800
Yeah.

1468
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:13,440
All right.

1469
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:17,840
So he's like singing like it's it feels like a completely different show.

1470
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,920
Bible Man's kind of doing like wraparounds or something.

1471
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:23,680
And then all of a sudden, Dick Van Patten's in like a kids show around like a campfire,

1472
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:26,640
singing a song about kind of Jesus or something.

1473
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:32,960
I found the Jim Varney appearance when we were talking about Ernest goes to Splash Mountain

1474
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:41,040
on Club 3 and I thought it was too confusing and boring to bring up in that celebration

1475
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:41,840
of Jim Varney.

1476
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:42,160
Yeah.

1477
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,080
No, I'm not saying I don't know what the hell's going on.

1478
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,200
Bible Man Jr.

1479
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:45,760
Oh, I don't know.

1480
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:46,240
Bible Man.

1481
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:46,400
Yeah.

1482
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,440
Bible Man Jr.

1483
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:48,720
I don't either.

1484
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:49,520
I don't have a clip.

1485
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:50,480
I have audio clips.

1486
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,840
I don't have one of those things.

1487
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:52,800
I was just like, oh, wow.

1488
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,080
Look, hey, look who it is.

1489
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:54,720
Yeah.

1490
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:55,760
There is a crossover.

1491
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,440
But right now I like Varney.

1492
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:02,800
There was some level of professionalism or like professionals involved in Bible Man

1493
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:08,880
Jr. because outside of Willie Ames and the Giotto brothers, if you look at other people's credits,

1494
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:15,920
they really don't exist like other performance, like mostly other occasionally other Christian

1495
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:17,680
media, but not that much.

1496
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:26,160
Well, well, on the one of the live tours, there was a person I had no need to say his name.

1497
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,040
I wish him well.

1498
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:32,320
I want to call out this guy, but they had the Bible Man Live at one time.

1499
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:40,320
Boasted a guy who played two face in the Batman water thrill spectacular at Six Flags Marine World.

1500
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:41,760
So there you go.

1501
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:49,840
A tenured two face, a real villain was deployed in Bible Man Live to play the character, the wacky

1502
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,120
protester.

1503
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:51,360
Yeah.

1504
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:51,760
Oh, yes.

1505
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,280
I've seen the wacky protester.

1506
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:59,200
That feels like a very 2023 kind of villain to come up.

1507
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,000
Oh, yeah.

1508
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,200
I mean, it feels of the moment.

1509
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,480
I would think that would be if they were doing it now, they could do that as well.

1510
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:04,720
Yeah.

1511
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,960
Like that's a gut now.

1512
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:07,920
It's pulled open.

1513
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,880
Now the wacky protester is a January 6th.

1514
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,120
So now I think maybe wacky protester would be out.

1515
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:14,000
Okay.

1516
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,120
Or it is a wacky protester, but wacky is meant like good.

1517
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:17,920
Like they're fun.

1518
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:22,720
Oh, well, that's all those silly clowns who entertained us on January 6th.

1519
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:23,360
The wacky.

1520
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,720
They certainly made me laugh.

1521
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,600
The wacky protesters may be an antihero.

1522
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,120
It was like Deadpool started as bad guy, but now it's fun.

1523
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,640
It seems like now it's good.

1524
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,880
Can they wrap their heads around the antihero?

1525
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,800
I don't think they even do that with any of these villains.

1526
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:42,000
All the villains come like they're all spawns of Satan, essentially.

1527
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:42,480
Right.

1528
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:47,760
So I don't think they're given the chance for salvation, really, even though in Christianity,

1529
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,480
you would give people the chance to like renounce.

1530
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,080
But I think that's too complicated.

1531
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:55,040
If Satan thought of them, they got to they just got to go back to hell.

1532
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:55,280
Yeah.

1533
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:59,520
They're all menacing children and none of them face redemption.

1534
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:03,280
They just get not really destroyed.

1535
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:05,200
They just get thwarted.

1536
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,400
Yeah, they just disappear.

1537
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:11,280
Whatever video whatever video effect was in the video box, the video toaster that they

1538
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,320
edited this on.

1539
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:18,800
Yeah, I was a little surprised there wasn't more fire and brimstone punishment for them.

1540
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:19,120
Right.

1541
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:21,120
That's true.

1542
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:24,720
I think I would like it more if they were more literal and biblical.

1543
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:33,280
And if you like flash to the fibler suffering like on the on the flames of hell, it cuts.

1544
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,360
It says 500 years later.

1545
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:35,920
Right.

1546
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:36,400
Yeah.

1547
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:39,120
The fibler is like melting away.

1548
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:40,800
He's a shadow of his former self.

1549
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:45,360
But he's been in just in the back story that he's been moaning in agony for the entire

1550
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:48,960
500 years since he dared mess up that youth group performance.

1551
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:56,160
I think some of the thinking behind the making of Bible man seems to be like, well, we want

1552
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:59,440
us we want these kids to follow God's word.

1553
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:03,520
We don't want to scare them so much with the fire and brimstone stuff that they run out

1554
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:04,080
of the church.

1555
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,600
They run away from the church.

1556
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:11,680
But we don't want to go too detail in the Bible lest they start doing their own investigation

1557
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,200
and start asking questions.

1558
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:18,800
This is the great like debate inside the religion, I assume, because we've we went over

1559
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,720
the Ark and count was an encounter.

1560
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:23,600
Is that what was called where he wanted it to not be?

1561
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,720
I forget that man's name.

1562
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:26,880
He is he wanted his hand ham can ham.

1563
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:27,280
Thank you.

1564
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,880
That's one of the most pastorly villains we've encountered.

1565
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,600
But he was pleasant, equally charismatic.

1566
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,800
Yes, he wanted no fun.

1567
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,800
He didn't want it to be like cartoon animals.

1568
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:39,760
No, this is serious.

1569
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,280
This is art.

1570
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:42,480
So there's this big push and pull.

1571
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:46,880
I feel like how do you how do you compete with the child entertainment of the day if

1572
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,680
you're not softening things in the Bible?

1573
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:53,440
Because if you're really going, if you're really looking into that Bible, that's a scary

1574
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:53,680
book.

1575
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:54,320
It's a lot.

1576
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:55,040
It's scary books.

1577
01:16:55,040 --> 01:17:00,320
So you you meet them halfway and you have a fudge shop and you turn a walking closet

1578
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,760
into a VR room.

1579
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,760
Well, you know, sorry to cut you off.

1580
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,080
No, I was just saying, you know what they really should have done?

1581
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:12,560
They should have had Mel Gibson direct a couple and bring that passion of the Christ

1582
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,920
realism to the lessons here.

1583
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,760
And yeah, Fibler will be punished.

1584
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:24,960
There's like it's exactly the half hour as released on home video.

1585
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:31,520
But then he then all of the kids take turns whipping his bare back for like a full hour

1586
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,320
after.

1587
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:33,120
That's right.

1588
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:36,560
Well, Bible man watches like Kylo, why don't you get in there?

1589
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:37,920
You haven't had a turn with the whip.

1590
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:38,320
Good.

1591
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,880
I know your arms aren't as you being six years old.

1592
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,960
You don't have quite the whip crack that some of the older kids do, but keep whipping.

1593
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:45,760
You'll get there.

1594
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:47,760
I know Bible man.

1595
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:53,120
I saw it like available to stream on Pure Flix, which oh God help me.

1596
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:53,520
Whatever.

1597
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,120
I got a free trial right now.

1598
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,560
Maybe you ever liked.

1599
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:03,760
Um, I, I, but it was also streaming on, uh, you know, Mark Wahlberg's weird Catholic app.

1600
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:04,260
Yeah.

1601
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,240
What's that one called?

1602
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:07,840
I forget what that's called.

1603
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:12,800
It's the one he was doing promotional videos for around time of father's stew and stuff.

1604
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:13,440
Oh, man.

1605
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:20,560
You went on the, uh, uh, he was on the today's show promoting it on Ash Wednesday.

1606
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,400
So you had ashes on the ashes.

1607
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:22,720
Yeah.

1608
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:27,440
I, I, this is foolish though, cause evangelicals probably think like, ah, no Catholics.

1609
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,000
That's not real.

1610
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:28,800
No.

1611
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,600
Man, I just signed up for RFD TV.

1612
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:38,320
Jason might know that because I discovered that the home improvement tooltime girl,

1613
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:43,760
Debbie Dunning has a show called Debbie Dunning's dude ranch roundup on RFD TV.

1614
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:48,160
So they was trying to get me to sign up and pay like $6 to go on RFD TV.

1615
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:49,440
Hang on.

1616
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:52,400
Why are you, why are you watching dude dude?

1617
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:52,640
Right.

1618
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:56,320
Well, I remember I was driving over here in the car and I said, don't bring this up,

1619
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,600
even though you want to talk about it.

1620
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,120
Don't force this into the episode.

1621
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:02,800
It's not necessary, but it's too late because we're talking about streaming service.

1622
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,120
Instagram knows what I want to see.

1623
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:10,400
And for some reason, there's a video of Debbie Dunning sitting on William Shatner's lap

1624
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,280
at a comic convention in the last few days.

1625
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:17,680
He looks uncomfortable at first and then they just start making weird sexual innuendo jokes

1626
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:18,560
about it.

1627
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:21,440
And then I said, oh wow, Debbie Dunning is doing like the concert.

1628
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:22,800
And I didn't realize this.

1629
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,840
And so I started going through and there she is with the Richard Karn at different

1630
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:31,200
comic conventions and she's wearing the Binford tool outfit, uh, everywhere, taking photos with

1631
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:31,760
guys.

1632
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:38,320
Is this, uh, maybe she neck and neck with danger girl in terms of mid nineties interest?

1633
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,920
I was not a huge home improvement fan.

1634
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,200
So I'm not trying to diminish.

1635
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,960
I was certainly chase Meridian.

1636
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:45,840
I'm being honest.

1637
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:46,960
I'm honest about chase.

1638
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:50,480
I'm honest about the danger girls, Abby chase, uh, all of them.

1639
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:54,640
But yeah, no, she was attractive, but I wasn't like obsessed with her or anything.

1640
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:58,240
This just the reason, by the way, the reason Instagram showed this to me is because an

1641
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:01,600
old William Shatner was in the clip, not because of Debbie.

1642
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:01,840
Oh yeah.

1643
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:02,560
What do I say?

1644
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:03,840
Instagram gets you.

1645
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,120
They know you don't want babes.

1646
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,960
You want old men, old.

1647
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,040
I want any star trek actor that's alive.

1648
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:15,280
That's over 70 people who are famous primarily for something that happened 24 years before

1649
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:15,920
you were born.

1650
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:16,960
Yes.

1651
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:22,320
They saw me follow the Barbara Eden fan account and they know a little bit of boat.

1652
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:23,600
You got a little bit of babe in there.

1653
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:23,920
That's true.

1654
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:26,240
Although I was never like, I never had a crush on Jeannie.

1655
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,480
I swear to God, my love of Jeannie was pure.

1656
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:29,600
Let me be clear here.

1657
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:30,960
I thought she seemed nice.

1658
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:37,920
But so then I found that then she's promoting Debbie Dunning's dude ranch roundup.

1659
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,280
And I said, well, what is this?

1660
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:43,920
And it is Debbie Dunning going from going around, I assume, probably maybe two states

1661
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:47,040
and finding like the best dude ranches in the country.

1662
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:47,760
Yeah.

1663
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,760
And I looked up RFT TV.

1664
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:55,840
I was like, well, I bet their Twitter bio will immediately tell me what this is.

1665
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:56,800
And it did.

1666
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:02,880
The official Twitter page for RFT TV, rural America's most important network.

1667
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:03,440
Rural, yes.

1668
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,920
It's like, oh, okay.

1669
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,600
I think I kind of.

1670
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:12,000
But this, if you sign up for the streaming service, you get shows like Big Joe,

1671
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:19,200
Poka Show Classics, which is just like a big hall of some kind where this guy,

1672
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:23,760
Big Joe, shouts out like, hey, here we got the, and then it's like a name, like the Emmett

1673
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:24,480
Poka.

1674
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:28,800
And then some guys like play a poker while very, very old people dance.

1675
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,640
And the thing is shot like a C-span or something.

1676
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,360
We're just like a hard camera here.

1677
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,880
It fades in and out.

1678
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:40,000
It might only be 10 years old, but it looks 50 years old.

1679
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,440
What does RFT stand for?

1680
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:47,680
I don't know, but there's shows on here called Cowboy Church, Cowboys of Thunder.

1681
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,160
Rural Free Delivery.

1682
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:50,800
Okay.

1683
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:57,760
Name for the US Postal Service's system of delivering mail directly to rural patrons.

1684
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,280
That's about as obscure as it could be.

1685
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,720
There's a show called I Love To Farm.

1686
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,720
So it's the TV version of the mail.

1687
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:06,800
Mail TV.

1688
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:08,160
Yes.

1689
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,160
There's a show called I Love Toy Trains.

1690
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,800
There's a show called Live To Farm.

1691
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,120
I'd say my kid would like that.

1692
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:15,520
Yeah.

1693
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:20,640
So the Merlin Jean show, just like, like Molly B Poka Party.

1694
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,920
These are all shows you get for your like six dollar.

1695
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:29,680
Cowguy Clo- I don't know if this is close or close with Scott the Cowguy.

1696
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:32,560
That's Scott Shellady in Nashville, Tennessee.

1697
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,840
He's wearing a suit with cow pattern on it.

1698
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:36,400
It appears.

1699
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:38,560
Scott Shellady.

1700
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,080
Now I have that in my head.

1701
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:42,640
All right.

1702
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:44,800
Scott Shellady lives in my brain now.

1703
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:47,920
There's something called the Presley Count- Presley Country Jubilee.

1704
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:50,400
And then they're all like looking and they're all kind of wearing those nudie suits.

1705
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,400
And I was like, oh my God, I think I'm going to pay six dollars to watch

1706
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,920
all the content on this network.

1707
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,920
This is where Paula Deen has ended up.

1708
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,720
Oh, no.

1709
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,080
Positively Paula.

1710
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,160
No, you got to put a sour note on it.

1711
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:03,520
We forgive Paula.

1712
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,680
Paula can do whatever she wants.

1713
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:08,320
Say whatever she wants on our FT TV.

1714
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:08,880
Texas bucket list.

1715
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:09,920
We hope she does it.

1716
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,520
But if she does, we don't fire her.

1717
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:17,440
This is a mix of stuff that is either very boring and harmless or like,

1718
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:20,320
here's like a commentary, financial commentary show.

1719
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:24,240
And it says Lee ESG is corporate communism.

1720
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:26,000
I don't know what any of that means.

1721
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,840
I don't know what ESG is.

1722
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,600
Look, Jason, I'll investigate all of this.

1723
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:34,320
But I yeah, anyway, I'll show it into this episode.

1724
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:38,240
Do you know that Debbie Dunning's dude ranch roundup is from 2017?

1725
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:39,520
Well, she's still promoting it.

1726
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:41,920
It's still available.

1727
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:42,960
It's still there.

1728
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,440
You don't just kiss a product goodbye.

1729
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,520
You put your blood, sweat and tears into.

1730
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:48,640
You went to those ranches.

1731
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:49,840
She's there was hot days.

1732
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:50,640
She's sweat a lot.

1733
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:53,200
This is look, I just learned about this.

1734
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:56,560
So I'm going to get to this before I get to Yellowstone is what I'm saying.

1735
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:59,280
I'm definitely going to go through that catalog.

1736
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,040
I think I approve of that.

1737
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:01,360
Yeah.

1738
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:02,240
Order of things.

1739
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:09,440
Well, look, you know, Pure Flix is no slouch either because if you're listeners,

1740
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:13,280
if you want to see all the Bible man were describing, you can find it there

1741
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:16,720
with the worst interface you've ever seen a streaming service have.

1742
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:19,200
Though I say that not having seen our FT TV.

1743
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,440
Yeah, we'll find out.

1744
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:25,760
But they've got a weird sad sitcom with Dave Coulier.

1745
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:31,040
Yeah, they're stacking the names up to that's called live and local with

1746
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:35,280
the and he's the host of a Christian local radio station.

1747
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:35,760
All right.

1748
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:39,200
And then there's another one called Malibu Dan, the family man.

1749
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:42,320
And that's about a local morning TV show host.

1750
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,160
These are both Dave Coulier.

1751
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,360
No, he's not in Malibu.

1752
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:49,120
Dan, there's nobody prominent in the bleed cast of Malibu.

1753
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:52,720
Dan, but you get Victoria Jackson and the episodes.

1754
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:55,360
I'm listening.

1755
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:59,440
Victoria, are there any poker parties on this streaming service?

1756
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:04,000
They may not offer poker, but RFD may as multiple shows about poker party.

1757
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,320
Unless there is a pure poker.

1758
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:09,120
If it's called that, there might be pure poker streaming.

1759
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,560
There's a full you're right.

1760
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:14,960
No, now that I think about this, there's a Roku poker channel that was promoted on

1761
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,800
one of the YouTube because I looked up Big Joe.

1762
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,080
I watched a little of that Big Joe and it says you can go to the poker channel on Roku.

1763
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:23,360
So there is a full poker channel.

1764
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:32,080
Roku's the Roku channel page is much more Wild West than the TV one.

1765
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:34,160
We could have a channel on Roku tomorrow.

1766
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:34,660
Yeah.

1767
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:37,760
Tonight, podcast, the ride channel tonight.

1768
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:38,480
We're launching it.

1769
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,360
It's mostly got poker parties on it.

1770
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,640
They're mostly in the public domain.

1771
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,320
Big Jason Sheridan's poker party.

1772
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:50,080
Public domain poker party.

1773
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,480
Also, you can watch the Carol Burnett show on RFD TV.

1774
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,160
I'm just calling this a battle between the two.

1775
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:58,080
Let's imagine we both have lightsabers.

1776
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:58,640
Right.

1777
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:02,160
Well, where else but on Pure Flix, can you watch the little rascals?

1778
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,360
Well, where else can you watch our gang?

1779
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:14,400
They don't just put copyright free.

1780
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,720
They don't put public domain stuff everywhere, dude.

1781
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:26,880
Only by the Lord's virtue on Pure Flix, can you find Chop Kick Panda, a animated film that bears

1782
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:31,360
no resemblance to any other martial arts related Panda film.

1783
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:37,280
Chop Kick Panda is original and the Lord recognizes it as an individual.

1784
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:40,400
But where can you watch Cattlemen to Cattlemen?

1785
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:46,560
So Scott, you're saying the 99 cent store like Dollar Store, Knock Off,

1786
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,640
Aladdin or whatever has jumped.

1787
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:52,240
Apparently, it's allowed to be on Pure Flix.

1788
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:54,320
Yeah, they have something called Cars Life.

1789
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:55,600
I got a car.

1790
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:56,320
Cars Life 2.

1791
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,560
I wanted to watch any television growing up.

1792
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:06,880
So if I got like a distant relative gave us like, you know, VHS copy, whatever, I will watch it.

1793
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:08,320
Just anything.

1794
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:08,800
Didn't matter.

1795
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,920
It doesn't matter what.

1796
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:16,160
Anything statistically, I am shocked I didn't get more like odd.

1797
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:18,160
Like, oh, I found this at the 99 cent store.

1798
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:21,840
It's like a weird evangelical like Little Mermaid or something.

1799
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:22,960
Sure.

1800
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,680
There's a lot of cartoons.

1801
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:27,760
Yeah, Pure Flix has a cartoon that's just called Jesus.

1802
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:29,600
They got to that title.

1803
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,400
Nobody's grabbed that.

1804
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,600
Nice and simple.

1805
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:32,560
Yeah, we got Jesus.

1806
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:33,120
We got him.

1807
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,040
There's something else I was going to say.

1808
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,160
Oh, oh, oh, here.

1809
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:40,800
Let me wrap it back to that episode.

1810
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,600
Big, big book.

1811
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:50,480
The one that is 100% about other than very brief flashbacks to a time that somebody named Decepto put Bible man in a pit.

1812
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:55,120
He is just something he thinks about briefly so that he can say, so I've faced challenges too.

1813
01:27:55,200 --> 01:28:00,320
So I think you'll be able to choreograph this number in the next hour without issue.

1814
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:12,800
And then you get to see a lot of performance of a song and not the song Big, Big, Big Book or Book of Books.

1815
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,000
I think they're both.

1816
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,640
There's three numbers in this song and there are these three numbers in the show and they're all about the Bible.

1817
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:21,520
Of course, this is the 1950s one.

1818
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:28,160
So here's a quick clip of the spirit of the 50s, but as pointing you in the direction of the Bible.

1819
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,560
It's important lyric.

1820
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:03,760
I it's the it's the only book I need you don't.

1821
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:09,120
So the message of this song is if you want to know about history, it's only one book.

1822
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:12,560
Well, isn't that still the message they're going with these days?

1823
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:21,280
It does keep some bad ideas out if you only pointed at the Bible and then the same message essentially

1824
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:27,760
is said about science when when all I've got is science on my mind.

1825
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:30,240
I run and fetch my Bible right on time.

1826
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:36,560
So if you start if your thoughts are drifting to dirty things like science and grab a Bible,

1827
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:40,480
they tell you this is music comes out on the campaign trail.

1828
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:43,280
The only video left is Big, Big Book, right?

1829
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,760
Empty library with one VHS in there.

1830
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:51,360
Yeah, they tell you to go to the Bible to learn about history and politics.

1831
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:55,840
And it's like, no, I don't even know.

1832
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:03,200
You can give it a shot, but like I don't think you have to take everything from that.

1833
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:03,920
You know, everything.

1834
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:07,840
I'd like to learn about Jimmy Carter's administration.

1835
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:08,880
Is that in the Bible?

1836
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:11,840
Go to the Bible.

1837
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,720
Hey, it's got a phone, Prince and a king.

1838
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:16,000
You answer my question, though.

1839
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,840
Punch run away.

1840
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:24,960
Yeah, they also they're showing all these kids these kids all look to be the age where it's like

1841
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:30,400
my memory of of being that age and of teach of like kids that age.

1842
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:35,840
It's like you encourage them to read anything because the last thing they want to do is read

1843
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:36,160
this.

1844
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:40,080
But Jason, silly Jason, the silly.

1845
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:40,480
You sure.

1846
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:46,400
Like it's it's infomercial like all these books who has room for any of these books.

1847
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:46,720
He is.

1848
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:47,200
He's good.

1849
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:48,880
But then if you just have one book.

1850
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,760
A book that's every kind of book.

1851
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:52,800
It's science.

1852
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,920
It's history.

1853
01:30:53,920 --> 01:31:00,240
If you just romance Christmas, there must be a scam like Christian ebook reader.

1854
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:04,240
Like there must be a scam Christian kindle where it's like, well, there's only one book on here.

1855
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,720
There's only one book you need.

1856
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:07,600
But you get this.

1857
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:10,000
You still get the thrill of paying thirty dollars a month.

1858
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,600
As if it was for separate books.

1859
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:12,400
That's right.

1860
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,400
The Bible subscription server.

1861
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:18,960
Do you miss out on monthly subscription feeds because you only read the Bible?

1862
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,080
Not anymore.

1863
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:25,600
So that that clip you see all the girls are like sitting at the soda fountain.

1864
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:26,960
They've all got poodle skirts.

1865
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:34,800
The boys are dressed like greasers and that they have heans, beefy teas, like tucked into jeans.

1866
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,160
There's no sunglasses.

1867
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:40,240
They're absolutely certainly no cigarettes or switchblades.

1868
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:42,000
Like, you know, none of that shit.

1869
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:47,200
You have to give them credit because it probably took 40 years for just the greaser and the

1870
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:50,960
poodle skirts to not be offensive to hardcore Christians.

1871
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:51,360
Yes.

1872
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:57,600
They they when the throwback burger restaurants came around with a jukebox and a milkshake

1873
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:00,080
machine, they were OK with that.

1874
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:01,440
But we don't talk about any other.

1875
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:06,080
What happened in the time, I'm sure like hardcore Christians were like, this is the most sinful

1876
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:10,160
dress that a child or a teen could ever attempt.

1877
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:10,560
Yeah.

1878
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:10,880
Yeah.

1879
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,520
We're we're we're eliminating songs one by one.

1880
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:16,960
We are there's no way to really know what be Boppa Lula means.

1881
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:17,120
Right.

1882
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:18,080
Oh, it's out.

1883
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:19,440
Those aren't slacks.

1884
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:23,040
They don't have a they don't have a button collar on those shirts.

1885
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:25,760
It's an undershirt.

1886
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:27,680
Rolling will allow rolled up sleeves.

1887
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:28,400
That's OK.

1888
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:31,120
On the boys on the ball on the ever on the girls.

1889
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:35,040
The girls wear full sweaters thicker than usual sweaters.

1890
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:36,000
Cover those arms.

1891
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:36,560
That's right.

1892
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:43,360
It's also very, very funny because like the the bad version of the song and then the good

1893
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:45,520
version of the song, there's not a golf.

1894
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:50,560
It's kind of the same level because they don't want to do a bad version of him.

1895
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:54,320
You know what you're saying?

1896
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:57,280
That a good version of that song would be the same quality.

1897
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:00,880
I'm saying like when they're like, oh, that was OK.

1898
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:02,880
Oh, when they rehearse it and it's not going.

1899
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:03,520
Right.

1900
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:04,560
Yeah, I can't tell the difference.

1901
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:05,200
I can't tell you.

1902
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:06,800
It's like shitty look.

1903
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,000
It's doing a shitty little show.

1904
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:08,500
Yeah.

1905
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:14,000
Another thing I like about this episode is when it's like, oh, we got to take our places.

1906
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,480
The kids are lining up as a bunch of kids outside.

1907
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,720
We're saying we want the show.

1908
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,160
We want the show.

1909
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:22,800
And they and the show is called The Bible Man Show.

1910
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,120
It has the same title as what you're watching.

1911
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:29,200
So this play that everybody's going to go see is called The Bible Man Show.

1912
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:33,840
And they send somebody's dad out, go distract them, kill some time.

1913
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:38,560
And and they start asking them all these questions like, when's the show start?

1914
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:39,520
When can we come in?

1915
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:42,160
There's a special guest in the show, right?

1916
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:43,440
Do you know who it is?

1917
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,360
Who tell us who is it?

1918
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:46,560
And he's like, I can't.

1919
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:49,040
I'm not at liberty to look over there.

1920
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:55,040
And would you believe that the special guest in The Bible Man Show is a Bible man?

1921
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,320
Wow.

1922
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:57,840
Shocker of shocker.

1923
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:58,400
How did they get him?

1924
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:00,800
Wow.

1925
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:01,520
Big get.

1926
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:02,080
Yeah, yeah.

1927
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:05,600
It was not just they didn't just license the property.

1928
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:06,640
Yeah, do this show.

1929
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:08,000
They had the man himself.

1930
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:13,920
I yeah, this one, this is cruddy elsewhere.

1931
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:19,200
They compare the Bible to this little another line that's like, well, like Shakespeare,

1932
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:23,840
that is Romeo and Juliet, but which is not a book.

1933
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:26,160
That is a play, not applicable.

1934
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:31,520
But it's the song is entirely like which like dissing lesser books.

1935
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:35,680
Like Webster in his dictionary.

1936
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:37,680
The Bible is better than Webster.

1937
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:38,320
Uh huh.

1938
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:44,240
But OK, I could you could there be a Bible without it when I wrote it without a dictionary?

1939
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:46,800
Yeah, I guess there's some validity to that.

1940
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:52,720
I sort of jumped around in episodes and it did start to dawn on me.

1941
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:59,200
I'm like noticing all these children are not like working at a volunteering at a like a

1942
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:05,680
soup kitchen or planting a tree like noticing everyone in this universe is

1943
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:10,080
mostly just proselytizing to each other all the live long day.

1944
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,960
Yeah, it's kids doing youth group performances.

1945
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:16,960
Yeah, kids who might be in the youth groups of the future.

1946
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:22,560
Yeah, they're watching this on the, you know, four by three TV strapped to the cart that's

1947
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:28,640
rolled in, you know, the only except the only thing resembling an exciting day in these.

1948
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:30,560
Uh huh.

1949
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:37,600
Except for maybe when Bible man live rolls into town, I want to make sure we devote some

1950
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:38,960
time to Bible man.

1951
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:39,520
I live in.

1952
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,160
I only say love.

1953
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:42,240
I mean, compared to the TV show.

1954
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:42,640
Yes.

1955
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:42,880
Yeah.

1956
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:43,520
Yeah.

1957
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:45,280
Well, because this is huge.

1958
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:48,160
I mean, you know, we're I don't know what cities it came to.

1959
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:51,760
I saw, you know, evidence of that it would go to Florida cities.

1960
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:52,480
That makes sense.

1961
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:53,760
Or maybe like Montgomery.

1962
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:58,400
So yeah, Bible man live shows up in Montgomery.

1963
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,240
We're now we're talking.

1964
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:03,280
It was like, if that's what I was trying to find, like tour dates, I was trying to find

1965
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:04,800
some documentation of it.

1966
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:09,360
It was apparently on something called the Billy Graham Crusades, which is something

1967
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:14,960
he did for decades, which was just a touring show to get to convert people.

1968
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:15,280
Okay.

1969
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:19,280
And it would contain like it would contain probably sermons, but I guess this would just

1970
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:21,520
be a chunk of it sometimes.

1971
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:22,320
Yeah.

1972
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:25,040
And I couldn't find there's different, I guess he was doing for decades.

1973
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:31,040
There's many versions of it, which I get in like going back like maybe the 70s or 60s.

1974
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:35,760
So he was maybe doing his own coming out of our shells show.

1975
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:36,720
Billy Graham was.

1976
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:36,960
Yeah.

1977
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:38,000
Years before this.

1978
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:40,320
But yeah, it apparently.

1979
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,720
Original Ninja Turtle, as most people call him.

1980
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:43,280
Yeah, right.

1981
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:43,520
Yeah.

1982
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:51,760
So yeah, so it's interesting because there are many different videos of this Bible man live

1983
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,160
and they're all a little different.

1984
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,320
They have different villains.

1985
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,680
They have different characters.

1986
01:36:57,680 --> 01:36:59,360
There are different songs.

1987
01:36:59,360 --> 01:36:59,680
Yeah.

1988
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:04,240
I was going like, I have clips from different shows with completely different songs.

1989
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:05,040
Yeah.

1990
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,960
And there's not just one rubber stamped.

1991
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:09,360
They kept reinventing the by what bio man live.

1992
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:10,800
The show was.

1993
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:11,920
And it's interesting.

1994
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:18,080
And again, there's not really like I didn't, I couldn't find like it on like all music.com

1995
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:22,800
where they had compiled a list of all the different songs, but you would go like 45

1996
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:26,560
minutes into one of these and I go, well, this, this song isn't terrible.

1997
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:27,360
Actually.

1998
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:27,920
Wow.

1999
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:28,720
It's not terrible.

2000
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:32,400
Like any song on the TV show that I came upon, I think was like awful.

2001
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:34,080
That Bible side.

2002
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:35,440
Did you not just hear that?

2003
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:36,240
Let's see where you go.

2004
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:39,120
It's the only.

2005
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,240
I burn all of their books.

2006
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:42,800
That was pretty good.

2007
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:47,520
And not that these songs are good, but I was enjoying them more.

2008
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,640
At least I'll say that.

2009
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:52,720
But yes, it's very much a setup exactly like coming out of our shells.

2010
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:56,960
Uh, where, you know, Bible man's there.

2011
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:59,600
Kids are yelling when the bad guy shows up.

2012
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:00,800
There's an easy lesson.

2013
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:03,200
Parky booing all the theme park booing.

2014
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:08,560
It has the ultimate theme Parky thing, which is the pre-recorded soundtrack.

2015
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:08,880
Yes.

2016
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:15,040
I think every one of them that I saw that like that it is all baked in, even though it

2017
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:17,360
is the real actors doing it.

2018
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:23,120
It is Willie Ames and later, uh, pastor, uh, slip.

2019
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:23,360
Yeah.

2020
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,480
Pastor slip.

2021
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:27,680
He's there in person, but they just lip sync.

2022
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:28,080
Right.

2023
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:30,000
I should have said, sorry, coming out of their shells.

2024
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,440
The song is coming out of our shells.

2025
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:32,000
Sorry.

2026
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:32,320
I know.

2027
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,440
I just want to be correct here.

2028
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:35,440
Make a big mistake.

2029
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:36,400
People are going to be upset.

2030
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:41,040
But you know, some of the characters aren't there.

2031
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:44,800
Notably Bible girl doesn't seem to be Bible girl does show up.

2032
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:45,360
She does.

2033
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:47,520
She sings a song in one of them too.

2034
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:48,400
Oh wow.

2035
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:49,440
So this is what I'm saying.

2036
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:50,000
Like, I don't know.

2037
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,960
I did not have time to document each show, which is kind of what I started wanting to do,

2038
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,680
but I would just take some chunks out of these things and we're going to,

2039
01:38:57,680 --> 01:39:01,440
I may end up having to edit some of this too, because I did not completely precisely,

2040
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:06,960
uh, cut these to the point where, because some of the lead up is very entertaining too,

2041
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:10,160
but maybe, uh, maybe you'll say I'm incorrect about that.

2042
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,880
I mean, this is no judgment on you.

2043
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:17,120
I think being that it is Bible man, I might say this is boring.

2044
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:17,440
Yes.

2045
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:20,080
So here, you know, let's start with Bible girl.

2046
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:24,720
Just, I want to give you a flavor, the different flavors that appeared on this live show.

2047
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:26,960
And I'll just start it and see what we get, where we're at.

2048
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:36,960
Wow.

2049
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:39,600
It sounds like this Natalie and Brulia.

2050
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:39,920
Yes.

2051
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:42,240
It says 2005 and the song is called free.

2052
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:46,560
So yes, they're going off of Natalie and Brulia from 1998.

2053
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:50,320
Yeah. I was impressed by how current it was until you said 2005.

2054
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:51,120
Yeah.

2055
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:06,240
I was thinking of Bible girls born a sinner.

2056
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:07,680
She should feel really bad about it.

2057
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:10,960
My own carnal mind.

2058
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:12,160
Oh God.

2059
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:13,840
This is making a sinner seem cool.

2060
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:14,800
Yeah.

2061
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:18,800
Do they ever do any flashbacks to like when Bible girl is a sinner and at our carnal mind?

2062
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:21,200
No, we ever see any flashbacks.

2063
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:23,360
And she's in a flash out the character.

2064
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:24,960
That's when she first met the paint.

2065
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:27,840
She used to be a danger girl.

2066
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:31,200
Now she's a Bible girl, but we're not seeing that.

2067
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:32,400
We're not seeing the old days.

2068
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,880
Actually, you know, that's kind of the gist of that one.

2069
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:36,400
That's not my favorite one, believe it or not.

2070
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:41,360
I have Bible man sings in one of these.

2071
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:42,320
Not all of them.

2072
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:42,800
Wow.

2073
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,080
But he sings in one of these.

2074
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:46,320
Boy, a flashback to the days of paradise.

2075
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:49,920
What Christ Jesus our Lord has done.

2076
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:50,560
That's slip.

2077
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:50,800
Is it?

2078
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:50,880
Yeah.

2079
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,640
So yeah, I was going to say this is not Williams.

2080
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:53,520
This is a later one.

2081
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,200
They both toured extensively.

2082
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:55,520
Yes.

2083
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:56,160
Bible man.

2084
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:56,800
This is shipped.

2085
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:57,360
This is later.

2086
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,240
I don't know.

2087
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:58,640
Real quick.

2088
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:00,560
Do you guys, what are you, who was your favorite Bible man?

2089
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:03,120
You know, it was a question we always answer, but.

2090
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:10,240
I mean, this is the only choice in the world where I would pick Willie Ames.

2091
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:16,000
I think in any other equation where the answer is, if it was like most boring guy,

2092
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,440
Willie gets it every time.

2093
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:20,960
But if if charisma is involved at all.

2094
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:22,240
All right.

2095
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:22,720
Fair enough.

2096
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:24,240
Yeah, I have to agree with you on that.

2097
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:28,080
Maybe versus Ken Ham, Willie stacks up.

2098
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:28,560
That's true.

2099
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:29,680
More charismatic.

2100
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:34,080
But but I do slip is to he's just got nothing.

2101
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:37,840
He's got nothing going on a little more classically handsome.

2102
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:38,480
Oh, but yeah.

2103
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:42,640
What the what jumps into my head is that he's a he's an L.A.

2104
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:44,400
three, but a Bible man ten.

2105
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:50,160
Compared to what became before.

2106
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:50,960
That's fair enough.

2107
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:54,880
By the way, that's a distract or citric too much.

2108
01:41:54,880 --> 01:42:02,320
But this bears saying is that the whole like they're doing the tours and the videos

2109
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:06,880
with Willie Ames and then all of a sudden, mysteriously, there's even a video I found

2110
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:10,800
where he says, well, I've hurt my back, so I'm not going to be able to do them anymore.

2111
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:13,600
But years later, I think the story has changed.

2112
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:14,000
Yeah.

2113
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:20,240
If you can believe it, I think that Willie Ames, who is not an out of shape man,

2114
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:25,600
but who, you know, a lot of us probably have more attractive fathers than Willie Ames.

2115
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:30,720
Let's give it up for our hot dad of us listeners, too.

2116
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:35,200
I mean, you know, he's just he's the most like milk toasty man.

2117
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:35,440
Yeah.

2118
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:40,880
And I think that here's what happened.

2119
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:45,760
Robert Schlipp was a pastor somewhere where Bible man live showed up.

2120
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:47,280
They hit it off.

2121
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:49,280
I really like you.

2122
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:50,720
And in fact, I trust you.

2123
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:53,920
And I sense that you won't screw me over in a year's time.

2124
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:57,600
Why don't you come along and be part of the Bible man ministry?

2125
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:58,160
And he did.

2126
01:42:58,160 --> 01:43:00,240
And then suddenly the production's like, who is this?

2127
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:01,440
Who is this?

2128
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:06,880
He's by far the hottest guy ever involved in the Bible man enterprise.

2129
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:09,440
Someone I found.

2130
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:10,880
I forget where it was.

2131
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,800
It was like Reddit or the YouTube comments.

2132
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:17,360
Someone's like, I noticed this episode because all the Bible man stuff is on YouTube,

2133
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:19,440
bootleg or otherwise.

2134
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:28,320
And there were YouTube commenters going like, I noticed that this episode suddenly Willie Ames

2135
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:33,360
is credited as the writer, director and producer.

2136
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:36,640
And Tony Salerno only gets the credit for co-creation.

2137
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:39,200
Do you think maybe there was some trouble?

2138
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:46,160
People are trying to like never on this like the Bible man set is a place of peace.

2139
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,560
The set is made in the Lord's image.

2140
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:56,080
Of course, I will say the generic CG model might be more attractive than

2141
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:03,600
you're saying when Willie Ames said he was not doing anymore because just of

2142
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:08,480
having to be in shape for the costume, you're saying that that's like maybe

2143
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:13,680
like a Michael Jordan flu game kind of retcon of the history.

2144
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:18,880
Yeah, I think this is Dirk Diggler and the new guy.

2145
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:19,680
Oh, right.

2146
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:23,680
But I accept the opposite of that in terms of content.

2147
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:27,920
But like the young gun shows up and it's like behind the

2148
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:28,640
candelabra.

2149
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:30,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2150
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:32,080
Suddenly your old news.

2151
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:33,680
And hey, he fits in the suit.

2152
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:35,280
So yeah, he goes in.

2153
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:43,520
But you know, things ended up fine for Willie, as you can tell by this clip of him several

2154
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:48,080
years later on the celebrity weight loss series, celebrity fit club.

2155
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:53,600
Of course, he ended up in a perfectly good state after some drill instructor guys showed

2156
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:56,080
up at his house unannounced one morning.

2157
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:59,440
Do you know how lucky they are that they weren't staring down the barrel of a 12 gauge

2158
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:00,000
shotgun?

2159
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:04,880
Now, when people come to my door and invade my property, the only reason they weren't

2160
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:09,040
looking at a shotgun was because I saw the camera crew out of a window.

2161
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:12,080
You told me that you could not get to the gym, right?

2162
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:13,600
So I brought the gym to you.

2163
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:14,480
And you know what?

2164
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:16,240
You had put a shotgun out, you could bring it out.

2165
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:18,400
You would have broke that thing right there off in your ass.

2166
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:22,640
If he's quicker than you, he's quicker than your son.

2167
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:24,560
Getting exercise in your schedule.

2168
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:26,080
So we try to help jump start.

2169
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:28,160
What did he say?

2170
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:28,800
Club?

2171
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,000
Do you remember celebrity fit?

2172
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,200
Yeah, yeah, he was on.

2173
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:35,440
At the time, I was watching it mainly going like that's Bible man.

2174
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:35,760
Wow.

2175
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:36,560
I was on this.

2176
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:38,080
And then what's great is this clip goes on.

2177
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:40,000
It's cutting to who else is on it.

2178
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,960
You're like, Jack, hey, Victoria Jackson.

2179
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:43,360
Wow.

2180
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:46,240
And then there's a and then he in a huff.

2181
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:48,640
He's like, you have insulted me for that.

2182
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:50,400
He's still even in a real argument.

2183
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:54,800
He can't get the actual rage and it just turns into you've insulted me.

2184
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:56,720
You've made me feel like a fool today.

2185
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:57,920
Damn you for that.

2186
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:03,440
And then he storms out and then a very concerned Gary Busey chases after him.

2187
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:11,520
And then he comes back in and then has a very like Christian hissy fit.

2188
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:19,200
Reality TV or not, this had a great, powerful, positive effect on my life.

2189
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:23,280
And I thought like what you did was take a dump all over it.

2190
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:25,840
That's funny.

2191
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,480
That's a little scary.

2192
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:33,680
I mean, even saying dump, even even acknowledging the fact that your body makes waste out of its anus.

2193
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:38,080
Yeah, yeah, that's not that's not something that I don't think that like evangelicals talk about a lot.

2194
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:43,760
No, it is a dump is something that the Lord has made, but it still doesn't mean I want one on me.

2195
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:44,880
Damn you.

2196
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:51,840
That is I do get the sense from him that he feels worse about the language he's using

2197
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:56,640
and not potentially pointing a 12 gauge shotgun at a stranger.

2198
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:00,640
Well, you know, he didn't he did.

2199
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:04,720
He saw the camera and that stopped him from bringing a gun at I guess,

2200
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:09,200
unlike a Bible man who only uses the sword of spirit.

2201
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:11,680
Willie Ames has other weapons and it's shotgun.

2202
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:19,920
There was a thread going around Twitter of it was a clip from like a New Jersey paper

2203
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:24,720
advice column and someone's like, I believe my neighbor is leaving her 13 year old child

2204
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:28,800
home alone for a few hours on Saturdays when they go to the part time job.

2205
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:33,280
And the advice columnist was like, you can leave 13 year olds alone for a few hours.

2206
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:35,840
Like essentially, please be normal.

2207
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:39,280
Like, and there's all these things in the comments of like,

2208
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:45,200
yeah, the cops were called in my town because a kid was walking four blocks to their friend's

2209
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:49,920
house and they thought they were that it's all this psycho stuff where it's like, yeah,

2210
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:53,760
when I was a kid, I was playing in the backyard looking for frogs with a flashlight.

2211
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:57,760
And my neighbor came out with a gun and said, like, you got to be careful.

2212
01:47:57,760 --> 01:47:59,120
I didn't know who you were.

2213
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:01,760
And it's like, oh, OK, so this we're all unhinged.

2214
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:02,720
Everyone's unhinged.

2215
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:03,920
Well, just look at next door.

2216
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:04,960
Look at the next door app.

2217
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:05,840
Yeah, next door.

2218
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:06,960
The hate crime.

2219
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:07,840
The psycho app.

2220
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:09,200
Out of their minds.

2221
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,320
Like just looking out the window, peering out the window.

2222
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:13,600
Yeah.

2223
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,440
A bunch of here's a here's a reference.

2224
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:20,400
But a Gladys Kravitz is blank, blank, blank, blank.

2225
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:22,640
Jason, I can't pull it.

2226
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:23,360
I've heard it.

2227
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:26,480
I've heard the neighbor from bewitched.

2228
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:27,680
Oh, yeah.

2229
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:28,180
OK.

2230
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:35,440
You got to look, look up Gladys Kravitz is big old rodeo roundup.

2231
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:39,920
Yeah, she's 140 and she's still hosting a show on RFT TV.

2232
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:43,920
It's insane that my go to for nosy neighbor is Mr.

2233
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:45,920
Roper and that is somehow yours.

2234
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:49,280
There's 10 years, 10 years more than mine.

2235
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:50,560
Yes.

2236
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:52,080
So that's weird.

2237
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:54,000
Gladys did not come up on the show for six years.

2238
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:54,480
Yeah, really.

2239
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:56,560
Um, do you have something to finish off?

2240
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,480
But as I have a few, I need to play a few more.

2241
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:02,800
So just then he starts yelling at the drill instructor guy about like,

2242
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:05,280
I called you and you didn't call me back.

2243
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:07,600
That made me feel like you took a dump on me.

2244
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:10,880
And then the guy's response is, you want to know where I was?

2245
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:12,400
I was at my friend's funeral.

2246
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,160
He's a soldier who died in Iraq.

2247
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:14,800
Oh, my God.

2248
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:17,760
Your next weigh in is eight pounds, eight pounds.

2249
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:25,760
So Willie gets shut up real hard with the fresh Iraq soldier.

2250
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:26,720
Jesus.

2251
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:28,880
Yeah, it's a hell of a show.

2252
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:29,760
It was intense.

2253
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:30,560
It really was.

2254
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:32,880
I do recall it was kind of a good show.

2255
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:34,960
Sounds like it's got it's full of drama.

2256
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:35,440
Uh huh.

2257
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:35,940
Uh huh.

2258
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:38,640
So anyways, but I'm sorry.

2259
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:41,920
I feel like you were in the middle of a clip and I took a big dump all over it.

2260
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:43,760
That's OK.

2261
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:45,600
I'm going to be polite about it.

2262
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,720
I'm going to be like Christian about it.

2263
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:47,600
The word teaches forgiveness.

2264
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:52,080
I am upset and want to get a 12 gauge, but I will be polite about it.

2265
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:52,960
This is real quick.

2266
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:55,280
So this is what Bible man sounds like when he sings.

2267
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:59,040
Word says, how can a young person keep his life pure?

2268
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:04,720
By living in keeping with your word, I trust in you with all my heart.

2269
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:07,920
Don't let me wander away from your commands.

2270
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:12,960
I have hidden your word in my heart so that I won't send against you.

2271
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:14,660
Amen.

2272
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:18,880
So that's Eunice.

2273
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:29,200
More 90s sort of rock here.

2274
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:31,440
You are my backbone.

2275
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:34,000
You are my breath.

2276
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:40,160
You are my very splinter skipping stone style song.

2277
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:44,400
You are the essence.

2278
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:45,840
You are my hall.

2279
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:50,480
You are the soul inside.

2280
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:54,400
He's in like a purple suit singing this.

2281
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:54,960
Yes.

2282
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:55,460
Wow.

2283
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:07,200
Holy God, help me through this night.

2284
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:09,280
This is definitely the most Christian rock of all the songs.

2285
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:14,960
So Bible man does not sing in all of them, but there's two more I want to play real quick

2286
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:17,680
because these are more my favorites.

2287
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:21,760
These are the two just to give you sort of a flavor of the later ones, but this one is

2288
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:24,640
Furiosa who we mentioned earlier.

2289
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:28,800
And this is before we started here, I asked Scott, I go, did you play a clip of Bible man

2290
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:34,240
live on the show before because I was watching this and I had this weird flashback and we'll

2291
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:39,040
see if you guys remember this or something that was the same as this, if it wasn't this clip.

2292
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:43,920
But I think it was a different parody of the song they're parroting here.

2293
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:46,000
So I may have to zoom around a little bit, but here we go.

2294
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:52,400
They've introduced Lucy the computer.

2295
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:57,680
That's why they're making this va va voom music because Lucy is a sexy computer.

2296
01:51:58,560 --> 01:51:59,440
But I'll zoom forward a little bit.

2297
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:02,400
The computers in the show, by the way, I'll say Acer on them.

2298
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:06,400
It's like the kind I had in 2001.

2299
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:14,720
I'll be able to pull up enough gold fury to turn these brats into one terrifying titanic

2300
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:17,360
tempered tantrum of trouble.

2301
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:20,800
So they're showing all these kids that are completely uninterested in the show while

2302
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:24,800
this is happening and the kid he's threatening to do whatever he's going to turn the kids into

2303
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:28,080
something and he's he's very annoying.

2304
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:28,640
I would say.

2305
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:29,360
But here we go.

2306
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:30,960
So the song kicks in.

2307
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:33,440
Do all the guys.

2308
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:33,940
Okay.

2309
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:42,480
Evil gives me a charge kind of an itch that is to cut a little run.

2310
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:47,520
Oh, well, you're so say it again.

2311
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:50,880
Furioso.

2312
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:52,160
I started thinking I said Furioso.

2313
01:52:52,240 --> 01:52:53,600
Say it again, baby.

2314
01:52:54,160 --> 01:52:56,560
Boy, I hate va va voomy stuff.

2315
01:52:58,240 --> 01:52:59,360
Let's rumba.

2316
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:04,260
What's up?

2317
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:06,400
Now he's rumba-ing.

2318
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:26,400
Is this sort of a Ricky Martin?

2319
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,400
I mean, that's what it sounds like to me.

2320
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:31,680
Now is the time to hit your favorite.

2321
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:32,180
My.

2322
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:39,200
It's familiar.

2323
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:40,400
Yeah.

2324
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:41,440
Why is this familiar?

2325
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:44,240
Can we play this?

2326
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:44,740
No, no.

2327
01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:46,100
Listeners.

2328
01:53:46,100 --> 01:53:53,780
I feel like you played live in La Furiosa on this show before, but I can't remember when.

2329
01:53:54,900 --> 01:53:56,900
Deepest darkest pandemic.

2330
01:53:56,900 --> 01:53:57,700
I don't know.

2331
01:53:57,700 --> 01:53:58,820
Ricky Martin parody.

2332
01:54:00,180 --> 01:54:02,260
I know that melody is instantly familiar.

2333
01:54:02,260 --> 01:54:05,620
Somebody else was just doing a live in La Vida Loca parody and you were playing it.

2334
01:54:05,620 --> 01:54:06,900
That's what might be the case.

2335
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:14,660
Well, was I talking about the Christian parody band apologetics and their Christian

2336
01:54:14,660 --> 01:54:17,940
parody of live in La Vida Loca, live in what Jesus spoke of?

2337
01:54:19,140 --> 01:54:20,100
I don't think so.

2338
01:54:20,100 --> 01:54:21,620
Living with Jesus spoke of.

2339
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:26,260
Get Christ in your life.

2340
01:54:26,260 --> 01:54:27,300
This is a real thing.

2341
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:28,100
Look it up.

2342
01:54:28,100 --> 01:54:28,420
Wow.

2343
01:54:28,420 --> 01:54:28,900
Apologize.

2344
01:54:28,900 --> 01:54:33,460
That's a whole pile of shit is the Christian parody band apologetics.

2345
01:54:33,460 --> 01:54:35,300
It's spelled with an X if you want to look it up.

2346
01:54:37,300 --> 01:54:42,260
I think that I feel like we played you play this specifically.

2347
01:54:42,260 --> 01:54:43,540
No, it's really.

2348
01:54:43,620 --> 01:54:47,460
And I can't think of, by the way, I found the name of the Eiffel 35 character,

2349
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:50,180
but I'll say that at the end of the show, but there's all these things we've forgotten

2350
01:54:50,180 --> 01:54:51,140
more things we've said on the show.

2351
01:54:51,140 --> 01:54:52,020
That'll be the top.

2352
01:54:52,020 --> 01:54:53,220
More than I've ever known.

2353
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:57,300
The top of the episode will be the reveal of the thing we said already.

2354
01:54:57,300 --> 01:55:03,300
But my favorite of all of the things that I found from the live is a song by a character

2355
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:05,380
named Rapscallion P. Sinister.

2356
01:55:06,820 --> 01:55:08,580
Did you guys find Rapscallion P. Sinister?

2357
01:55:08,580 --> 01:55:17,140
Oh, so he's got kind of like a Kano for Mortal Kombat, like metal plate on his head.

2358
01:55:17,140 --> 01:55:19,220
He's so lipsynchy.

2359
01:55:19,220 --> 01:55:20,100
Allow me to introduce.

2360
01:55:20,100 --> 01:55:22,020
It's a little off because of the Bluetooth.

2361
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:24,100
I am Rapscallion P.

2362
01:55:24,660 --> 01:55:26,020
I'm sure it was fine live.

2363
01:55:26,020 --> 01:55:29,220
Yeah, P stands for polite.

2364
01:55:30,020 --> 01:55:33,140
You can simply call me Sin.

2365
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:37,620
Well, get a load of this dump.

2366
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:41,220
So this is where the Bible lumps make it all hop.

2367
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:42,820
Bible lumps?

2368
01:55:42,820 --> 01:55:45,620
I will now shut down Eunice.

2369
01:55:45,620 --> 01:55:49,540
He's got like bright red hair and a bright red like chin patch.

2370
01:55:49,540 --> 01:55:51,300
It's like a mobile connection.

2371
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:52,020
Scott Weiland.

2372
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:52,740
I am.

2373
01:55:52,740 --> 01:55:54,180
He does look like Scott Weiland.

2374
01:55:54,180 --> 01:55:54,580
In a hotel.

2375
01:55:54,580 --> 01:55:55,140
I am.

2376
01:55:55,140 --> 01:55:56,020
Fear.

2377
01:55:56,020 --> 01:55:56,500
Hurt.

2378
01:55:57,460 --> 01:55:58,660
Someone.

2379
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:01,060
I like him the best maybe actually.

2380
01:56:01,060 --> 01:56:01,780
There.

2381
01:56:01,780 --> 01:56:02,900
We're up and running.

2382
01:56:03,860 --> 01:56:09,540
Allow me to also introduce you to the sidekick and nagging force behind.

2383
01:56:09,540 --> 01:56:12,900
He's like a Matthew Liller, Johnny Lee Miller hacker.

2384
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:19,140
Yeah, underhand computer influences or simply known as Lucy.

2385
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:20,660
So now Lucy is in this as well.

2386
01:56:20,660 --> 01:56:21,140
Lucy is.

2387
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:24,660
Oh, I've never had so much love for us.

2388
01:56:26,180 --> 01:56:26,820
Those are boobs.

2389
01:56:26,820 --> 01:56:29,540
And there's no Vava Voo music with Lucy in this version.

2390
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:30,740
Wait a minute.

2391
01:56:30,740 --> 01:56:31,620
Who are you?

2392
01:56:32,340 --> 01:56:35,620
Why doesn't anyone tell me that I have to re-educate another

2393
01:56:35,620 --> 01:56:38,180
rookie when it comes to this evil stuff?

2394
01:56:38,180 --> 01:56:39,220
I'm Repskeli.

2395
01:56:39,220 --> 01:56:40,500
So he's Repskeli and P.

2396
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:42,340
Sinister is what he's about to say.

2397
01:56:42,340 --> 01:56:47,140
But then he gets into a song and the song I think you'll understand why I like this song the best.

2398
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:49,060
And maybe you will, maybe you won't.

2399
01:56:49,060 --> 01:56:49,700
We'll see.

2400
01:56:49,700 --> 01:56:51,940
The guy already looks like one of Green Day.

2401
01:56:51,940 --> 01:56:52,440
So.

2402
01:56:53,140 --> 01:56:54,740
Looks like Mike Dern from Green Day.

2403
01:56:56,020 --> 01:56:58,660
Let's break my name down, shall we?

2404
01:57:02,580 --> 01:57:04,660
Oh, I'm expecting this.

2405
01:57:27,940 --> 01:57:29,220
The angriest kids.

2406
01:57:31,620 --> 01:57:34,820
When I sing, it really is a crime.

2407
01:57:35,620 --> 01:57:37,220
So what is scallion?

2408
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:39,300
What does that mean?

2409
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:42,340
It sounds so foreign.

2410
01:57:42,340 --> 01:57:43,780
It sounds so mean.

2411
01:57:44,660 --> 01:57:45,940
It is an onion.

2412
01:57:46,820 --> 01:57:48,180
The color green.

2413
01:57:49,140 --> 01:57:52,500
And it is smelly if you know what I mean.

2414
01:57:53,860 --> 01:57:56,100
You can call me Mr. Kiss.

2415
01:57:56,100 --> 01:57:58,340
You can call me Mr. Slime.

2416
01:57:58,340 --> 01:58:01,540
You can call me cause I'll answer every time.

2417
01:58:02,020 --> 01:58:03,780
You can, you do.

2418
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:04,900
This is kinda good.

2419
01:58:04,900 --> 01:58:05,700
You can do.

2420
01:58:05,700 --> 01:58:08,340
What is right for the P.

2421
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:10,740
Well, it stands for polite.

2422
01:58:11,780 --> 01:58:13,300
You can call me Mr. Slime.

2423
01:58:13,300 --> 01:58:13,780
One more time.

2424
01:58:13,780 --> 01:58:16,260
You can call me Mr. Slime.

2425
01:58:16,260 --> 01:58:19,380
You can call me cause I'll answer every time.

2426
01:58:20,740 --> 01:58:22,980
You can do what is wrong.

2427
01:58:22,980 --> 01:58:26,260
You can do what is right for the P.

2428
01:58:26,260 --> 01:58:28,420
Where it stands for polite.

2429
01:58:28,420 --> 01:58:32,660
I mean, the groove is pretty good.

2430
01:58:32,660 --> 01:58:33,540
It's all right.

2431
01:58:33,540 --> 01:58:34,900
It's a pretty good groove.

2432
01:58:34,900 --> 01:58:37,860
It's different than all the other bad songs.

2433
01:58:37,860 --> 01:58:42,260
Well, it feels like a song Mr. McFisto could have done.

2434
01:58:42,260 --> 01:58:42,900
Absolutely.

2435
01:58:42,900 --> 01:58:44,660
Yes, and he's very McFisto-esque.

2436
01:58:45,700 --> 01:58:49,780
So that was the gem I found where I was like, okay, here we go.

2437
01:58:49,780 --> 01:58:53,620
This kind of doesn't surprise me that like Billy Graham was like,

2438
01:58:53,620 --> 01:58:56,340
all right, you gotta have a little more pizzazz.

2439
01:58:56,980 --> 01:58:58,260
We have a stage director.

2440
01:58:58,260 --> 01:59:00,420
You think Billy Graham's influence got the sexier song into the show?

2441
01:59:00,420 --> 01:59:09,380
I think a tent revivalist, I think like a guy who grifts a lot of money on a touring ministry

2442
01:59:09,380 --> 01:59:12,740
probably at least had a director and a lighting guy.

2443
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:15,140
You know, I'll say this.

2444
01:59:15,140 --> 01:59:22,580
I don't know when they joined the tour, but the stage, it looked the same in the early one I saw.

2445
01:59:23,300 --> 01:59:25,940
But the only difference I think is this is a look, let's be honest,

2446
01:59:26,740 --> 01:59:28,420
this song is a sexy song.

2447
01:59:28,420 --> 01:59:30,740
Yeah, could have been the influence of Billy Graham.

2448
01:59:30,740 --> 01:59:32,580
Could have been the sexy influence of Billy Graham.

2449
01:59:33,940 --> 01:59:37,780
How do we hide it without, you have the sex without saying sex.

2450
01:59:37,780 --> 01:59:38,280
Yeah.

2451
01:59:38,660 --> 01:59:44,180
And Rapscallion P. Sinister was the sexiest character in Bibleman.

2452
01:59:44,180 --> 01:59:45,540
But what is the message here?

2453
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:53,540
In all this time, now where they've landed is that the boring vanilla stuff that

2454
01:59:54,260 --> 01:59:57,220
Bibleman does that we're supposed to root for that.

2455
01:59:57,220 --> 02:00:01,620
But then finally, there's a halfway decent, halfway sexy piece of music.

2456
02:00:01,620 --> 02:00:03,460
And right from one of the minions of Satan.

2457
02:00:04,020 --> 02:00:04,660
Right.

2458
02:00:04,660 --> 02:00:06,580
That's what they're confused, I guess.

2459
02:00:06,580 --> 02:00:13,540
Do you think this song was an awakening for any, did it like shake anyone out of their bubble

2460
02:00:13,540 --> 02:00:14,580
and their stupor?

2461
02:00:14,580 --> 02:00:15,940
I want to be Rapscallion.

2462
02:00:17,620 --> 02:00:22,740
Yeah, I had to have, I think the groove in that song is undeniable.

2463
02:00:22,740 --> 02:00:30,420
There's probably like a young person, man or woman who saw this performance and went home

2464
02:00:31,060 --> 02:00:39,780
and did their first act of self-pleasure inspired by this performance at the age of 27.

2465
02:00:42,340 --> 02:00:44,420
And a whole world opened up for them.

2466
02:00:44,420 --> 02:00:44,980
Uh-huh.

2467
02:00:44,980 --> 02:00:47,700
Yeah, and they Rapscallion P. Sinister to thank.

2468
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:48,200
Yeah.

2469
02:00:50,980 --> 02:00:51,480
Wow.

2470
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:52,200
Yeah.

2471
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:53,720
That song, I'm glad you found that.

2472
02:00:53,720 --> 02:00:57,640
I felt like I was coming up empty in the live performance.

2473
02:00:57,640 --> 02:01:00,200
Like, live clips were slurring for me.

2474
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:03,560
Yeah, there's like only two or three songs if you're lucky in these performances.

2475
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:06,040
So you really got to like find them.

2476
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:08,440
You have to hang in there to find.

2477
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:12,280
Because I'm sure, I'm sure if they changed this much, I'm sure there's a lot of different

2478
02:01:12,280 --> 02:01:13,400
things I've missed already.

2479
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:17,640
Well, the one bit of dumpster diving, I was happy.

2480
02:01:17,640 --> 02:01:20,760
I really, I thought live was just an area that was not working.

2481
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:22,280
So I'm really glad you found that.

2482
02:01:22,280 --> 02:01:27,640
But then today I finally found a live video that gave me what I wanted,

2483
02:01:27,640 --> 02:01:31,880
which was a little bit of like, it had Willie Ames talking to you at the beginning and

2484
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:35,080
talking about, you know, putting the show together.

2485
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:39,960
And that's the one where he weirdly says, we're not going to be doing it as much anymore.

2486
02:01:40,680 --> 02:01:44,280
It's not because I'm not handsome, as you can see.

2487
02:01:44,280 --> 02:01:46,920
I'm, I'm magnificent.

2488
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:51,640
But, but anyway, this is it's not so much about what happens in the show.

2489
02:01:52,360 --> 02:01:56,120
It's there's all this weird stuff at the beginning, kind of showing the influence

2490
02:01:56,120 --> 02:02:00,360
of the Bible man live enterprise, which has now been running for, you know, maybe seven years.

2491
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:05,640
And the first thing is that you see it's confusing what's happening, but Willie Ames

2492
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:08,360
is getting a tour of a spaceship.

2493
02:02:09,320 --> 02:02:10,200
What's happening?

2494
02:02:10,200 --> 02:02:11,560
They don't explain what it is.

2495
02:02:11,560 --> 02:02:15,880
It's just like a minister talking and it takes you a minute to put it all together.

2496
02:02:15,880 --> 02:02:20,040
And for the guy to say, well, you know, and he's a minister in Sarasota, Florida.

2497
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:26,280
And he says, you know, we had, we had the Bible man show come to Sarasota and, you know,

2498
02:02:26,280 --> 02:02:27,880
it was the most exciting day in our parish.

2499
02:02:27,880 --> 02:02:31,880
And, you know, we saw that the way the kids were paying attention, you know, they were just,

2500
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:35,080
they were at attention much more so than in a regular service.

2501
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:37,560
And they were looking at those lasers and looking at the lights.

2502
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:42,520
So that's why we set up the new youth mass center.

2503
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:47,640
And what that is is just, they just took a room and put a big spaceship in it and filled it with

2504
02:02:47,640 --> 02:02:53,480
lasers. So that's where the kids get to go to church now, which I say that's, that is a plus.

2505
02:02:53,480 --> 02:02:58,120
You know, we were getting a little confused here, but if that was me, I was a church going kid.

2506
02:02:58,120 --> 02:03:04,760
If suddenly, if I'm going to Sunday service for the thousandth time and oh boy, all right, well,

2507
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:05,800
see how I can keep this.

2508
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:08,040
Uh, actually we're going to a different room.

2509
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:11,480
I'd be thrilled.

2510
02:03:11,960 --> 02:03:16,200
Yeah. I feel like this is, this is always when I'm looking at like Christian entertainment,

2511
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:22,280
you're like, I was entertained by only like something that was three times better than this,

2512
02:03:22,840 --> 02:03:27,080
like two is 15% better than this. Yeah. It doesn't take much. It doesn't take much.

2513
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:30,280
I mean, if power Rangers, which, you know, there's something to power Rangers and the designs are

2514
02:03:30,280 --> 02:03:35,000
cool, but if you watch the show, obviously it's not sophisticated, but if power Rangers and ended

2515
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:39,400
with like Zordon going in, remember study your Bible or whatever, I'd be like, yeah, I guess I

2516
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:45,320
should. This show is awesome. So the universal empathy or commit yourself to Christ. Right. I

2517
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:50,040
go with Pink Ranger standing by because you'd go, you get so excited to be part of like a fan club

2518
02:03:50,040 --> 02:03:55,240
or if they said send a, like a postcard in, it wouldn't have taken that much. But for some reason,

2519
02:03:55,240 --> 02:04:00,680
like anything I've ever seen this Christian entertainment, you go, this is not watchable.

2520
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:05,000
This is kind of sending or this is cheap for this is not entertaining. Yeah.

2521
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:11,240
And for the most part, this is, but there's, there's fleeting moments. There's fleeting

2522
02:04:11,240 --> 02:04:17,320
within the Bible. And I guess in the, like on this scale, it clear, look at that, like it inspired

2523
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:23,400
a laser space church for kids and Sarah's Florida. That must've been like such a, a huge

2524
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:29,000
boost to morale. Oh yeah. If you're a young person in that town and clearly it had a huge effect all

2525
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:35,800
over Florida because the next thing it cuts to is Bible man getting a special letter of

2526
02:04:35,800 --> 02:04:41,720
commendation, like a plaque or something, some honor from the mayor of Tallahassee,

2527
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:49,000
who is just, you know, ravishing praise on, on Willie Ames and the Bible man and then Willie

2528
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:54,280
is holding a Bible man mask and he gives it to the mayor of Tallahassee. So it's this wonderful

2529
02:04:54,280 --> 02:05:00,200
exchange. Spirits are very high. And I was like, I wonder if I can find out who this

2530
02:05:00,200 --> 02:05:08,680
mayor of Tallahassee, Florida was. Look it up. And one of the quickest

2531
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:17,240
Wikipedia justifications of search I've ever seen the guy's name, Scott Maddox. Compare the photos.

2532
02:05:17,240 --> 02:05:23,000
That's him. Ah, what's this? Not even deep into the Wikipedia. Scott Maddox was indicted on

2533
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:30,280
December 12th, 2018 on 44 charges, including racketeering, bribery, extortion, bank fraud,

2534
02:05:30,280 --> 02:05:36,280
and wire fraud in an FBI investigation into corruption that played a key role in Democrat

2535
02:05:36,280 --> 02:05:40,840
Andrew Gillum's campaign for Florida governor. Uh, he, at this point he was some other position

2536
02:05:40,840 --> 02:05:47,000
in Tallahassee by then. Uh, he basically was like taking bribes from companies that wanted to change

2537
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:54,600
the rules in Florida. Like he, this guy got 40 grand from Uber personally. Wow. Um, and so he got

2538
02:05:54,600 --> 02:06:01,240
in trouble and his girlfriend got in trouble and this man is today in jail. Okay. He's serving out

2539
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:07,320
a five year sentence. His girlfriend's serving out maybe could be wrapping up a two. Um, so in his

2540
02:06:07,320 --> 02:06:12,040
personal effects that they take before you go into jail, a Bible man mask might be sitting in this.

2541
02:06:12,040 --> 02:06:16,040
It could be in an evidence locker. It could be an evidence locker as well. But what do you have to

2542
02:06:16,040 --> 02:06:20,600
say about this? No, please. No, you can take anything you want from me. Uh, you can lock up

2543
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:28,520
my girlfriend for life for all I care, but do not take the Bible man cowl. That was from Willie Ames.

2544
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:33,480
Do you understand? You're lucky I didn't have a 12 gauge shotgun today. FBI came to my door.

2545
02:06:35,320 --> 02:06:42,680
Celebrity fit clubs, Willie Ames. That's right. Show some mercy. Oh my God. A celebrity fit club

2546
02:06:42,680 --> 02:06:51,880
fan is all of us are please let me go. Oh, sad. Yeah. So the one politician I ever saw Bible man

2547
02:06:52,840 --> 02:06:59,240
interacting with is in jail. All right. So, you know, he hung out with good folks,

2548
02:06:59,960 --> 02:07:06,040
like rapscallion, you know, fun villains and real life villains. Yeah. Um, you know, he had a,

2549
02:07:06,120 --> 02:07:12,760
he had a blaze ride came to an end with, I guess, after some sputter of a not very good cartoon,

2550
02:07:12,760 --> 02:07:20,280
seemingly. Yeah, I, well, the cartoon's a little unfortunate just by sheer nature of it being

2551
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:26,680
animated. It's slightly more dynamic. Uh, but like some of the stuff is kind of what, like here's the

2552
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:31,640
fiddler in the cartoon. It's just wearing a domino mask and that's like green hair. Boring video

2553
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:36,600
game cut scene. That bad one too. There was a video game also. That looks like, oh, right. Oh,

2554
02:07:36,600 --> 02:07:42,280
cool. Um, the, the animation in the cartoon reminds me, uh, I tried to explain this recently,

2555
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:50,440
I think on the show, but it reminds me of this, like stuff. This is probably ancient history on

2556
02:07:50,440 --> 02:07:58,200
the internet. This is just chickens walking into like a waterfall. And then this was all, um,

2557
02:07:58,200 --> 02:08:03,800
um, like six or seven years ago, it starts to pop off in a second. Thank God.

2558
02:08:05,160 --> 02:08:09,080
And then they come out as crocodiles and techno music plays. I've never seen this.

2559
02:08:09,960 --> 02:08:14,760
This is so this would play to my toddler to this day. Well, since got the link. Yeah. Well,

2560
02:08:14,760 --> 02:08:20,520
this was a thing a few years ago, someone found like, there were all of these just warehouses

2561
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:27,400
full of people with computers, just generating weird CGI cartoon or where it's like cartoons,

2562
02:08:27,400 --> 02:08:33,640
where like a CG Shrek and a spider man would switch bottom half. Oh, I've seen stuff. I've

2563
02:08:33,640 --> 02:08:39,800
seen stuff like that. It was all just gaming the, uh, YouTube ad revenue. It was all gaming, uh,

2564
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:45,640
like ad revenues and algorithms and stuff. Yeah. And it was just people being paid pennies on the

2565
02:08:45,640 --> 02:08:53,240
dollar to like generate this stuff. That is the aesthetic of the Bible man cartoon. And that's,

2566
02:08:53,480 --> 02:08:59,320
like, look, there's an excuse if it's made by bots, but yeah. I, what, what did the,

2567
02:08:59,320 --> 02:09:05,400
what did the Bible man folks have? The episode I watched was about like a father and son going to

2568
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:14,200
like, uh, visit another son in a juvenile detention center. And then the doubter, I think is the

2569
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:20,200
villain's name. Like he makes them all forget their Bibles and Bible man and cipher don't know.

2570
02:09:20,200 --> 02:09:26,840
They're like, why do you all seem so out of it? And then they save the day and the kid saves the

2571
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:34,440
day. But it's also like saying some weird, had some weird lines about a juvie. And it's just like,

2572
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:36,040
this is kind of a bummer.

2573
02:09:38,360 --> 02:09:45,240
Well, Bible man found time to be a bummer. I think a lot of the time, uh, um, there reminded me of my

2574
02:09:45,240 --> 02:09:51,400
favorite episode description, which is that there's one where the story is that, um, uh, a kid is

2575
02:09:51,400 --> 02:09:57,000
going to make a comic book of Bible man. And he's, he's licensed this like a real publisher is going

2576
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:02,280
to do it. And Bible man is overseeing the art of his own comic book. And he keeps giving the note

2577
02:10:02,280 --> 02:10:08,120
that he looks too good and exciting, which distracts from the real point, which is God.

2578
02:10:08,120 --> 02:10:08,840
Right. Right.

2579
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:10,360
So the better you make me look,

2580
02:10:11,160 --> 02:10:18,520
there, there's very Bible man notes down Bible man waters down comic art.

2581
02:10:19,160 --> 02:10:25,080
There's very confusing stuff. Uh, there, there's multiple episodes. I feel like about like anger,

2582
02:10:25,080 --> 02:10:30,440
like Furiosa, like don't give into your anger. And it's like, okay, well, how do you teach that

2583
02:10:30,440 --> 02:10:35,560
kid to deal with anger, deal with the negative emotion stuff, read your Bible. And it's like,

2584
02:10:35,560 --> 02:10:37,480
God damn it. Like, what are you doing?

2585
02:10:37,480 --> 02:10:39,240
G G. Damn it.

2586
02:10:39,240 --> 02:10:44,280
Oh, G D. Damn it. They don't even like that. And G apostrophe D.

2587
02:10:44,280 --> 02:10:45,000
They don't.

2588
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:50,840
An apostrophe is just a, it's a false O. So we object to it not due to the censorship,

2589
02:10:50,840 --> 02:10:54,440
but because it's lying, it's all apostrophes are liars.

2590
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:58,040
If you use a hyphen too, like don't use a hyphen instead of an O.

2591
02:10:58,600 --> 02:11:02,280
All the weird symbols, the hashtag and the symbol.

2592
02:11:03,160 --> 02:11:04,200
Godless symbols.

2593
02:11:04,200 --> 02:11:05,560
Impostors.

2594
02:11:05,560 --> 02:11:08,600
Every bit as big of an imposter is Fibler himself.

2595
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:14,680
They hate the comic strips where like Snoopy stubs his toe and jumps up and it's just a bunch

2596
02:11:14,680 --> 02:11:21,880
of punctuation marks and a word balloon. Snoopy should have calmed down,

2597
02:11:21,880 --> 02:11:24,200
said a brief prayer and then fetched his Bible.

2598
02:11:25,720 --> 02:11:32,360
This here is a screen grab. This is a preview image on the, uh, scraping the sultan singing

2599
02:11:32,360 --> 02:11:37,560
stickers of selfishness episode. That is a kid with a weird head. Like I don't even know what.

2600
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:42,520
No, that show, I tried to watch that cartoon and it's, it's awful.

2601
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:43,000
It sucks.

2602
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:43,800
It's unwatchable.

2603
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:49,320
It's no live action Bible man, which again to reiterate is one of the worst series ever produced.

2604
02:11:49,320 --> 02:11:53,720
It's so interesting and unexciting. Uh, Bible, you can get Bible man mini figures,

2605
02:11:53,720 --> 02:11:59,240
like Lego knockoff figures, which kind of I'm tempted to get. Like you, cause it's a,

2606
02:11:59,240 --> 02:12:03,000
I don't know if you've seen these, uh, they're like blind bags. They'll have like Muppet Legos

2607
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:07,800
and Batman when the Batman, uh, Lego movie came out and it's like, you don't know what's in it

2608
02:12:07,800 --> 02:12:11,400
cause it's called a blind bag, but that's the same they're doing this year. And it's,

2609
02:12:11,400 --> 02:12:16,120
it's certainly not Lego making the Bible man, but they look exactly like, uh, Lego.

2610
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:23,800
And you can get Bible man, Bible girl, cipher, melody, Baroness crusher, Dr. Feel, Luxor Spondreth,

2611
02:12:23,800 --> 02:12:31,640
master of mean, the Ronin of wrong or the mayor of maybe. So, and then there is one

2612
02:12:31,640 --> 02:12:35,000
chase figure that they don't say, and it's just got a question mark. So that's a, that could be a

2613
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:39,320
mayor of me. Maybe it's indecisive.

2614
02:12:39,320 --> 02:12:44,040
Maybe it's non-committal. You either commit your heart to Christ or you don't. And every time

2615
02:12:44,040 --> 02:12:49,880
you're indecisive about everything, it reminds you, you can be indecisive about your heart as

2616
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:56,200
well. So we don't, maybe is, is the filthy word. I'm on the parasource.com website,

2617
02:12:56,200 --> 02:12:59,960
which is serving Canada's Christian community. They're the ones selling the Bible man. I'm gonna

2618
02:12:59,960 --> 02:13:05,080
see if I can find a coupon code and get us. Well, I would say whatever you, even with a discount,

2619
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:11,960
even if you only end up paying like four 53, $4 53 cents, just make sure you give the four 53

2620
02:13:12,760 --> 02:13:18,840
also to a cause that Bible man and all these people would hate. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2621
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:24,520
Just, which is, you know, it could be certainly something drag affiliated at the moment. Yeah.

2622
02:13:24,520 --> 02:13:29,960
But by Bible man standards, you could just send it to the Webster people, send it to the makers

2623
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:35,400
of those evil dictionaries. Right. Yeah. Dear Warner brothers, this is to help you out.

2624
02:13:36,280 --> 02:13:43,320
I'm sorry for these mini figs I bought. I hope that's by a safe. So your child

2625
02:13:43,960 --> 02:13:48,040
doesn't get anywhere near some of the stuff we've acquired for this show.

2626
02:13:48,120 --> 02:13:50,600
Like the Trump playing cards you gave me, the curse. Oh yeah.

2627
02:13:50,600 --> 02:13:56,040
The Trump thing I find every three months and I go, oh, when I find the cards you got,

2628
02:13:56,040 --> 02:13:58,520
you got these like, what do they call it? When they punch a hole through them?

2629
02:13:58,520 --> 02:14:02,360
The casino car, like that casinos used to a lot more.

2630
02:14:02,360 --> 02:14:06,280
Decks or something. Yeah. They would sell it like in the souvenir shop.

2631
02:14:06,280 --> 02:14:11,560
We did casino implosions episode. Jason got us Trump casino playing cards and I find them every

2632
02:14:11,560 --> 02:14:16,840
three months and I go, ah, like as if I found like a demon and a demon in my drawer. I think I gave

2633
02:14:16,840 --> 02:14:22,200
some, maybe I gave Eva or maybe I lost the auction for like the button that says it's lies.

2634
02:14:22,200 --> 02:14:26,760
Like Eliza Minnelli opening our one person show for a week at Trump Plaza.

2635
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:32,440
Oh wow. Well, say what you want about Mr. Trump, but he's never indecisive.

2636
02:14:33,320 --> 02:14:36,520
When he was president of America, he was no mayor of maybe.

2637
02:14:38,600 --> 02:14:43,000
Well, yeah, yeah, we can agree on that. What the fuck else about Bible man? I mean,

2638
02:14:43,080 --> 02:14:47,640
that's that's plenty. Yeah, I'm worn down. Listener, if you're curious to check out more

2639
02:14:47,640 --> 02:14:55,240
Bible man, don't it will make you so sleepy. This was here's two things that happened in my

2640
02:14:55,240 --> 02:15:02,440
prep for this episode. One, uh, Aaron at some point was like, we're supposed to go out later

2641
02:15:02,440 --> 02:15:06,280
and we're deciding who was going to drive. And she's like, uh, I feel like maybe I should drive

2642
02:15:06,280 --> 02:15:11,800
because you look really tired. Like you, you clearly are tired as shit. And I had gotten

2643
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:16,760
plenty of sleep the night before and I was like, I think you're right. It's a Bible man

2644
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:21,240
watching all this Bible man is doing it to me. And then I immediately went and took a really hard

2645
02:15:21,240 --> 02:15:27,000
nap, the hardest nap. Uh, and then this morning I had a little bit, I said like, I gotta go. I have

2646
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:30,840
to do a little bit more, uh, Bible man. And she, and by then she's like, you have to make me a

2647
02:15:30,840 --> 02:15:36,360
promise that you will not watch any more clips of the show. I don't like who it's turning you into.

2648
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:41,560
I think your brain is not as sharp. She would probably pass along the same message to you.

2649
02:15:41,560 --> 02:15:47,800
The listener, uh, we look, we like your sharp minds out there. We got good listeners and it'll

2650
02:15:47,800 --> 02:15:54,360
only, it'll only dull your blades to be much less sharp than the blades of the sort of, uh,

2651
02:15:56,440 --> 02:16:00,200
see, look, I couldn't remember the name of it. That's how bad my mind is now.

2652
02:16:00,200 --> 02:16:05,320
Is that salvation? It was, I think it was spirit. The sort of, no, is the breast, the salve, no,

2653
02:16:05,320 --> 02:16:12,120
it was the, the, uh, the cuff links of salvation. Um, it was the, the, the brass knuckles of,

2654
02:16:12,120 --> 02:16:19,320
of fortitude. It was the pinky ring of remembering dot Christ died for your sins.

2655
02:16:21,800 --> 02:16:27,240
Wow. Uh, do you feel the same recommend Bible man? I, well, I'll, speaking of exhaust,

2656
02:16:27,240 --> 02:16:31,960
I've been tired just in general, but today is the, by far I've been the most tired doing the show

2657
02:16:31,960 --> 02:16:35,960
and I've been like out of sorts. I was really late to the last record because I was so out of it.

2658
02:16:35,960 --> 02:16:40,120
I feel worse today. Wow. And I think it has something to do with Bible man.

2659
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:45,640
Geez. Well, it seems like a good reason to and well, but well, is it Bible man doing it to us

2660
02:16:45,640 --> 02:16:52,040
or are we all just giving in to the lizard of laziness, the Sultan of sloth?

2661
02:16:53,880 --> 02:16:59,480
Very good point. Something to consider whenever you're not being your greatest self, keep it might

2664
02:17:12,040 --> 02:17:17,400
uh, serving the church and not your community or your fellow man. Yeah. Yeah. If you're out there

2665

2666
02:17:23,960 --> 02:17:28,600
