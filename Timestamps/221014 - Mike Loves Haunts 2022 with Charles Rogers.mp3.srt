1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Warning! The following haunt cast is a dark journey into this year's SoCal Haunts.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Not Scary Farm, Universal's Halloween Horror Nights, and Six Flags' big old teenage fog suck.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But we also journey into the psyche of our own Mike Carlson.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Why does he love douchey Vegas fool parties? Is he a fast boy?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Search Party creator Charles Rogers joins our psychic evaluation.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But one fact is unimpeachable.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Mike loves haunts on Haunt Cast the Fright.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Welcome to Haunt Cast the Fright, the Scream Park Podcast where the three ghost hosts delight in saying the names of obscure, scare actors from the 1960s.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm Spike, bro-blurl blood-ridson.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Joining me as always, Jason Skeleton.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hi, you were an alien until whatever br-br-br-son.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Was that on purpose? Was that part of it?

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It wasn't really on purpose. I wrote it down and as I was reading it I went, I didn't say this out loud.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You wanted to do kind of a take two just to let people know how it was in your head?

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I guess I should have said Spike like blood-ridson or something.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I should have kind of grumbled it or growled it like a monster.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You know what I'm saying?

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This is the voice of, what was yours?

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This year I'm trying out Scott Gravedigner.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But anyone can veto that.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
No, I'm aware of it right now.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
If one person says they don't like it then it's out.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah, no, I'm good with that.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
All right.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So, no, I guess I feel like I've never found one I like with my last name.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No, not me either in particular.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Jason Skeleton is perfect.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes. Yeah, I like that one a lot.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You're locked in.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You're locked in.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Well, it gives us something to look forward to in the future.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
A reason to keep going.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Let's get up.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Our guys could end this year but we need to get the scary names.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I don't have a fun name for the guest and I'm realizing this.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But we'll bring them in.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We'll figure it out.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We've already done Charles as Gnarls.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But that's a famous band already.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yeah.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He's the co-creator of Search Party until it's deleted off the HBO Max servers by David Zaslow.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But for now he is still the co-creator.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This is Charles Rogers returning to Podcast Arrive.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Thank you for having me.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Charles Lee Ray.

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Is there something there?

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's the Chucky Man.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Is Charles Lee Ray?

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh, interesting.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's good.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I don't know.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Wait, what do you mean the Chucky Man?

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah, the Chucky Man.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The guy, the killer's name is Charles Lee Ray in Chucky.

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Who inhabits the doll.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Who inhabits the doll.

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh, gotcha.

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, that's the real guy.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You're revealing yourself to have never seen Chucky.

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's one of those scared the hell out of me as a kid.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The idea of it.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The very notion of it.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And my wife had an old thing with it where she wouldn't watch trailers at all until she was 12 years old.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Because she mistakenly saw Child's Play 2, the trailer, and a theater.

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So she had to go to every movie late for many, many years.

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So it's a scary name to invoke in this house, but not the murderer's name who I don't.

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So you could be Charles Lee Ray-gers to tie it into.

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That's good.

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's impeccable.

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Great, great.

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It might be the best.

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You plunk it up a little more and then it becomes.

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's the best of all three of these, or all four of these.

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's foolproof.

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So yeah, we're in the holiday spirit here.

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I guess you would say holiday spirit.

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm Christmas.

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What are you?

86
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Thanksgiving?

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Thanksgiving, yeah.

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Cool.

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Jason?

90
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Our birthday?

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yeah.

92
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We need that more now than ever.

93
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's right, Charles.

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You got it.

95
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Columbus Day.

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't care.

97
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Oh, no.

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh, my goodness.

99
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
All right.

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Everybody listen.

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I got some stuff to eat.

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Just an episode of Gutfeld.

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Oh, man.

104
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
No, it's a soprano.

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He's taking more of like a Silvio and Polly Walnut's angle on like, got to protect Columbus

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Day.

107
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's a bad tradition.

109
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah, it's about Italians.

110
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
My Italian roots.

111
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah.

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,280
And we're going to get to the Soquel haunts, of course, because it's haunters of fright

113
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,000
and the spirits are out and we're loving the season.

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Mike loves haunts.

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And I love haunts.

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's why we're here.

117
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,760
Last year, Mike loves haunts with a question mark because I didn't escape.

118
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,000
I didn't do an escape room involving a minotaur.

119
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,560
Now, I wish I had a report to tell everyone that I have done the minotaur.

120
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,240
I've conquered it because I had a panic attack last year, putting on a mask in this whole

121
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,240
thing.

122
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,400
And like, I just couldn't.

123
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,240
My brain melted down before we started.

124
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,900
It wasn't because of the scary man in the minotaur outfit, which I said on the episode

125
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,840
once the lights were on, looked like shit.

126
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,840
Not the case.

127
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,840
I was afraid of it.

128
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,800
But I was just like, I sort of had a panic, like sort of a mask panic and like claustrophobia

129
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,560
panic and I sat out, I tapped out in front of everybody, humiliating.

130
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,560
I haven't been this humiliated in like since high school.

131
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,520
People you respect and admire, I feel.

132
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,520
Sure.

133
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,520
Yeah, of course.

134
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,920
We had friends and I don't know why I'm reminding you.

135
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,720
No one's invited me to anything since.

136
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,720
I look like a fool.

137
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
Industry execs.

138
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,320
People who have given you jobs.

139
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,400
Yeah, David Zaslav was in your room.

140
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
He was there.

141
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,080
I'll give you the never delete deal right now for any shows that you ever pitched.

142
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,680
Yeah, he was there, but I know I made a fool of myself.

143
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,760
And anyway, I have not conquered the minotaur yet.

144
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,880
It's not going to be this year.

145
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,100
I'm trying not to give a baby COVID.

146
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,160
That's really what the mission is right now.

147
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,440
So I probably shouldn't be in an escape room trying to conquer a minotaur.

148
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,720
But running through a haunted house is fine.

149
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
And you had a mask on.

150
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Yes, exactly.

151
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,720
With a mask on.

152
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,360
I had a gator on over the mask.

153
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
Ran through that thing.

154
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
I barely breathed while I was in there.

155
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
I didn't see you breathe once.

156
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Yeah, so you're in the clear.

157
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,320
Wow.

158
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
And then we're fine.

159
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
You did it right.

160
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,080
Well, so what is being proven here is that you love haunts.

161
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,480
And so you fought through that you're very busy.

162
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,000
You're very sleep deprived.

163
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That's true.

164
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,280
You still went to do the haunts that you love as of two years ago, I think.

165
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,440
Now Jason and I have made no, I don't want to say we've made no progress because I think

166
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,000
maybe we don't have interest in making progress.

167
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,560
Well, I've been watching more scary movies.

168
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:52,640
Scott is at least steadfast in his feeling that he's never going to do any of this.

169
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:58,960
Jason, I won't say lies to me every year, but definitely sort of suggests.

170
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,960
I don't lie to you.

171
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,720
This year I told you I was like, oh, my knee has gotten a lot more flexible, a lot looser

172
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,880
lately, but it's still kind of uncomfortable, long walking.

173
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,880
That's true.

174
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,520
And crowds are not ideal.

175
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,800
It kind of is an anxiety source walking around in crowds.

176
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,360
But I understand working on it.

177
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,920
I have sympathy for that as well.

178
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
But I did.

179
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,360
I said, you know, you do one maze and then you can go on that rat, the log ride, a timber

180
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,120
mountain log ride with the famous band that we like, the Calico Creepers.

181
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,120
It was amazing.

182
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
Yes.

183
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
Mike took me on that for the first time.

184
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,120
I had never been on that before.

185
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,120
Yeah.

186
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,120
Oh, geez.

187
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,120
So great.

188
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,120
I've been to not very scary farm before, but never done the Calico.

189
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,120
Wait, is that what it's called?

190
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,120
Calico Mine Train?

191
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,720
No, that was the it's a timber mountain log ride.

192
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
We're getting there.

193
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,680
So, Jason, you're saying you're watching movies now to prepare yourself for next year.

194
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
Yes.

195
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,680
What are you watching?

196
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,600
I watched Get Out last week.

197
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,240
I couldn't remember I had ever seen it all the way through.

198
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,480
It was very good.

199
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,880
I watched it a few days after Pinocchio and a few days before The Munsters.

200
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,560
So it was like an oasis in the desert, basically.

201
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,520
Well, well made movie directed, written, acted.

202
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,520
And then the others.

203
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
Some others.

204
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,520
Yeah, I saw The Munsters.

205
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,400
Well, I saw the first 15 minutes of The Munsters as a joke.

206
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,280
And then we were like, we actually can't do this.

207
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,280
And then we fast forwarded to Elvira.

208
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,280
Oh, yeah.

209
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,280
That's the end of the movie.

210
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
And then we were like, let's watch the credits.

211
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,000
That's what I should have done.

212
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,040
Yeah, we covered it on the Patreon.

213
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,400
And I tapped out at 38 minutes.

214
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,320
Some people have expressed dislike of this.

215
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
Some people are upset with you.

216
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Yeah, I think.

217
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
It feels insane to me.

218
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,480
Some people sent us messages of like, that you shouldn't get the money from the Patreon.

219
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,480
Somebody said that.

220
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,480
You shouldn't get.

221
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,480
Jason, I should take all the money.

222
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
That's an interesting idea.

223
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,480
No, hang on a minute.

224
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,480
Oh, well now.

225
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,640
There is no deal in place that says that the name of the episode, Being a Movie, requires

226
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,400
all three hosts to finish the movie.

227
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,000
Charles is not a witness, but you can second that it's a very difficult thing to get through.

228
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Don't bring me into any of this shit.

229
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,880
I don't know who these people are that are coming for you.

230
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,880
I don't know who their parents are.

231
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
Well, all right.

232
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,680
Well, you know, I'm just going to get into the bank account right now and cash out before

233
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,280
this shit goes any further.

234
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,840
When I have COVID, you're like, no cash, no cash.

235
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,360
Like, if you ain't on some episodes, you don't see that green.

236
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
No cash, no cash.

237
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,080
No cash, no cash.

238
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,080
I rushed.

239
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,080
How many can we record before Jason's back?

240
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,840
I dock your pay sometimes when you don't say as much as I do on an episode.

241
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,120
I count you by the word.

242
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,760
I always worry I talk too much.

243
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,760
So that is a confusing statement to me.

244
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
I don't know.

245
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,760
I don't know that you talk too much on the show.

246
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,760
I think you leave people wanting more.

247
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
Yeah, I agree.

248
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,960
Oh, you always got to leave them wanting more.

249
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
Thank you, Charles.

250
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,560
You gave me such nice compliments the last time you were on.

251
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,160
You've talked a little too much just to let you know right now.

252
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,160
Oh, OK.

253
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,160
You were just there.

254
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
You were in the pocket.

255
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
See?

256
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,160
Learn.

257
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,160
I did.

258
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
I gave you all really nice compliments last time.

259
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,160
Yeah.

260
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,160
Mixed up your news.

261
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,120
Yeah, well, so speaking of last time, I just want to talk about this real quick.

262
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,800
You gave us a very nice gift.

263
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:21,160
All three of us received a copy of a prequel novel about the character Claire Dearing from

264
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,960
Jurassic World, a thick hardcover book.

265
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,960
Something studied in colleges.

266
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Yeah, this is.

267
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,960
And we all got our own copy.

268
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,960
We each got our own copy of it.

269
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,960
Amazing.

270
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,960
Three of us are bad.

271
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,960
Well, two of us are bad readers.

272
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,560
Scott and I are bad readers.

273
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,360
Jason's actually the best reader of the three of us.

274
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,360
And I'm a pretty slow reader.

275
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
And he's a slow reader.

276
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,360
But I needed to at least peruse this before you came back.

277
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,360
And just have you read?

278
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
Can I ask if you've read it?

279
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,360
I have.

280
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,560
I was just being the teacher, not the student.

281
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,560
You'll read Cliff Notes before you have to admit to the test.

282
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,160
Yeah, and I did not read every word.

283
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,240
I will say that.

284
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,080
But this is a story about Claire Dearing, Bryce Dallas Howard from the Jurassic World

285
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,080
series.

286
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
It's about her internship.

287
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,080
It's written by her.

288
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,080
Yeah, from her perspective.

289
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,080
Yeah.

290
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
So she was like a very.

291
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
It's a go rascalis.

292
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,080
Where was it?

293
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,800
There's a woman behind the woman.

294
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,800
Exactly.

295
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
I hope it turns out better for Claire.

296
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,800
I mean, it doesn't because dinosaurs are after her eventually.

297
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Well, it's an age old American debate.

298
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Would you rather be on tons of drugs that scare you or dinosaurs chase you?

299
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,360
I'm just going to give a real quick, quick like book report about it.

300
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,800
Claire is an idealistic, like wanting to save the planet type.

301
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,080
Over the course of the book, she's kind of turned cold into the cold businesswoman we

302
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,480
know Claire Dearing.

303
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,480
You remember how she is in the movies.

304
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,480
Yeah, all white heels that click clack really loud.

305
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,480
That's what a cold person wears.

306
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,480
Yeah.

307
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,480
So for her nephews.

308
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,480
I think that's right.

309
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,480
If you're not close to your nephew, someone's fucked up about you.

310
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,480
Yeah.

311
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,480
And that family should be mad at an aunt who pays for nephews to go to an island and then

312
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,160
for them because she has a job.

313
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:24,160
Because now you learn that her like her love, another intern, and I'm forgetting his name

314
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,160
already.

315
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,160
He is killed.

316
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,000
There's some sort of nonsense with like a raptor that comes onto the island and he's

317
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
killed.

318
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,080
And there's also like a murder mystery of a different intern that is uncovered by Claire

319
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,480
Dearing.

320
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,080
So it's a 400 plus page novel with multiple plots.

321
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,960
Multiple plots, multiple new characters.

322
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,080
There's not even as many.

323
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,040
You would think that the Owen character, the Chris Pratt character, which no, he doesn't

324
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,080
show that they meet for the first time, I believe in Jurassic World.

325
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,560
I don't even believe this is a this was a question last time I asked all three of you.

326
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,680
And I wonder if you know, I don't think there's even a mention of the character, Lowry Crothers.

327
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,680
Right.

328
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,680
Yeah.

329
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,480
Now I have a question for you.

330
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,560
Who is Lowry Crothers?

331
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,880
Does anyone want to answer this?

332
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,960
This is the start of our last episode.

333
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,320
I asked everybody this question.

334
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
Oh, I got it right.

335
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,320
Charles might.

336
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Wow, really?

337
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,320
Oh, we've done this before.

338
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
Lowry Crothers?

339
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
This has happened.

340
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
This has happened.

341
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
We just talked about it.

342
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,520
This has happened before and this will happen again.

343
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,520
We'll say.

344
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,800
We have a term now.

345
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,920
It's five timers.

346
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:34,080
If we've ever told the story more than once, we've ever told it two times, it ends up being

347
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
a five timer.

348
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
Is Lowry Crothers?

349
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
Is that Jake Johnson's?

350
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
Lowry Crothers.

351
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,760
Is that Jake Johnson's character?

352
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,760
That is correct.

353
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
Okay.

354
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,680
We had a faster time than last time because everyone gets wrong.

355
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,680
We had a bunch of different answers.

356
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,520
You asked Charles if it was Scatman Crothers.

357
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,520
Right.

358
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
So that's not who that is.

359
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,520
Scatman Crothers Lowry Crothers.

360
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,520
In the Smothers Brothers reading.

361
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,000
Anyway, that's basically the book.

362
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,040
That's the gist of the book.

363
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,540
It's a 400 page YA novel about Claire.

364
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,540
It's a Claire Dearing mystery.

365
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:11,720
I mean, imagine if the CEO of Pixar's book was about a murder mystery in his own life.

366
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,680
Well, another intern has died mysteriously.

367
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,720
Well, off of that, I do want to say, not to jump the gun, but I do have presents for

368
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
you.

369
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
Oh my gosh.

370
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
Two times running.

371
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,720
Well, because Mike and I went without Scott and Jason.

372
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
Oh my God.

373
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,720
What's wrong with me?

374
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,720
And Jason.

375
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,720
I decided to make it feel like bring the not scary farm to you.

376
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
Wow.

377
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,720
Wow.

378
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
I wonder, is it a jam?

379
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,720
What?

380
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,720
Broad Preserve.

381
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
Wow.

382
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Hey.

383
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,720
Thank you.

384
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,720
Now, this is a, now this is a scary.

385
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
Wait a minute.

386
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,720
Wait a minute.

387
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,720
There's something scary in it.

388
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,600
I was going to say it doesn't look.

389
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
It's not just regular.

390
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,400
There's a scary element inside.

391
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,080
Should this be filmed perhaps?

392
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,360
Is it a bunch of snakes?

393
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,360
The snakes pop out?

394
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,360
Jason, open it up.

395
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,360
There's just like pubes in here.

396
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,840
Well, strawberry.

397
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,840
What's in it?

398
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,960
Got Charles.

399
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
What's in it?

400
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,960
It's terrifying.

401
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,960
Oh, there's a mouse skeleton.

402
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,960
I got an eyeball.

403
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,960
Oh God.

404
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,960
You both have eyeballs or a skeleton?

405
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,960
They were not careful on the farm this week.

406
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,960
Oh my gosh.

407
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,960
Wow.

408
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,960
Oh, and it's dripping.

409
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,960
This is very disturbing.

410
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:36,960
You've given us like the first like in-person surreal, scary image of a mouse skull dripping.

411
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,960
This is what you're missing.

412
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,960
This kind of excitement.

413
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,080
This adventure.

414
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,080
They're not going to sleep for a few nights.

415
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,080
I know.

416
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,080
But you're right.

417
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,080
We have to bring the scares to them.

418
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,280
This is the whole philosophy is that these guys need to be scared constantly in their

419
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,080
own homes from here on out.

420
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,080
I'm scared, but I'm also relieved because I'm almost out of jam.

421
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:04,600
So as long as you sort of trust where the eyeball was before its insertion, you could

422
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,320
kind of take the top slice off in general.

423
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,680
Just go towards the bottom.

424
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,680
Now you're going to do the whole thing.

425
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,680
He doesn't give a shit.

426
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,680
Scott, are you kidding me?

427
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,680
This guy hates soup after me once.

428
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,680
He doesn't care.

429
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,680
I eat Burger King.

430
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,680
Is that true?

431
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,680
Yes.

432
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
He ate a bisque from Disneyland after me.

433
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,680
I don't remember.

434
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
Yeah.

435
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,680
Where were we?

436
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,680
We were at Disneyland and there was like a bisque I was drinking.

437
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,040
And I remember like, did I get two of them accidentally or something?

438
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
Maybe I drank a little bit.

439
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
I was like, I'm full.

440
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
I can't have this.

441
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
And I go, do you want this?

442
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,040
And you're like, yes.

443
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,040
And you started drinking it.

444
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,040
Oh yeah.

445
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,040
Because I want to try the bisque.

446
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,040
I was trying to decide.

447
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,760
Yeah, that's an odd part of bisque.

448
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,760
I guess you would eat soup, eat a bisque.

449
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,760
But it's liquid.

450
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,360
So you do drink it.

451
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,360
In a yard.

452
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,360
You slurp it.

453
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,360
Yeah.

454
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
You got the tall boy.

455
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,760
If you go to Yard House over here in downtown Burbank, you can get a yard of tomato bisque.

456
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,760
On the seasonal menu.

457
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,760
You want a lager, you want a bisque.

458
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,160
Two half of Weissens and a pint of bisque.

459
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,160
For my girlfriend.

460
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,160
Thank you.

461
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,840
This is so great.

462
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,320
You really have horrified the podcast for the first time in this or any of the Octobers.

463
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,120
Because now I'm covered in goo.

464
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,120
I know.

465
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,120
You really went for it.

466
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,120
I'm covered in weird sticky fluid.

467
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,120
You got to lick your fingers.

468
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,120
That's the only solution.

469
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,120
Oh no.

470
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
Yeah.

471
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,120
Mouse goo.

472
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,120
That's gross.

473
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,720
This is great.

474
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,720
You did it successfully.

475
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,160
And this is the sort of thing where maybe in a maze you would end up with something sticky

476
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,560
on you and you just have to imagine what it could be even though hopefully it just preserves.

477
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,280
That's true.

478
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,280
There have been a couple mazes this year where there were sticky things.

479
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,320
Sometimes I feel like it's accidental.

480
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,760
Like it was painted and like the paint shouldn't be the paint they used.

481
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,680
Or those things that you have to like the viney things you have to go through.

482
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,760
They have like a siliconey like then there's something like a little sticky about that.

483
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,760
Yeah.

484
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,760
Yeah.

485
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,760
They use the wrong polymer or something.

486
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,760
Yeah.

487
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,760
Yeah.

488
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,760
That was my favorite maze.

489
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,880
Dr. Polymer.

490
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:07,880
So basically you because Jason we can believe or him or not when it comes to the knees

491
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
and the anxiety.

492
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,880
Well the knees are real.

493
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
It's clear to me so hard.

494
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,600
Well the knees are real and Mike has known me since 2009.

495
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,600
So he's seen the spikes here and there.

496
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,360
I'm just attacking Jason.

497
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
It's Halloween.

498
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,560
I'm just attacking him.

499
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,760
There could be more gooey things all over you.

500
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
You never know.

501
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,560
The people around you are joking in the way that you worry everyone around you actually

502
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,320
thinks about you.

503
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,320
Scariest Halloween of all.

504
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,320
The scariest.

505
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,320
Yeah.

506
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,320
I'm not making any progress on this.

507
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,880
You needed somebody to do a haunt with you.

508
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,720
You needed a haunt.

509
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,720
And you didn't want it to be your tiny daughter.

510
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,720
Yes.

511
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
No.

512
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
Not yet.

513
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
Next year.

514
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,720
Yeah.

515
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,720
Rope her right in.

516
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,720
When she can hold her head up on her own.

517
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,720
That's when the baby.

518
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,920
When she can smile she'll be able to see the brand new smile maze.

519
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
That's right.

520
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,920
Yes.

521
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,920
It's teaching so many babies to smile.

522
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,220
That's right.

523
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,880
You found a fray.

524
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,220
You guys did this trip and I haven't heard anything about it.

525
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,960
So you did not scary farm.

526
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,780
We did not scary farm together.

527
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,780
Yes.

528
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,540
We separately did Halloween Horror Nights.

529
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,840
But yes we did scary farm.

530
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,100
We did it on opening night.

531
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,100
It was very fun.

532
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,100
A very fun time.

533
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,100
I felt very VIP.

534
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,860
I got to be part of the media elite.

535
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,860
Full disclosure.

536
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,940
We were part of the media elite that night.

537
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,900
My friend Bobby who I brought along was not.

538
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,900
Well yes.

539
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:31,060
We felt bad we only had two VIP passes essentially that allowed us access to all the hottest

540
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,500
areas of the park.

541
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,860
And I'm not trying to brag here but you know when you get when you're at the media elite

542
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,140
like we are.

543
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,380
Yeah there's going to be some steam trays set out for you.

544
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:49,060
And yeah you're going to get like as much of those somewhat boiled potatoes as you want.

545
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,580
I had some mac and cheese balls.

546
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,740
And they had an ice luge.

547
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:58,780
Luge that was in the shape of some sort of gremlin thing and then they would pour your

548
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,780
drink down.

549
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,780
Wow.

550
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:06,100
And the drink we agreed if we're allowed to speak disparagingly about the hand that feeds

551
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,100
us.

552
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,940
Well we want to say thank you for all this stuff.

553
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,940
Never mind.

554
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,940
Sorry.

555
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,300
But then we can say the first drink you had I think is where you're going with this right.

556
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:19,300
The first drink you had was maybe the sweetest thing anybody could put in their mouth.

557
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,300
Yeah.

558
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,620
I have since thought about how grateful I am that you knew what I was talking about

559
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:28,980
because there is a smell in LA that's only in LA buildings like interiors that's like

560
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,100
a sweet mildew.

561
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,620
In my mind I'm like it's probably asbestos.

562
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:38,020
But it's all over LA and it's like in if you go to like a meeting on like a lot or like

563
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:44,900
the Gaylord apartments like those old school LA places it's a sweet start clocking in America.

564
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,180
Okay okay.

565
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,940
Which lot what lot smells like this if I ever go on a lot again.

566
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,300
In my mind it's Paramount.

567
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,340
You know it's any place that has the sort of old school 20s.

568
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,340
20s.

569
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,340
Yeah.

570
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,340
Okay okay.

571
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,340
Not some sleek fox situation.

572
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,340
Yeah.

573
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,340
Yeah okay.

574
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,740
It's a very specific almost like mothballs.

575
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,660
But the drink it tasted like that.

576
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,660
Yeah.

577
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,660
That one wasn't as good.

578
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,940
The other ones were good and the beer was good.

579
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,620
I went to this weird tasting event there and I didn't stay around long as I had something

580
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,900
else to do.

581
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:20,300
So I quickly consumed a drink that was a in a syringe like it was kind of like that like

582
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,900
preserves or mouse goo in a syringe and it was unclear.

583
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,540
Well either you could like shoot kind of straight from that or pour it into your drink.

584
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,060
It was this not available.

585
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,540
It's only I have the syringe drink.

586
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,740
This sounds like a bachelorette party or something.

587
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,740
Or a hospital.

588
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,740
Or a syringe.

589
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,740
Or a bachelorette hospital.

590
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,740
Yeah.

591
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,660
Yeah maybe I wanted a sort of covid fugue that I'm not.

592
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:47,540
Sea stripper nurse shooting shots with a syringe into your mouth.

593
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,740
No we didn't see anything like that.

594
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:53,540
No these were the concoctions of a mad scientist you see.

595
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,140
And I kind of liked it for being like a fruity drink.

596
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,140
I didn't I didn't mind.

597
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,140
It was on the sweeter end.

598
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,140
But yeah I don't know.

599
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,140
That was at Knott's Berry Farm?

600
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,140
Yeah.

601
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,140
Was that in the Johnny Rockets?

602
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,140
No.

603
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:08,140
Well we buried the lead because that's where the VIP party was.

604
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,740
We were rocking and rolling.

605
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,740
That's right.

606
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,780
They were not playing rock and roll music though unfortunately.

607
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,780
What?

608
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,540
Mike and I did the Lindy all night long.

609
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,540
Yeah.

610
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:23,060
Despite no rock and roll we were doing it just to try to keep the spirit of the restaurant

611
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,060
alive.

612
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,660
And they weren't serving the regular Johnny Rockets menu sadly.

613
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,460
So that was a bit of a bummer.

614
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,380
I said this and I mean this in the best way.

615
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,060
And we've all been to Knott's events and they're nice enough to have us.

616
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:40,460
Knott's events always feel like your grandma's church is having an event and you're invited.

617
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,580
And there's a lot of stuff there to have and it feels very like home.

618
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,580
Everything feels very homemade.

619
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,580
Does that make sense?

620
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:51,220
The park in general I think feels very like you know homey and quaint.

621
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,220
Yeah.

622
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,220
Like your grandma.

623
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,220
Right.

624
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,220
Like your grandma.

625
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,220
Like your same grandma.

626
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,220
Like my mom's place.

627
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,220
She's very kind.

628
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,220
She owns a lot of roller coasters.

629
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,220
She's an unampeded mean.

630
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,220
She's a billionaire.

631
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,220
She lives in the desert.

632
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,420
I go to Winnapark and I feel like I'm back in Upper Darby.

633
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,420
Yeah.

634
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,220
Yeah so we got to do that.

635
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,620
Full disclosure we got to skip the lines.

636
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:16,620
This is the perk of being theme park journalist podcasters slash influencers.

637
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,620
Yeah geez or just hanging with them.

638
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,620
Boy.

639
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,620
On top of the world.

640
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,620
I know.

641
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,620
Well I've been calling myself a theme park influencer ever since then.

642
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,620
Just keep saying it.

643
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,620
See what doors open.

644
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,620
Door to this garage.

645
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,620
At least that one.

646
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,620
One door could open.

647
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:38,340
Did I have like some sort of swagger in my walk like look at this.

648
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,180
You seem like a cool kid for sure.

649
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,180
Yeah I was.

650
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,900
But like did I feel full of myself a little bit because I was like come on look at this.

651
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,900
Look what we've done.

652
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,900
Oh yeah.

653
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,900
No I was I was.

654
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,900
I was.

655
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,900
How charming was that.

656
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,220
Was that Willy Wonka whisking you around.

657
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,220
Was that what it was like.

658
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,980
It was it was it was incredible.

659
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,980
You were.

660
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,980
Yeah I felt like your child.

661
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,980
Thank you.

662
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,980
All right great.

663
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,980
Wow.

664
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,980
Yeah.

665
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,980
You were a movie star and my dad at the same time.

666
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,980
Okay that's good.

667
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,980
Yeah.

668
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,980
Well I'm very far.

669
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,340
I mean obviously I'm in father mode right now so.

670
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,740
That's probably what it was.

671
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,000
We did we did every maze.

672
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,140
We did every maze which was great.

673
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,140
Not repeats.

674
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,140
Yeah.

675
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,060
Not usually has like one or two new ones and then repeats and then they'll freshen up the

676
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,820
repeats.

677
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:25,840
So so the first time we ever went down to nots we got a behind the scenes tour of the

678
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,620
depths and dark entities.

679
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,620
Yeah.

680
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,100
The lights were on and those are still there.

681
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,060
And those I feel like they last for like fourish years.

682
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,160
So these could be the end of the last year for that.

683
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,160
So you all did that.

684
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,980
Well with the lights on.

685
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,980
Yeah.

686
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,980
Is that weird.

687
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,980
It was fine by me.

688
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,720
All good on my end.

689
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,760
It's like if you walk around the place set with like all the work lights on.

690
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,240
Were they scaring you though or were you just.

691
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,240
Oh no no they were just telling us how they did everything and how stuff worked.

692
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,960
And that's already what 2018.

693
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,960
Yeah.

694
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,960
Yeah.

695
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,960
So that's four years ago.

696
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,840
So so those are like the stalwarts now of the night.

697
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,400
But Charles have you been to you've been to scary from before.

698
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,040
Let's let's let's do this.

699
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,920
Haunt wise history with Haunt.

700
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,920
How long have you been doing them.

701
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,920
Oh man.

702
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,920
I love Haunts.

703
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,400
I've been doing them probably since high school I guess.

704
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,640
But even in high school and junior high my friends and I would set up a haunted house

705
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,440
for trick or treaters to walk through.

706
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,440
Oh wow.

707
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,640
And we would put a lot of effort into it.

708
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,640
So that was it.

709
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,320
So it's been it's been in my blood from day one.

710
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,520
What was do you remember like the haunted house themes or anything you would do.

711
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,920
Well we lived I lived I grew up on the border of Texas and Mexico which is very subtropical

712
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,840
so it's a little like Florida swampy in that way.

713
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,840
It's very wet.

714
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,840
Oh wow.

715
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:51,440
The theme was plants like every year you had to work with the foliage.

716
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,920
But the plants were mutant plants or just we would just sort of like put cobwebs on

717
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:01,280
everything and then jump from behind lots of plants in the house that I had the house

718
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,280
that I grew up in.

719
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,240
There was multiple doors that you had to walk through before you got to the front door.

720
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,320
A lot of opportunity for scaring.

721
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,600
But I think I maybe I told this the last time I was on I can't remember but my number one

722
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:20,680
haunted house story is that in high school I went with my cousins and my mom to a haunted

723
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:26,880
house on the border and they all went into the next room and some scare actors pulled

724
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,240
me back and they pulled me to the ground and they pinned me down and then like more scare

725
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,960
actors came around and they just took my pants off.

726
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,720
I mean you're not supposed to be doing that.

727
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,600
It's an assault is what.

728
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,720
They just kept yes ending that energy until they realized they had crossed the line and

729
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,720
then you could I saw them kind of be like oh and then I just like hoisted my pants up

730
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,920
and like ran out and then my mom was like they took my pants off.

731
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,640
She was like oh no.

732
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,520
They just got so caught up in the and why why you.

733
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,560
Well.

734
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
God.

735
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,880
Look at me.

736
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,480
All right.

737
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:08,840
All right.

738
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,840
I see it.

739
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:10,920
Jesus.

740
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,960
That didn't put you off haunts forever.

741
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,840
No maybe it fueled my addiction.

742
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,840
Chasing that high.

743
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,280
I haven't found it since.

744
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:24,240
You know not I love I think I've been there for years probably.

745
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,920
I think this is like maybe my fourth year of going.

746
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,920
And I think this was the year that I got a little bored with it.

747
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,480
But I still treasure it and think it's very special.

748
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:41,080
Yeah well that's a that's a larger I feel like topic because these both knots and horror

749
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,840
nights and maybe you won't feel the same about horror nights but there's like eight ish nine

750
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,840
ish houses.

751
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,320
It takes a lot of time to do it.

752
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,040
You know if you have like your front of the line passes and by I think we said by the

753
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:55,680
eighth or ninth time you're almost looking for like someone to like punch you or something.

754
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,240
Totally.

755
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,240
Or my mind I'll just I'll be like I need to send that email and like things will just be

756
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,200
jumping out at me and then I just get into a trance.

757
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,120
This is what I've said to my close before I go that first one is going to be bad.

758
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,520
You're going to be like I'm never why would I ever do this.

759
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,320
This sucks.

760
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,200
I don't want to be scared.

761
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,760
I hate it.

762
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,840
The second one you go OK it's not as bad.

763
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,240
But I like the eighth or ninth you are just kind of like zombified like hey we go OK look

764
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,560
at that.

765
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,840
Oh yeah there's a clown that's yelling at me OK.

766
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,040
Hey you're right.

767
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,360
Anyway none of the next one like yeah there is a feeling by the end of that where I think

768
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,560
your brain has learned like no one is going to attack me.

769
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:30,800
Yeah.

770
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,120
Right.

771
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,440
And it's also you're exhausted because it's midnight.

772
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,960
But Charles never learned that.

773
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,360
You did.

774
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,640
No I was attacked.

775
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,680
I was attacked Mike.

776
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,240
Well it wasn't.

777
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,440
That keeps it alive for you.

778
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,040
You don't believe the victim.

779
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,000
I don't think that is what I said.

780
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It wasn't look it wasn't the nuts scary farm character Mesmer doing it.

781
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,040
It was something else.

782
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,680
It wasn't one of these beloved I nots I.

783
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,640
Coodles.

784
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,640
Wasn't Coodles from Horror Nights.

785
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,240
That's not Coodles.

786
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,800
Coodles.

787
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,000
It was not Coodles.

788
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,440
It wasn't the ghost town resident with supernatural the conductor.

789
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,960
Are you speaking of the conductor.

790
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,640
I believe I saw that her name is Sarah Marshall.

791
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,760
Oh Sarah Marshall.

792
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,120
Yes we saw we met her.

793
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,400
We'll never forget her.

794
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,240
We did not forget Sarah.

795
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,600
What is it that name.

796
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,400
That's crazy.

797
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,640
I don't know but it just says on the like it's like oh oh wait I saw that too.

798
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,600
Wait where was that.

799
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,640
That is the last.

800
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,200
OK why am I it's Grimoire.

801
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,240
That was in Grimoire.

802
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,600
That was a new maze and the character's name in Grimoire for some reason is Sarah Marshall.

803
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,280
I don't know if they didn't know.

804
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,520
Any other name almost I mean not Annie Hall but like most other names.

805
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,320
It sounds like an old noise name.

806
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,800
I don't know.

807
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,280
No I didn't Google it.

808
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,000
Who cares.

809
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,720
We're putting it up.

810
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,480
Yes Sarah Marshall.

811
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,800
I mean we I guess we yeah we could talk about that.

812
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,200
That's Grimoire which is the new maze.

813
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,360
We did it like one of the last ones we did it.

814
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,880
That's their big Kahuna this year right.

815
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,880
That's the big unveiling is Grimoire.

816
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,200
Yes because the other new one is like Bloodline.

817
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,960
That one is like they give you a gun which is actually we did do that's the only maze you did.

818
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,720
Yeah this is the newer version of Infected.

819
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,360
Oh that's right.

820
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,240
Yeah I like the idea of like putting like a kind of fun gun and it's like a zombie or you're

821
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,680
shooting but this is my feeling with a lot of rides that you have a gun on.

822
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:22,880
It's too much.

823
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,320
Too much going on.

824
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,360
Yeah and they didn't work.

825
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,920
And the guns didn't work and like it's not a satisfying thing to shoot it.

826
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,080
Yeah.

827
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,400
Because people are just they're getting close to you already and they're not going to like

828
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,480
kill themselves to throw themselves against a wall to make it feel like you're actually shooting them.

829
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,440
Yeah and I didn't know I was just shooting all the good people and I didn't it took me

830
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,720
a really long time to realize that I was shooting the people helping me.

831
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,280
Yeah like a steampunk bartender you were lighting up.

832
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,560
Of course I'm going to shoot a steampunk bartender.

833
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,600
This is annoying.

834
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,880
This is an annoying aesthetic.

835
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,320
I would love to shoot a steampunk bartender.

836
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,360
Way more than a zombie.

837
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,200
You're trying too hard to have an identity.

838
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,760
One too many Tinder dates end with so I'm a steampunk bartender that's my gig.

839
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,260
Goodbye.

840
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,680
And that was another one I think we did at the end closer to the end and I was just like

841
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,320
this is too much and then the score isn't satisfying.

842
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,400
It doesn't even tell you like wait for your score.

843
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,560
So it's like you weren't paying attention.

844
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,840
I watched the video YouTube of it before this and I was like oh this actually

845
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,080
makes it actually better than it was in my memory.

846
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,480
Yeah.

847
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,320
Because my memory was just like I got to pretend to shoot these people and.

848
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,000
It was a big line of people too.

849
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
You just felt like you're in line with a gun just sort of walking through a line but

850
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,560
Grimoire was really weird because it was kind of a Stranger Things camp like teens at a campfire

851
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,640
and I mean you know the SoCal actor element of it's very engaging.

852
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,400
Like there's a lot to think about there with like you know all these 20 year olds

853
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,640
like playing teenagers and like you're just making like direct eye contact with

854
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:03,040
four feet away and they had a fake campfire and then the girl the lead girl read from

855
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,800
a book I think called Grimoire.

856
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:11,680
Grimoire is like a book of evil essentially and I guess various lore I guess and she's

857
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:17,280
lip syncing the dialogue and it's a very I'll say the word intimate kind of spot to be in

858
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,960
and I for a second I thought this was going to be the best maze because there's like people

859
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,600
she's like dressed like the Pokemon trainer.

860
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,600
What's the name of the main Pokemon trainer?

861
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,560
Misty or Ash.

862
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,400
I think it's Ash she's dressed she was dressed like Ash she's got big baseball cap and she's

863
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,280
got big book and she's like doing the real like come on everybody type acting and she's

864
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,880
pretending she's doing the lip sync and then yeah something happens and she says something about

865
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,160
the book and then lights or whatever and smoke shoot up and I remember going this might be the

866
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,960
best one.

867
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,240
It started really promising and she's lip syncing to a track that's extremely loud.

868
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,960
So loud.

869
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,400
Is just booming unnaturally loud everywhere.

870
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,680
You're close to her yeah.

871
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,920
And then other people would be kind of ad-libbing or they decided later that they should like

872
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:03,680
have more lines but there wasn't a track and it was already too late or something so there

873
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,280
would be like her that would be like we have that would just be so and then somebody else

874
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:13,520
would be like it was just like this completely like what the mix was off.

875
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,840
I was off to say the least.

876
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,520
I watched that video and I think the reason her track is recorded is because an effect

877
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,160
has to hit after she reads from the book.

878
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,720
Maybe I think there's like some fog or an explosion or something that happened.

879
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,840
I think what it is is that all the kids we don't see Sarah Marshall again we don't forget her but

880
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,040
we don't see her again.

881
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,400
She's Sarah Marshall I believe because they're trying to find her.

882
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,240
They remember her but the other you see the other kids later.

883
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,760
Now they're played by different much older actors in my memory.

884
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,200
It's like you saw the kids before and then you see them later and you're like then looks like

885
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,920
that guy aged 15 years since I saw him at the campfire.

886
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,920
Look you gotta have some dupes and you gotta do 30 minutes on 30 minutes off.

887
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,400
Yeah yeah of course.

888
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,760
You gotta just match the best you can.

889
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,000
But I think that's why the recorded track is because they have those people all

890
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,880
trying to sound the same.

891
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,400
You can look different but don't you ever sound different.

892
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,280
No if you sound different it will give it away.

893
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:21,680
So but you go through like a really like weird like 20s or 50s pastiche before that which I again

894
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:26,960
I'm watching the video and I go oh that was all really cool and then you go through like a fox

895
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,080
hole I believe.

896
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,760
Yeah you go through like a black and white house.

897
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,080
Like then you go through a closet then you're like in an army fox hole for some reason.

898
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,960
Yeah and then you're in like paths of glory all of a sudden.

899
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,720
And then Jason you're like this you go into a rations room with a bunch of cans of soup.

900
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,440
There's just a big room full of like not Campbell soup but it is like the logo it looks like Campbell

901
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:47,760
soup.

902
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,080
Is anyone eating any of these biscuits?

903
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,720
I don't want to be the first.

904
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,760
Somebody else try.

905
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,480
Is the VIP wristband get us these?

906
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,080
Can I get a couple?

907
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,000
You get tackled by a scare actor for trying to rip one of the cans off of the.

908
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,500
Sir.

909
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,480
And it's all that's all actually pretty cool and then you go back into present day

910
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,720
and then there's just many rooms of going through the forest trying to find Sarah Marshall.

911
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,360
Yeah.

912
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,400
And you can't find her.

913
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,760
We didn't find her.

914
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,360
And you do forget your goal.

915
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:18,720
Absolutely.

916
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,760
You forget Sarah Marshall but you do forget why you care.

917
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,000
There's a Buena Park actor yelling at you though later but you still don't know what you're doing.

918
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,920
And it's that very classic maze thing which I realize they all almost all have accepted six

919
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,400
flags.

920
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,240
They almost all have this thing where people are like come on come on and it's just like

921
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,840
it's just like rushing you like airport stress is like yes that's how that's how a lot of them keep

922
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,720
the tensions high.

923
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,800
Yeah and well and also the built they built in keeping it moving because you got to get a lot

924
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,240
of people in and out here so for some reason all these are all very urgent.

925
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,960
I think I've said this probably twice on the show at least by and I didn't do this because they

926
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,960
did a WB like Horror Nights on the Lot a couple years ago.

927
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,680
That's fun.

928
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,960
And they did like an Arkham Asylum Batman one and there was a room in the video I was watching

929
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,080
where Joker has to do like he has to yell and do his Joker shit but also he has to move sure

930
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,880
the line is moving and then anybody else wants to control the line too he's like hold on one

931
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,800
moment and then he does this whole thing and then like he's like checking checking to make

932
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,160
sure the whole group is ready and then he's like all right right this way you know like they

933
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,680
couldn't get a second person.

934
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,880
And this is a Joker's assistant.

935
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:33,920
Yeah Harley Quinn couldn't have done that so yeah it's all it's all built into like ride capacity

936
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,880
or or haunt capacity is the the narrative has to move because we got to get people in and out.

937
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,600
Yeah Grimoire was a new one the first half that's my review the first half I feel like is great.

938
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,440
And I think it's an unfinished story if I remember correctly they kind of just

939
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,280
they're just like okay go go out.

940
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,040
Yeah they end and like she's gone the book took her.

941
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,480
Yeah she's dead I think.

942
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,960
Yes she's gone Sarah Marshall's dead.

943
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,920
Huh yeah well I guess these things aren't supposed to have happy endings.

944
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,520
No it's really sad actually.

945
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,920
Because you're seeing the book through the ages like the book taking people are possessing

946
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,720
people I think.

947
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,520
Yes because they keep like there's somebody will come out like somebody cooking something

948
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,600
in a kitchen and she'll have like the book and the book is glowing and everything else is black

949
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,120
and white around you which is a cool effect.

950
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,080
It's painted black and white and they're like wearing like gray makeup and like black and white

951
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,480
clothing.

952
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,160
I feel like if they can punch up that second half next year.

953
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,880
Yeah.

954
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,520
We may have.

955
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,120
A go picture.

956
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,000
Yeah and it can make it to the four year mark.

957
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,920
Is that the longest these things go or is it.

958
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,800
I think around.

959
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,840
What's the Kenan of.

960
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,080
I know.

961
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,960
The origins one right.

962
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,040
No origins is newer really origins was 2019 I believe.

963
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,680
Dark ride I think last year dark ride.

964
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,680
Yes that's the oldest one.

965
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,280
You can feel that feels old.

966
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,360
That one does feel that's the weakest I think.

967
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,320
It's OK it's not bad but it's not it's not that scary and it's not that interesting.

968
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,440
Yeah I feel like the clown room at the end is like kind of fun but not not as fun as

969
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,040
like killer clowns at horror nights.

970
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,240
It's a fun idea to just walk through a dark ride is a fun idea but it doesn't really always

971
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,440
feel like you're doing that.

972
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,680
So I think wax works has a similar tiredness to it too but there's something

973
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,320
just very charming about wax works for me.

974
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:25,120
Wax works Dr Scratch I believe is the character's name and he like it's a you're in a wax museum

975
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:30,240
but he's also taking people and turning them into like horribly disfigured wax creatures.

976
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,480
At the end you see like depending on if people are on their shift or not people are in like

977
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,200
the vats of wax like crawl like calling out to you.

978
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,000
I don't think we got that because I was watching the video earlier today.

979
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,120
I remember a couple of times we going through the mazes and I go like there's a couple

980
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,800
of people called in sick today.

981
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,520
There was that and then a lot of the things that had been working before weren't working

982
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,920
where there'd be like a big hand that comes out and grabs you.

983
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,400
Yeah yeah and I was sort of waiting for the big spectacle moments and those it did feel

984
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,800
like this year maybe it was just opening night and it takes a second to sure get the show

985
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,320
on the road but it did feel a little like there was a dip for me but maybe I'm just

986
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,440
getting desensitized.

987
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,360
I did that I did I did Fright Fest I went to the Magic Castle.

988
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:12,720
Wow.

989
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,960
I had a frightful month.

990
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,360
Yeah and Horror Nights and so I'm just sort of exhausted.

991
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,440
Yeah yeah yeah well you've lived at like scream decibel I guess for I guess less so

992
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,000
the Magic Cast unless I don't know are people screaming at you?

993
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,600
No that was that was delightful.

994
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,840
Yeah that's just a calm nice time.

995
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:37,680
I will say the my favorite one of Knott's is Mesmer which is when we did first.

996
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,520
Yeah I'm having a hard time remembering it and I was thinking about you saying that

997
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,040
it was your favorite and how for some reason it's blended for me.

998
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,160
Mesmer it's a lot of like you go in a circus tent and then there's a room that's got like

999
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:57,120
different shaped clocks like grandfather clocks and it's all tilted it feels like a Batman

1000
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,800
Villains lair or something versus the other like it feels different.

1001
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,040
Yeah.

1002
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:06,560
It's got a mood it's got an atmosphere to it that and it's all like disorienting you.

1003
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:06,960
Yeah.

1004
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,720
Versus just like pummeling you with Boyna Park scares.

1005
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,120
Right right but the yeses.

1006
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,640
The industry term yes.

1007
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,520
So I've got that one's a new I think that one's like two years old but I feel like that one is

1008
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,200
the best maybe which is because I was the freshest also that's also very possible.

1009
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,200
Mike let me ask now that you've been going for a few years now.

1010
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:29,600
Yes.

1011
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:34,080
How do you decide where to start do you start with like what's closest to the entrance do

1012
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,560
you start with what you're most interested in like.

1013
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,760
Well Jason this year I'll tell you why we started with Mesmer is because it was very

1014
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,040
close to the Johnny Rockets.

1015
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,560
Johnny Rockets proximity and you want to like you hope that I guess in this case there was not rock

1016
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,600
music playing but in another year you might hope that if you're a little afraid that maybe you

1017
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:00,560
hear rock around the clock it is like you can kind of like tether to that.

1018
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,920
A Bobby Boris Pickett cover of rock around the clock or something.

1019
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,480
Okay sure sure sure yeah they should there's they should fill it with spooky rock.

1020
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,840
That would be a great idea.

1021
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:14,240
They should there's a lot more depressing than someone whose mental health relies on

1022
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,480
orienting themselves with rock around the clock.

1023
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,560
They're just giving us some rock music.

1024
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:26,000
Ah there's also that's the second year I think of the roaring 20s area.

1025
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,360
Yeah that was nifty I like that.

1026
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,400
Which you would say nifty.

1027
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,320
I was that I really stopped.

1028
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,680
But it's the right word for it.

1029
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,200
I did.

1030
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,240
Oh your instinct was correct.

1031
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,760
It was cute.

1032
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,240
There's like like evil news boys this is why I said this last time Jason this is your this

1033
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,320
is outside too you don't even have to go into a scare like into a maze this is just outside.

1034
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,480
This is the roaring 20s scare.

1035
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,200
Goring.

1036
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,640
I said roaring I said it wrong but yeah you got like your evil news boys.

1037
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,400
Yeah your evil flappers.

1038
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,000
Yeah little jazz band playing up there giving it it's all.

1039
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,280
This jazz band sounded great.

1040
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,080
I it didn't sound that evil to me honestly it just sounded fun.

1041
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,040
Well that's the trick.

1042
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,440
But there's fun music I've made me music isn't always like the haunted mansion you know.

1043
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,240
It's that's true.

1044
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,240
Ghosts like ragtime I guess is what I'm saying.

1045
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,360
They've established that they don't need to they ghosts are fun they don't need to just listen

1046
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,560
to like screeching on a on a chalkboard or something.

1047
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,160
Ghosts yeah ghosts like screeching on a chalkboard but they also love an upright bass.

1048
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,520
They really do this is seems very associated.

1049
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,480
It is true that it seems like what for some reason I don't know if the haunted mansion

1050
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,120
started it but is can somebody point to the first piece of pop culture where an upright

1051
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,640
bass was associated with ghosts.

1052
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:41,040
Well when what were ghosts before the 20s I guess they were Victorian but before that

1053
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,200
you know it's kind of like how teenagers didn't exist till the 50s like ghosts didn't have

1054
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,480
a brand until right right right didn't have a musical identity.

1055
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,080
They were just ragtime era.

1056
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:56,960
They were just insane peasants that with no outlet with no way to express themselves

1057
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,080
from beyond the grave was there they found jazz was there an origin of like ghosts being

1058
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:07,600
fun were like ghosts like represented you know sadness up until a certain point when

1059
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,720
somebody was like well what if we just like pretend they're just having a party.

1060
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,920
I don't know the answer to it.

1061
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:17,200
Is Disney part of this they I don't want to say they invented it but certainly and there

1062
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,840
was stuff before the haunted mansion but like I do think of like the skeleton like the early

1063
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,680
Walt cartoon the skeleton dance.

1064
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:30,800
That's kind of like a late 1800s like the whole like mysticism movement made like magic

1065
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,280
tricks and like the macabre of really popular in the late 1800s.

1066
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,880
Oh yeah yeah that's true.

1067
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,640
Like Bella Puck like skeleton person.

1068
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,520
Oh sure.

1069
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,800
And then you could like have fun with somebody who has access to beyond the grave or like

1070
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,160
plays with your expectations.

1071
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,760
And stances and huh huh.

1072
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,040
There was also a tradition of reading ghost stories at Christmas time.

1073
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,320
Really?

1074
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,880
Yeah that Christmas Carol is a ghost story.

1075
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,000
Right right right right.

1076
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,200
Because Christmas was miserable until like 20 years ago.

1077
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,160
Yeah until the Coca Cola.

1078
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:02,800
Coca Cola.

1079
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,640
A couple years before we were born.

1080
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,140
Yeah.

1081
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,880
And we're all 18 just to do the math.

1082
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,480
I toured one of the this big old DuPont mansion in Delaware.

1083
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:20,000
That's like a museum now does like historical exhibits every Christmas of like what is

1084
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,680
Christmas like over the years.

1085
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,240
You would go through different rooms and floors and they're like and so this is the 1800s.

1086
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:32,800
This is 1910s 1930s 1950s and like the older ones are like the Christmas tree was often

1087
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,160
decorated on Christmas Eve with candles.

1088
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,440
It was not decorated sooner because you could only fill the candles for one night and you

1089
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,560
had to blow them all out lest you burn the house down.

1090
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,320
Yeah makes sense.

1091
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,840
So that was Christmas.

1092
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,560
That was Christmas Eve.

1093
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,880
One day of an extreme fire hazard.

1094
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,320
Yeah and then yeah and then there's poppers.

1095
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,200
I love poppers.

1096
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,200
Yeah everybody did poppers.

1097
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,200
The British poppers.

1098
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,040
I'm finally listening.

1099
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:01,780
No.

1100
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,960
The ones that you like pop and have confetti and like little paper crackers crackers.

1101
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,440
Okay so you're saying capitalism has made everything fun really is what we're saying.

1102
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,160
Yeah and they've injected some things really.

1103
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:16,960
It's not wrong.

1104
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,080
It's not completely wrong.

1105
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:22,240
Yeah it's uh what the whole show is about.

1106
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,480
We celebrate the good stuff that capitalism that's right leads to.

1107
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,120
That's what the thing on the apple podcast says.

1108
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,200
Poppers startups nowadays.

1109
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:39,200
So yeah nots overall it delivered uh it's not it doesn't give you every year when you try to

1110
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,600
talk about it since there's so much stuff that's like very similar or the same it's like I don't

1111
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:48,720
want to go over the depths again because I've been there every listener knows my feelings on the

1112
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,480
depths they know.

1113
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,640
I'm not sure every host remembers your feelings on the depths.

1114
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,000
You remember the my favorite part of the depths is that they do this really awesome thing with

1115
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,800
like a laser when you're walking through like fog or like it's supposed to imitate fog or water.

1116
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,520
So they put fog then they kind of put this laser that makes it feel like it's only chest level

1117
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,760
and then there's people kind of putting their like fins or they're like sea creatures putting

1118
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,960
their like arms up above.

1119
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,000
Fins to the left fins to the right.

1120
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Well that's why I like the depths a lot.

1121
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,320
Like the only bait in town.

1122
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:22,000
It's very successful at what it's pulling it looks good.

1123
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,360
It looks it's like one of the best effects that I've never seen anywhere else.

1124
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:30,720
Yeah and every time I see it I think about how I was in this play in a community theater.

1125
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,880
Oh actually this is a high school play where it's called the Diviners and it's a play that

1126
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:41,280
only high schools know and I played a preacher who has to like go and like save a boy who's

1127
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,400
drowning and the director just wanted me to like jump on the floor of the stage and just

1128
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:53,280
like pantomime swim and it's supposed to be the most upsetting climax possible and people would

1129
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,080
just fucking laugh every time I would jump on the ground and start swimming and I think about

1130
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:03,360
that every time I see the depth I'm like if we only knew about this not technology in 2005.

1131
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,360
That could have been doable for high school maybe.

1132
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:12,160
A lot could have been doable in my upbringing that I wasn't given.

1133
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,240
You have a long improvement.

1134
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,680
This is not that high on the list ultimately.

1135
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,240
Capitalism could have made it more fun.

1136
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:27,120
I felt a little like Knott's is getting stale to me as somebody who goes but at the same time

1137
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:32,000
I've been going to Six Flags it made me think Knott's is so special.

1138
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,240
It really made me think like they really Knott's has a soul at the end of the day.

1139
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,640
It's a weird soul and it's a makeshift soul but it is a it does have a soul.

1140
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:45,360
For sure yeah yeah and it's got the like a they've got a voice that's consistent.

1141
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,200
Now I have not been to Fright Fest.

1142
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,840
I don't want to go back to Fright Fest without Anthony Gio.

1143
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,160
Yeah.

1144
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:55,600
Basically that's when whenever Anthony wants to go and do Fright Fest because we did Fright Fest a few years ago.

1145
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,080
But I want to hear about Fright Fest.

1146
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,120
Yeah yeah please.

1147
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,080
This is my first one.

1148
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:06,000
I mean I went to Fiesta Texas into Six Flags over Texas growing up to those Fright Fests but this was

1149
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,400
I had never been to Magic Mountain before so this was my first.

1150
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,120
Oh at all.

1151
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,160
Yeah yeah and I don't think I can do roller coasters anymore.

1152
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,920
It was really rough on my body.

1153
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,200
Which ones did you do?

1154
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,880
I did basically all of them.

1155
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:23,680
The one that screwed me up was the Viper because it's like a loop and then a corkscrew and that was too much.

1156
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:30,080
Yeah it was too much but then my friends went on Tatsu where you dangle and you face down and I said

1157
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:30,960
I can't do that with you.

1158
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:31,680
That's actually weird.

1159
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,400
That's too scary.

1160
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:32,880
I love it.

1161
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,600
This is too scary.

1162
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:33,840
Really?

1163
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,360
I've only done it once but I thought it was thrilling.

1164
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:40,800
This is what's funny about this is that he's the brave much braver than us when it comes to stuff like that.

1165
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,520
What does it mean?

1166
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,720
Are you asking him or me or?

1167
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,360
You.

1168
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:50,640
Oh I don't know I just thought I mean that one was fun because I this was like 2007 something like that.

1169
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:55,600
I just thought it was so unique because you load into the chair like you're sitting and then it

1170
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,800
like swings you up so you're facing down and like flying.

1171
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,680
It is unique but it scares the shit out like the idea of it scares the shit out of me.

1172
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,160
It's actually scary because like you can die.

1173
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,880
Yeah it behooves them though to keep their guests alive as much as possible you know.

1174
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,760
That's what I always.

1175
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,160
I think I came to that conclusion around like 11 or 12.

1176
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,840
Sure you're not wrong.

1177
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:23,680
I think like that there's the separation of scary rides and haunts.

1178
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:29,280
Jason if you can get over anything that's scary about a roller coaster then you get

1179
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,440
the fun part that you enjoy.

1180
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:31,600
Yeah.

1181
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:35,200
I feel like with a haunt I don't think you there's enough in it for you or me

1182
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,760
like so we get over the fear and then what am I am I going to appreciate the the theming.

1183
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,400
Yes.

1184
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,400
That's what that that's what is in it for me.

1185
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,120
I think so.

1186
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:45,600
Okay.

1187
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:52,800
I like the theming I also like the world of horror like media and fandom and it's all very

1188
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,480
a piece with like theme park fandom and comic book fandom.

1189
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:56,960
Yes.

1190
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,120
It's a similar language.

1191
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:03,120
That's what I guess because we both did not we were kept away from all this as children but

1192
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,720
we're comic book kids.

1193
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:04,880
Yeah.

1194
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,800
Now yeah you're like oh it's all the same.

1195
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,800
And when it's really pulled off to I mean not to skip around but with horror nights

1196
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:15,920
too where you're just like oh this is a fully realized idea from beginning to end it's

1197
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:21,200
elevated and even though it does feel a little corporate or something there's still yeah

1198
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,400
you're just like wow you really pulled this off and I got in the middle of something and

1199
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,760
it felt real to me or you know or the idea of it felt real to me.

1200
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,720
It's interesting because you're like certain ones like Mesmer for instance you're like kind

1201
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,160
of impressed that it's not doing the same thing as every like all the other ones.

1202
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,840
It's similar of course but it's not quite they're like doing a few things that are new

1203
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:44,560
but then like to jump around horror nights there's a Halloween maze.

1204
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,440
And they pummel you with I love it.

1205
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,080
I love it.

1206
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:52,640
I don't I think I've been I've never been pummeled more with like people jumping out at you.

1207
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,080
There's a spot at the end I think I think that I'm remembering this right.

1208
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:00,640
There's a room with like eight Michael Myers right and like half of them are real.

1209
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:07,360
There's so many Michael there's probably 40 Michael there might be that many maybe actually

1210
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:11,680
and then the last stretch of it there's just Michael Myers coming out of every window at

1211
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,200
you as you try to leave.

1212
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,920
Wow very body inclusive like all shapes and sizes.

1213
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,320
Sure yeah not at all.

1214
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:23,280
So like by the end you are like even if it's your last maze you come out of it pretty impressed.

1215
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,920
Yeah you're like they got me and it's classy too and also the I mean not to be rude but just

1216
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,880
like the it just feels like horror nights is sag.

1217
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,840
Everyone is just you know a groundling.

1218
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:39,760
Sure there's like a certain level where like the wigs have a little more patina

1219
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:47,600
and everyone's really selling it but Six Wags was I mean these people they don't want to do it.

1220
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,840
I don't know why they're doing it.

1221
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,360
It's parents making them get a job.

1222
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,320
I guess so.

1223
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,240
That's on the billboard at the entrance.

1224
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,960
I don't want to do the work today.

1225
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,520
That's what we found when we were there is that very few employees wanted to do it.

1226
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,360
We kept joking about it because it's so many I mean probably a hundred times somebody would

1227
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:12,240
be like boo and then there'd be a moment where they'd be like and it was just it would be this

1228
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:16,880
like apology energy that was like no no it's okay like it kind of worked like you want

1229
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,200
and it's so everything at Six Flags the sets were kind of good the sets were good but then

1230
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:30,880
there was one one at Six Flags called Aftermath 2 Chaos Rising because we're all so aware of

1231
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,440
the first one and how the chaos needed to rise.

1232
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,280
How could they do another Aftermath?

1233
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,040
The chaos would have to rise or something.

1234
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:46,000
Then it's gonna leaven but that was these huge set pieces with really tall

1235
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:51,200
towery you were you were basically in Children of Men essentially and so you were like walking

1236
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:57,360
through burning buildings with real flames and it was it was really like the the production

1237
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:05,120
design was amazing but then the actors were all like victims of this chaos whatever it was so no

1238
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:14,400
one was coming for you everyone was just like oh oh no like you just keep walking by people being

1239
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,600
like that way.

1240
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,500
Hey!

1241
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:22,960
It's like being like walking you're like outside of a high school nurse's office.

1242
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:30,640
Yeah it was like hour 13 of like the Capitol riots it was like everyone was basically disbanded.

1243
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,480
It got mazed.

1244
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:40,160
And this is like right after the head of Six Flags is like you know we're changing our image we're

1245
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,920
not just gonna be a babysitter a place where you can just drop your kids off and I'm like

1246
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:49,680
do you know what parks you run man like you're changing like you're gonna have to inject a lot

1247
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:55,680
of money and a big change in like your whole vibe if you don't want to just be like the teenage spot.

1248
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:03,040
Yeah I know that's the one Six Flags across the board every house had that kind of Rob Zombie

1249
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,680
what's the zombie show the The Walking Dead like where everything is just a little

1250
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,200
MAGA.

1251
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:16,880
It's just like ah dang that's not my favorite thing about Halloween ultimately that's not the

1252
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,280
aesthetic I think about I love a gothic I love a spooky yeah.

1253
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,640
Was there the Haunted Mansion like ripoff one this year?

1254
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,440
There was yeah.

1255
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,760
Okay because that a lot of them they keep around.

1256
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,400
Yeah I liked it okay yeah that one was okay.

1257
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,400
Well they had one where people were flying over you a lot and that was

1258
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:40,160
cool where they were in these harnesses and they all felt like trained enough in this thing.

1259
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,560
The highest compliment you could give.

1260
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,280
It was satisfactory training provided.

1261
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,160
Yeah they did this thing where they would lunge at you and then they were on bungee cables so that

1262
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:56,160
they would get really close to you and you thought they were going to hit you but then at the last

1263
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:00,400
second they pull back and they somehow felt confident enough to understand the distance

1264
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:05,920
There was some horror nights that had like a bungee yeah I feel like sometimes you see the

1265
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:11,200
bungee when we did Delusion there was bungee like the rock monster punched somebody and they

1266
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,520
bungee like shot them backward.

1267
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:18,320
Yes so Trumpy about just saying and they had bungee and there we and we love bungee.

1268
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,560
The thing with the haunts they gotta have more bungee they don't do bungee.

1269
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,520
Did you do Twisted Colossus?

1270
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,120
Yes I did Twisted Colossus.

1271
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,000
How was that?

1272
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,360
I liked it I liked it but god I missed the days where I could get on a roller coaster and feel

1273
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:41,680
abandoned every time I was like this is I have to be on high I don't know what I was trying to

1274
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,600
monitor but I was like I must be on I must be on Red Alert.

1275
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,400
Yeah you want to feel free when you're on it not like worried.

1276
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,840
I was looking at every screw I was passing on all of them so.

1277
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:57,920
Okay because that's I gotta get but that's that's another Minotaur for me is getting back on Twisted

1278
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:02,160
Colossus because I did it once and it crushed my genitals and I would just.

1279
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,680
Who needs you to do this?

1280
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,240
No one I I'd say don't do it.

1281
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,040
I have to do it.

1282
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,800
Seems like you're better off not.

1283
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,080
No I'm gonna do it.

1284
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,640
I don't want your genitals to get crushed again Mike.

1285
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,840
That's not gonna happen again.

1286
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,080
Yeah that's I can fix that.

1287
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:16,800
Unless you like it.

1288
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,480
You have a daughter they still work it's fine.

1289
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,280
You did reproduce post-test to Colossus.

1290
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:23,760
That is a good point.

1291
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,480
I think you should freeze sperm and then go on Twisted Colossus.

1292
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,320
You can freeze sperm out of six flags too.

1293
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,760
Yeah at that Johnny Rocker.

1294
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:40,640
So yeah I gotta get back on Twisted Colossus because it was crazy and fun but like it felt

1295
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,720
I felt insane on it.

1296
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,000
It's like there was a panic another anxiety attack happening to me.

1297
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,440
I think that one was correct.

1298
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,400
I think you were right.

1299
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:52,880
I'm worried you're gonna get over this fear and then that'll be the time that Twisted Colossus.

1300
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,520
Claims my genitals for good.

1301
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:57,680
I hope not.

1302
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:03,200
Again as we discussed Jason we love we all love when we can dock each other's pay

1303
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:07,840
and get more of the money but I don't want your pay docked permanently due to your death.

1304
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,240
No this is Twisted Colossus is good.

1305
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,280
It's just that the whole situation was bad.

1306
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,760
The employee leading up was not the most helpful person when we were trying to give him

1307
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,520
our plastic souvenir glasses and he wouldn't touch them and he said you gotta get out and

1308
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,840
go and put them on that table over there and we had to get out after being loaded on feeling

1309
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:30,800
like the ride was gonna take us like without like somebody's gonna step on it as it shot away.

1310
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:38,400
Charles the Six Flags teens this did you sense more of a vacantness or a hostility due to them

1311
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:47,440
not wanting to be is was it more of like lost eyes or like open mouth like gaping yeah yeah.

1312
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:54,800
Yeah if there was I mean I'm sure there's all kinds but it was it was the look of people who

1313
00:57:54,800 --> 00:58:02,480
have done no self-work which I guess is teens but there was there was a there was like a I don't

1314
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,800
know my place that was like that was the energy.

1315
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:11,360
It just sounded that they that they scared and then like recoiled a little like how can

1316
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,520
you have the confidence to scare when you're clearly not like that that's that's very difficult.

1317
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:22,000
Yeah that's that requires the most confidence in the world maybe that's who this is whose pay

1318
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,760
should get docked if we're deciding. He didn't commit no one committed. I do want to say if Mike

1319
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:34,640
dies I happily will do a Mike impression um on the show forever. Oh sweet okay cool like how

1320
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:41,360
Rich Little did uh the pink panther after Peter Sellers died um he dumped half the movie.

1321
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:45,680
I'm happy to do that. That's that's thank god because the backup would have been a James Earl

1322
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:53,280
Jones AI situation and that sounds expensive so the guy sounds good you know uh I'll go along

1323
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,960
with that plan but I would like to hear Rich Little try his hand at an impression of me.

1324
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:07,840
The only thing I could ever do to impersonate you is funny. Funny funny funny and fun.

1325
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:13,120
I've heard funny. Is that like my Chicago accent? Yeah that's interesting. Oh I've never caught

1326
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:17,840
that but it sounds familiar. And if Griffin Newman now I'm really jumping around if Griffin Newman

1327
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:24,560
is listening to this episode something he says on blank check is fundamental. Start clocking.

1328
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:33,840
You could is a drinking game. This is coming from someone who has no friends just podcasts so

1329
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:40,560
you sit and listen. They did that one again. They did that one again. That's the hook so mine is

1330
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:45,200
the hook is like funny so like Rich Little. Same root word as Griffin. Yeah right it's funny and

1331
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:49,920
fundamental. Yeah maybe just listen to everybody's F you I mean somebody's has to be fucked. Somebody's

1332
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:56,160
has to be however they say fuck. Yeah listen for Jason's fuck and that'll be the key. The only thing

1333
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,720
I'll say about anyone doing impression to me is I don't want it to be nasty like that Phil Hartman

1334
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:06,320
Frank Sinatra impression. I want it to be nice like the Joe Piscopo Frank Sinatra. I want it to be of

1335
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:11,040
respect. I want it to be loved. He loved because he loved Mike. It came from a place of love.

1336
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:17,760
That's a five timers. I was talking about Joe Piscopo's kind Frank Sinatra impression. That's

1337
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:25,520
for sure something. It was funny. It was fun and it was funny and fundamentally. Is that kind of

1338
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:32,720
griffin-y? Sorry. Fundamentally. That's what he like. It's probably like super pronounced. Yeah

1339
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:38,400
totally. He hits the syllables. Yeah wow. Well try it at home kid. Now you know you have a guide

1340
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:44,160
for doing a griffin-numinum impression. Did you see any antics of teens that weren't working there

1341
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:49,280
because when we were there we saw a teen put his mouth on the fog machine and suck a bunch of fog

1342
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:55,600
up and then spit it out. No I didn't see anything too crazy but I will well there were girls that

1343
01:00:55,600 --> 01:01:02,160
were screaming in a way that was like oh my gosh. That was with us too. Yes that's happened there

1344
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,760
with us too. You were like it's a little performance. I know there's something where I'm like it's a

1345
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:11,120
little bit too much. If it's not a performance then something's up here because you shouldn't be

1346
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:16,400
screaming this loudly. Yeah no we had that too. We had exactly the same thing. Did you drink a

1347
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:20,800
beer in the little pen they make you sit in by the giant rockets? My friends did. I've been trying to

1348
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:26,320
drink less. My friends drink a beer. In the pen. In the little pen and I will say the one thing

1349
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:31,600
teen wise I did feel was that I went with like all me gay guys and I was like well we're just

1350
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:36,480
gonna get killed. Like there's just it just felt like one of those things where it's like we had

1351
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:42,320
a comment. We went to Magic Mountain. We went to Valencia and we should have known.

1352
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:51,600
It's basic math. I don't want to forget though that the most exciting thing that happened to

1353
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:56,880
us at Not Scary Farm was the moment that this clown walked up to us and started heckling us.

1354
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:03,440
Yes yes and teasing us and then she walked away. Teasing both of you so it wasn't about your

1355
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:08,000
orientation. No no no this was not and I used the word preference. That's what I'm saying.

1356
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:15,840
It's okay. Oh shit fuck I've never been in this scenario before okay. I can tell you.

1357
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:19,680
Preference preference okay. That is a great trick to play on straight people.

1358
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:25,040
On orientation preference. I'll get them in a garage. It's a forced choice actually. Get them talking.

1359
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,400
Scary.

1360
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,800
Scarier than an eye in a Knott's Berry jar of preserves.

1361
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,160
Don't use orientation as the keyword to do an impression of me.

1362
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:40,640
So we were generally heckled. We were heckled as a group and then she she walked away and then this

1363
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:46,080
janitor came up kind of seemingly out of nowhere. Yes. And was like like a materialized. Yeah it

1364
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:52,800
was very magical. A magical janitor came up and was like man every year that clown gets sillier

1365
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:59,680
and sillier. It's literally the funniest thing you could say about a clown.

1366
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:08,720
He had like the like it was like the Wingsworld 2 Charlton Heston like far away look in his eye

1367
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:17,680
like that clown like oh boy. Bob Hoskins Schmee like yes yeah. Look at that. It was so like he was

1368
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:24,160
so delighted. Yeah yeah. It was one year I thought he peaked and then he showed me.

1369
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,960
That is maybe the best character interaction we had all night. That of my year. Yeah sure. That

1370
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:37,200
was the best thing I heard all year. How were the sliders this year? Did you see any sliders? The

1371
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:42,240
people sliding on the ground. Not the burgers. I assumed you were asking about burgers yes.

1372
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:46,720
No but I did have like they had a carving station where I had some turkey or something.

1373
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:53,440
Ah that Halloween. Like a grandma like a grandma's church thing where you're like they have a carving

1374
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:59,840
station here like multiple carving stations which yeah they give you a big like tri-tip or whatever

1375
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:05,600
they got. Yeah my gate like a depression era orphan. Yeah I also I like immediately I lied

1376
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:09,440
because your friend couldn't come in with us because we want to break the rules. I didn't want

1377
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,800
to get in trouble. But I immediately I was like oh yeah we're gonna be there in two seconds.

1378
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:20,400
Like you turn around and I have two plates loaded up of food. I'm getting like 10 boiled potatoes.

1379
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:25,520
The whole English breakfast. Yeah the sliders is you're talking about the people on their

1380
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:30,960
the slide on their knees and scare you. Yeah. There were a few out. Less than usual though right? But

1381
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:36,080
I feel like it was less than usual and I don't want to say it's because because they've been

1382
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:41,120
doing it so long at this point but it's got to be just hell on your knees. Yeah. There's no way.

1383
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:46,320
There's no way you could come back next year and do it again. Yeah when we were at Six Flags

1384
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:51,040
the opening ceremonies of Monsters a guy slid right out in front of everybody and made a bunch

1385
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:57,920
of teenage girls shriek and then we heard him stand up and go oh like we heard him grimace

1386
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:03,600
that he heard himself opening night first scare of the night. And I have to imagine that happens

1387
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:09,520
a lot because these people are sliding like crazy. Be honest those are your least favorite. The most

1388
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:15,200
like you don't like are you most scared of those scares? I feel like that's when you grabbed my

1389
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:21,520
arm that one day. But I think that is very impressive. Okay. So I don't know that might

1390
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:27,360
bounce out then. So you go ah and then you go ooh. Ooh. And that's how you hurt your knee was

1391
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:34,320
as a slider. I was sliding yeah I was raw dogging sliding. I didn't know paths. During the summer.

1392
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:39,440
That's what you can't do. Yeah it can't with the asphalt's 80 degrees and the sun's beating down

1393
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:44,720
you're not supposed to just throw your knee at it. Jason there are no summer sliders we keep telling you.

1394
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:52,400
Well yet. But for some reason sparks did come out of your knees. Yes. Can I ask the wait let's Scott

1395
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:56,400
you actually watched the video now that I'm thinking we just recently did a Patreon episode

1396
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:03,600
about the musical Starlight Express. Is there sliding in Starlight Express? Oh geez. I couldn't tell you off hand.

1397
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:10,000
I feel like a lot of stuff happens. There's a little bit I think. Could be. There has to be sliding in Starlight Express.

1398
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:15,520
It's probably accidentally sliding a lot. That's true. But is there Starlight Express? It's gone for

1399
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:22,240
ever and ever. So I don't know. It's still playing in Germany. Yeah they built a private theater that

1400
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:27,760
is just for this that the town financed because they love Starlight Express so much. Wow. There's

1401
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:34,480
a documentary on the sliders. Yeah. But did Starlight Express did they actually invent sliding?

1402
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:40,640
Not Scary Farm predates Starlight. Right but did sliders start with Not Scary Farm the first year?

1403
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:44,720
I think those sliders seem pretty proud of their sliding. That they started it.

1404
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:50,400
But I think a lot of because there is sliding in a lot of these things and I think there is

1405
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:56,560
speculation and argument over which one of the I think it's from Theme Park World but I bet there's

1406
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:03,120
a guy out there who's like I know I'm the first slider. It feels adjacent to on Letterman when he

1407
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:08,880
had that woman that would just like drill her stomach with like sparks would fly out of her stomach.

1408
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:15,200
She had a metal. She was an ongoing theme in the show. I bought this woman up on the show before

1409
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,400
where yeah she would have like a metal outfit and it would spark. She would just spark because she

1410
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,000
was hitting herself with like some sort of power tool. Something that would create sparks and she

1411
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,760
would just like. Yeah. And it would happen whenever you'd go to commercial and they're like the band

1412
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,360
would play and then this woman would come out and just like spark her stomach for no reason.

1413
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:34,960
It would be a sort of a celebration. It feels like that. Like a late 90s discovery. Yeah but yeah.

1414
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:38,880
Not as I feel like yeah there were only a couple sliders. So there was still a lot of people with

1415
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:45,680
like a soup can full of change. Yeah. That's an old standard which like allowed like to rattle it at

1416
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:50,880
you. They had canners. There's plenty of canners. They had canners yeah. Canners versus sliders.

1417
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:56,160
My favorite Shakespearean situation.

1418
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:05,600
Dynamic. I would like to try sliding now that I'm thinking about it but it's probably not a good idea.

1419
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:11,120
Yeah no go for it. Why not? You only live once. What was it? Is it just like knee pads? Do you remember?

1420
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:16,560
I mean I would love to watch the training montage of you getting into sliding because like the

1421
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:22,080
whatever guy you found would go like oh just knee pads huh? That's what you're thinking. Well

1422
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:28,080
go ahead and try and you get your ass handed to you but then slowly but surely you become better

1423
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:36,080
than him. We will try and whose injury will get blown out first? My knee or your reoccurring Achilles

1424
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:41,600
tennis injury. My tennis. Well they've healed since I haven't been playing so those are doing

1425
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:46,320
alright right now but we'll see when I'm sliding for sure. When the Civil War does happen,

1426
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:51,920
sliders everyone half of America will become a slider. There's just gonna be so much of it

1427
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:57,920
everywhere. It's gonna get weaponized. It's inevitable. Yeah. But just duct taping washers.

1428
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:02,240
You don't think half America's accidentally already duct taping washers in their hands as we speak?

1429
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:10,800
Because if they take guns away what do we got? Sliding. And we washers. And if you can't slide

1430
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:18,560
the children will just shake a heavy can around. But the fourth world war will be fought with washers.

1431
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:26,960
Six Flies you probably won't return to maybe. I mean I just love being at a theme park so if

1432
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:31,920
somebody wants to go I of course I'll go but um Universal I mean I don't know do you want to

1433
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:37,680
talk about Universal? Yes. I loved it. You had a great time. You guys not go to this one together.

1434
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:44,160
I thought a lot about Mike though. Oh that's nice. Wasn't the same there. Did you think of me?

1435
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:50,160
I was thinking of you. That's nice. For sure. No I swear. But that felt a little like stiff

1436
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:55,280
like thinking of like that seems like passing or like not without not with a lot of like feeling.

1437
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,840
I'm talking about like powerful adoration. Oh you're talking about.

1438
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:03,200
I mean I don't want to lie. I don't know. Have you seen the lake house?

1439
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:08,240
No. It's much too bad. Are you talking about a generic lake house or the

1440
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:11,200
the hunter race? Talking about the lake house Mike and I are gonna buy.

1441
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:19,200
I was talking about the movie. I mean I'm into the lake house uh buying it that is uh but I I want

1442
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:24,960
to shout out real quick the Margaritaville interaction I had at City Walk before because

1443
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:31,280
this was what I was high about the whole time. I told Jason this already. I was sitting outside

1444
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:37,680
by the fire pit at Margaritaville waiting for uh two friends to show up and an employee of

1445
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:43,200
Margaritaville rolled by and he said hello Mr. Carlson congratulations on the baby. Welcome back

1446
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:50,720
to this sector and he kept rolling. He kept walking. Whoa. Wow. And I was like wow. This he

1447
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:56,800
never came back never talked to me again. Whoever this was good work sir. Geez. Wow. That made me

1448
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:01,280
feel great and crazy at the same time. Very Truman Show. Sure. Yes. Whenever the actors are

1449
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:07,360
trying to get messages to him. Yes. Yes. So I was congratulated on the baby but then also a City

1450
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:14,880
Walk saga reference thrown in. Wow. Yeah. Really. Like a king. Yes. I did feel like. You were a VIP

1451
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:19,360
somewhere. No one was there too so when I kept when I told my two friends they were like uh okay

1452
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:24,320
that's cool. I was like no no no but you did you hear what I said? I said sector and sector is a

1453
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:30,800
reference to when we did. We did 19 episodes about City Walk. They like it and they still talk

1454
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:37,840
about it and they say the song. He used our linguistic choice. What? What? He used our language.

1455
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:42,880
He used our linguistic. Oh sure. Yeah yeah. He used our term. Yeah. Our term. Like speaking Navi.

1456
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:50,320
So I was uh obsessed with that interaction the rest of the night is what I'm saying.

1457
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:55,840
Yeah. So your brain your mind was occupied. That's what I'm saying. I was occupied. I

1458
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,680
like I can't I feel like I brought it up later in the night too even like just like but you

1459
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:04,240
guys saw that like or you heard that that was cool right and they were like yeah it's cool or no I

1460
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:08,960
ran into my my sister came later and I told her about that and she was like oh oh yeah.

1461
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:16,080
Oh I had a lower key version the other day at Avengers campus. I was at the pin bar and someone

1462
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:19,920
popped up and said hey I like the show can I get a picture and then they just disappeared as quickly

1463
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:24,640
as they appeared and then I drank a beaker full of hard seltzer. Did you say no to the picture?

1464
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,480
No I said of course you didn't have. Oh okay. Yeah. Why are all our fans running away?

1465
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:33,840
Makes it harder to prove. Yeah. We need to take a picture to prove that it happened. Well they're

1466
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:45,920
athletes. That's why. Oh. I just figured it out. Yeah. Oh wow. I had a plastic test tube of

1467
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:54,240
hard seltzer with an obscene amount of boba in it and no straw. I looked around and no one was

1468
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:58,880
being given a straw so I just ate a few mouthfuls of boba at the end of the drink.

1469
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:03,520
I have a question. How many of our listeners have ever listened to this podcast while doing

1470
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:09,360
the battle ropes? The two big ropes that you was like do this. Like how many people have ever

1471
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:14,400
listened to podcast the ride while just ripping on those battle ropes at a gym or in the back

1472
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:20,240
your backyard or something. There's wrestlers who listen. Could be a wrestler. There are a few

1473
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:24,560
wrestlers who listen so I guess that is possible. It could have been the wrestlers. Charles do you

1474
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:29,520
do the ropes? You're in good shape. Would you do the ropes and listen us? Thank you for saying that.

1475
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:38,400
I absolutely would. Have I know. That's too much to ask. I think there's a bigger question of has

1476
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:43,200
anyone ever listened to a podcast while doing the ropes? That might just be the case in general.

1477
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:48,640
Yeah, Rogan. Exclusively Rogan. You're right. I take it back. I wasn't thinking that way.

1478
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:53,520
And then everyone everywhere like they go like damn social justice warriors.

1479
01:13:53,520 --> 01:14:00,720
Right. Yeah. I was thinking of like POOG. What? POOG it's Caperlands podcast. I was thinking of

1480
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:10,240
rope people would not listen to. Rope people. Rope people. There's some doughboys listeners I bet

1481
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:14,320
who do the ropes while they listen to doughboys. Yeah, they live vicariously because they should

1482
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:19,440
not be eating that. The food they cover. Oh I see. Yeah. Yeah. You don't think they roll a McDonald's

1483
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:23,600
and then do the ropes to get rid of the excess. They earn the McDonald's with the ropes. I guess

1484
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:28,800
that's true. By the way thwarted earlier from getting an adult happy meal. Oh yeah you waited

1485
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:35,360
too long. I waited too long. Huh? Who thwarted you? The app. I checked like 10 in the valley.

1486
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:40,080
There's like 10 close by. I was at McDonald's Monday morning at 10 38. You were. You

1487
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:44,960
texted me pretty early. You rope dropped. A grimace toy. Now this is our ropes. It was you

1488
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:50,160
rope dropping McDonald's adult happy meals. That's correct yes because I wanted one of the

1489
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:54,880
the new weird toys that look like it's melting. But it says until the end of the month so I'm

1490
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,880
assuming they'll restock at some point. It's a good question. I don't know if they will. There's four

1491
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:02,320
different weird toys. Do you guys know what I'm talking about? I've not looked up what the adult

1492
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:07,680
happy meal toys are. There's I it's I don't know what it is something called cactus plant. There's

1493
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:12,720
some sort of like art designer McDonald land toys with grimace, hamburger, birdie, and then a

1494
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:18,000
character I've never heard of. Not Ronald. Oh wait where they have the multiple eyes? Yes multiple

1495
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,800
eyes. They look they look scary. It's like a street wear collaboration I think. It's like when

1496
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:28,160
a unique low was doing like sesame street clothing but they had like X's over Big Bird's eyes and

1497
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:34,000
you're not sure why but like it's cool I guess. Okay. So I got a grimace with four eyes. Well

1498
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:38,480
since we're talking about this sort of thing you as you guys you went to Horror Nights.

1499
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:43,360
Did either of you collect all the custom NFTs to show your Horror Nights fandom powered by

1500
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:47,360
Hyper Mint? I have a few of them. Powered by Hyper Mint by Moon Pay?

1501
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:54,880
Oh I'm seizureing from those words. I would have gotten on the moon on the website you see this

1502
01:15:54,880 --> 01:16:02,800
graphic that says ready player me create your avatar. Ready player me? You could get so the

1503
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:06,400
Horror Nights thing this year was that you would scan and you would get an NFT for every maze.

1504
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:11,600
I will say this I couldn't find the QR codes for a lot of these mazes so I ended up with maybe two.

1505
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:16,960
How did you know this? I didn't see any evidence. You asked a good question. I heard people talking

1506
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:22,000
about NFTs and now you're that's I understand now. I'm trying to remember how I heard about it. Maybe

1507
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,320
Instagram or something and I got very like oh man I'm gonna get all the NFTs and then I got two of

1508
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:32,320
them and forgot and then there were signage was not clear. There's also a limited drop of

1509
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:40,480
$185 Universal Monster hoodies. How much is it? $185. Do they look cool though? They look all right.

1510
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:46,320
You can kind of see them. The McDonald's this is a trend because the McDonald's adult happy meals

1511
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:52,720
also coincide with a website where you can buy like $60 McDonald's shirts. Hip like art McDonald's

1512
01:16:52,720 --> 01:17:00,080
shirts. So McDonald's is really doing it. Yeah some of my favorite artists work for McDonald's.

1513
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:05,440
That's it's always been the case but now more than ever. Sure freelancers. Is capitalism doing

1514
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:11,200
good stuff? That's again. Art jackets. And the uh now now this is not a hip this is just a classic

1515
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:16,240
they're bringing back the the buckets. Remember the bucket the classic McDonald's buckets.

1516
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:21,680
I'm not gonna make the same mistake with the buckets. What mistake? I slept I slept on the

1517
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:26,160
adult happy meal. Jason wanted one of the toys. I was going to Disneyland the next day. I was like

1518
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:30,640
I should not eat a Big Mac value meal. A Big Mac adult happy meal. Could have gotten nuggets.

1519
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:34,400
Could have gotten nuggets. Yeah it's like a 10 piece nugget. That's way too many nuggets.

1520
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,120
Put them in the freezer. That's true.

1521
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:46,400
So yeah the buckets are coming back which is fun. But yeah I have grimace. Fun. Fun. Oh I said it.

1522
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:51,200
I think listeners should take 10 shots every time you say fun.

1523
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:57,200
10. Let's see what happens. Let's see what happens to that Patreon. Yeah.

1524
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:04,960
Oh no all our pay has been docked. I don't know you know if the credit cards keep renewing then

1525
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:11,120
oh that's a terrible thing to say. You know it's weird a lot a bunch of our listeners died but the

1526
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:15,520
credit card kept renewing. And they had no way in their lives to cancel the credit card.

1527
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,840
And people thought they were alive because they were paying for this Patreon for years.

1528
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:26,560
They're probably fine. All their OnlyFans and Podcast the Riot Patreon just kept

1529
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:32,800
clicking away. I'm getting concerned that they died. Somebody check somebody log into their Patreon.

1530
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:39,600
They always give someone your Patreon passwords in the event of your death. And your OnlyFans

1531
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:44,640
password. And your OnlyFans. Yeah. You take out life insurance. Send us your OnlyFans passwords.

1532
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,600
We're gonna isolate that clip.

1533
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:56,640
Next week on Podcast the Riot. Send us your OnlyFans. Password. All right so what horror

1534
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:02,160
nights? Highlights? Yeah. Stuff you liked? Well I'm trying to think yeah the NFT is kind of a bust.

1535
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:08,400
Wasn't so fun like I thought it would be. Fun. Fun. The big kicker do you want to just go right

1536
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:13,200
into the big picture? Sure. Do you want to work your way into it? Is the kicker what I think it is?

1537
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:22,160
Baby you better believe it. Is it the weekend? Yeah. It was great. I wish you could see the

1538
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:26,480
I wish you guys could do the weekend at the very least. It was fantastic. Because I love okay so

1539
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:32,480
what I love I've said this many times on the show. I like a loud douchey pool party where the music

1540
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:36,640
the bass is hitting and I love the outside of the weekend's maze because they're blasting it as if

1541
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:41,360
it's like a Vegas pool party. So do you get this any better than we do? We've never understood why

1542
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:50,560
you like this. I actually I hate that but but I get but of course I can access the irony you know.

1543
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:55,680
I don't even know I mean there's irony there but I don't even know if it is irony. I think I was

1544
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:59,600
trying to analyze this too because we've tried to figure out what it is and why I like it. I like to

1545
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:03,360
go to almost any concert doesn't matter if I know I won't pay necessarily but if it was free and I

1546
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:11,200
don't have anything to do I'll go you name the band I'll go. Okay the Beatles. I'm there. I'll see them.

1547
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:18,400
Okay a Beatles tribute band. I did it a month ago. John talks about himself. John talks about

1548
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:24,320
John's death in the third person. Yes but also when we're talking about Transformers a ride that

1549
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:30,320
pummeled you I think I there's a I have like a sensory like I like a lot of stimulation. I like

1550
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:36,720
to check on the phone. I have all these alerts. I think my brain is better when it's getting hit

1551
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:44,960
with a lot. You're a fast boy. I'm not saying I'm a fast. Oh a new term. I am a fast boy but I think

1552
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:51,840
it's probably like to try to keep the bad thoughts out or something like keep it away keep getting

1553
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:57,520
pummeled with stimuli and a variety of stimuli so I don't have to like sit with myself for too long

1554
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:01,600
and I think it extends to like Transformers getting the shit kicked out of me on that ride.

1555
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:07,280
A part like a pool party where you're just music is unbearably loud. I don't want bad thoughts.

1556
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:16,800
I'm a fast boy. Stimulate me. Yeah. Sounds like an awful club song. I don't like bad thoughts.

1557
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:22,480
No we're gonna sample that and make a beat out of that. If somebody in the audience could sample

1558
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:27,760
what Scott said and I think it's done now. I think it's already been done. I think that would be

1559
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:34,400
a good point. I'm gonna run for president. And then if it ends with Jason saying send me your

1560
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:39,360
OnlyFans password that'll be the end of it. We gotta go picture. I think we'll have a hit on our

1561
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:46,080
hands. So I think that's what it is. I think that's it. Again I would not do that like three days in

1562
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:51,600
a row at Vegas but I like one couple hours there. I mean I don't have an opinion about the weekend

1563
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:56,240
at all. Like he's somebody that's not really in my consciousness but then when I was waiting in line

1564
01:21:56,240 --> 01:22:05,360
I was like oh wait I actually like all these songs. The songs are all pretty good. I don't go out of my way to listen to them but if they're just on yeah I'm like oh yeah these are

1565
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:13,680
yeah I'm like but the the vibe of it was pretty like chic for a haunted house and it was it was very

1566
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:19,440
VH it was very like MTV movie awards. That was the energy of it. Yeah yes that's yes like yeah because you

1567
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:26,560
would see like in a big big elaborate stage picture for a performance with like dummy weekends or

1568
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:31,440
something and there was like full of the maze was full of like fake weekends and dead weekend. Little

1569
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:37,520
Richard weekend looked a lot like Little Richard. The hair especially. It was a weird like this is actually

1570
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:41,200
Little Richard. They bought like last minute Little Richards and we're like yeah this will have to do.

1571
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:48,240
And it's like that you go into like a club room and there's like a lady dancing and then she

1572
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:53,040
gets her throat slashed. It was just I didn't know what to expect. I was like the weekend that's

1573
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:57,440
going to be my least favorite room because who cares. I mean thing because who cares about this

1574
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:02,160
you know this just feels like America like this is just America. See this is where we're different. I

1575
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:06,880
heard weekend maze I go it's gonna be my favorite one and I was right. Well because I couldn't even

1576
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:13,760
imagine what that would mean you know that so but then the fact that it had this sort of 80s like

1577
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:19,600
it felt like a clubby like 80s music video. Yes that is what it was. With lots of lasers and your

1578
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:24,160
lots of mirrored things. A big casino like a big slot machine all of a sudden you walk in there's

1579
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:30,160
a big slot machine like evil slot machine. It was so elevated for a haunted house it looked so good

1580
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:34,400
and then there was a whole plastic surgery. There's sort of like an LA nightmare too like a lot of

1581
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:40,720
there was a woman that was like carving out a man's face and then being like he's so hot and just kept

1582
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:45,360
saying he's so hot over and over and over and I was like all right kind of this is kind of cool

1583
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:52,000
actually I like this. So that was good delivery. That was very good. Horror nights the lorry the

1584
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:57,760
Jamie Lee Curtis groundlings edition was great. Got some equity people in there you know some

1585
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:03,840
sag people. The big highlight too for the weekend maze is that you go in the Super Bowl rooms you

1586
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:10,160
go through the Super Bowl maze mirror rooms with the jiff we've seen the jiff of the weekend

1587
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:16,880
where he's like lost and putting his arms up. Yes okay and it's so fun to be in the Super Bowl

1588
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:23,760
room. It's about is it the most iconic moment or is the most iconic room because there was the Dr.

1589
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:28,800
Dre Snoop Dogg when they had rooms like there's little set pieces. You're asking what is the most

1590
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:34,240
iconic Super Bowl room? Yes that is what I'm asking. Because there's been a couple of these lately.

1591
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:39,920
Yes that is not Timberlake because he came out of a room and it was it was boring in there.

1592
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:45,120
You're right. He's at the bottom of the list. Was Katy Perry in a room at the Super Bowl?

1593
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:48,960
She had the shark we know the shark. She must have been in a room at some point in her life.

1594
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,960
That's true but on camera in the halftime of the Super Bowl I don't think so.

1595
01:24:53,600 --> 01:25:00,160
Aerosmith and Britney Spears and in sync no rooms just on stage. Rooms are new rooms are in the

1596
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:05,280
less Super Bowl rooms are in the last four years. Yeah Prince was not in a room. Springsteen not in

1597
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:12,560
a room. We didn't have the technology you could only film from up above. Yeah this was this is

1598
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:16,880
the first I guess I was excited because it was like it's not just you're going to be in a room

1599
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:21,200
you've seen a movie now you're seeing a room that you've seen on the Super Bowl. Yeah so that's what

1600
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:26,720
is exciting about it for me. A different type of room. Yeah a different type of room. I feel like

1601
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:32,800
the room hit you harder than the room hit a lot of other people. That's possible. Jason what did

1602
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:39,040
what did you think about this room? I thought this house I thought. No no no the I mean the

1603
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:45,680
weekend. Were you ever like the room? I clocked the room. I did clock the room. I remembered it

1604
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:54,480
from the Super Bowl. His other big performance summer 2020 he did the MTV was it the I think

1605
01:25:54,480 --> 01:26:01,760
music video awards and he likes the video music awards video music awards VMAs and he

1606
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:07,760
takes the year was kind of um he was on the top of this building I looked it up it's called the

1607
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:14,880
Edge it is a hundred story skyscraper in New York and he was like stumbling around like the the

1608
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:21,760
helipad and then a helicopter was also circling him in the air there wasn't a ton of new items

1609
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:27,920
in the summer of 2020 there wasn't a lot of new media so it was just like oh yes I don't even know

1610
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:32,880
what this is I've not seen this oh it's great okay go home and watch it he's always on top he was on

1611
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:37,040
top of the Hollywood sign with Lana Del Rey too right wasn't that I think that yeah something like

1612
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:43,840
that he's gotta get down I also heard uncut gems with the weekends and is he in the gyms isn't the

1613
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:49,840
way at the weekend in uncut gems that's Adam Sandler oh I said the star oh yeah you idiot

1614
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:55,680
yeah it's the weekend am I crazy audience is gonna tear you up for that one dude I could see how you

1615
01:26:55,680 --> 01:27:02,240
thought that though I forget where where I heard this I feel like I read it a couple of places at

1616
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:09,280
this point but like the opening night uh someone went through the maze and when they came out like

1617
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:15,040
someone else was like hey you know that room where there was a few weekends like stabbing people or

1618
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:21,760
something uh one of those fake weekends was the weekend sure like that was actually him yes weekend

1619
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:26,240
he's having the like the thing with Sandler's girlfriend in uncut gems in the bathroom

1620
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:34,000
oh okay with Julia Fox Mike I knew that I was playing pretend that was a trick you were in it

1621
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:41,200
it was that was a haunt for you oh I'm scared I was scared I was being gaslit yeah the weekend

1622
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:47,280
that was the highlight I mean the after our hours bar did you go did you see it what's the no what's

1623
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:51,520
the after hours so they oh above Jurassic world above Jurassic world we so yeah I couldn't even

1624
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:57,360
look at it was so busy it freaked me out I got really excited because they had turned it into

1625
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:02,880
like a neon red bar of some kind which of course it wasn't anything that special but they called

1626
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:07,920
it the weekends after hours bar so I that was enough for me we I was like yeah let's go run

1627
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:14,000
up the stairs the line was yeah it was crazy insane did you get in no well because like there's no

1628
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,880
time to do anything else yeah so literally I was like I will wait for this but the problem is we'll

1629
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:25,200
run out of time I saw a few videos of people who would go on and recorded houses and stuff on media

1630
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:31,760
night I think was the ordinary adventures one day they were like the wait for the weekend bars 90

1631
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:37,040
minutes it's about there was like the longest wait for anything yeah but they did bring pizza fries

1632
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:42,240
out to Hollywood oh I didn't even know that yeah this was a thing that people were talking about

1633
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:47,200
this is a Florida thing it's a Florida thing we hadn't had before it is french fries with

1634
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:52,400
marinara sauce and mozzarella and pepperoni and you could get it at the after hours now yes and

1635
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:57,840
apparently was only at the after hours bar this year that's also such an inconvenient like the

1636
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:03,680
balcony of the Jurassic Park restaurant it's not the easiest like crowd flow location yeah that's

1637
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:08,560
true but it's a great location oh great location like it's a beautiful dress patty I would get

1638
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:15,760
married there yeah you're absolutely right it feels like it's a little bit of Hawaii paradise

1639
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:23,440
yeah right and right in born LA right I really like it I don't need to go there do you know any sort of

1640
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:31,200
girl boss-esque scientist who could perform the ceremony someone who's seen murder yeah

1641
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:38,480
it made her stronger would love to go back to our old place of employment someone who adopted a

1642
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:48,640
cloned girl and moved to the forest with her old co-worker the terror tram oh we gotta talk about

1643
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:54,400
that's maybe my second favorite thing really I didn't they could have been it could have been

1644
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:59,120
they could have fleshed out more but I really liked yeah the nope area was amazing yeah that

1645
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:03,920
was really cool but then you're going so the terror tram it takes you if you don't I mean

1646
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:08,480
you were a tram and I worked the terror tram when I did I've never been to a

1647
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:15,920
haunt just as a attendee but I did drop people off to get scared well when they drop you off

1648
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:22,640
you this time around you walk through a lot of just kind of like it was weird how low quality

1649
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:28,880
a lot of it was there was an area that was just cutouts of like cats just pictures of cats and

1650
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:33,360
then there were people dressed as cats scaring you and there was just a track that was just like

1651
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:40,080
like over and over and it was like this is not the horror nights I love and then you get and then

1652
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:45,040
you get good coodles and you get to this I mean it is it's incredible that you get to walk through

1653
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:50,000
the psycho motel it's just incredible that you get to like that feels that's awesome that you're

1654
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:55,840
able to just walk around so psycho motel so yeah you get on the tram it's like a normal like tram

1655
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:59,440
that they do for the tram tour where they show you the movie the magic of the movies

1656
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:02,880
but they've got new video and they introduce you to a new character

1657
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:08,800
that they put that they say is like an old universal character I think they've perhaps done

1658
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:13,600
it before this character has been there before I was googling and there seemed to be a history

1659
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:18,320
in a way that made it seem like this is not all new to the internet okay so I apologize

1660
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:27,040
coodles is presented by Eli Roth as well oh from the twisted mind of Eli Roth for the visionary

1661
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:32,960
the dark visionary mind to be like all right uh so there's a clown named coodles scott I don't know

1662
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:37,520
if you this is this a little do you want to look him up maybe see if you would find him scary

1663
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:42,240
but like coodles they're like oh he was an old clown around the this was he on the set or was

1664
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:46,400
he in the tram he was like the fun tram mascot I believe they're talking about something like that

1665
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:51,280
oh they're reaped they're presenting it like in the 60s or something there was this fun character

1666
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:57,600
yes okay okay gotcha um and then he likes to he like went missing and he started killing tram

1667
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:04,400
operate tram tour Scott and Allison mm-hmm those were their names because my my tram lady was like

1668
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:13,920
and if we see Scott and Allison and yeah then they dump you right in front of the start of a maze

1669
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:17,840
and there's coodles was right out there I thought they were gonna hide coodles but they don't he's

1670
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:23,040
just they don't hide coodles yeah yeah he's just waving to you and then you pretty quickly walk

1671
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:29,600
like through the Bates Motel yeah up to the house uh Bates house I guess I always think about how

1672
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:35,520
crazy it is that there is a house like just on top of the hill that looks down at that war of the

1673
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:41,120
world's plane crash just the back oh yeah if you look out the back yeah yeah just see somebody lives

1674
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:46,880
there yeah I mean it's amazing yeah that's your view and then at one point in time probably the

1675
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:52,320
owner of that house had just like picturesque yeah you with the valley and then back we'll go

1676
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:59,520
one morning to a plane crash oh god it's been smoking every day since smoking plane crash uh

1677
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:03,120
so yeah you walk through the Bates Motel you're getting scared coodles like there's many people

1678
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:07,760
playing coodles spoiler alert uh you're getting scared like people coming in and out of rooms

1679
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:13,120
like that's all pretty fun and then you walk up and they ask you do you want to take a photo

1680
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:19,680
with Norman yeah I saw some people doing did you of course I did I love to take photos with

1681
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:27,440
characters uh and they give you a very specific instruction that I did not hear they said do not

1682
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:35,440
kiss Norman and I said hell no I'm kissing the man on the lips and I gave a bugs bunny style kiss

1683
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:42,560
I grabbed his head uh they said do not do not step on the stairs I did not hear this

1684
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:50,320
I walked like next to Norman almost on the stairs and Norman Bates in character goes don't stand on

1685
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:56,240
my stairs wow and I go oh Joe I'm so sorry I'm so sorry but then he stayed there of course and

1686
01:33:56,240 --> 01:34:03,360
took the photo so and and I could feel why because the steps are not like they feel rickety I don't

1687
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:06,800
know why they wouldn't make those stronger I don't know why they wouldn't fix it but it definitely

1688
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,960
felt like you you were like it could break right through that's probably why that'd be kind of fun

1689
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:17,200
if you broke fantastic if I spoke with broke the psycho house if it all collapsed off of yes like

1690
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:22,720
how's the guys like boltergeist imploded like boltergeist leaving only you standing like it all

1691
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:28,960
collapses perfectly around you uh-huh whoops so you get to meet Norman and take the photo with him

1692
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:34,400
which for horror nights he really should be attacking you if I had a gripe I understand

1693
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:38,800
it's fun to take a photo with him but it should be like you take a photo with like mother's skeleton

1694
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:45,360
right he attacks you earlier yeah it's also you he's one of those characters where Anthony Perkins

1695
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:50,320
is just so Norman Bates that it's not an interchangeable it feels there's something

1696
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:54,480
about how he just looks like a realtor or something there's just something about him that

1697
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:57,920
didn't look let me find the photo let me see how what the like how the likeness I mean I don't know

1698
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:01,680
who you got but my Norman my Norman was a little is that why you didn't take the photo because

1699
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:07,280
you're like this doesn't feel right yeah it's it's amazing they do find a good amount of people

1700
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:13,920
to do that it's really specific I mean he's kind of just a guy but like I don't know I've seen way

1701
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:19,120
better slender pale I wonder if they have like a lot of wiry game in who moved to LA need a job

1704
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:35,600
David Schwimmer perhaps a little oh well no you know he's actually he's not bad that's not that's

1705
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:40,400
not the kind of guy how many knives do we give him on the norm and looks he gets eight knives out

1706
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:45,600
of 10 he looks like somebody I know supporting cast member he's got the pomade like hair like

1707
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:53,760
yeah yeah yeah my guy was like a Dylan Baker type it wasn't wasn't the same uh-huh a Dylan Baker

1710
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:25,280
fighting but also making up and getting along gummo ride it out ordinary people

1711
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:34,880
colon in ordinary people ordinary people rising so then you go from the baits house you go to war

1712
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:40,800
the world set and I can't it's that's before the cats I agree with you the cats part is very

1713
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:45,440
confusing yeah the cats and then bats and then you and then you walk down the hallway that has

1714
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:51,040
pictures of bats and then there are men with bats yes they're just like yeah yeah so you're just

1715
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:56,640
making any connection okay I don't yeah I like that we were that we were outside I think I was

1716
01:36:56,640 --> 01:37:01,360
like you know it's a nice night it was a nice night my night was less than nice but then you get to

1717
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:07,680
you get to nope land and that was amazing it's the whatever that's called the town yeah it's the

1718
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:14,480
like Jupiter's clam yeah yeah and it's all but it's it's it's nope mashed up with the us

1719
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:20,720
the us care like the us jumpsuit people are out with the scissors because you can't really do

1720
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:26,880
anything with like nope is about looking up in the sky you know right scare people for those

1721
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:33,840
creatures are pretty delicate and hard to reproduce in any meaningful way really pull out some stops to

1722
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:41,200
make a spaceship yeah complicated with the shots even just from the trailer it's all open spaces

1723
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:47,440
and pastures and mountain towns and yeah so good move they yeah they put the us and us was one of

1724
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:53,280
my favorite mazes whenever that was I loved the us maze and also I think was was Jordan interviewed

1725
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:58,320
on the tram too before I'm trying to think they showed a clip of the month the zombie monsters

1726
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:04,080
which yeah also they promoted zombie monsters on the tram oh interesting um and maybe there was

1727
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:10,400
like an interview with Jordan there was like a cut up featurette of him talking about all his movies

1728
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:16,400
yeah yes that's right energy yeah so what I really want to talk about is my pal rob zombie and his new

1729
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:24,160
passing the torch I'm retiring I know I had a good run there but I I know it's not getting

1730
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:30,240
better than that no one can fill my shoes like did they ever do this I'm asking more questions

1731
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:35,520
I don't only answer to uh did they ever was there ever part of the terror tram where they took you to

1732
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:40,560
the monster's house which is on the wisteria lane it's a little far yeah wait because then you're

1733
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:46,080
hoofing it up yeah the hill that's the hardest part to walk and you got to dress it up but you've

1734
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:51,440
got to redress it like the monster's house yeah do we know maybe move it and rebuild you should know

1735
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:58,080
this which desperate housewife lived in the monster's uh this was literally my audition and

1736
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:03,120
I don't oh no it was so hard for me every time I'm sure I've said this before but just like

1737
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:14,080
remembering and then and then the blue house is the home of brie played by marcia cross is that

1738
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:18,800
one right did I get that right yeah I don't know that the details are right but marcia cross was

1739
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:24,400
the actor there was who played brie or was just on the show what's that was terry hatcher yes terry

1740
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:28,960
hatcher is one of them I don't remember her but this was all required there's things as a tour

1741
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:33,440
guide that you can say if you want but they like really cut a deal with desperate housewives you

1742
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:40,800
have to say all of these names the actress and the character and and the house and god I like I would

1743
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:45,920
just melt down having to remember these five names of a show I don't watch anytime I was on the tram

1744
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:49,840
that would usually felt like there was a little bit of a buzz every time we go down with stereo

1745
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:56,160
that felt like for a while that was the draw yeah oh wow okay this is the golden girls house too is

1746
01:39:56,160 --> 01:40:02,240
that there no that's disney that was disney world for a while even though it was really weird

1747
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:08,240
because the golden girls predated the theme park so like wait a minute why is it here they built

1748
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:13,920
like a fake golden girls house yeah for the exes in the house because it would have they make the

1749
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:18,800
show if they didn't have this there was other shows that were well wisteria lane I can't remember

1750
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:26,080
them scott you should know all of them of course uh animal house might have been the monsters house

1751
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:30,960
too the monsters house was repurposed yeah yeah it was I know that for a fact I know that and then

1752
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:35,520
they were also I was there when they were this is another story I've told before uh they were they

1753
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:40,560
had built a new house at the end of wisteria lane for the mockingbird lane pilot for the singer

1754
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:46,800
fuller monsters jerry o'connell show so I was they were like and now we're building a new

1755
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:52,000
monsters house for this new show called the mockingbird lane I have no memory of this

1756
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:58,640
I was like it's come up it's only come up a lot of times lately we just keep we just love the

1757
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:03,440
look we're all big brain singers it's obviously you want to talk about it as much as possible

1758
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:07,520
I just I'm sure we've talked about I just wanted to know which desperate house wife

1759
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:11,280
lives in the monsters house that's all I want to know that's why I asked the question

1760
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:16,320
and if you could walk into the house on a trip to her tram that would be fun maybe if the zombie

1761
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:22,960
movie is popular what's the zombie movie the rob zombie monsters movie you tell me you all would

1762
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:27,600
know more than I do it was in the top 10 what else I don't think there's any more green lights

1763
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:33,600
left in LA after um that movie well they moved in the croatia where they shot right right do you

1764
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:38,400
anybody can film whatever they want as long as they go to croatia there was a uh I'm trying to

1765
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:42,960
think just other other hits real quick uh they had an they had a few more like original may

1766
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:47,520
usually it's all all ip they had an original I should look up what the name of it the hotel

1767
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:53,280
one I like that one which is cool and they had like original characters yeah and like it was very

1768
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:58,480
tower of terror like very old time hollywood serial killer who kind of looked like two-face

1769
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:05,280
and he would uh just attack you in every room I have his name somewhere let me find it sorry

1770
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:09,360
I'm trying to think of I'm busy I'm still trying to find out who lived in the monster

1771
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:14,160
I'm also working on that everybody's looking up shit we gotta be here we gotta be present

1772
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:18,480
I'm putting this down Dan you can look up what you want I'll find it later this is for me I'm

1773
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:24,480
pulling myself out of this I'm looking everybody back in the eye not gonna we're all looking at all

1774
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:28,480
of us glued to our that's fine when you get when you we do the when we do the episode where you

1775
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:34,240
do the whole tour you will have to have that piece of information oh that I am gonna feel the same

1776
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:41,840
pressure I felt in 2006 and then uh like it's still right now in my head one of the names is

1777
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:48,080
Paula and I don't think there's a Paula on Desperate Housewives that's Paula D her

1778
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:53,280
brief sitcom was filmed can we punch this because we've been teasing this for years that scott's

1779
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:58,320
gonna do the full tour as an episode can we just get one of our friends who are currently working

1780
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:02,720
on the lot and just we just jump in a golf cart and we just shoot a video of you doing it on a

1781
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:08,880
golf cart for us sure that would be that's hey that's I'm there it's up to one of our lot friends

1782
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:13,600
okay how good of friends are they you should yeah I think I think we can do it the whole tour

1783
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:21,680
I think that's cute that's that's content that's nice that's what our tough athletic uh listeners

1784
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:26,240
want to hear that's what them while they're doing the battle ropes that's some rope damn scott's

1785
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:30,000
crushing these desperate housewives facts it's really motivating me to keep roping

1786
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:36,160
so I'm still trying to find the uh the name of this there's like a there's an order the killer's

1787
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:41,440
name is really fun and I've completely lost it so somebody's got to say well I don't know what

1788
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:46,000
else to do because I didn't go there somebody else is gonna have to say something else it was great

1789
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:52,160
I love I love haunted houses when they feel like real places and it felt like a real hotel like

1790
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:56,000
you're that's what I liked about the us it's like you're in a living room yeah and especially when

1791
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,400
there weren't people sometimes there'd be no scare actors in the room and you'd just be walking

1792
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:04,800
through yes you know an open house and you're just like this is actually the scariest thing

1793
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:12,720
the universal um hotel house that is where the walking dead used to be yeah we say that yeah and

1794
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:20,240
man these lines at universal are out of control I don't know how people I was I we bought the like

1795
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:25,840
express passes and I feel like people who didn't buy them only did like three things it's or you

1796
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:31,040
just or you have to commit to it's we it's after hours bar and then you got yeah you have to do

1797
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:36,240
yeah if you don't have the express you have to like get there either early or like stay pretty

1798
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:41,200
late because if you stay pretty late everything gets the wait is at midnight though right not too

1799
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:47,840
okay well then yeah maybe you can do it okay I finally have the name uh it is maximilian de vil

1803
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:09,920
the eager points there's a lot of that it's usually yeah your point it's usually it's and

1804
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:15,600
it's usually yelling about a 60s sitcom or about like a soda that Jason hasn't had yet and he's

1805
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:19,200
like I'm gonna have it tomorrow you gotta have it today well Jason will give me a point back

1807
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:30,000
oh yeah I was gonna say oh okay am I the the did you do the death eaters oh walking through

1808
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:34,960
harry potter yes yeah that was the highlight I take it back that was my favorite thing of like

1809
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:39,760
all yeah it was up there with the weekend for me because they do like scary like death eater

1810
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:43,920
people with the wands and whatever and there's all this like green laser there's a lot of smoke

1811
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:49,920
you walk through like the back of diagonale or hogsmeade whatever it is and suddenly there's

1812
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:53,440
like all this smoke and then there's all these death eaters and there's somebody doing like a

1813
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:58,640
big performance yeah they've all got wands it just I felt I felt like I was in harry potter

1814
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:04,480
it is it is good and it's not like nobody scares you yeah like nobody jumps out really but they're

1815
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:08,320
like in like a little corner and like smoke is shooting up and the green is there and you can

1816
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:13,360
just like hang out and it's like a very good atmosphere it just reminded me how much I love

1817
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:21,440
harry potter I hadn't connected to that love in a while sure any reason yeah no just a preference

1818
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:29,440
okay all right um to answer your question how do people just get to the I think if you uh really

1819
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:34,160
want to do this and you want to spend two hundred dollars for one night you can get a frequent

1820
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:41,200
oh yeah freaking fear or an ultimate fear pass and the ultimate fear pass you can go every night

1821
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:47,520
of the month yeah and the other one you can go you only have 27 nights you are able to go how

1822
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:52,960
much is the ultimate fear pass and will you do it with me next year and get the ultimate fear

1823
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:58,960
pass it's 329 okay hopefully it doesn't go up too much next year when we do it

1824
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:08,400
and we'll go every night oh yeah we have to so it's a different between it says up to 27 nights or

1825
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:13,120
up to 33 nights so you're really only getting another week okay well next year we'll do it

1826
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:23,040
and you guys you only have pizza fries for 27 nights in a month well that's your super size me

1827
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:29,680
I'm trying to think what other real quick well uh mazes uh killer clowns was back

1828
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:35,200
yeah we did that before scarecrow one I don't know oh yeah yeah but it was yeah the one thing

1829
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:39,760
I liked was the birds poop on you you walk through yeah there's a bunch of birds and like waters

1830
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:46,560
you get shit on yeah it's good did you guys see this giant crow creature like bird creature

1831
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:52,320
with a top hat on stilts that was like yes skulking around that looked pretty cool you'd like you'd

1832
01:47:52,320 --> 01:48:00,160
have like that crow we uh crowena why you just you didn't even have to look it up you just had

1833
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:09,280
crowena hold it sorry I almost forgot there's a very aggressive uh like flames that shoot out

1834
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:13,920
when you're on like the main drag of universal which I like they're like blasting some sort of

1835
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:19,600
like metal music usually yeah it almost feels a little like the wrong tone for it I agree I'd

1836
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:28,240
never like metal ever but especially that's the side of Halloween that I'm like no no like yeah

1837
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:32,960
like I mean it's like slash is wailing on the guitar I think that's what it is at least in

1838
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:37,520
previous years it's been slash it should it should be like Danny Elfman energy in that area

1839
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:42,000
like it should be like you know you should feel like welcome to the world of movies rather than

1840
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:48,160
shredding on guitar lately have you seen this he's shredding looks like a pro wrestler yeah he's on

1841
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:54,560
the battle ropes he's playing at the bowl in a couple weeks yeah I'd like to see that he has

1842
01:48:54,560 --> 01:49:00,960
bright flock like a like what is it shock red hair is that the word shock flock what is it shock

1843
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:06,880
shock is a flock of red hair like several redheaded birds yeah yeah a few birds on his

1844
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:14,320
head so he's got red hair he's very vascular he's so very baby and jack yes yeah wow he's doing the

1845
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:19,440
not drinking water for like 24 hours to get vascular he's like playing like the simpsons theme

1846
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:26,080
on like rock guitar or at least somebody in the band is rock guitar yeah you or as most people

1847
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:31,760
put it guitar well you can play jazz guitar you can play rock guitar you can play prog rock

1848
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:36,560
he did coachella and and there was the simpsons they started with the regular simpsons and then

1849
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:41,680
they rocked it out but it was a metal simpson good for him so yeah he's playing the bowl in

1850
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:46,720
a few weeks I'm not gonna go to that I'm scared he's gonna jump out and he is eat my face he

1851
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:52,480
looks like a zombie now frightening but and again then he does like uh oh and go boingo song at the

1852
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:59,440
end I take back that he looks like I would love to work with him he's a legend absolutely

1853
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:05,840
I mean it really solidified in my mind that I just love horror nights horror nights is how I feel

1854
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:10,640
about universal where like even though I've been a million times I still am transported to the movie

1855
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:19,200
magic world and nots has like special it has like special diy like the whole if the whole town comes

1856
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:26,160
together we'll pull it off like energy yeah yeah and then six legs just felt like like a coke

1857
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:35,120
commercial from 1992 1992 it's the same coke it's the same pallets of coke the same machines

1858
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:42,960
mrs taz is in the commercial with a bikini yeah you were helping you were helping build the

1859
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:50,560
confidence of some very scared you were actually you were the scary element by just being older

1860
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:55,040
than them and walking past them so you really helped them overcome their fear

1861
01:50:56,560 --> 01:51:01,600
they're already confused because all the fixtures and buildings are sun bleached everywhere they

1862
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:10,080
turn they haven't seen a sherman williams paint paint store in their life uh uh real quick before

1863
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:16,480
we go the biggest thing that I realized the night of the nots event was that there is now

1864
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:21,920
a taco bell in the walmart by the portillo's in pointe park and this is very exciting to me

1865
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:27,280
but you didn't get taco bell no you just hung out there I just was I stopped in the walmart

1866
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:33,360
you cruise because we I this was if anyone saw this tweet this was true that I just I hadn't seen

1867
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:38,880
my phone in an hour I went and looked at it and there was the text exchange oh my god has the

1868
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:46,480
taco bell in the boyna park walmart always been there no response from us no it's new

1869
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:52,480
you answered to yourself yeah yes I said wow it's new this is like all right straight to

1870
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:57,600
twitter this is such a mic encapsulated this was not I was not being performative at all this was

1871
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:01,840
literally just my reactions in real time and then scott posted it without my consent my consent to

1872
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:09,120
twitter uh you know thought about asking but uh I'm not upset um I was excited to learn that there

1873
01:52:09,120 --> 01:52:13,280
was now there was something in there before and I forget what it was what I think it was a subway

1874
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:18,640
why do you know what was in the walmart in pointe park I know there's I know there's things you like

1875
01:52:18,640 --> 01:52:23,600
in pointe park like nots berry farm the pirate show but the walmart is a walmart well yeah

1876
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:28,640
statistically it's likely it was a subway in there most of them have subways in there I just have not

1877
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:34,800
seen a taco taco bell in a walmart before so I was excited by that it's just that those brands

1878
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:41,280
walmart x taco bell in x pointe park how was the energy was everyone excited it was not well

1879
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:46,960
people were not there like they had the key they had the new like ipad system for ordering

1880
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:53,280
but people were not ordering there hang on you went in but didn't get food from there well we

1881
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:56,960
were going to nots and I knew there was some vented to johnny rockets but why'd you go in

1882
01:52:56,960 --> 01:53:01,120
just to see it I had to go to use the bathroom I know anyway and I also went in to check for the

1883
01:53:01,120 --> 01:53:06,400
toys yeah oh but I did I think I went in there mainly to use the bathroom but also I have to

1884
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:11,280
check the toys and I did get something from my friend I found a mummy toy that he was looking

1885
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:18,160
for tom cruise mummy no they don't do this okay no one's done those so you got an elizabeth moss

1886
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:26,880
invisible man toy from another world one of the last new releases from the old world there are

1887
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:32,320
rob zombie monster toys coming though and I have one of them for the rest of our lives yeah forever

1888
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:38,720
10 a year we're all gonna get gifted them so many times well charles what's a what takes the cake

1889
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:45,280
then it seems like universal is the winner overall it feels unfair because they are the most financed

1890
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:52,960
entity but yeah it just doesn't it just I loved it I really loved it and uh everybody had fun

1891
01:53:52,960 --> 01:54:01,280
it was pretty funny in a very fundamental way I'm so curious I really this I I say all I know is

1892
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:11,440
that I say pants also instead of like pants funny pants welcome to my world it also it really sounds

1914
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:26,560
that's right because we talked about that with john gabris big like storied history of stuff a lot of

1915
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:30,560
shooting done at adventure land yeah a lot of stuff is shot there I walked through I mean it was

1916
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:36,800

1918
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:46,400
oh cool just for that shot yeah so that was that was cool wait yeah so I mean that's like

1919
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:49,440
because we talk about all the time about things that film and theme parks yeah how would it how

1920
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:53,920
do you feel to like have it it's yours for I don't know how long you were there well first of all it

1921
01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:58,640
was supposed to be called the happy place but um it was supposed to be like disney world but then

1922
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:04,960
because of clearance issues there is a happy place in universal studios in osaka there is like

1923
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:10,240
an area or something called the happy place and it did not clear so we had to call it merry merry

1924
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:16,720
land which I was just like it's not nearly as meaningful um for the story and then it just

1925
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:20,640
kept getting notched down from like I think we're gonna shoot knots very far I think we're gonna

1926
01:57:20,640 --> 01:57:26,800
like do like a day in southern California and it just yeah I mean like everything was search party

1927
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:33,280
it all just that was like I guess we're just shooting in New York again but you set the bar

1928
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:38,880
high and hopefully you land somewhere yeah exactly yeah so then we went settled for adventure

1929
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:44,880
adventure land and uh yeah I mean it was fun we made up a fake uh fake theme park I was the one

1930
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:49,520
I meant was the Jeff Goldblum the like the journey to the center of the year I mean I guess that's not

1931
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:54,800
technically well it's it's like a reveal I guess but that's like extremely theme parky yeah yeah

1932
01:57:55,120 --> 01:58:01,600
in the that was green screen on the out you know like through the windows and then the reference

1933
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:07,200
I gave the art department was um the back to the future ride when you're going through the canyon

1934
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:13,520
of like through the volcano oh yeah yeah like everything prehistoric before yeah dinosaur

1935
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:19,200

1938
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:43,200
centrifugal force and a bunch of heaters it's all the build up to a a restaurant yeah ultimately

1939
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:49,600
much like mars 2112 yes this is our name very much circling back to Jurassic world that scene

1940
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:53,920
