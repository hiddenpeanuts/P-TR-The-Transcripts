1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,280
Welcome to Podcasts that Ride the Second Gate.

3
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,760
I'm Jason Sheridan joined as always Scott Gairdner.

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,940
Hi, here and ready.

5
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:27,920
Mike Carlson.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,740
Hello, I'm here.

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,620
I almost said toot toot I'm here.

8
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,940
Toot toot I'm here.

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:32,780
Yeah, but no.

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,620
It's not a train.

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,460
It's not a train, that's why I didn't do it.

12
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,740
It's a futuristic iteration of a train.

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,260
I said don't do that, it's not a train.

14
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,700
And then I thought, then I analyzed what my instinct was

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,660
and it was incorrect.

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,340
It was wrong, it was bad.

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,420
I mean, I'm glad you were honest.

18
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,740
I think, hey, you know what?

19
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,860
I think it was cute.

20
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,940
I think it was very cute.

21
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:50,780
It was.

22
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,600
If I said it?

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,440
Yeah.

24
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,280
Or if I, okay.

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,500
Well, let's try to take it again.

26
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,340
Say it every time.

27
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,760
Jason, introduce me.

28
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,240
Oh, Mike Carlson, also here.

29
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,360
Toot toot, I'm here.

30
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,840
Toot toot is here, like he always says.

31
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,080
I think it's a catchphrase now.

32
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,920
Yeah.

33
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,960
Okay, toot toot I'm here.

34
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,000
Put it on a shirt.

35
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,600
I think I'm too embarrassed of that.

36
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,200
I'm embarrassed to be next to it.

37
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,920
So what's this podcast you're doing?

38
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,100
Oh, it's good, it's, you know, it's the same person.

39
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,120
Yeah, the guy is, Mike goes, does a catchphrase.

40
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,280
He always says toot toot.

41
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,040
Oh, is he the toot toot I'm here guy?

42
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,880
Yeah, no, it's him.

43
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,720
Oh, I hate that guy.

44
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,160
Oh yeah, awful.

45
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,360
Yeah, okay, yes.

46
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,680
You wanna talk to other people at this party?

47
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,680
Okay, that's fine.

48
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

49
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,740
Well, I understand.

50
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,680
Folks, we're here.

51
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,160
It's the second part of our discussion of the People Mover.

52
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,040
Honing in on the Florida,

53
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,320
and the Florida redo that Tomorrowland Transit Authority.

54
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,040
It was the People Mover there for a while.

55
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,400
For a while, the Wedway People Mover.

56
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,760
Yes, which had a great sign, by the way.

57
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,440
I also had this sign.

58
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,280
Yes, okay, okay, yeah, yeah.

59
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,960
Was it sponsored by something specific initially?

60
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,440
Yes, it was sponsored by the Edison Electric Institute.

61
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,280
But the sign specifically says,

62
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,680
presented by America's investor-owned electric companies.

63
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,080
That clunky sentence was in a theme park for people to see?

64
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,240
It is as long as the phrase Wedway People Mover.

65
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,400
It takes up so much of the sign.

66
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,380
It's also so generic.

67
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,360
Investor-owned?

68
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,960
So that implies it's not an electric company

69
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,040
operated by the government.

70
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,920
It is by investor-owned.

71
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,960
What the hell does that mean

72
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,400
to a five-year-old with cotton candy?

73
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,360
Nothing. Nothing.

74
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,200
Nothing, jargon.

75
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,800
Doesn't mean much to me now.

76
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,400
I feel like I have a 30-something of,

77
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,600
feels like he has cotton candy for brains.

78
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,840
Well, you're not alone there.

79
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,520
You're just getting fuzzier.

80
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,200
So this is the 70s.

81
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,960
It's not an opening day Magic Kingdom attraction.

82
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,440
It opened in 75,

83
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,720
but Tomorrowland was designed

84
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,040
with the intent of a people mover.

85
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,200
So there was, you could see a second story concourse.

86
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,040
Oh, okay.

87
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,880
You could see overhangs. They were ready for it.

88
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,400
Also, when they built Epcot,

89
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,240
there was plans for a people mover

90
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,680
that would go around Spatial Earth

91
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,240
and go through the second levels of Communicor.

92
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,440
That got scrapped.

93
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,200
That people mover never got built.

94
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,040
Huh.

95
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,880
What a minute, wow.

96
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,200
In a different park elsewhere in, wow,

97
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,240
Epcot people mover.

98
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,720
Yeah, that would have been,

99
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,160
it would have been cool if they had just like maintained,

100
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,600
because they was almost a version of the people mover

101
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,240
built in Galaxy's Edge.

102
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,080
Yes.

103
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,160
Which is going to be themed to what?

104
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,000
The Banthas?

105
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,880
Banthas, yeah.

106
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,920
So it would have been fun if that sort of

107
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,720
was just a trademark of Disney parks

108
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,520
where it would be sort of different types of vehicles

109
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,840
that would move you around.

110
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,960
That Bantha ride would be so popular.

111
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,920
You know the way that everybody feels like there's,

112
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,000
I like Galaxy's Edge.

113
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,600
No, I like it, but there's something a little,

114
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,000
I think it would be the thing.

115
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,400
I think everybody, we'd be seeing celebrities Instagramming

116
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,240
on the Banthas, families laughing.

117
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,160
It's like something for children, little children to do

118
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,000
that's not our answer to this.

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,400
And yeah, with the lack of like little shows and stuff

120
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,600
because the place is so big

121
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,040
and it feels a little empty sometimes,

122
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,520
depending on what time of the day.

123
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,200
You always got a big Bantha flying,

124
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,280
or not flying, but roaming around up above you.

125
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,840
Messed up, they messed up.

126
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,760
And I'm also, you know what?

127
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,480
We got Nintendo coming soon

128
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,160
and we're gonna talk a lot about it,

129
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,040
but Hollywood is not getting Japan's Yoshi ride.

130
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,000
And I've watched a ride through of the Yoshi ride

131
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,040
thinking I won't get there for a while.

132
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,960
What a cute, pleasant ride.

133
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,880
There's a little game,

134
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,200
you have to do an Easter egg hunt on it.

135
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,400
Oh, and I'm so frustrated having a two-year-old

136
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,840
and that there's not gonna be a little Yoshi ride

137
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,160
for him to do.

138
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,920
What a stupid, why did they cut this bad?

139
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,760
Yeah, I know.

140
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,760
That's a very small, though Japan land is small.

141
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,920
And the one here is smaller.

142
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,000
This is not a big physical footprint land in general.

143
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,640
I saw someone have a negative review of the Yoshi ride

144
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,920
in Japan, but they may not have a child.

145
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,160
I mean, I'll say that it was, I did,

146
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,400
that's more of what I'm thinking.

147
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
I did a watch through and even was like,

148
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,720
seems a little slow and nothing and rinky dink.

149
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,480
But then also I'm like, but imagine being on it.

150
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,440
I think if you were on it, you would have.

151
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,160
I think the big thing is getting to be on a Yoshi is awesome.

152
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,360
Getting to see a different color Yoshi, awesome.

153
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,400
Then getting to see the above the land view, awesome.

154
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,040
And then I think maybe the negative part was like,

155
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,320
it was inside they felt it was not as themed.

156
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,440
It was not as cool when you would go into the tunnels.

157
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,720
When you go into little tunnels, there's not, yeah.

158
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,600
It should have been better.

159
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,920
That's the review of it.

160
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,760
So I think you are missing out on that vantage point.

161
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,080
That's the big thing.

162
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,560
And the Yoshi's getting a kid going,

163
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,520
oh, I get to get pink Yoshi or whatever.

164
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,400
This vantage point thing came up

165
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,600
in the discovery zone episode recently.

166
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,440
Yes.

167
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,840
That was something that you said, Jason,

168
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,600
about you like being in the tubes

169
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,600
because you could see characters from a weird view

170
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,840
and games from, and let me plan the rest of it.

171
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

172
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,000
It's funny that ties right into what we're talking about.

173
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,240
Now, something that this is true

174
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,920
of both versions of the people mover.

175
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,720
Why is it so satisfying to be up in a window of a store?

176
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,400
Like it's Star Traders in Disneyland.

177
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,360
I don't know what it goes through in Disney World exactly.

178
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,200
Star Traders.

179
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,680
It's Star Traders again, okay, great.

180
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,400
Like why it's so, and like waving to the people in the store

181
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,800
and like, oh, I wonder what they're buying.

182
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,640
What do they do?

183
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,480
Wow, I can see the cashiers.

184
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,520
I can see their computer.

185
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,920
And then you're in the store and like,

186
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,640
wow, there's people going by.

187
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,760
Wonder if they're enjoying the ride.

188
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,120
It just like creates this arbitrary division

189
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,880
between people.

190
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,560
It has the riders and the people watching the riders.

191
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,800
Yeah, I don't know.

192
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,800
I guess it turns the shoppers into like animatronics

193
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,040
in a certain way.

194
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,880
Yeah.

195
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,640
You're watching that show.

196
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,400
Yeah, so without knowing it, your entertainment

197
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,320
while you're looking for what mug to buy.

198
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,480
Yeah, exactly.

199
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,680
It's just neat.

200
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,000
And the Florida version has so much of what was neat

201
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
about the original one too.

202
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,880
But do you wanna, Jason, do you wanna put up any like

203
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,880
arguments for what makes this one better or more?

204
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,920
I don't know that it is a competition, but.

205
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,640
Well, I'll say, you know,

206
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,360
the one I like is specifically

207
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,720
the Tomorrowland Transit Authority that runs,

208
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,280
the narration that runs from 1994

209
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,480
and then they took it out in 2009.

210
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,320
Okay.

211
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,080
And more specifically, I really like the one

212
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,640
with that Tomorrowland loop, which I found

213
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,000
by going year to year in footage.

214
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,840
Wow.

215
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,760
The music loop that I like seems like it kicks in around 2003.

216
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,640
Do you have a name?

217
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,920
Can you quantify or how did it,

218
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,400
how did the listeners find it?

219
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,160
Okay, you can find it on YouTube.

220
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,360
If you look up the term,

221
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,200
I, because it kind of plays throughout the land too.

222
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,800
It plays.

223
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,440
Does it have like a, like the,

224
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,520
like Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow as part of it?

225
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,800
Part of it, it has, if you had wings as part of it,

226
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,280
now is the best time of your life.

227
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,120
So it incorporates all of these songs

228
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,000
from Tomorrowland past and present.

229
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,040
That's cool.

230
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,400
If you look on YouTube,

231
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,800
it's called Tomorrowland area music loop.

232
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,360
It has 1.7 million views.

233
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,200
Wow.

234
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,880
So, and this was an early lockdown.

235
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,600
I mean, before, even before that,

236
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,000
I would put it on if I was working or stuff,

237
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,560
but especially during early lockdown,

238
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,520
I was going back and forth between Pandora,

239
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,200
like music and just repeating footage,

240
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,920
Pandora music, Avatar Pandora.

241
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,640
Yeah, they're not the stage, not the radio.

242
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,480
Yeah, that and this Tomorrowland music loop

243
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,000
just to keep myself sane.

244
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,840
Wow.

245
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,000
So, but I, when I was watching through

246
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,560
people mover footage, which according to my YouTube history,

247
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,480
I have watched 23 videos of various people mover

248
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,320
through the years.

249
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,080
Like in the last week or so?

250
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,200
In the last three days.

251
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,120
Oh my God.

252
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,880
This is including California and Florida

253
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,400
and the multiple narrators in Florida.

254
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,040
Cause Jack Wagner was the original narrator.

255
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,880
Then it was-

256
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,000
Who's fake Mickey, who's, wait, he's specifically the,

257
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,400
he's, I use the den and also the,

258
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,680
okay, you asked for it.

259
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,520
Yeah.

260
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,520
So it's weird that he's such a like,

261
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,440
swirly, nice sound, like the voice of Disneyland.

262
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,000
The voice of Disneyland, yeah.

263
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,400
And so that's how they first rolled out this people mover.

264
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,920
And then it was Orac One, the commuter computer

265
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,040
from 85 to 91 or 94.

266
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,880
Yes.

267
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,120
And then in 94, Peter Rennaday becomes the narrator

268
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,120
and kind of was doing like a Jack Wagner voice.

269
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,960
Yeah. It's that sort of, it's similar in tone to that,

270
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,400
your attention please, the Disneyland,

271
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,000
it's in that neck of the wood, kind of like trumpet it up.

272
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,760
Yes. But that, but the one thing I can't figure out,

273
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,360
cause the like now departing rocket tower Plaza

274
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,760
that I have as my phone ring for years.

275
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,960
I think I played this on the show.

276
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,000
This came up before once.

277
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,400
Yeah, this came up before.

278
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,040
We tried to activate it organically, but it didn't work.

279
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,520
And so I think it, I know how to get there.

280
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,360
Can I call you?

281
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,200
Yeah.

282
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,320
Why weren't we talking about,

283
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,720
what was the last Peter Rennaday conversation?

284
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,560
Cause this came up, I remember you bringing up.

285
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,880
He's just in so much here, this is the clip.

286
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,000
The Iranian transit authority,

287
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,080
the Trinidad and Manstap now departing

288
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,600
rapid tower Plaza station for a round trip

289
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,280
super Skyway tour.

290
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,800
So that, that is like my favorite thing.

291
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,120
Like when, since I was a kid, I loved that.

292
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,440
And then when I went back in like 2012,

293
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,680
I was like, who the fuck is this voice?

294
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,560
It is like a funky teen.

295
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,760
It is like a hip young person and I hate it.

296
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,600
Yeah.

297
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,040
And no vibe, there's no real anything to it.

298
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,040
There's no vibes.

299
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,520
They did keep the music loop.

300
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,800
So that was at least there.

301
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,240
And then I was very happy to see in the summer of 2022,

302
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,840
there was a, it is new again.

303
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,320
It's a little more of a hodgepodge.

304
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,280
It's kind of everything.

305
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,480
It's all the narration,

306
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,800
it's little pieces of all the narrations

307
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,720
and cute music cues and references to older attractions.

308
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,120
This is kind of when in talking about the,

309
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,720
the split and figuring out how do we divide these episodes.

310
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,840
I think some of the, this is a big difference.

311
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,600
Florida, I think has always had more personality

312
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,520
in the narrators.

313
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,800
I love the narrators in the Disneyland version,

314
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
but they're just sort of kind of like,

315
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,120
just generic talky people, which it was originally.

316
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,520
But then that you have this computer voice

317
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,240
and kind of a character with Orac one

318
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,520
is a very different thing about the persona of the,

319
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,640
and they've kept it up.

320
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,680
That you may, you maybe are getting characters on here,

321
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,600
which fleshes it out as a themed experience a little more.

322
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,480
You, to be just to clear it out,

323
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,120
you like all of them except for the teen.

324
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,280
I, I.

325
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,720
I know you have your preference, I'm saying,

326
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,360
but you, the only one you have disdain for is the teen.

327
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,480
I just didn't, yeah, I feel like they removed personality

328
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,520
and they also put in the version.

329
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,120
Like Poochie they put on, like Poochie's voice.

330
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,960
Yeah, essentially.

331
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,120
Well, they put in a lot more character,

332
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,480
like Mike Wazowski or Stitch or like Buzz Lightyear.

333
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,320
And it's a little.

334
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,840
None of them are the voices, clearly.

335
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,200
So it's not like you're really getting your friends.

336
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,240
Right, yeah.

337
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,520
And I also, I, if we ever talk to them,

338
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,360
I do want to ask Peter Reneday, is that you?

339
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,680
Because there's a narrator and there's an announcer

340
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,320
and I can't figure out if they're the same person.

341
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,240
This was a real leap that you have,

342
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,080
you want to get Peter Reneday on the show?

343
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,920
Are you calling your show?

344
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,240
Oh, I would not, no, I just mean if we're.

345
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,920
We ever have them on, it's very casual.

346
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,280
If we ever have them on, I, yeah, I'm sure we'd love to.

347
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,920
Peter, we gotta know.

348
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,200
Is this you, like, as I, I was trying to figure out,

349
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,040
it's so hard to find credits

350
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,320
for some of these attractions of like,

351
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,840
who was this voice, who was that voice?

352
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,400
But so he's, and we've done this list before, I'm sure,

353
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,240
but sir, that specific, your ringtone.

354
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,000
Lincoln's a big one.

355
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,720
I don't know when Lincoln, now I don't remember.

356
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,840
He's been Lincoln at certain times.

357
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,720
Right, which, in and out with that original,

358
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,480
it's either that original guy, Royal Dano,

359
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,320
or it's this guy.

360
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,640
And he's Lincoln, Peter Reneday is Lincoln recently in Seoul.

361
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,760
There's a brief Lincoln appearance

362
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,000
when there's the different mentors

363
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,560
who might, trying to sync up with 22, the lost soul.

364
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,360
So still doing like a go-to Lincoln in a lot of things.

365
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,760
And we might've talked about Reneday before also

366
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,760
because it's another, it's a different fake Mickey.

367
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,880
Reneday is Mickey at the beginning of Splash Dance,

368
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,360
the Splash Dance album that was fun to talk about

369
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
a while ago.

370
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,320
All the fake Mickeys are in play in this thing.

371
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,160
My favorite fake that he does is fake James Mason

372
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,800
in the 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ride.

373
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,840
Right, right, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

374
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,760
That's a good one, that's a tricky one to do.

375
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,160
Fake Nemo, he's, James Mason plays Captain E,

376
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,280
it's not just James Mason, a little sloshed going like,

377
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,200
are we going to the Roosevelt?

378
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,240
On a talk show, no.

379
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,080
Yeah.

380
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,360
Peter Reneday has the credit, Bailiff in Cat from Outer Space

381
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,880
and the, an earlier voice that you mentioned, Orack One,

382
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,480
that was the voice that was done by an actor

383
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,920
named Ronnie Shell, who was the cat from outer space.

384
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,760
Wow.

385
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,520
Another property represented throughout

386
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,920
People Mover history.

387
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,440
Anyone wanna call that shot?

388
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,720
I don't know if I do, Cat from Outer Space episode.

389
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,400
I don't know anything about the cat from Outer Space.

390
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,280
That sounds like your shot you would call.

391
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,440
Reneday is Splinter as well.

392
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,280
Oh right, yes.

393
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,240
And Splinter in Coming Out of Our Shells

394
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,040
that before it switches to the Bryan Adams vocals.

395
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,040
For his song, Skippin' Stones.

396
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,320
Yeah, Skippin' Stones.

397
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,960
Sandin' in water.

398
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,480
Might be the worst sung song in history.

399
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,880
It's insane, I mean, maybe the singer,

400
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,680
the singer isn't trying to straddle the difference

401
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,880
between Bryan Adams and elderly rat.

402
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,800
Maybe he's a better singer, usually.

403
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,600
Skippin' Stones.

404
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,440
Yeah.

405
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,480
Passing Stones, kidney stones.

406
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,840
That's what it sounds like.

407
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,200
But so Peter Reneday, yeah, so he's the narration.

408
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,960
I feel like the 94 Tomorrowland, when that was redone,

409
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,840
that was a very aggressive push in the regular magazines,

410
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,440
we got Disney Adventures, Disney Magazine, The Glossy.

411
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,280
I got Disney Magazine, they really hyped up.

412
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,160
That got me so psyched to go to that new Tomorrowland.

413
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,880
I was so excited for all of it.

414
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,040
And I loved it.

415
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,800
And I still think it looks pretty good.

416
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,400
Like they've added some more mod stuff back in,

417
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,640
the entry, they changed the entryway.

418
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,120
They scaled back on some of the more retro future

419
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,200
Buck Rogers, kind of like Finns and all.

420
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,640
And I can't complain too much,

421
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,600
because they replaced it with a lot of blue lights

422
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,840
and neon blue, which I think always looks good and futurey.

423
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,040
They should just default to that, absolutely.

424
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,720
I will say, this, when they redid Tomorrowland in 94,

425
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,680
big aesthetic swing that was very bold

426
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,200
and could have not worked.

427
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Could have not, yeah.

428
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,480
I thought it was so very, you know,

429
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,600
their attempts to answer the question,

430
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,720
how do we keep Tomorrowland just permanent

431
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,200
and not change it all the time, is doing this weird,

432
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,160
it's the future, but it's also the 1930s.

433
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,160
And it's a future that seems to involve a lot of big boxy

434
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,720
30s type robots who are very friendly.

435
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,880
And all of Tomorrowland becomes this actual,

436
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,240
I mean, not actual, but like a simulated community

437
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,320
that has public transit, which is what we're talking about,

438
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,480
and a convention center and a science center

439
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,200
and little like, you know, here's a newspaper stand

440
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,320
and there's characters.

441
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,720
And it sort of is a consistent little world

442
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,720
and through line that was very, in a very pre-Galaxy's Edge,

443
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,200
very well done and consistent in the original way.

444
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,680
Yeah, and I think, yeah, very civic minded,

445
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,600
which is kind of ironic when we're talking

446
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,680
about the people mover, because, you know, in the 70s,

447
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,080
they tried to sell the people mover to cities

448
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,760
and airports and balls as like a way of getting around,

449
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,160
as like a public transit option.

450
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,280
And there is a marketing brochure you can find online,

451
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,560
like a 10 page, like, this is what it looks like.

452
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,320
This is the Houston airport people mover.

453
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,120
And some of the language in it is like,

454
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,440
and you know, isn't this nice for society?

455
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,480
Isn't this nice for the civic population?

456
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,400
Like they are trying to pitch it as like, you know,

457
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,440
we tested it in theme parks and now it's working every day

458
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,280
in an airport, why not put it in your city?

459
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,560
Is the MCO Orlando airport,

460
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,160
is that a people mover or a monorail?

461
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,520
What is it technically?

462
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,200
If you use people mover to mean automated transit system,

463
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,360
I think it's closer to people mover.

464
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,800
I don't know if there's conductors

465
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,080
at the end of those trains.

466
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,520
I think that is, if the, if, well, yeah,

467
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,640
if is it like the way we've determined,

468
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,360
we're using the word people mover,

469
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,360
or is it the Disney definition of people mover,

470
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,280
which is no motor.

471
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,120
Right.

472
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,560
And the track is doing all the work.

473
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,440
And that I couldn't tell you.

474
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,880
I bet it's not then that.

475
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,800
Cause it's not, that seems like it has.

476
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,480
A skateboard is a people mover.

477
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,040
No, because the ground isn't.

478
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,800
But it's moving a person.

479
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,480
Yeah, oh yes, in one sense.

480
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,520
Yeah, in one sense.

481
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,520
I think we, maybe how do we do any definition.

482
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,720
People mover lower case is when it's just something

483
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,000
that's moving people.

484
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,320
But people mover upper case means Disney's definition

485
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,960
where the track is doing all the work.

486
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,800
Yes.

487
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,520
Oh, and we didn't, I don't think we said the phrase

488
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,080
linear induction motor somehow in the first episode we did.

489
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,840
Well, here's a big difference.

490
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,480
Yeah, the Florida one.

491
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,240
California is powered by, was powered by Goodyear tires

492
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,720
every once in a while, pretty constantly.

493
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,680
I think it's like over 500 points

494
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,200
along this mile long track.

495
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,560
You hit Goodyear tires that are forever spinning

496
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,680
and that gives you the momentum to keep going.

497
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,800
In Florida, different thing.

498
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,160
Powerful electromagnets in the track

499
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,200
that attract and repel and can be customized.

500
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,240
So like, all right, speed up in this section

501
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,160
or slow down in this section.

502
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,360
They're kind of, you know, there's fail-safes too,

503
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,360
both for safety, but also like, okay, this motor's out.

504
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,360
So the other ones pick up the weight.

505
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,640
Okay, oh, so you can, certain particular ones

506
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,840
can go offline and that's okay.

507
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,840
And so this is a system that the Houston airport one uses.

508
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,960
By the way, I watched the full loop

509
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,960
of the Houston airport people mover

510
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,280
and it is maybe the most boring video footage

511
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,240
I've ever consumed in my life.

512
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,600
This is, to fully explain this, Disney is making,

513
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,120
like we have this idea for a public transit system

514
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,200
that it's only deployed as a theme park ride

515
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,080
and they wanna sell it to actual places

516
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,560
and it works in exactly one forum, we think.

517
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,840
And it is that Imagineering built this tram

518
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,280
in the Houston airport, which is the George Bush

519
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,320
Intercontinental Airport.

520
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,720
And yes, you can watch video of it.

521
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,240
And it is, I think you might be able to declare it

522
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,320
Disney's most depressing ride.

523
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,000
Because it's just going through not just terminals,

524
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
but it's like basement and claustrophobic, low ceilings.

525
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,680
I think if a very determined person could walk

526
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,200
pretty well faster than this thing.

527
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,840
And it's enclosed, it's not open air.

528
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,760
Undecorated, like the stripes on the side of it

529
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,480
are the most decorations associated with it.

530
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,320
Stripes, yeah.

531
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Stripes, yeah.

532
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,800
That's not much.

533
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,960
I always, and it was actually disappointing

534
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,920
because I knew that bit of trivia.

535
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,960
And I always pictured the fun friendly Disney people mover

536
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,520
being oddly in the airport and everybody having a good time

537
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,240
like on all those posters.

538
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,000
But no, it's in the dingiest, saddest.

539
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,840
There's no decoration in these hallways.

540
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,680
No.

541
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,600
There's not even a like, watch out for bombs.

542
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,800
There's not even that.

543
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,160
Just bare walls, low ceilings.

544
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,600
It also, I mean, good, it connects to parking

545
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,400
and a hotel like convenient.

546
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,600
I saw a thing that said like, well, for the airport,

547
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,800
it's before security.

548
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,240
So you have to go, if you're connecting flights,

549
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,640
if you're gonna use this monorail,

550
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,360
you might have to go through security again.

551
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,920
God, that seems like a waste.

552
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,760
Yeah, a little bit.

553
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,680
Well, I think, I believe that this,

554
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,640
what was kind of cool and cutting edge in 1981,

555
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,800
if you can imagine, is struggling a bit in 2023.

556
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,160
And I think it's in need of replacing.

557
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,400
And it's not even the main people mover

558
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,640
that services this airport.

559
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,480
Yeah.

560
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,400
Are we calling, we aren't calling the shot

561
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,080
of the Houston airport, are we?

562
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,560
Hmm, are we?

563
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,760
I mean, if one of us has a crazy layover

564
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,640
and something to do, you know, a day.

565
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,760
If I decide to go visit Monday, then.

566
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,120
The asterisk of it is like,

567
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,400
oh, this is the only one that Disney ever sold to outside,

568
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,960
outside of theme parks.

569
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,960
Except, there's an identical copy of it at the US Capitol

570
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,600
that goes between buildings.

571
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,080
What happened is Disney spun off this division of WED

572
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,320
and sold it to a Canadian company called Bombardier.

573
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,240
And they were the ones who got the contract

574
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,720
to make the one at the US Capitol

575
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,440
that connects a bunch of the Congress buildings.

576
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,440
This is insane.

577
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,280
There is a, there's a sort of,

578
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,760
depending on how you want to define it,

579
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,720
kind of Disney people mover under the Capitol.

580
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,160
Which I have written.

581
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,160
So you can go on it as not a government employee?

582
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,560
Yeah, when I went on like the, you know, high school.

583
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,680
Was that on the date January 6th when you were there?

584
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,160
I know, wasn't running that day.

585
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,160
I don't know, something else was going on that day.

586
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,360
When I did, like in the year, early 2001,

587
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,200
when they would just let high schoolers

588
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,480
loose on the US Capitol to just wander the buildings

589
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,800
after you met your congressman.

590
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,640
And they're just like, all right,

591
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,200
you have six hours until we meet back up at the buses

592
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,120
to go back to the Holiday Inn.

593
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,960
There's a ride, you want to do the ride?

594
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,960
And my friends and I found a ride

595
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,760
and we're like trying to find

596
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,000
the most famous persons off it.

597
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,360
So we would just go from building to building on this ride.

598
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,280
And this was, sorry, this was early 2001?

599
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,120
What happened, what changed?

600
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,480
I don't know, I think just everyone,

601
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,520
like after Shrek, everyone was having such a good time

602
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,640
that year and people were doing other stuff.

603
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,920
Just the Shrek world.

604
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,760
Yeah, pre-Shrek world.

605
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,000
Pre-Shrek world, post-Shrek, excuse me.

606
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,280
I think we all remember where we were when Shrek came out.

607
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,320
I think, yeah, should we have a quick moment

608
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,320
of silence for Shrek?

609
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,160
I am a believer, so I think so.

610
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,720
Well, we'll do it off mic.

611
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,800
That's so weird and you can watch,

612
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,720
there's a little bit of that included

613
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,320
at the end of the very long Martins vids

614
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,960
that shows you a lot of these iterations.

615
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,400
I laughed when I said, like,

616
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,520
this video contains seven iterations

617
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,360
of people move a ride throughs and then you get to the end

618
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,000
and you get a little ride through of this one,

619
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,320
which has, this one's got great decorations,

620
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,560
not like Houston, it has the seal

621
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,240
of the United States Senate.

622
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,160
It's so weird seeing the Senate logo on a ride

623
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,480
and Mike, you brought up a certain date,

624
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,120
not another date that was avoided just now,

625
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:43,120
but on January 6th, did any of those senators flee using,

626
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,840
this is an underground way to get out of the building

627
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,160
with a bunch of crazies trying to,

628
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,120
with a bunch of patriots, I'm sorry, trying to get in.

629
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,440
Yeah, thank you.

630
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,960
It's a very good question and you'd have to imagine

631
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,320
someone, some of them wrote it

632
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,040
at a certain point during the day.

633
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,200
I bet, I bet.

634
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,040
Yeah.

635
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,760
Who was the guy who ran away very,

636
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,480
who like tweeted in support of everybody,

637
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,320
but then there's the footage of him.

638
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,160
Holly?

639
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,000
Josh Holly?

640
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,840
Josh Holly, yeah, yeah, yeah.

641
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,080
If there was then footage of Holly

642
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,480
under a blanket.

643
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,600
Or like doing the same kind of floppy run onto the ride,

644
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,840
slipping and falling, hitting his head on the windshield,

645
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,680
like Ernest pressing his face up against the glass,

646
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,360
banging into every pole.

647
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,560
There has to be.

648
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,160
And I don't know, they didn't talk about it.

649
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,920
Some people I think hold up in their office.

650
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,080
Some people went to different like safe areas,

651
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,960
but yeah, somebody had to hop on that thing.

652
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,960
Yeah, yeah, you think so.

653
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,560
And thank God that it wasn't breached.

654
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,480
Thank God that the shaman wasn't like,

655
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,280
we've captured the Senate mover.

656
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,120
Right?

657
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,360
It would be funny to see the shaman crying this.

658
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,920
He'd take his hat off and scratch his head

659
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,120
like while this is going,

660
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,240
and he's like pulling up the station real quick,

661
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,080
gets himself back together.

662
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,200
It's going 130, baby.

663
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,520
If he was at least like next to the ride

664
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,240
while it pulled up, it would be like he was the shaman

665
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,160
of song essentially on Navi River Journey.

666
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,400
So it would be the closest thing to a Disney ride.

667
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,080
There's a shaman at the end of it.

668
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,080
But he sings, kill my parents, kill my parents.

669
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,720
Yeah, it's sort of a different.

670
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,240
It's still just as pleasant a tune,

671
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,880
but the message is different.

672
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,320
The footage you're going to see today may shock you.

673
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,200
You're going to see footage of a people mover attraction

674
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,960
absconded with by bandits in goat horns.

675
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,480
And by the end of this 21 day procedure,

676
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,400
nothing will change for anyone or anything.

677
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,520
Yeah.

678
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,000
I will lose my job is what will happen.

679
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,040
Anyway, I won't say anything else.

680
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,880
What, what?

681
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,720
No, no, no.

682
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,560
Okay, okay.

683
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,400
I'm getting punchy.

684
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,560
Speaking of tunes, Mike just said tunes.

685
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,400
I did, yeah.

686
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,960
I, so I started watching a lot of these versions

687
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,960
of the people mover and there was on retro WDW's channel,

688
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,040
one from 1994.

689
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,960
And I was like, oh great,

690
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,720
let's see what it looks like opening year.

691
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,760
And this is, if you'll recall Alien encounter

692
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,920
opens December of 94, then real quickly closes

693
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,400
and reopens in June of 95.

694
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,720
So the land was done before that big ride

695
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,400
and the narration is in there.

696
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,440
The narration that I recognize,

697
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,280
the music is not what I recognize

698
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,960
because it is like Looney Tunes old music

699
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,000
when they go to a factory, like the dun dun dun,

700
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,840
da da da da da.

701
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,760
Like it's really kitschy, cartoony music

702
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,680
playing in the background with the regular narration.

703
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,600
And then a year or two later,

704
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,040
I don't know how long it took.

705
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,480
It seemed like it was just placeholder music.

706
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,880
And then eventually at some point,

707
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,000
it's kind of like more twinkly spacey music.

708
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,840
Okay, okay.

709
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,840
That seems like it runs from like the mid 90s

710
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,360
up to like 2003 when I started to find videos

711
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,880
with that Tomorrowland music loop.

712
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,360
Well, so much of the vibe of this thing

713
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,600
was like, was bustling city and then like gears,

714
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,000
a lot of gears involved in this new,

715
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,840
like it was a very, it's like the,

716
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,400
it's the city that the robots live in and robots.

717
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,240
Oh, right.

718
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,080
Yeah.

719
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,900
Robots.

720
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,740
I know robots.

721
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,560
I don't know what the city is called.

722
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,360
Perhaps robot city.

723
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,200
It might be called robot city.

724
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,160
I just saw on that Twitter account that posts

725
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,760
defunct foods, they posted the robots tie-in cereal.

726
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,320
There was a robot cereal?

727
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,320
Six months or a year.

728
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,800
Yeah, it's just frosted strawberry Cheerios or whatever.

729
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,280
Gears probably.

730
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,680
It was a robot city.

731
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,520
Yeah.

732
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,960
Oh, great.

733
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,280
And the main character.

734
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,120
Rodney Copperbutton.

735
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,120
Your eyes went right to it too.

736
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,160
We all know.

737
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,760
And the evil Ratchet is trying to cheat older robots

738
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,560
into buying expensive upgrades.

739
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,040
This is like, it's Chapec.

740
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,120
Yeah, wow.

741
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,800
Chapec's entire plan was laid out by the character Ratchet.

742
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,760
Wow.

743
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,600
And then there's a guy named Mr. Gunk.

744
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,840
That's a thing I've been saying to my son lately.

745
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,680
Yeah.

746
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,520
And make him laugh.

747
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,360
Gunk.

748
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,480
Well, I gotta show him Mr. Gunk.

749
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,000
Who plays Mr. Gunk?

750
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,840
Hold on, let me find it.

751
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,680
I just saw the name.

752
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,520
Dan Hedaya.

753
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,360
Oh, I love Dan Hedaya.

754
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,200
We love Dan Hedaya.

755
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,020
Dick.

756
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,860
It's Dick.

757
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,700
Wow.

758
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,560
And the guy who doesn't get along with the Addams family.

759
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,400
Yeah.

760
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,400
Maybe I would like, wait a minute.

761
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,240
Look who played.

762
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,680
Are you looking at the same thing I'm looking at?

763
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,640
Are you saying who plays fire hydrant in robots?

764
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,480
No.

765
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,320
Fire hydrant is played by Jay Leno.

766
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,160
Well, we gotta call the shot.

767
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,000
Call the shot.

768
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,820
Robots.

769
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,660
Robots.

770
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,480
Robots.

771
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,040
Stephen Tobolowski's in it.

772
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,560
All the American Idol judges are in it.

773
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,080
Oh, wow.

774
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,800
Can someone, is robots, is it Disney film?

775
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,480
No, it's Fox.

776
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,200
Meet the Robinsons is a Disney film.

777
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,040
Yes.

778
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

779
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,700
Okay.

780
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,540
Whoa, my God.

781
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,820
And look who's at the premiere, Osomo.

782
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,500
Here's Osomo with Greg Kinnear.

783
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,500
Here's Osomo with Amanda Bynes.

784
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,340
Wow.

785
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,420
This is great.

786
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,260
Oh, boy.

787
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,220
Oh, I can't wait for the robots episode.

788
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,060
Who does the music?

789
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,220
We're gonna learn all about Cappy and Big Weld.

790
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,140
Also, in a different town called Rivet Town.

791
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,900
Rivet Town is not Robot City.

792
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,940
Awesome, I'll kind of,

793
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,900
an early ding against the Disneyland Tomorrowland

794
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,480
where I was like, they don't have people moving,

795
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,260
but they got fucking Osomo.

796
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

797
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,020
And it didn't seem to be working 100% either

798
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,500
from like 20 feet away.

799
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,580
It's a scene like it.

800
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,420
Right, right.

801
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,500
Was jerking around.

802
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,500
There's also, by the way, there's a separate,

803
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,060
people know my thing, Tiny Fuppets,

804
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:03,220
which is a Brazilian ripoff of Muppet Babies.

805
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,540
One of the things that that's based on

806
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,980
is a real cheap Brazilian movie

807
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,700
that got made called Tiny Robots.

808
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,100
Which, and that has a whole other,

809
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,920
and I gotta find the name of that city.

810
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,760
I'll figure that out.

811
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,940
But don't let me interrupt.

812
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,460
I'll work quietly.

813
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,540
Back to the people mover.

814
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:22,340
So the people mover in 94 gets renamed

815
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,220
to the Tomorrowland Transit Authority.

816
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,820
I've established on the main feed episode,

817
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:32,620
never in my life have I referred to it vocally as that.

818
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,940
But in Canon, in K-Fape,

819
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:38,700
I know this is the Tomorrowland Transit Authority.

820
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,860
And they play it up.

821
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,800
They play up that this is a line.

822
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,900
There are other lines.

823
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,660
There's red, you know, I think this is the blue line.

824
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,180
There's a red line and the green line.

825
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,420
One would take you all for a,

826
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:53,180
one would take you to the exurbs, the suburbs, you know?

827
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,340
Is that a, they made up like a future word

828
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,020
for suburbs called exurbs?

829
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,420
No, I think exurbs is a term already.

830
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,260
Oh, it is?

831
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,340
Oh, I never heard exurbs.

832
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,580
Oh, I was hoping that was like Disney mythology.

833
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,740
That would be crazy.

834
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,300
They do, what is the term they use?

835
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,620
You know what would be great is if they did like,

836
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,780
the people mover would go on all the lands

837
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,180
and it could somehow change what you were in,

838
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,380
at least just from your vantage point

839
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,140
of what like kind of vehicle you were in.

840
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:19,980
Oh, sure.

841
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,820
Like you could start in Tomorrowland

842
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,940
and end up in Galaxy's Edge

843
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,100
and all of a sudden it feels like,

844
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,900
oh, now we're on a Banta.

845
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,260
I don't know how they would quite do that,

846
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:29,140
but that would be cool too to make it extend out.

847
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,740
Scott, your thinking was correct.

848
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,780
They did come up with a term.

849
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,720
The green line provides local transportation

850
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,340
to the hoverburbs.

851
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,180
What?

852
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,460
Wow. The hoverburbs?

853
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,260
I love the hoverburbs.

854
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,100
The red line takes you off planet.

855
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:44,940
That's so dumb.

856
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,180
Oh man, that's Back to the Future 2 dumb.

857
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,020
I love it.

858
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,220
Floating, I assume.

859
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,620
It must be a floating city, a hovering city.

860
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,820
It might only be like two feet off the ground.

861
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,660
Right, right.

862
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,180
You don't have to be up high to hover.

863
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,220
No. Oh man, that rules.

864
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,100
And here, just really quick to close this loop.

865
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,940
Tiny Robots is set in New Iron City

866
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,980
and it follows the adventures of Trank,

867
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,860
who's an old fashioned kind of robot.

868
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,540
So he doesn't get along with the high tech robots

869
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,300
that he finds in New Iron City.

870
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,980
Imagine what could happen with the worst animation ever

871
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,540
done by any underpaid people.

872
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:21,060
Didn't we go to Iron City for Alita Battle,

873
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,060
was that the name of it?

874
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,220
Alita Battle Angel.

875
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,460
Was that part of the Alita Battle Angel?

876
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,020
Isn't that the name of the city?

877
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,260
I can't remember the city.

878
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,100
I think so, right?

879
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,540
I know we were trying to get to Zalem.

880
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:34,140
You're trying to get to Zalem, but where we were.

881
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,660
I think it wasn't at Iron City, am I wrong?

882
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,780
I didn't realize that Alita Battle Angel

883
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,940
was at one point a pivot point for James Cameron

884
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,220
and he was deciding, do I make this or do I make Avatar?

885
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,660
And what a different world it would be

886
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,460
if he'd instead gone with, would it have worked?

887
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,500
Maybe we'd all, and Alita Battle Angel

888
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,020
crushes box office records.

889
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,860
I mean, it didn't, with not him directing,

890
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:59,460
but if he'd done it, we might be up to Alita Five by now.

891
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,940
Sure, passport to Iron City.

892
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,780
Yeah, that was the name of Iron City.

893
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,620
Yeah, where's Iron City?

894
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,940
But not New Iron City.

895
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,260
They stole it from this movie

896
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,180
that stole everything from robots.

897
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,700
Yeah, so, oh, and I always forget,

898
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:16,420
James Cameron produced Dark Angel on Fox.

899
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,300
Yeah.

900
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,860
Which I don't know if that had anything to do

901
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,380
with the Battle Angel.

902
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,380
I don't think so, but he liked angels.

903
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,420
He liked angels.

904
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,660
And this is, remember I talked about

905
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,980
my creepy high school teacher a couple months ago.

906
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,900
I was trying to forget.

907
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,740
I know, but I.

908
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,580
Oh, what a dark.

909
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,660
We were supposed to cast the movie

910
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,860
and I think I said that I cast Jessica Alba

911
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,020
and he in front of the class made a big show.

912
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,300
He goes, I gotta congratulate this guy.

913
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,940
He walked around the desks.

914
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,500
He shook my hand and he goes,

915
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:46,300
he cast TV's Dark Angel, Jessica Alba in a movie.

916
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,820
And like, he made a big show of it,

917
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,700
like a real horny show.

918
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,540
Oh no.

919
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,060
That's very odd.

920
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,540
Yeah, you don't, he like, no one else casts

921
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,260
like an actress that like was good looking

922
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,380
in the class other than me.

923
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,900
Like there's no way.

924
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,460
I don't know what, he must've been like

925
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,660
a big Dark Angel fan and really wanted us to know about it.

926
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:08,380
If anybody in this class wants to stay after

927
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,300
and is willing to be cool about it,

928
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,500
I do have Jessica Alba on the cover of FHM.

929
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,340
If you wanna hang and just look at pics.

930
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,460
That was the vibe of him,

931
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:22,180
but he also looked like John Lithgow.

932
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,940
Oh no.

933
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,180
Oh, you never didn't give that visual.

934
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,300
And I didn't give that visual,

935
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:30,100
but he very much felt like this weird kind of like

936
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:34,180
hyper nerd man who looked very much like Lithgow.

937
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,340
Jeez.

938
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,900
So there's an extra dynamic to that story now.

939
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,180
Oh, yikes, yikes.

940
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,500
Let's speed away from here.

941
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,340
Yeah.

942
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,180
Maybe seven miles per hour.

943
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,500
Let's get to the hover burbs.

944
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,340
The hover burbs.

945
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,780
Yeah, the hover burbs.

946
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,940
No pervert teachers in the hover burbs.

947
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,780
Not the pervert burbs.

948
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,540
The ups are regulated.

949
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,220
So let's see, what did they redo

950
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,620
when they redid the people mover?

951
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,380
Well, the main thing, this Tomorrowland Transit Authority

952
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,220
thing is what, this is what I'm like,

953
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,620
that Tomorrowland, it's gone.

954
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,700
We need a thrill ride.

955
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,220
Nobody wants this boring, gentle ride.

956
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,900
Strip it out now, there's just nothing.

957
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,260
Now we have no ride.

958
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,420
As opposed to here with this name,

959
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,060
which is a very stiff name,

960
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,820
but it ties everything together.

961
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,940
And you go, and like now it is, all right,

962
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,540
so this is the little train that takes you

963
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,380
from place to place.

964
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,740
And the narration explains,

965
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,300
here where Alien Counter is, is the convention center.

966
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,540
And like this is considered,

967
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,460
this rocket port or whatever.

968
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,940
Like if you go, if you went to New Tomorrowland

969
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,620
and you got on this first,

970
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,100
this explains the story to you.

971
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,380
Yeah, I mean, that's great.

972
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,140
And I think I really like that it does.

973
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,740
One, they call it the TTA,

974
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,140
the Tomorrowland Transit Authority.

975
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,460
A piece on Laughing Place points out

976
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,980
that it addresses each location

977
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,220
in the reality of like, so yeah,

978
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,620
they say the Interplanetary Convention Center.

979
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,340
And this company, Excess Tech,

980
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,740
is testing out their teleportation technology.

981
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,940
They don't give away

982
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:04,260
like the horrifying Alien Encounter elements.

983
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,020
Wow, as opposed to the Disneyland one,

984
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,260
which would just be like,

985
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,420
George Lucas brings Star Tours, which is fine,

986
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:15,260
but like doing the full K-Fabe is pretty cool.

987
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,340
Yeah, and they, I mean, as it goes on,

988
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:23,340
as like Dream Flight flips to Buzz Lightyear,

989
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,900
there is a little more.

990
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,500
You get the fake Buzz Lightyear.

991
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,500
It's like Buzz Lightyear blasting off

992
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,820
or like join Buzz Lightyear in whatever.

993
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,180
That one's a little more straightforward.

994
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,260
It's a little more straightforward.

995
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:38,580
They do, you can still see into Buzz Lightyear

996
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,820
just as you could see into Dream Flight

997
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,180
and If You Had Wings.

998
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,180
But a thing I really like on that music loop

999
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,420
that is still on there,

1000
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,500
it starts playing the If You Had Wings instrumental

1001
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,900
as you are passing over that.

1002
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,140
And it continues for a bit of the ride.

1003
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,660
And then it plays, now is the best time of your life

1004
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,300
over Progress City.

1005
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,820
So in the spots where these things were,

1006
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,820
that's pretty cool.

1007
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,700
Wow. Yeah.

1008
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,100
And the Progress City element,

1009
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,140
when they changed it to the Peter Rinade narration,

1010
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,300
it's a lot more like here's Walt's vision of the future.

1011
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,580
They specifically contextualize it

1012
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,020
in the world of Walt Disney.

1013
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,500
They don't just say like the world of tomorrow,

1014
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,540
like a city of the future.

1015
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,660
It's interesting because it's like,

1016
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,140
maybe everyone can give their opinion on this.

1017
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,740
It's like we've talked about Sea,

1018
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,380
the Society of Explorers and Adventures,

1019
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,660
which like touches a lot of the different parks

1020
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,660
around the world.

1021
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,540
And it's kind of subtle depending on,

1022
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,340
some places subtle, some places it's not.

1023
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,780
There's characters in the secret organization

1024
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,340
and certain characters have been added

1025
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,100
and retroactively added to rides.

1026
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,260
But then there's this Tomorrowland Transit Authority,

1027
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,940
basically like tied everything up in a narrative

1028
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,860
in one area and it can find it to an area.

1029
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,180
Is it better this way or is it better

1030
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,940
where Sea is sort of loose?

1031
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,380
Is there an, you know what I'm saying?

1032
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,020
Cause like Sea can actually sort of overtake everything

1033
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,020
if you really want it to in kind of an annoying way.

1034
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,660
Where like, you know, everything's connected

1035
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,180
to the point where you're like a little tired.

1036
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,540
Versus this though, which I think is cool.

1037
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,140
Like I think Sea is cool too,

1038
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,180
but I think this one almost like,

1039
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,740
it being a little bit confined to Tomorrowland,

1040
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,660
I don't know, I like it.

1041
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,380
We fleshed out this, well, it's more manageable.

1042
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,220
It's certainly more manageable.

1043
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,380
Just flesh out mythology of this place.

1044
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,620
I think you just stumbled into a good idea

1045
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,580
for fixing Tomorrowland though,

1046
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:33,020
which is doing that premise that they're trying to employ

1047
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:37,580
for the Marvel campuses, which is a narrative

1048
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,500
where all the Tomorrowlands are a little different.

1049
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,340
Oh yeah.

1050
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,780
But there are certain components and like,

1051
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,700
well they all have space mountains.

1052
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,900
So maybe those all function as this, you know,

1053
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,060
they're a hub of, right.

1054
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,620
You know, like travel for whatever.

1055
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:56,620
Like if you add consistency to the rules of Tomorrowland,

1056
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,700
instead of that they're all kind of a hodgepodge.

1057
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,540
Yeah.

1058
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,420
You could like sort of slightly fix

1059
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,500
or clarify things across the board

1060
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,100
and especially Disneyland, that could be cool.

1061
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:13,380
Well like, at least in the current narration,

1062
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,620
and I think this has always been around at different levels,

1063
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:21,100
but they referred to Space Mountain as Starport 75,

1064
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,780
which is the year it opened.

1065
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,660
So like that you could easily apply

1066
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,340
to all the space mountains, you know.

1067
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,180
Yeah.

1068
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,340
You just put the year they opened, like.

1069
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,980
If we're saying that like that's a space day,

1070
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,100
that's some kind of launch point

1071
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,460
in the way that Star Tours is as well.

1072
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:42,100
Like probably a lot of the rides you would consider that.

1073
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,700
Those places that take you to different places.

1074
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,100
Yeah, that'd be cool.

1075
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,940
Yeah.

1076
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,700
I'm wondering if every land should have its own sea.

1077
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,820
I'd rather have more seas than just one sea, yes.

1078
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:57,660
And sea leaves out, sea is entirely Adventureland,

1079
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,300
Frontierland, past stuff.

1080
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,140
Why not?

1081
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:00,980
Yeah, I would love that.

1082
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,300
But then also waterpark stuff.

1083
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,620
And waterpark stuff.

1084
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,740
And cruise.

1085
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,300
Disney private island stuff.

1086
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,740
Cruise, yeah, the cruise ship has some sea stuff.

1087
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,580
Uh-huh.

1088
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:12,820
So yeah, maybe the answer is more seas.

1089
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:13,660
Yeah.

1090
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,340
That's the sea of the past.

1091
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,860
What is the sea of the future?

1092
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,700
Right.

1093
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,980
Yeah, cause I think, I mean,

1094
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,660
it's not the worst version of it,

1095
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,820
but like as they added more characters,

1096
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,900
as they added Puzzle, Light, Ear, and Monsters,

1097
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,420
they can get Stitch.

1098
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:32,140
It did weaken the narrative they were trying to do.

1099
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,820
Like it kind of like.

1100
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,940
I, they melded it into the narration

1101
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:41,180
and have updated narrations and stuff over the years.

1102
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:45,180
And I think those rides, Stitch being the exception,

1103
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,340
I don't, I'm sure there are fans of it.

1104
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,660
I don't, I didn't mind it terribly,

1105
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:54,500
but like I think those Buzz Lightyear and Monsters, Inc.

1106
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,660
being pretty decent rides,

1107
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:59,380
like being decent rides that people enjoy,

1108
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,020
lets it get away with it, you know?

1109
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:02,860
Yeah, sure, sure.

1110
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,460
It doesn't totally break the narrative.

1111
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,980
It doesn't totally break the world.

1112
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,940
It kind of makes sense being there.

1113
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,780
Yeah.

1114
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:09,620
You know?

1115
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,020
It's all heard the aesthetic to me a little bit

1116
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,260
because there was this fully committed,

1117
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,820
I really liked the like 30s future that they had going.

1118
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,500
And you know what I don't like is like,

1119
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,620
it's kind of a rinky dink rocket with the green aliens on it.

1120
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,500
Or like, I don't like, I may have said this before,

1121
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:28,980
I don't like any exterior of any Buzz Lightyear rides.

1122
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:33,300
I like the ride, but I think the signs are junk.

1123
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,100
And there's much better iterations of Toy Story aesthetic

1124
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,460
done in the parks.

1125
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,980
I just don't like these ones that they've,

1126
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,460
they just feel cheap to me.

1127
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,420
They feel like Disney store or something.

1128
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:48,900
That was, and it's that 90s vibe too, which doesn't,

1129
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,860
I mean, not the bad, like cheap 90s vibe

1130
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:54,300
versus the good tomorrow in 90s vibe.

1131
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,100
I guess I should just make that distinction.

1132
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,340
Sure.

1133
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:00,220
I almost wish, and this is really,

1134
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,620
it makes sense that they're just like,

1135
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,700
this is a Buzz Lightyear ride,

1136
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:07,700
because we're in the 1% of people who care about that.

1137
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,540
But if you want to stay consistent with what you're saying

1138
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,940
about like alien encounter,

1139
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,460
I would like them to couch and hide the fact

1140
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,140
that Buzz Lightyear's in the ride.

1141
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,180
It should be a different thing.

1142
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,780
That should be like, oh, you know, this is,

1143
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:24,860
cause I'm trying to think there's no narrative reason

1144
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,260
other than you're just getting on a ride

1145
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,300
to go destroy Zerg, I guess.

1146
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,140
But it should be-

1147
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:33,060
Oh, sign up to join forces to stop this menace.

1148
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,420
Whatever the space rangers sign up,

1149
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,020
space ranger, whatever.

1150
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,700
And it's a sort of a generic thing.

1151
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,620
Space ranger out, well, it's like the mall,

1152
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:43,140
when you, the mall has the army sign up station

1153
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,060
and the Marines sign up station.

1154
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:45,900
Yeah.

1155
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:46,740
It's one of those.

1156
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:47,580
Yes.

1157
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:52,580
The space rangers are renting out a defunct office space

1158
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,780
to Marlin.

1159
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:57,060
Specifically the mall in Burbank has the army station

1160
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,860
next to the Marine station.

1161
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,660
And you're like, I've never seen,

1162
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,460
I've never seen them next to each other.

1163
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:05,340
Like, should there be a store in one of these?

1164
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,100
Do they get along?

1165
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:07,940
Do they get along?

1166
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,780
Yeah.

1167
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:09,780
And the emoji, I just remember once

1168
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:14,140
there was a giant emoji movie poster, like in between them.

1169
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,540
And if like somebody's in one of the offices

1170
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,820
and they go, oh, this guy isn't cut out to be in the Marine,

1171
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,900
let's send him over to the other office.

1172
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:21,780
Does that ever happen?

1173
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:22,620
I wonder.

1174
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,980
We've got somewhere better,

1175
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,660
more suited to your specific skills.

1176
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,620
Or they send them downstairs to the Navy office.

1177
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,940
Like what happens?

1178
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:30,780
I don't know.

1179
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,540
This is by the other emoji movie.

1180
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,380
Oh yeah.

1181
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,220
Standy, yeah.

1182
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,300
I bet it's still there too.

1183
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,140
Yeah.

1184
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:38,980
Yeah.

1185
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:39,820
All the, yeah.

1186
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,660
It's the Burbank mall.

1187
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:41,500
It's not.

1188
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,340
Yeah, yeah.

1189
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,220
There's probably a lot of just stray emoji movie artwork

1190
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:45,820
that the pandemic, everybody forgot about in the pandemic.

1191
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,020
So yeah.

1192
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:51,340
So like a Monsters Inc. laugh floor.

1193
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:54,300
Just make it look like the laugh factory sign.

1194
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,140
Yeah.

1195
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:55,980
It's the Tomorrowland laugh factory.

1196
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,820
Right.

1197
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,100
And then you go in and you see them,

1198
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,460
but that'll keep the aesthetic and everything on point.

1199
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,060
Oh, they just happen to be here,

1200
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,700
these characters in the Tomorrowland world.

1201
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,900
Do you want the digital billboards saying,

1202
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,140
we support our comics.

1203
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,380
We support free speech.

1204
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,220
I would like them to say that.

1205
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,700
And then I would like it to say like,

1206
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,220
Dane Cook under that.

1207
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,980
But then Zane Cook was there.

1208
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,860
I was just gonna say space Dane Cook.

1209
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:21,700
Yeah.

1210
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,980
And like if they can tie together the,

1211
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,980
any acknowledgement that like,

1212
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:34,060
isn't that where the Mike L. Blipchards incident happened?

1213
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:35,900
Yes, right.

1214
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,660
When that robot went haywire.

1215
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,860
It started insulting those other robots.

1216
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:41,700
Yes.

1217
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,540
Yeah.

1218
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,700
Those robot slurs you don't use.

1219
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:44,540
That's right.

1220
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,380
Yeah.

1221
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,980
So if they could do that, that'll be for the parents.

1222
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,260
That's the wink to the parents.

1223
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:49,460
Yeah.

1224
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,500
But it would, yes, it would keep the,

1225
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:57,260
IP bleed from bothering the 1%, which are us.

1226
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,540
They can do it easily.

1227
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,020
Although if they fix it,

1228
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:03,180
then we don't have things to talk about on this podcast.

1229
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,020
That's true.

1230
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,060
They shouldn't fix anything.

1231
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:08,700
Well, untouched, I feel like is the two,

1232
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,260
like there were two big scenes

1233
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:14,380
that I think came along with the TTA version,

1234
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:17,020
which is the robot shipping department

1235
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:21,060
next to star traders.

1236
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,700
What happens in that?

1237
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,740
It's so hard to get like still stopped footage.

1238
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:29,260
They're all like shipping stuff off world.

1239
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:30,100
Okay.

1240
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,420
Like it's right after the progress city scene,

1241
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,900
which I learned that is the,

1242
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,740
you're in the attic space of cosmic rays.

1243
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,100
It all bleeds together.

1244
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:40,940
Really?

1245
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:41,780
Yeah.

1246
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:42,620
That's what I saw.

1247
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:45,300
That was even when they built that,

1248
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,140
they were like, all right,

1249
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:48,220
we're gonna put some sort of diorama upstairs.

1250
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,420
We don't know what yet.

1251
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,140
So you're up above.

1252
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:51,980
Sunny eclipse.

1253
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,220
At that moment.

1254
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,060
Yeah.

1255
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,700
Somewhere thereabouts.

1256
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,340
Wouldn't that be great if the space angels were up there?

1257
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,820
Like waiting to come down.

1258
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,660
That'd be a good way to tie it.

1259
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:03,500
Yeah.

1260
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,420
Encouraging you to get a bite, see the show.

1261
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,260
Sure.

1262
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,100
Yeah.

1263
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,940
Get a mediocre chicken sandwich,

1264
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:10,740
but they have a toppings bar so you can load up.

1265
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,780
There is a poster for pan galactic pizza,

1266
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:16,300
which kind of ties into the pan galactic pizza bar,

1267
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,660
which I love so much in Japan.

1268
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:21,420
There's also the digital,

1269
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,460
the robot like hair salon,

1270
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,060
the person getting the crazy hair.

1271
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,460
It's another civic moment.

1272
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,940
It's very strange.

1273
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:29,780
And for a thing,

1274
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:33,820
it's odd to only have two little sci-fi scenes.

1275
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:34,660
Yeah.

1276
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:35,500
That's it.

1277
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,020
You feel like at least one more would make it seem like,

1278
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,340
oh, so that's a recurring bit of this ride.

1279
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:40,860
Cause as it stands, it's like,

1280
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:43,180
are there little scenes or not?

1281
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,020
Yeah.

1282
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:44,860
What is this?

1283
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:48,060
That comes, like I'm wondering if that was a fix,

1284
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:50,820
like where you would see into,

1285
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:52,620
if you would wings or Delta dream flight.

1286
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:55,460
Cause every time they updated those rides,

1287
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,180
they're like, oh, the people mover,

1288
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:00,580
we gotta make an eyeline for the people mover view.

1289
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,820
And I think it was really clean for,

1290
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:04,660
if you had wings,

1291
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:08,660
you could see into the different like footage scenes.

1292
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:09,500
Okay.

1293
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,340
Mm-hmm.

1294
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,340
It's, yeah, I'm trying to remember.

1295
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:13,660
Cause so much of this stuff,

1296
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,580
I think even blends together.

1297
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:19,100
We've talked about sort of how we were kids in Epcot.

1298
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:21,820
Epcot, all the dark rides are sort of a piece.

1299
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:25,140
And in my memory, world of motion could be

1300
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,540
part of my spaceship earth memory.

1301
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,740
It's hard to sometimes,

1302
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,980
but I think some of the people mover stuff

1303
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:33,340
is also mixed in with that too.

1304
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,180
Well, that's why-

1305
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,820
For so many trips to Disney world.

1306
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:39,100
I was shocked to find all this old 90s footage

1307
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,620
where the narration is the same,

1308
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,620
but the music keeps changing.

1309
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:43,460
Right.

1310
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:44,280
And that was like-

1311
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,420
That makes it feel like you're either gonna try to turn you,

1312
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,020
like make you go insane.

1313
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,060
Well, I was the one who insisted

1314
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,700
on trying to find the music for Josh.

1315
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:54,420
Look, the whole podcast that we're doing this to ourselves.

1316
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,260
Yeah, sure.

1317
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,740
We're driving ourselves insane.

1318
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,100
But I'm saying like, it's so interesting.

1319
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,260
Cause yeah, you're like,

1320
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:03,620
it's just like kind of a little off of what your memory is.

1321
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:04,460
Yeah.

1322
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,740
And then you're like watching something you're like,

1323
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:06,580
I remember this music.

1324
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,140
I was eventually right in the 2000.

1325
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:10,860
I'm looking back, I was right in the 2000s,

1326
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:12,700
but I just filled in the blanks of like,

1327
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,220
okay, I like this half and I like this half.

1328
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:18,100
Like we could completely wreck people's memory

1329
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:21,140
if we find a lot of footage from rides

1330
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,260
that are no longer there.

1331
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,940
And then subtly edit together scenes

1332
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:27,020
that didn't belong on the same ride.

1333
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:27,860
Yeah.

1334
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,700
And music that wasn't on the thing.

1335
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,700
Like if you could do it in a subtle way,

1336
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,180
you can completely reshape people's memories

1337
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,500
of what these rides were.

1338
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,820
Make them really upset.

1339
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,020
Yeah, make people upset.

1340
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:40,380
And it could be a long con of some kind.

1341
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,700
I don't know how we got money out of it,

1342
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,300
but at least we get some laughs.

1343
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,140
I don't know.

1344
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:44,960
Well, there's all that, you know,

1345
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,780
those like Mandela effect type, like Berenstein bears.

1346
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:48,620
Yeah.

1347
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,580
And those things that people,

1348
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:52,540
there are some people who just find all that stuff

1349
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:53,380
kind of interesting.

1350
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,460
And then there's others who are like,

1351
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:59,460
and see, that's what proves that Hillary is drinking.

1352
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:03,220
But like somehow there's a path from,

1353
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:04,580
I remember things not so,

1354
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:07,500
I remember a movie called Shazam to,

1355
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:11,420
now see, this proves that there's adrenochrome.

1356
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:14,620
And I'm not sure how those things connect, but they do.

1357
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:15,460
That's true.

1358
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,340
People are really off the.

1359
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,420
It's just seeing like there's stuff out there, man.

1360
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:20,740
If you look for the little things,

1361
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:22,740
it proves the bigger picture.

1362
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:25,380
Yeah, no, that's a whole nother episode.

1363
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:29,380
But yes, there is a direct line from like,

1364
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,580
misremembering a theme song to a cartoon

1365
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:35,180
to lizard people walk among us.

1366
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:36,020
Yeah.

1367
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:37,900
That's what it opens up Pandora's box.

1368
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,660
Like, yeah, that's possible.

1369
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:40,500
Right.

1370
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,140
Isn't it possible that Tom Hanks has just a big bottle

1371
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,460
of infant blood every night?

1372
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:46,420
Yes.

1373
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:48,900
It's because I forgot the second line

1374
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,900
to the tailspin theme song.

1375
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,220
I've been misremembering it this whole time.

1376
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,380
I always thought it was win it if you spin it,

1377
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,540
but then I looked it up and it was spin it in a minute.

1378
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:58,380
Right.

1379
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,940
So therefore.

1380
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:00,780
Therefore.

1381
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:01,860
You wanna go storm the Capitol?

1382
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,460
Don't mind if I do.

1383
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:05,620
I'm hijacking the Senate mover.

1384
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,980
Well, the little versions of that is like when,

1385
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,860
if you prove someone wrong,

1386
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,940
you see people being proved wrong on the internet

1387
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,060
and they go like, well,

1388
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:15,020
the fact that I would believe it was real

1389
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,100
that says something about our modern era.

1390
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,260
And you're just like, shut the fuck up.

1391
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,500
That's how changing the world.

1392
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,860
That's like on the playground just deciding.

1393
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:25,660
And I have the infinity weapon that defeats everything.

1394
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:26,980
Yes, exactly.

1395
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:32,420
Anyway, my memory of Tomorrowland and the TTA is perfect.

1396
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,980
Eventually they did add PeopleMover back.

1397
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:38,380
Isn't it now today called the PeopleMover again?

1398
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:41,300
It is now called the Tomorrowland Transit Authority

1399
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,260
PeopleMover.

1400
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,100
But isn't there,

1401
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,180
I think in the last couple months,

1402
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,660
it may have gone back even further.

1403
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,060
Oh really?

1404
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:48,900
To just PeopleMover?

1405
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,580
I think maybe.

1406
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:51,420
Let's see.

1407
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:52,260
I barely.

1408
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,060
On the Disney World website should have the official.

1409
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,980
Oh, that'd be the source.

1410
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:56,820
Yeah.

1411
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:57,660
Right.

1412
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:00,660
So, cause they have the official name of Ride listed.

1413
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,940
And it is still Tomorrowland Transit Authority

1414
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,460
PeopleMover on the website.

1415
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,300
Okay.

1416
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,540
So I guess that's the official.

1417
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:07,380
So.

1418
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,180
I thought I'd seen that maybe they just reduced it

1419
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,020
all the way.

1420
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:10,840
But you're right.

1421
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,340
They were not using,

1422
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:13,180
we'll see the way,

1423
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:15,060
well the way I remember it proves that maybe

1424
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,220
there's some possibility.

1425
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:20,020
No, but it was just Tomorrowland Transit Authority

1426
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:20,860
and then they intruded,

1427
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:23,420
like why not put this nice term PeopleMover

1428
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:25,580
that people have fun as for back into it.

1429
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,060
And those can all live together.

1430
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:30,820
I think maybe that was added back in around the time

1431
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,300
of that thing I hate,

1432
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,980
like the narration I hate.

1433
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:34,820
Okay.

1434
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,580
Of the more funky.

1435
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:40,100
I think this 2022 might've brought back that chime,

1436
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:43,220
that little like three thing.

1437
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,260
That's part of your ringtone.

1438
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,100
That's part of my ringtone.

1439
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,340
That takes you back.

1440
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:47,740
Very satisfying chime.

1441
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,340
It is very satisfying chime.

1442
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:51,180
But yeah.

1443
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:55,700
And it's funny to think about like young me going like,

1444
00:53:55,700 --> 00:54:00,460
I like this middle-aged man doing a version of an old man

1445
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:03,220
doing public service announcements for the city.

1446
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:04,060
Like I don't,

1447
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:07,220
I know what rides are in there.

1448
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,700
Like tell me the backstory.

1449
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:13,380
Tell me the reality of the cityscape you've created.

1450
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:14,500
Weird children.

1451
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,940
Weird, weird wild stuff.

1452
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:18,180
Strange fixations, weird children.

1453
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:22,780
Little quick hits about what's different in Florida

1454
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:25,500
besides the electromagnetic thing.

1455
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,020
It's also all flat.

1456
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:30,140
That's the only, with the difference in the tracks,

1457
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,060
it did that this Tomorrowland one didn't have the power

1458
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:32,900
to take you uphill.

1459
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:35,140
So you couldn't do the like climbing and descending

1460
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:39,380
over the Autopia track like you could in Disneyland.

1461
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,820
What's the other?

1462
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:42,660
The cover.

1463
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:43,860
They made the whole thing covered.

1464
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:44,860
No roofs.

1465
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:45,780
On the cars.

1466
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,500
It's just all got a big roof.

1467
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,380
Yeah, yeah.

1468
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,060
There's a little bit of the voiceover

1469
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,060
that we have not mentioned,

1470
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:54,140
which is when a very specific person is paged.

1471
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:54,980
Of course.

1472
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:56,140
This is what I wanted to mention.

1473
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:56,980
Oh, okay.

1474
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,300
There you go.

1475
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,220
There is a little, probably those little chimes

1476
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:03,100
and then you hear paging Mr. Morrow.

1477
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,220
Paging Mr. Tom Morrow.

1478
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,060
Yes.

1479
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:07,740
Which is a name that's been part of a lot

1480
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:08,860
of Tomorrowland things.

1481
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:09,700
Yes.

1482
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:12,740
If you got the pun, I don't know if you got Tom Morrow,

1483
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:14,220
what the pun is there.

1484
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,780
I'll say I always knew they said this.

1485
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,420
I think I got it.

1486
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:22,660
And then of course, this is why my favorite YouTuber

1487
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:25,580
has taken the name Paging Mr. Morrow

1488
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:26,780
is because of this reference.

1489
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:27,620
Yeah.

1490
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:30,740
So now I have a lot more fondness for this section

1491
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:33,300
of the People Mover because of how much content

1492
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:38,020
of the gentleman, real name Nate, but his name,

1493
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:40,780
which we can't find this, maybe this question to ask.

1494
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,740
The internet says his name is Nate Morrow.

1495
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:44,580
I don't know if.

1496
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,420
Name is Morrow.

1497
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,260
I do not know his last name.

1498
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,740
I don't know if that's real, I think,

1499
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:50,220
but he goes by the moniker Mr. Morrow on YouTube.

1500
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,820
If we have him on, we can ask.

1501
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:53,540
But by him, I mean Peter Rennaday.

1502
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:54,660
When we have Peter Rennaday on,

1503
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,500
we can ask if he knows what's Morrow's real name.

1504
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,340
We can only have Peter Rennaday

1505
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,020
if he's in character Splinter the whole time.

1506
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:00,740
That's my, that's what I want.

1507
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:05,580
Yes, today Splinter, you may know him as a Master Sensei rep.

1508
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:09,140
He's going to teach us ninjutsu today.

1509
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:11,460
But yeah, so now I have a lot of,

1510
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:15,940
I'm gonna like cheer next time I go on this section.

1511
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:18,140
Cause I also like watching, cause Mr. Morrow

1512
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:21,180
is in Disney World almost every day and he's making videos.

1513
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,740
He makes a big deal when he goes on the People Mover

1514
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:25,580
and he like kind of makes a thing.

1515
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:26,420
He does a little point.

1516
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:27,260
Jason watches this.

1517
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,580
Okay, the point that you do when.

1518
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:30,420
Green Day comes on.

1519
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,260
Green Day comes on.

1520
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,100
Green Day comes on.

1521
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:32,940
Green Day comes on.

1522
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:33,760
Green Day comes on.

1523
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,600
Green Day comes on.

1524
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,440
Green Day comes on.

1525
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,120
Mr. Morrow is my favorite TV show.

1526
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,240
I want to say that as well.

1527
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:42,440
I think you can find the name in the Disneyland People Mover.

1528
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,040
One of the narrations there.

1529
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,640
They say real quick.

1530
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,720
Yeah.

1531
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,680
Mr. Johnson is mentioned.

1532
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:52,840
Well, they say Mr. Johnson in the one narration,

1533
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,960
I think is giving the traffic and weather report

1534
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,720
and another, I think they say paging Mr. Morrow,

1535
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,880
call Mr. Johnson.

1536
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,720
You are having trouble keeping these straight in your head.

1537
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,440
After 23 versions?

1538
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,280
Sure.

1539
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,100
Yeah.

1540
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:11,100
After watching the arc from like Super 8 to VHS to digital,

1541
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,280
like yeah, sure.

1542
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,260
Yeah, yeah.

1543
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:18,520
Okay, you know, we've been like very detail oriented

1544
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,480
in this episode.

1545
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:23,420
I'm going to bring up really quickly two big parts

1546
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:27,680
of the human experience that tie into the People Mover.

1547
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,520
Go ahead.

1548
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,520
One is death.

1549
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,720
I don't want to meditate on this for long,

1550
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,160
but it's worth mentioning this somehow,

1551
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,480
this pleasant ride that we have enjoyed talking about

1552
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,880
so much for two episodes is one of the deadliest rides

1553
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,680
and it's not Disney's fault, I don't think.

1554
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,260
Just early, like people just start,

1555
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:48,440
like in two cases, teenagers just were trying to pass

1556
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,440
from car to car.

1557
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,720
Jumping from car to car.

1558
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,280
Yeah, yeah.

1559
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:56,800
Including one was a month after it opened in 1967.

1560
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,800
This nice, one month in, it had a death on its hands.

1561
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,120
Crazy.

1562
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,580
One was Grad night.

1563
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:05,720
How grim is that?

1564
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,920
There is a Grad night death and somebody,

1565
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,280
I'll tease this, somebody who's been on the show,

1566
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,360
somebody we know, their mom was at that Grad night

1567
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,200
where it happened.

1568
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,040
Jesus.

1569
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:21,240
I won't tell, let them bum us out with a sad story later

1570
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,720
if they want to.

1571
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,560
These deaths were all at the Disneyland version, correct?

1572
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:29,120
Yes, well, there was recently an older man

1573
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,980
who died on the Disney World one,

1574
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:34,020
but I don't think it had anything to do with the ride.

1575
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,780
I think it was just pre-existing conditions.

1576
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:36,620
Yeah.

1577
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:38,580
Or so Disney would have you believe.

1578
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:41,980
I think some of the Disneyland versions

1579
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:44,060
led to lots of different safety,

1580
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:49,060
like led to the kind of more caged ride vehicles

1581
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:51,700
and then led to the Florida,

1582
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:54,020
like I think the Florida programming,

1583
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:57,540
I think they can like stop on a dime a lot more.

1584
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:58,380
They can just kill them.

1585
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:00,320
They can just not people, what is the wrong word?

1586
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,440
They can kill the vehicles.

1587
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,840
They can stop the vehicles.

1588
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:03,720
That's the better word.

1589
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:04,560
Right.

1590
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,400
Disney cannot.

1591
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,220
Yeah, you can't say.

1592
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:08,520
Walt's space laser was not created

1593
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:11,000
and is so exacting that it can bounce through a people

1594
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,440
mover tunnel and take out people who don't look right

1595
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,720
to the Disney company.

1596
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,080
When Walt's God was still alive,

1597
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,000
God used to be able to just pick the person out of the car,

1598
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:21,960
but that was before.

1599
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,400
Well, that's why they made it go through Space Mountain.

1600
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,360
You just, you don't see the claw coming for you.

1601
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,320
It just plugs you.

1602
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,560
When you come out the other side,

1603
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,240
there's one less senior party.

1604
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,440
Wait, that's something we haven't talked about in both

1605
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,920
versions. You can go into Space Mountain.

1606
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:36,760
I know.

1607
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:39,760
And there's nothing better who doesn't want to go on Space

1608
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:40,600
Mountain.

1609
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:41,880
I'm sure I've said before the,

1610
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,720
the first time I went in the part of the first time I went

1611
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:44,880
on the people mover and it said,

1612
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,680
you're going into Space Mountain.

1613
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,840
I started screaming at my mom with,

1614
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,920
they said we're going in it's skin.

1615
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,520
She said, no, no, no, we're just going into the building.

1616
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,360
We're not.

1617
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,360
No, they said it's going to be it.

1618
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,480
I'm going to like, in my mind,

1619
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,960
this was a trap that Disney made to force children to go on

1620
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:06,920
scary rides. They weren't ready to go on without harnesses,

1621
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:10,040
without even being in the proper vehicle to do so.

1622
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,080
Like at that moment,

1623
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:14,520
I thought this is an evil company that's like going to put me

1624
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,520
into a big machine and grind me up.

1625
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,160
That's so interesting. How old were you about when there?

1626
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:22,080
Well, I hope this was when I was three.

1627
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:25,280
I actually mean to ask it as if it was eight.

1628
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,120
I do not know.

1629
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,640
That was not with my intention for asking the question.

1630
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:31,560
Cause it's interesting the type of scared kids we were.

1631
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:36,560
Cause I was sort of the like clench my seat,

1632
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,840
close my eyes as tight as possible.

1633
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,320
But I don't think I was like yelling like that.

1634
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,600
You just internalized.

1635
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,400
I internalized and it is so what I do to this day.

1636
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,560
I think I do too. Cause I like, you know,

1637
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,480
I like complain a lot.

1638
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,640
That's probably what I, that's me.

1639
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,520
That's my version of screaming.

1640
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,320
It's interesting cause we still have our same versions of

1641
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:02,320
dealing with whatever dealing with stress, yelling to anyone who listens.

1642
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:07,160
And I just sit there clenching and you're just grabbing the chair.

1643
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,360
Jason, what were you, you never got scared on these?

1644
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,120
You were so, you were just kicked back. You put your feet up.

1645
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:17,080
Oh, not on these. No, I loved going into space.

1646
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,680
Mountain. I let you saw the lift hill.

1647
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,200
I'm saying what kind of nothing, what kind of a scared kid,

1648
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,800
if you were in a, like you were five years old and you were scared.

1649
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,360
I would invent impossible scenarios.

1650
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,560
How would you express it? I guess what I'm saying,

1651
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:31,000
would you be loud and say, or would you kind of just be quiet?

1652
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,200
Internalize until it got to a point where it was too much and I burst into tears.

1653
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,040
And that's about right. What you do now, I think.

1654
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,120
Does that ring true to this day?

1655
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,400
I, I try to minimalize.

1656
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,840
I try to use healthy coping mechanisms nowadays.

1657
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:50,680
Well, that's much like the people mover put mechanisms in place so that people don't die.

1658
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,400
Yeah. But you've given yourself safety mechanisms.

1659
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:58,760
Yes. The space mountain stuff in Florida, I, you know, they,

1660
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:03,320
the music cues are often very good. You see the lift hill. You,

1661
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:07,960
if you're lucky, you see the work lights on it's main place to see it with the lights on.

1662
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:12,280
Oh yeah. If there's a problem on the ride and you can ride through it and see the whole track,

1663
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:15,360
the space mountain track, which looks so ugly and bad.

1664
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,760
Horrifying. Oh, awful. Yeah.

1665
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:21,120
Two different rides. So like if one breaks down, the other can keep going.

1666
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,800
Like they're not dependent on each other.

1667
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,880
When they do major construction, they close both.

1668
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:31,800
The other thing is in very early versions of this ride, you could look down into the

1669
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:39,840
then sponsor RCA into the home of future living, a very cumbersome name,

1670
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,960
because I guess the house of the future was already taken.

1671
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,520
Future living. Yeah.

1672
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:52,080
Huh? I, that the view that you get going, going between the two lift hill,

1673
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:57,440
that's a big superior part of the, uh, going between the two space mountain lift hills.

1674
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,480
So maybe you're getting space mountain rockets on either side of you.

1675
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,840
There's the upside down people working with space tools. Oh man.

1676
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:08,960
Above you. That's a great dramatic viewpoint. Very cool part of the people mover down there.

1677
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:14,960
Also, when I was a kid and it was sponsored by FedEx, I love the exiting scene where the

1678
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:21,200
astronauts are making FedEx delivery. Like they have FedEx boxes. It added to the city,

1679
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:27,200
like the functioning futuristic society element. I think I think I just liked it because it's like,

1680
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:31,520
yeah, well we saw the shipping department and now it's FedEx. So I guess they beam,

1681
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:38,240
they beam the packages, right? Yeah. And earlier when I said big elements of human

1682
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:45,760
existence, one was death. The other is sex. Um, that one story, uh, this was from Erin,

1683
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:51,600
not her and not us. Sorry to lay you down. Uh, she, she talked to somebody once who said,

1684
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:56,640
oh yeah, I love Disney. I, you know what I used to do? Uh, my, my girlfriend at the time and I,

1685
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:01,280
uh, would go on the people mover and we wrote it a bunch of times and we found where all the cameras

1686
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:08,160
were and then found the longest stretch inside, but there are no cameras. And we, in that, in that

1687
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:18,240
zone, we did some sex full death. I don't know. I don't think she, she maybe was ready to not hear

1688
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,800
further details about this person. Turn into a Howard Stern in the 1990s.

1689
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:29,440
What are you going down on her? You know what's going on? You flip around. What was it? Yeah.

1690
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:34,400
She didn't decide to quiz was great. Big tomorrow plan. What, uh, what do you think

1691
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:38,240
were you above star traders? What's a trot superspeed tunnel? Where was it? Uh,

1692
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:42,720
where at one or the current narrator or they, who's named to our FI it's kind of a throwback

1693
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:48,560
to where Mike hop on that Sibian real quick. The sex device of the future, you know,

1694
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:53,680
the other detail I like from the story. She, she said like, this was back when they were, uh,

1695
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:59,840
when, when this guy was in his punk days and he had his punk girlfriend. So these two punks,

1696
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:06,160
these hard rock punk or mohawks. That's what I was, I, again, no further ado, but imagine what you,

1697
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:11,920
I guess like who knows now in today's big brother security state, I don't think punks are able to

1698
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:18,960
have sex on this ride. No, but back in, uh, you know, back in Sid and Nancy days, you could go

1699
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:24,320
ahead and get on with your giant mohawks and go to town. Yeah. Not with these current wait times.

1700
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:30,080
I think last year we waited, or like two years ago, we waited like 30, 35 minutes to get on.

1701
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:34,560
I don't know if it's from the breaking down, but like the railroad and the people mover

1702
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:39,920
have just had insane weights. Well, they may have been, they may have been taking the time to chase

1703
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:46,560
out some, uh, penetration, power wash those pleasing blue ride vehicles.

1704
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:52,880
Jason, that makes Jason sick to his stomach. Do not, if you do that wherever you want,

1705
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:59,280
you do that in the Capitol building for all I care. I have allegiance to one thing. Absolutely.

1706
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:04,400
Go do it. And you know, did anyone have sex in the, was that ever part of it? I don't think so,

1707
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:09,760
but I don't think those lame-os, they should have, they were just stealing laptops and smearing shits.

1708
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:14,960
Two of them, two of those ugly weirdos should have had some sex in there. Here should be a new

1709
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:20,320
part of Disneyland forward to curb this problem. If it's still a problem, bring back holiday hill,

1710
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:26,720
a new version of the hill that was there before the matter horn where people used to neck with

1711
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:33,280
each other, the nasty trash hill, bring the hill back so people can neck. There's no necking spots

1712
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:39,440
in the parks anymore. So that was the old day. So let's bring it back with this and forward.

1713
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:44,960
When we bulldoze Harbor Boulevard business, small businesses, one of those places that will,

1714
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:50,960
one of the attractions that will rise is a new holiday hill. The neck nook, the neck nook,

1715
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:58,480
calling all neckers, all neckers. Let me say this. I think this is funny is that when they're

1716
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:04,560
telling you, you can't use one of the people mover vehicles. Have you seen this? There's a real lo-fi

1717
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:09,520
thing they do, at least in this video. I don't know if it's currently happening is they just

1718
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:19,840
throw up a red cone in the vehicle, like a traffic cone. That's great. Just one single

1719
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:24,960
cone sitting there. Wasn't there a fun way they could say it's like an off, it's off to,

1720
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:30,480
oh, it's repair what? Like a sign with a robot. Whoops, fixing this one. At least a cone with a

1721
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:37,120
big gear in it. At least a cone with a big gear in it. So regular cone, but they just throw up

1722
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:42,960
one cone in there. There's still cones in the future. Yeah, not a future. It's not a future cone.

1723
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:51,600
Look, we've seen our paths. We've seen the bad rotting track world that we have to deal with

1724
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:58,160
in Los Angeles. And then we've seen the bustling metropolis full of hover burbs and

1725
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:06,240
de-atomizing FedEx stations. And I don't know, I'm just so glad they kept it. I'm really going to

1726
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:12,400
make a point every time I go, I gotta go to the Tomorrowland Transit Authority or the Tomorrowland

1727
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:17,920
Transit 30 people mover or whatever you want to call it. And I'm also always sad to get off

1728
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:24,000
when you go back to that station, like, no, you're kidding. This could be a half hour and I'd be

1729
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:30,880
happy. So I guess I feel similar now as we return to the station and thus ends our people mover

1730
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:35,520
export. Cause they never made another. Why didn't this go to Tokyo? Why didn't go to Paris? It's a

1731
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:41,760
great ride. It only went to a shitty basement in Houston. Yeah, I don't know. It's a good question,

1732
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:46,480
but they definitely, not Shanghai doesn't have a version of it, right? There's nothing even close

1733
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:51,040
to it. I don't think so. And it's funny because like that marketing material I was talking about

1734
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:56,800
when they were trying to sell it to people, it did say like the Ford Magic Skyway, Disneyland,

1735
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:03,200
Disney World, the Houston airport. So like they kept saying like we use it in the theme parks

1736
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:10,720
and that you, you know, takes 40,000 people a day. So how much does your, you know, airport or

1737
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:17,040
shopping mall or city use? You know? And so like, yeah, I don't know why they didn't put it anywhere

1738
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:22,320
else. Probably because of maintenance cost. Yeah, I guess. I mean, I'm trying to like, it's, it's

1739
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:28,080
always pretty popular. It obviously loads fast in Florida, but there's been times when I've seen like

1740
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:34,000
a good line. Like there's often a good line waiting to get on it. The line is pretty gnarly

1741
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:41,200
now where it's just like temporary stanchions next to the Astro Orbiter line. And then the like poor

1742
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:47,360
cast member with a sign on the stick. Yeah. That must suck being the sign on the stick guy who has

1743
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:53,360
to move depending on how long the line goes. Yeah. I guess I don't really know the answer why that

1744
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:56,960
hasn't been built, but it, I'm sure it's probably for the same reason at the Bantha thing. Like it

1745
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:02,800
feels like that's the expendable cost when you're building stuff is like, well, this is superfluous

1746
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:08,880
and it's not going to be as attractive of a ride to people. But I think it's a mistake. And I also

1747
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:14,240
think there's a version of it where you plus up little show scenes and you make it a little bit

1748
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:20,400
more of an elevated, elevated experience. Yeah. Little sparkly, make those hallways cool. It is

1749
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:25,120
crazy that they don't just put flashing lights in the hallways and you are just moving through

1750
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:33,200
industrial tunnels. Make it like the space mountain holiday overlay. Yeah. Blast music in there.

1751
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:39,360
It takes, it takes as much as like, it's what it takes to make a party bus cool. Yes. All you need

1752
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:46,720
to do. Yes. And I will call my shot future episode this year, party bus. Party bus is like a little

1753
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:53,280
party buses in general. That sounds good. Well, if it means we have to rent one and drive it around.

1754
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:58,720
It does mean that. So where are we going tonight? Boys? Nowhere. Just take us in a loop. We will

1755
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:05,040
review the experience on our podcast. Well, that is a thing that you go like, well, the people movers

1756
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:10,400
aren't technically a mode of transit because they start and end at the same place except for the one

1757
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:18,080
in Houston and the Capitol. Okay. Right. But I don't know. The company, look, Bob Iger's got a lot on

1758
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:24,400
this plate, but I think looking, taking a hard look at people movers. I think it's a little,

1759
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:29,920
it's quietly just a thing that makes the theme parks what they are. Yeah. It gives you like,

1760
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:34,880
I got on a ride even on the most crowded day on the most hot day and the most rainy day. Yeah.

1761
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:40,720
I went on one ride and it was like, it gives you one. It's pleasant. Nobody's unhappy coming off

1762
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:46,640
that thing. And there's enough technology to make little show stuff, scenes and stuff, probably not

1763
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:53,600
in a crazy expensive way, make you feel like you had a little extra experience. It's not just a

1764
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:59,280
little mode of transportation and waste some time. And Bob, you like the NBA. Bob Iger loves the NBA.

1765
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:06,640
That's true. His wife's name remind me. Willow. Yeah. What's the name? I don't remember. Bay.

1766
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:12,720
Willow Bay. Yeah. Yeah. That's the thing people talk about with sports, right? With

1767
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:18,480
uh, professional sports and athlete intangibles. He hasn't even know where you're going.

1768
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:24,800
Well, I think like stuff like the people mover are the intangibles where they're hard to quantify

1769
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:30,960
for like the money men, you know, right. But they noticeably add things to the park. So it's easy

1770
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:37,600
to cut because it's just like, well, then we save, you know, right. No, $1000. Right. No IP. It's not

1771
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:42,000
a thrill ride. It's sort of just like, well, it's kind of like the train, isn't it? Like we have the

1772
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:48,080
train and there's a, yeah, it's in the middle of all this real estate who cares, but everybody who

1773
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:52,400
is interested, I don't think there's anybody who doesn't like the people mover. Yeah. I don't think

1774
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:57,440
so. I think it's sort of a universally agreed upon. Yeah. It's great. Cause you can, so I hope so

1775
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:03,920
pregnant people, babies, like anyone can go on the people. Horny people. Yes. Horny punks, horny

1776
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:12,560
crap. You know, as long as they can dodge cameras, they can make it their own. Right. Yeah. It's great.

1777
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:18,080
I, I really liked the thing and I'm glad we talked about it for a while. You survived podcast.

1778
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:23,440
There I had a second round, a second loop. We did the little go one more time. One more time.

1779
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:29,040
Old boy. Let's take a vote. The audience want to stop being referred to as Clifford's and be called

1780
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:36,960
horny punks from now on. No, it's okay. Even further removed from theme parks. Let's not do that.

1781
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:42,160
Then a couple of people. Yes. Yes, I would. Yes. You finally, you see who I am. You may know.

1782
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:52,880
I'm so wrong. This is what Mickey hugs me. Hey, thanks for listening and believe in the promise of tomorrow.
