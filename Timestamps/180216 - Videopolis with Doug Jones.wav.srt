00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:19,880
Calling all teams. Today, a musical kaleidoscope of sight and sound. Neon light sticks, fast dancing, surplus 1984 Olympics equipment, and bodacious sets from Swedish Eagle and DJ White Rabbit. We're going to the top. It's Videopolis on Podcast The Ride.

2
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:50,140
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a show hosted by three guys who believe people should not be judged by the color of their skin, but by their high score on Buzz Lightyear's astroblasters.

3
00:00:51,160 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm galactic hero Scott Gairdner. I'm joined by space scout Mike Carlson. Greetings. And cosmic commando Jason Sheridan.

4
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,080
Hi, where does that rank on the chart?

5
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,880
I gave myself the highest one, which is really selfish of me.

6
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,480
Oh, you came up with that joke?

7
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:17,380
None of them are the last. Yeah, that's my reward for thinking of the joke. And none of them are the lowest. The lowest is sort of if you just don't shoot at all.

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,180
And you guys, you shot and you did well. Although those names probably don't reflect our actual scores. I'm terrible at astroblasters.

9
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,560
I always get the same thing. It's always in like the 200,000 range or 300,000 range.

10
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,560
Yeah, my brother is amazing at it.

11
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,840
Well, you have to know the secrets.

12
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,380
Yeah, you got to know the colors.

13
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,740
Do we know the secrets, Scott?

14
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,660
I think I just found one that I got 100,000 in one shot and I feel great about it.

15
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,780
I think it's the blue ones, right?

16
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,660
No, Jason.

17
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,140
Or the purple ones?

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,820
No, Jason, no. There are unpainted, unlit targets on Buzz Lightyear's astroblasters.

19
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,820
Oh, I don't have time for this.

20
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,680
You have to know where to look.

21
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:53,980
Okay.

22
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,760
And then you shoot, like when you go in that dark tunnel, there's a secret one against the wall.

23
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:05,280
So hopefully the car gets, the best case scenario is the car gets stuck right there and you shoot it for like five minutes.

24
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,520
But that thing will give you so many extra points.

25
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:16,160
Yeah, I'm very good at Men in Black Alien Attack getting the 100,000 bonus by pressing the self-destruct button.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,080
Oh yeah, I've heard of this. Do you know also about the Midway Mania secret?

27
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:20,820
No.

28
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,580
No, what is that?

29
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,280
There's tons of them. I can't even, I should have said secrets plural.

30
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,380
There's tons of them and we cannot waste our audience's time anymore.

31
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,040
No, we can't. We've got a lot.

32
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:37,260
But there are tons of them and you have to look for little things and it shoots out and it changes the whole complexion of the characters on the ride. It's crazy.

33
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,640
Yes, look it up.

34
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:46,600
They're not even in the ride. You have to have an app. You have to start firing on the app before you even get on site.

35
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,360
You stay up all night until you land at DCA.

36
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,840
Alright, but yes, look, there's a lot to get to because we have a great guest today.

37
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:07,100
There's so much to describe you. You're a raconteur. You're an actor and a writer and a DJ and a drunk history narrator and a video remixer.

38
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,620
But most of all, you're a big theme park nerd like us and we're happy to welcome Doug Jones to the show.

39
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,700
Hi.

40
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,620
Hi, Doug. Welcome.

41
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,100
Thank you for that introduction.

42
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:19,960
Absolutely.

43
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,160
You guys wrote an introduction for yourselves, so can I write one for myself right now?

44
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:25,700
Absolutely.

45
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,320
It's only fair. I am a 38-year-old who likes to live life to the max.

46
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,080
Several X's in max, I would assume.

47
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:34,780
Thank you.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,040
Doug, you said that so loud we have to recalibrate or record your booming voice.

49
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,780
I, uh, lashing through.

50
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,840
Should I keep the microphone like...

51
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,420
Far away from me.

52
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,760
Yeah, we're going to put it on a boom pole and then into a C-stand.

53
00:03:51,300 --> 00:04:01,140
I'm so excited to be here. It's going to be really hard for me not to be projecting loudly into the mic for the next five hours.

54
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,240
Which hopefully will be edited down to two.

55
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,320
If we can. If we manage to do it.

56
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,960
In all seriousness, move it back closer. You're making me nervous now.

57
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,440
Might not be picked up at all.

58
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,140
Alright, well, yeah, we're here. There's so much that we could talk about with you, Doug.

59
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,840
But we're here specifically to talk about a topic I've been looking forward to for a while, which is Vidiopolis.

60
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:32,140
And Vidiopolis, if you don't know, was an 80's teen dance club that was open in the late 80's at Disneyland up near It's a Small World.

61
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,780
And there's a ton of issues that this thing brings up, especially the fact that Disneyland, to Disneyland's dismay,

62
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:46,660
Vidiopolis really opened up a Pandora's box of rowdy youth culture entering the park for the first time.

63
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,400
And some of these negative elements remain to this day.

64
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,800
And there's a story that people have asked us on Twitter to talk about a little bit.

65
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,480
I forget how much on the show we've talked about the Disneyland gangs.

66
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,620
But there are, well, you wouldn't necessarily call them gangs.

67
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,520
Social clubs, Scott. Please, social clubs.

68
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:15,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But there is the thought recently in a lawsuit alleging that some of the social clubs have engaged in more gang-like activity.

69
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:22,180
There was a story in the LA Times, I'll just read their synopsis of it, that the head of one of these clubs,

70
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:33,320
oh, but by the way, if you're at Disneyland, keep an eye out for big roving groups of social club members who wear vests with patches all over them.

71
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,780
And sort of a Sons of Anarchy fashion. That's how you describe it, right?

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,120
Yeah, many of them look like their favorite songs probably have the phrase,

73
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,260
a-wop-bop, a-loo-bop, a-wop-bam-boo in them. A lot of rockabilly looks.

74
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,280
Greasers.

75
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:59,960
Like the patches, though, instead of having maybe like a skull or a motorcycle, it'll have Jack Skellington on it or Captain Hook or, you know.

76
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,480
Like Tinkerbell with tattoos or something.

77
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:12,300
Or Darby O'Gill and the little people. And they got cuts, but they're cuts. They got leather or denim vests.

78
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,620
Motorcycle gang calls them cuts.

79
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,140
Oh, okay. I thought you were saying the word cucks.

80
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,380
Oh, no, no.

81
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:25,000
The recently relevant term cucks, and I was like, that's a bold statement. I wouldn't mess with these guys and call them that.

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,120
Yeah, I wouldn't at all do that.

83
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,600
I think just the hippest, coolest guy on the podcast has just shown us up as far as slang goes once again.

84
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,800
He's thirsty for slang.

85
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,200
Yeah, I love slang and Sons of Anarchy lingo and all that stuff.

86
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,440
So anyway, what is occurring is that, okay, so the head of one, according to the LA Times,

87
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:53,680
the head of one of these clubs has accused another of using gangster-like tactics to collect protection money for a charity fundraiser at the park.

88
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,520
So there's a lawsuit now, and forgive me, I forget the sides, I forget who's who in this story,

89
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:06,440
but the lawsuit is between the Main Street Fire Station 55 social club and the White Rabbits social club.

90
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:16,480
And the flames of this feud have been lit by podcasts like this one apparently, and I don't seek to add fuel to this fire.

91
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:23,500
In fact, all I want to happen is for all of these social clubs to just get along and make peace.

92
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:31,960
And that's relevant to us as well, because all three of us, the hosts of the show, are all in Disneyland social clubs. Isn't that right?

93
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,100
Different clubs.

94
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:39,180
Yeah, we are in different clubs, and yet we put our differences aside to come together to do this podcast.

95
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,980
And that's why we want to just encourage peace between everybody.

96
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,600
If you guys want to talk about your groups.

97
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:53,340
Well, I'll go first. I'm not the head of the group, but I would say I'm sort of the vice mayor kind of a thing.

98
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,960
We kind of have a whole hierarchy to it, but I can't get into that.

99
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,480
Or I couldn't, I could, but it would take too much time.

100
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,480
But anyway, as a very prominent member of the Disneyland social club, Eeyore's Reason to Live,

101
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:09,800
I want to say that these social clubs are not about anger or violence.

102
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:17,580
They're about getting together with some good buddies, wearing some thick denim, some of the thickest denim that you can find,

103
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:29,260
and growing a big beard as bushy and as black as it possibly can be, and just loving the park, having an adult libation or two,

104
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:37,620
and just enjoying the time without having kids and enjoying it with your other adult friends.

105
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,420
We can all agree. Sorry, I was getting a little emotional here at the end.

106
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:52,100
I, of course, you know, I am, yeah, I started my social club. I founded my club.

107
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,640
And I've been a subject of controversy in the community.

108
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,760
Of course, I founded a group called the Uncle Urville's Controversial from the start,

109
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:10,160
because in lieu of leather or denim vests, we all wore terry cloth bathrobes with the sleeves cut off.

110
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,940
Also controversial was Carousel of Progress has not been an attraction at Disneyland in quite some time.

111
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:21,860
I was then exiled from the group in a coup orchestrated by Mike Carlson,

112
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,400
much like he tried to snake me on our animatronic of the month poll.

113
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,900
This is before he found it, helped found Ur's Reason to Live.

114
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,880
My current group that I started is known as the Jake Sully's.

115
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,200
Again, controversial, as Avatar is not a Disney property.

116
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,100
It is merely licensed for the World of Avatar section of Animal Kingdom,

117
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:53,020
land that does not even feature Jake Sully, but I like to think I was future looking, future forecasting, some might say,

118
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,800
because that 20th Century Fox merger goes through.

119
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,360
It's gonna be big for the group.

120
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,900
It's gonna be big, big for the group.

121
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,720
Yeah, well look, you guys have personal beef and yet you've been able to put it aside,

122
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,080
and why can't the White Rabbits, the Main Street Fire Station,

123
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,200
I've, you know, probably the listeners already know if you've explored certain corners of the park,

124
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,320
that I run the gang that hangs out at the very top of Tarzan's treehouse.

125
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:23,720
We're a Tarzan-themed gang and we call ourselves the Edgar Rice Burrosers.

126
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:30,640
And, you know, look, I'm not saying we don't resort to some shady stuff to maintain our territory.

127
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,120
You know, yes, we've, you know, people are messing with us.

128
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:39,120
We have had to threaten to use baseball bats to play Phil Collins drum fills on people's kneecaps.

129
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,520
But, you know, it doesn't mean we're actually, you know, we're just trying to maintain the territory.

130
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,080
It doesn't mean we're actually gonna commit any violent acts.

131
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,940
And overall, we're interested in working in a spirit of harmony, you know,

132
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,480
and we're keeping up the motto of two worlds, one family.

133
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,640
Yeah, and you guys also do public service, too.

134
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,660
You stand at the treehouse and tell people whether they want to know it or not.

135
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:08,420
That, like, look, over there, that little teacup and teapot look like Chip and Mrs. Potts from Beauty and the Beast.

136
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,220
Like, all day long, you'll tell them that little bit of trivia.

137
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:12,880
Yeah, we're happy to help.

138
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,540
I think this is, I think we're all headed for, like, a really great, really great breakthrough here as far as, like, talking peace and stuff.

139
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,020
I do want to just remind everyone, stay the fuck out of Critter Country, okay?

140
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:23,540
Whoa.

141
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,780
Stay the fuck out of Critter Country if you're gonna, you know, bring the whole gang there.

142
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:34,440
You can come in singles and maybe pairs, but as far as the whole gang, stay the fuck out of Critter Country.

143
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,380
Why, because it's your territory?

144
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,560
Yeah, Eeyore's reason to live, Critter Country. That's where our brother Eeyore is.

145
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,820
The Hundred Acre Way, you're not wanting to lose any acreage in the Hundred Acre Way.

146
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,200
Yeah, we always have a person or two in line to meet Eeyore at all times.

147
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:52,860
So if any of our brothers or sisters want to get in line to take a photo with Eeyore.

148
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:58,940
The council has talked to you about this. You can't go around making this proclamation. You know that.

149
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:06,800
I respect the wishes and territory. I don't want to rile anything up.

150
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,760
I'd encourage you to, let's all try to avoid profanity if we can.

151
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:11,460
I'm sorry.

152
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,060
Because they are family parks even if none of us have families.

153
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,540
My parents listen to this podcast, so they're...

154
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,100
Is that right?

155
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,620
They don't want to hear words like that.

156
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,660
Oh boy, okay.

157
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:22,500
Oh boy.

158
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:30,000
Well, so there's one rule we all need to adhere to in these social clubs, which is keep the profanity light.

159
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,960
I find myself having to censor myself when I'm at Disneyland because of the amount of children that are around.

160
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:43,080
Do you guys also watch The Lip when you're...

161
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,440
Because I'm one of those people that like, I forget where I am.

162
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,460
You're excited to be there.

163
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,900
I'm excited. Like when you started recording the podcast, I was talking way too loud.

164
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:01,560
I would do the same thing if I'm in line and I, you know, dropping F bombs and maybe S bombs.

165
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,640
And then I quickly realized, oh, I'm at Disneyland. I've got to...

166
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,380
It's easy to forget.

167
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,620
Yeah, try to keep it clean.

168
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,180
Try to keep it clean.

169
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:10,660
Yeah.

170
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,480
I never have a problem.

171
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,100
Because you're a good boy.

172
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,280
Because I'm a very good boy. I will say I scold my girlfriend all the time about that.

173
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,840
She's got the pirate mouth.

174
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,680
She'll throw the F word around.

175
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,260
And I'll say, shh, there's like a child behind us.

176
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,480
And also like, you're not in these walls, not between these walls.

177
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,420
We shouldn't be saying those words.

178
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,920
I also, anytime I'm at any park, I assume that there's microphones everywhere.

179
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,580
That I'm being, everything I say is being recorded.

180
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,700
Yeah, there have to be.

181
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,040
That's fair.

182
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:49,700
So besides the swearing, I don't want to talk anything about my personal life that might get somehow entered into their system.

183
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,660
I know it's a silly thing to...

184
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,720
I mean, I think it's a silly thing to be used as wallah in a film or something.

185
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,380
I mean, you guys talked about that there's like plainclothes security guards everywhere.

186
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,680
Like, I'm saying like, oh, let's go back to the car and get the drugs.

187
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,000
Well, that was a very...

188
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,820
They will follow you to your car.

189
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,860
And make sure that you don'tԽ come back in.

190
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:15,820
A very funny story a few years ago, that two people were in line for going through security,

191
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,020
and were like talking about the edibles they had on them.

192
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,280
And a plainclothes security was around them.

193
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:31,720
And the picture published with the story was like, you could see the plainclothes guy talking to the uniform security guy.

194
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,800
Once they had taken the massage.

195
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,400
And they just said like, hey, you can't let you in today.

196
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,280
You're not banned or anything.

197
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,360
But like, take it off property today.

198
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:46,280
But the plainclothes guy was wearing the goofiest Star Wars dad shirt.

199
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,900
They give him like XL.

200
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,080
And he's like, oh, I'm just a normal tourist.

201
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,280
Cargo shorts.

202
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,340
Tim Burton mad hatter, like frizzy red hair.

203
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,120
Yeah, so it's just him writing up a report on the little, you know, filled out notepad.

204
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,280
A porg backpack.

205
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,900
Which I just saw for the first time at the park yesterday.

206
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,580
And they look ridiculous.

207
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,440
It's like the Yoda I was explaining to the person I was with.

208
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:20,260
That the Yoda, the Wookiee backpacks are like a shrunken down Wookiee.

209
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,400
So it looks weird.

210
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:28,520
But the porg backpacks are like oversized, like way bigger than a porg should be.

211
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,440
And that also looks weird.

212
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,020
I don't like either of them.

213
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,500
It should be like a clutch.

214
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,080
It should be a porg clutch for like ladies.

215
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,360
Like a tiny little bag.

216
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,440
And when you open it, it screams.

217
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,700
Like the porg.

218
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,860
Yeah, that's a good idea.

219
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,840
Yeah, they're kind of a, they're a little shrill.

220
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,840
I think I was expecting the porgs to be cuter.

221
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,320
And they kind of just scream and make a fuss.

222
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,220
I love them.

223
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,360
I understand why they have them wearing them.

224
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:00,620
Because that's the last, a person with a porg backpack is the last person I expect to tackle me.

225
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,420
As soon as I exit the park.

226
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:10,760
Yeah, that's a good, but anybody could have weapons and like fold out batons in their porg backpacks.

227
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,700
You gotta be careful.

228
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:19,500
As always, we're talking about a place that we love that uses North Korean-esque tactics to spy on people.

229
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,680
And prevent illicit substances from entering.

230
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,200
But you know what, they're running a private business.

231
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,520
Yeah, it's private property.

232
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,620
And they, look, the parks are great.

233
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,320
Doug, you're a huge parks fan.

234
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,920
I think we met for that reason.

235
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,220
Yes, our very first conversation, I believe.

236
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,840
Yeah, yeah, I think there were some tells in some of my videos that let you know that I was a theme park guy.

237
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,920
And then you told me about your excellent videos.

238
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,360
I don't want to get the names wrong, but the Mouseketeers Escape from Splash Mountain.

239
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,960
And the Golden Girls Return to Space Mountain.

240
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,840
I could be mixing up Witches Going Where.

241
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,640
Yes, that's about right.

242
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,220
Okay, something like that.

243
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:08,760
But you make these wonderful mini movies that are remixed out of Disneyland specials, some of our favorite things.

244
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,720
Which, these things you've done have delighted me over the years.

245
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,100
Oh, thank you.

246
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,120
Highly recommended to our listeners.

247
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,880
Dante Fontana is your name as a remixer and DJ, correct?

248
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,840
Yes, for EverythingisTerrible.com.

249
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,100
Right, right, right. Okay, yeah.

250
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,560
And you've put so much wonderful Disney madness out into the world.

251
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,960
Thanks, and there's so much out there that's not on YouTube.

252
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,020
Like, you guys have no idea.

253
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,700
Like, there's so many reasons why your YouTube channel can get shut down.

254
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,800
Especially if you're a person who likes to upload Disney clips.

255
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:50,900
So, the reason for the DVDs is to not have to worry about that.

256
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,420
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

257
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,820
You send people these DVDs in the mail.

258
00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:05,440
And they're sourced from mostly video cassettes that either I taped off television or a soccer mom on the internet that I traded with taped off television.

259
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:15,960
And, yeah, I amassed over 200 live Disney TV specials from the 70s, 80s, and 90s.

260
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,760
Oh my god.

261
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,660
To make these things.

262
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,720
There are, and there's so many more.

263
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:21,560
Jeez.

264
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:27,900
Truly insane. And you're getting VHSs that have commercial breaks and everything. You're getting it as it aired.

265
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,600
Oh yeah.

266
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,780
Oh, all kinds of Kissimmee Saint Cloud commercials, right?

267
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:33,620
For sure.

268
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,020
Yeah.

269
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:34,780
For real.

270
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,860
My childhood favorite. The target with arrows being shot at it.

271
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:47,060
Of like, here's Universal Studios, here's Disney World, and here's Kissimmee Saint Cloud.

272
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:47,340
Right?

273
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,620
Perfectly illustrated the proximity.

274
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,940
That's exactly why you need to get into the heart of the action down there in Kissimmee.

275
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,300
Yeah, okay. But so you're a big Disney archivist, a big Disney fan.

276
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:11,760
You also, if we could pimp you out for a specific tale, you're also a fan of something we haven't talked about a lot on the show, but the world of the Chuck E. Cheese animatronics slash the Rock-A-Fire explosion.

277
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,600
The showbiz pizza.

278
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,040
For sure.

279
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:13,560
Yes.

280
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:21,740
I think also something we talked about the first time that we spoke, and you've got kind of a history at this point with the Rock-A-Fire explosion.

281
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:32,220
Yeah, I grew up going to Chuck E. Cheese and I had no idea about the Rock-A-Fire explosion. I don't know if there was a showbiz pizza in Southern California or not.

282
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:32,680
Maybe not.

283
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:47,500
Because if you don't know the full story of it, yeah, Chuck E. Cheese, all the Chuck E. Cheese's were kind of, there was a merger of two franchises or it was, what's that creepy term? Like concept solidification?

284
00:19:49,140 --> 00:20:08,000
Yeah, it's something that still goes on today where they just do a cheap redressing. So the Chuck E. Cheese Munch's band was cheaply, quickly, and thoughtlessly redressed. I mean, sorry. The Rock-A-Fire explosion was quickly and cheaply redressed as Munch's band.

285
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,580
The current Chuck E. Cheese band.

286
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:10,920
Current?

287
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,680
Yeah, well, I guess the current band is becoming no band at all.

288
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,880
I hear that there's only like one left in the United, in Northern California.

289
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,920
Is that right? Have they all been?

290
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:28,580
Well, they all, the band's been gone for a while. If you ever stepped inside a Chuck E. Cheese, which I don't recommend, it's awful.

291
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,780
We are half a mile from one right now.

292
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,520
We should all go.

293
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:39,840
There's no doubt that all four of us have gone into Chuck E. Cheese alone without children. Am I correct? Can I assume this?

294
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,160
I don't know that I've been in alone.

295
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:53,160
I went the day after my senior prom with all my friends and dates and stuff because we were not getting a beach house or something afterwards.

296
00:20:53,660 --> 00:21:00,520
And it was for sure, like all the signs said, must be over 18 or have kids to get in. And we just walked right in. No one gave a shit.

297
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:08,940
We had money to spend. We were hanging out for a while. We didn't cause mischief. We were all good boys and girls.

298
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,660
Not as weird as a mid thirties gentleman.

299
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:20,680
I feel like for the last 10 years, it's just, they got rid of the band and it's just been one animatronic Chuck E. Cheese doing a radio show.

300
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:21,380
Yes.

301
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:27,480
Every kid's dream is to watch someone do a radio show.

302
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,520
The Eric Bogosian version of Chuck E. Cheese.

303
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:38,920
Let me get really confusing here. I know that the radio station version of Chuck E. Cheese's is called Studio C.

304
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,080
And we later, probably soon, we'll be talking about something called Studio K.

305
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:43,620
Yes please.

306
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:48,400
So let me just delineate. Let's get the studios straight in your head. C is the Chuck E. Cheese version.

307
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:56,740
But anyway, the original band, which is a lot more loved and fondly remembered, is the Rock-A-Fire Explosion, which was at Showbiz Pizza.

308
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,780
Not in California, mostly, where we both grew up.

309
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:08,660
But so you've gotten to interact with the actual Rock-A-Fire Explosion.

310
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:14,460
There's a movie, also I should just point out, there's a movie that talks about there's only a few of these robot shows left.

311
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,960
People have preserved them.

312
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,900
There's three full shows in this country.

313
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:20,420
Right.

314
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:26,280
And I was so moved by the documentary. I'd never heard of the Rock-A-Fire Explosion before.

315
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:36,240
But as a Disney nerd, as a theme park, animatronic, obsessed guy my whole life, it really spoke to me.

316
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,660
And I had to see the show.

317
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,600
It's very country bears-esque. In the look of it, at least.

318
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:50,400
That's when I saw the documentary the first time it struck me.

319
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,960
I did grow up with the country bear jamboree.

320
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,520
Or somebody at the park yesterday.

321
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:03,820
Actually, one of the country bear walk-around characters was at California Adventure in front of the Grizzly Bear Rapids.

322
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,080
And I heard a mom... shaking my head.

323
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,620
Excuse me.

324
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,820
I heard a mom tell her daughter,

325
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,160
Oh, look, it's one of the grizzly bears.

326
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,580
And I just sank my head in disgust.

327
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:27,880
I was like, yes, there is one of the grizzly bears from the attraction, the Grizzly Bear Jamboree.

328
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,140
Excuse me, I have to go in the men's room and throw up.

329
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,500
I'll be back.

330
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,140
It's like someone who needs to listen to this podcast and learn a thing or two.

331
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,480
Yeah. No, I grew up with the country bear jamboree.

332
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,860
And it's so much similar, which I believe is also three stages.

333
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,880
One main stage and then two side stages.

334
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,900
So I had a trip planned to New Orleans.

335
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:08,820
And I rented a car and basically skipped New Orleans and went on this trip to Mississippi.

336
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,020
To a rural, Sandy Hook, Mississippi, which is in the middle of nowhere.

337
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,840
And found one of the guys who was the subject of Damon Breland.

338
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,240
And he was, I reached out to him via email.

339
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:29,620
And he was very nice to let me drop by and watch about three hours worth of shows with him.

340
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:33,860
I offered him money because I don't want to waste this guy's time.

341
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,000
It probably cost, he probably spends a lot of money maintaining this.

342
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,800
And he has the full show.

343
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,000
He has the full show.

344
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,560
You know, some people have pieces of the show that they bought on eBay.

345
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,800
There's only three full shows that are running.

346
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:53,200
The guy in the documentary who drinks Mountain Dew.

347
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,760
That guy.

348
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,820
Who only drinks Mountain Dew.

349
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,000
Yeah, who has it in a shack in his backyard.

350
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,560
Oh, you did not meet that guy.

351
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,860
No, I did not meet that guy.

352
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,900
Yeah, I met the guy who has the tattoos on his arm.

353
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,820
Oh, right. Okay.

354
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,820
And then the third guy who has the show is Aaron Fechter.

355
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:17,060
Who I reached out to and almost went to on my most recent trip to Orlando three months ago.

356
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,540
He really, really wanted to host me.

357
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:26,820
But he unfortunately, he said he had a timeline.

358
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,680
He's like, email me in the morning and I'll see if I can squeeze you in.

359
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,800
And he couldn't.

360
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,440
So, yeah.

361
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,060
Is he hosting people constantly? Is that what he does?

362
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:42,480
Yeah, he has began opening tours to the public for the first time.

363
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,640
He is the creator.

364
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,720
He is the creator.

365
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,820
Yeah, yeah.

366
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,560
Of the Rock of Fire explosion.

367
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,760
Look up, if you're listening to this podcast, look up this documentary.

368
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,780
This documentary is phenomenal.

369
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:53,980
It's fascinating.

370
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,060
It's as good as King of Kong.

371
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,780
I associated it with the King of Kong.

372
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,620
It's not the same filmmaker, but it came out around the same time.

373
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,140
And both of those documentaries just like blew my mind.

374
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:05,880
So, yeah.

375
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:10,180
All he wanted in return, I offered him money.

376
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,380
And all he wanted in return was for me to bring him a pizza.

377
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,420
A cheese pizza.

378
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,760
That's all he wanted.

379
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,200
How amazing is that?

380
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,560
I think you were saying that the nearest pizza place was like 30 minutes plus or more.

381
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,520
An hour away.

382
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:27,880
An hour away.

383
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,540
Much to my surprise, I did not know that.

384
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,640
And I felt so bad.

385
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,360
I showed up like two hours late.

386
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,540
And people who know me know that I'm never late for anything.

387
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,380
I went on this wild goose chase.

388
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,720
What was the pizza place?

389
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,120
Do you remember?

390
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:41,980
Was it a local place?

391
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,080
Yeah, it was like a Domino's.

392
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
But the closest Domino's was an hour.

393
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,600
This was in the middle of nowhere.

394
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,240
And he had taken like a gas station and converted it into a showbiz.

395
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,220
I mean, it wasn't just the rocket fire explosion.

396
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,740
He had like original showbiz tables.

397
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,360
He had original showbiz like kiddie rides.

398
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,800
Like he had decked it out.

399
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,480
This guy, unlike us, has children.

400
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:15,360
But I have a feeling that it's like mostly for him.

401
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:21,080
He probably hosts one or two birthday parties a year.

402
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,500
He confides...

403
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,580
I don't want to make fun of the guy because he's just like us.

404
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,600
Very nice.

405
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,200
To make fun of him would be to make fun of me or any of you guys.

406
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,380
Look at him walking in the mirror.

407
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,360
He confided in me that he has on a couple of occasions slept on the stage.

408
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,000
Which I would do like that's when I got my Reebok.

409
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,480
The day I got my Reebok pumps, like when that just came out, I slept in them.

410
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,920
How is that any different?

411
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,080
That's really funny.

412
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,720
But the show is beautiful.

413
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:55,720
Seeing it for the...

414
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,840
I mean, seeing the documentary is one thing.

415
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,360
To see it in person was just...

416
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,320
I wept.

417
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,440
It was so...

418
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,140
Now I get it.

419
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,420
Now I get why people are so obsessed with it.

420
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,000
The music's good.

421
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,800
The jokes are funny.

422
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:14,700
It's so effective and it's so much better than Chuck E. Cheese.

423
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,840
And now I really understand.

424
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,260
The first show that he programmed...

425
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,600
And by the way, this is all...

426
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,180
Now I know it's all running off of Windows 95.

427
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:28,520
He took me into the back room and it's running off like an old PC.

428
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,600
With all the weird hydraulic pumps.

429
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,220
And these guys teach themselves how to...

430
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,700
This show takes maintenance.

431
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:40,420
So he's constantly having to fix the hydraulic pumps.

432
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,820
And hydraulic fluid.

433
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,620
You have to acquire industrial fluids.

434
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,520
And there's so many little details.

435
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,400
There's a frog on a lily pad on the stage.

436
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,560
And Nat pops its head up and down.

437
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,720
So if one thing's broken...

438
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,620
I saw him as we were watching the shows.

439
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:04,640
As the shows were running and they were singing and chatting.

440
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,380
He was going and making little adjustments.

441
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,260
Wow. Geez, really?

442
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,240
Is he one of the people who's...

443
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:18,760
Because there's been a few music videos where artists have worked with the owners of the Rockafire Explosion

444
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,160
to make them sing their songs.

445
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,260
Is he one of those that has customized it?

446
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,580
No, that's Aaron. That's Aaron Fechter.

447
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,260
That's the factory that once housed 200 employees.

448
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,600
It's now just him. He's the sole employee.

449
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,900
They talk about this in the documentary.

450
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:41,260
The only reason why he's still there is just these little freelance projects where people...

451
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,620
There's a big band that did it.

452
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,180
I can't remember if it was MGMT or something.

453
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,520
I feel like maybe Norrels Barkley has...

454
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,540
Yeah, there.

455
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,780
I'm probably mixing them up.

456
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,120
I believe the Rockafire Explosion makes a cameo in the Key and Peele movie.

457
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,880
Which I have not seen, but I hear that they...

458
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,580
Keanu?

459
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,340
Yeah, Keanu. They wake up and they're being held hostage in a room that has the Rockafire Explosion.

460
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,960
Whoa. So that would have been...

461
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,660
Not the one you went to, but made by the owner in Ortega.

462
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,140
Yeah, I think he's the one who actually represents...

463
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:16,520
When the characters do cameos.

464
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,740
They do publicity. He's their manager now.

465
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:26,980
It's worth mentioning that Rockafire Explosion was the inspiration for the horror video game.

466
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,700
Five Nights at Freddy's, right?

467
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,800
Five Nights at Freddy's.

468
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,760
More so than Chuck E. Cheese.

469
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,600
Are you so into it that you know the names of the characters?

470
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,660
I do now.

471
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,900
This is a thing I should know.

472
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,580
Because I know Chuck E. Cheese characters.

473
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,960
Can you list just for my enjoyment?

474
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:56,240
Fats Domino is the terrifying gorilla that is at the front and center playing the keyboard.

475
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:02,980
Clearly, when you see the purple monster munch in Chuck E. Cheese, he's clearly a remoded version of Fats Domino.

476
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:08,980
Crudely remodeled, much like Tower of Terror is crudely remodeled to be Guardians of the Galaxy.

477
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,500
Oh, sure. Indeed.

478
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,280
Shots fired.

479
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:19,040
Sorry. I've been wanting to get that out for a week since on record.

480
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:25,300
If it's not clear 30 minutes in, all our guests on past shows have been wonderful.

481
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,820
Doug is definitely the one who has the same disease we do.

482
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,820
Aren't these the same strain of it?

483
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,820
Yeah, slight variances, but ultimately the same overall virus.

484
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,360
So Fats Domino is one.

485
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,260
Yeah, back to the robots.

486
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,520
Sorry, Mike.

487
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:46,040
Beach Bear is on the stage right.

488
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,820
And he's got a bird that he holds.

489
00:31:53,320 --> 00:32:04,320
And what I did not know until I actually saw the show in person is that the bird, his pet bird, also sings and interacts and talks.

490
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,940
So it's like a bonus character that I did not know about.

491
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,600
So it requires his own separate maintenance.

492
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:21,900
Yeah. And the first show we watched, which, gosh, I can't remember. I believe the word magic was in the title of every song.

493
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:32,860
It was like the songs were so well themed. There was a Beatles, an all Beatles set. The shows are 15 minutes long.

494
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:39,620
So there's an all Beatles show. The first show we watched was all songs with the word magic in the title.

495
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,440
Wow. Pilot's magic, ELO's strange magic.

496
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:51,440
Yeah. And the bird that Beach Bear holds took the lead verse on the first song. And I was like, what?

497
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:52,960
You sing?

498
00:32:52,960 --> 00:33:01,860
I was like, no way. I was like, that bird sings? And then Damon looked at me and he's like, yeah, the bird sings.

499
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:10,520
I thought you knew that. I thought you were one of me. He didn't realize that I'd never seen the show before.

500
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,580
Like, is the sky blue?

501
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,580
Reaching under the counter for a real shotgun.

502
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:21,700
There's Rolf de Wolf.

503
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:22,900
Rolf de Wolf?

504
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,440
Rolf de Wolf. Yeah. Earl Schmurl.

505
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:34,780
There's Loony Bird, who I was just speaking of.

506
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,640
That's the little bird.

507
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,560
The little bird. Yeah.

508
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:36,980
Good singer.

509
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,600
Duke LaRue, who's the drummer.

510
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,020
I know Duke. Yes, I knew that one. I knew Duke.

511
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:50,760
Mitzi Mozzarella is the female cheerleader character who became redressed as...

512
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,460
The bird?

513
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,500
As Helen? Or as Pasquale? Or no?

514
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:56,980
As the other one?

515
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,440
The female character.

516
00:33:59,320 --> 00:33:59,960
Helen. Yeah.

517
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:00,940
Helen is the bird.

518
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:06,820
Helen is the weirdest, most common name. Everyone else has a fun name and then it's just Helen.

519
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,160
Very plain.

520
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,740
Jasper T. Jowls, Pasquale, and Helen.

521
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:18,220
Boy, we are certainly... there's a little preview of the ultimate, the seven hour Chuck E. Cheese.

522
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:23,200
R. Lawrence of Arabia will be about the Rock of Fire Explosion and the Munch's Miggly Band.

523
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,960
Well, hey, look, you know what? We're talking tunes. We're talking music.

524
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:41,900
We're talking great music, very retro music and boy, if you want to hear some great stuff, you'd probably want to time travel back to Vidiopolis at Disneyland.

525
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:50,720
It opened in 1985 and finally a place where teens can hang out and get rad at Disneyland.

526
00:34:51,720 --> 00:35:01,220
Doug, in many cases we are pulling our... we conversationally present information that is ripped out of articles that we quickly read before recording the podcast.

527
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,820
In this case, you literally did write the article about Vidiopolis for dangerous minds.

528
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:15,680
Yes, and I have to... just like Rock of Fire Explosion, this is not something I grew up with. This is something that I happened upon a year or two ago.

529
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:25,760
I had found... I guess it first came under my radar when I found a Disneyland special called Disneyland Summer Vacation Party from 1986.

530
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:37,900
A two hour special hosted by Mindy Cohen from Facts of Life, Kim Fields, also from Facts of Life, Scott Valentine, who you guys might know from the Splash Mountain rap.

531
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:44,600
Oh, hey, is this a zip? I performed the rap on an episode that's coming at some point.

532
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,900
Really? I sure did. I look forward to that. It was a blast.

533
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:52,040
He was also Nick Moore, Justin Bateman's boyfriend from Family Ties.

534
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,160
Wow.

535
00:35:53,380 --> 00:36:02,480
And Malcolm Jamal Warner. So they're at Vidiopolis and they split up like Mindy Cohen and Kim Fields go off looking for cute guys.

536
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:08,140
And then Scott Valentine and Malcolm Jamal Warner go out looking for girls to talk to.

537
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:14,340
And then meanwhile, while we go looking for girls, here's a live performance from Culture Club.

538
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,760
Or Miami Sound Machine.

539
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:23,720
This is the special that was used for one of the Everything is Terrible videos, right?

540
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,780
Yes. Yes. Yes.

541
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,120
So I cut. There's there's there's it's a it's a super serious dance party.

542
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:39,260
It's it's it's it's 1986 and and it's it's it's in the characters are out dancing with the yeah with the club goers.

543
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:48,460
And and so I cut out I took the two hour special and just only edited together the characters dancing with the guests.

544
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,960
And it's like stars are from the original special like you know, I added this.

545
00:36:52,960 --> 00:37:21,260
I added the special effects. I love the stars. So it's like it turns out to be a 15 minutes of nothing but characters characters like like like the queen of hearts dancing with a bunch of guys are like there's there's a there's a scene where a Miami Sand Machine is playing the song Bad Boys and like the big bad wolf gets like pushed in the middle of circle and starts breaking saying it's just like if you're ever sad or you want to cheer up, just just watch this video.

546
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:32,440
It's truly something I took some screengrads from it because I watched it. It was fascinating. The two of the country bears are dancing at one point and then both Brea Rabbit or Bear Fox and Bear Bear.

547
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:37,540
And there is a long. Yeah. Yeah. Bear Fox really shaking his bottom.

548
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:49,900
This is what I call serious sweaty dancing, which is something that I miss. You don't see as much in that if you go to a Hollywood nightclub, you're not your chances are you're probably not going to see dancing like this anymore.

549
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:57,060
It's going to be more like, you know, casual casual type of music.

550
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:07,700
Sure. You're not seeing like serious pop lockers. No, you're looking for skill and timing. A lost art. Unfortunately.

551
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:21,560
Yeah. So I was showing this montage at the Ace Hotel where I do a monthly projecting and DJing and my friend Daniel Paul, who's a Los Angeles architectural historian.

552
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:31,060
Oh, boy. I have to talk to this gentleman. Oh, my God. He's he's he's I've met him recently and he's one of the most fascinating people I've ever met in my life.

553
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:44,480
Wow. He just his knowledge is incredible. So he looked at it. He's like, oh, wow, video op. And I said, what? And he said, oh, the dance club at Disneyland in the 80s. I used to go when I was in high school.

554
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:56,740
And that's I my jaw dropped and I was like, well, but God, the way that and this I kind of there wasn't that much. There's not enough information on the Internet.

555
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:03,300
So I just started and that's how me writing the article came about. No kidding. I have to tell that there's a story here. I have to tell it.

556
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:18,180
Now, if you if your appetite is not already wet by the general notion of the 80s teen dance club in Disneyland, just I think it's I think it's crucial to set the tone that we hear a little bit of the videopolis theme song.

557
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:24,440
This to me, if you're not in already, this song, I think tells you everything is really something you need to know. And here we go.

558
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,500
Oh, right.

559
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,080
This show.

560
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,340
To the music so high.

561
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,980
Going to the top.

562
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,220
The.

563
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,780
The.

564
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,280
The.

565
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:15,600
Oh, boy. So I got to say, I'm sure there's more iconic 80s songs, but this song, which has been stuck in my head for days since like starting to research this episode, is like the perfect Disney distillation of 1980s pop music.

566
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:21,500
Yeah, I know that this isn't true, but it seems like that song influenced everything Scott Gairdner has made in entertainment.

567
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,800
Scott, all of this is so much in your wheelhouse.

568
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:30,660
You know, I didn't know I didn't know videopolis like you. I was a late comer, but I remember it existing.

569
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:37,180
I remember probably the first time I went to Disneyland in 1988. I probably passed by the dance party in progress.

570
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:43,160
But I'm three, so I can't go in there. But I know that we talked with Anthony Geo about baby brain.

571
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:53,080
I know my baby brain locked into like the distant neon so hard and the logo just like if you're listening to this, please pull up some logos.

572
00:40:53,160 --> 00:41:04,480
Right now, I'm looking at the 45 of that song, which is like, you know, that that sort of 80s squiggle writing with a big like slash under it and a big purple triangle.

573
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:14,780
And if you are familiar with Moonbeam City, the show that I did, like for sure that is me just like, well, I got to clear out the attic of the old baby brain stuff.

574
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:26,820
Yeah, I like I know that videopolis had a lot to do with my like locking into neon and triangles and and, you know, Janet Jackson music.

575
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:34,200
Here's the thing I like about that song is that it's very much the perfect kind of pop music single nonsense.

576
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:40,480
Like the words kind of mean nothing like they may as well be singing to do Ron Ron.

577
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,900
Yeah. Go into the top video.

578
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,520
Go into the top video. I've just been singing to myself for days.

579
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,960
You're gonna see what I mean.

580
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,080
In that scene.

581
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,260
Ellie Greenwich, Phil Spector, Brill Building, Fashion.

582
00:41:54,580 --> 00:42:01,780
There's a lot of American bandstand comparisons to videopolis because there was a TV show broadcast from there.

583
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,460
As well. Yes. Yeah. But I also want to say about the song.

584
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:10,900
I'm a I'm a big liner notes junkie. I want to know every musician who played on everything wrote wrote everything.

585
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:21,640
And I was this like this song is on discogs.com which kind of compiles liner notes and all you get on it is unknown generic male singer.

586
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:26,880
There is no one bothered to write down who sang the videopolis song which is so disappointing.

587
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:32,840
If anyone out there knows for some reason anybody like it's your dad or something, please let us know.

588
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,540
Let's give him a credit.

589
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,200
It was probably the guy who wrote it.

590
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,620
And it sounds like he like this is a demo. This is the song that I wrote.

591
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,020
And you could when you find a big name singer to sing it. Let me know.

592
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,380
I can't wait to send you the track like no, we'll just use what you sent us.

593
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,320
This is fine. We don't want to we don't want to pay Bolton or whatever to do it.

594
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,600
We don't know the writer either. No, none of it's none of it.

595
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,100
None of it. Thank you for gifting that song to us.

596
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,980
That song I think really sets the tone and set the tone for my life.

597
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:15,860
The thing that I didn't know until recently, there is a wonderful video on YouTube that shows you 50 minutes of what it was like to be at videopolis.

598
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,860
Somebody just like showing one of their nights out with their friends.

599
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:26,800
A raw unedited like one hour home video of videopolis from from like start to finish.

600
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:36,740
It's just wonderful. You couldn't fake if you like set out with the art decorators to like create a perfect sort of snippet of 80s culture.

601
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:43,280
It's so so perfect. But I didn't know that they they played the song at the beginning of every night, apparently.

602
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:49,680
Yes. That's when you knew Videopolis was up and running and was when they played the themes. It's a club with a theme song. It's wonderful.

603
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,780
If they were to have like if you were to look at all the people wearing the 80s clothes and the music and everything going on in the hairstyle.

604
00:43:55,780 --> 00:44:02,340
If they were to show like the art director of the Goldbergs, they would be like, this is too much. This looks too much.

605
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,620
This is too fake 80s. This isn't really how the 80s were. But like it's there. It's just this is a this isn't even a promotional video on YouTube.

606
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:16,540
It's just like someone's home movie. Yeah, it was crazy. It's the it's unbelievable how much everyone was the 80s.

607
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,160
The dance floor accommodated accommodated 3000 guests.

608
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:28,600
That's wild. Yeah, that we should say this is where the place now if you're if you've been to Disneyland, it's where they do the show Mickey and the Magical Map.

609
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:35,380
That's right. Which is a family friendly little show. Fantasyland Theater. Right. Which was it was strategically placed.

610
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:41,180
They want to put it at a place that was like a way that it wouldn't interfere with the families. It was in the corner of the park.

611
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:49,260
This is before Toontown. So there's no real reason to be all the way up in that corner, which is probably why I miss it because I was going to the park during this time.

612
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:57,220
I would have been between the ages of like six and eleven, I think. But but it was kept separate for for for a reason.

613
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:08,200
It was it was the back room of Disneyland. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the the fantasy the Fantasyland train station for four years became the Videopolis train station.

614
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:13,120
So the party could actually start, I guess, when you enter the park and get on the train. Yeah.

615
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:26,220
I have a picture here and it is very like cool looking. Oh, yeah. They full on changed the like station and it looks very I don't know what the style, but it is crazy to change the train station.

616
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:36,060
I can't even I'm not sure I can like look at all of these this imagery and function. I'm like I might go into an epileptic fit the more of these things we see.

617
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:41,100
A little bottle of smelling salts and a a mint jewel up close by.

618
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:47,820
Should he get the vapors? Much like an eye on me, guys. Much like when we talk about couches with Jason's.

619
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:53,880
When we talk about neon and 80s stuff with Scott. Yeah. They're both prone to too much excitement.

620
00:45:55,140 --> 00:46:01,060
And for Mike, it's a Chicago style Italian beef sandwich. I got to have my beef.

621
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:08,980
You got it. I should also say, if you're listening to this and have never been to Disneyland, but something your head goes like this sounds familiar.

622
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:16,540
I have been to Disney World a lot. Videopolis East was an opening day club at Pleasure Island.

623
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:22,880
No kidding. Even less documentation on that. You can find virtually nothing on that.

624
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:31,360
Pretty much. No, I mentioned in the past our the much liked among us Funkland series.

625
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:40,820
I was watching their two parts on Pleasure Island and they mentioned it opened as the Disneyland was closing.

626
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:47,920
Yeah. In 1989. It should be mentioned that both of these were Michael Eisner projects.

627
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,620
Old Mikey Eisner.

628
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:55,780
The Videopolis at Disneyland was the very first attraction to be completed under Michael Eisner.

629
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:59,720
Wow. His first order of business was TTT.

630
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,480
The thing he rushed out like Trump's immigration ban.

631
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:12,340
Eisner ordered a cool teen dance club and he needed it done in his first. Well, not his first hundred day, but like a presidential order.

632
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:17,880
It was done in 100 days. They rushed this thing out. They call it the 100 day miracle.

633
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,400
How much did it cost? Like 3 million?

634
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,340
3 million dollars.

635
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:31,880
A lot of it repurposed media equipment, projectors and screens and stuff from the 84 Los Angeles Olympics that they got on cheap like at surplus prices.

636
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:41,300
I've also seen it reported, although this might be a Wikipedia fact that is wrong, but I've also seen it reported that some of it came from the US festival.

637
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:51,560
Steve Wozniak's San Bernardino concerts in the early 80s, which I recommend any videos of those legit amazing incredible bands, incredible performances.

638
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:59,600
I think after the current Olympics, maybe we should look around and see if we can get our own Videopolis going. Get some cheap discounted TVs.

639
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:00,940
You mean from Seoul?

640
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,500
Yeah, yeah. We'll go to Seoul.

641
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,640
Oh, okay.

642
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,420
Yeah, we'll go to Seoul and buy all the leftover TVs.

643
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,080
Hey, you want to go to Tokyo soon?

644
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:09,940
Yeah, stop over in Seoul.

645
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:10,660
Stop by Seoul.

646
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:18,420
I think I don't have any concerns about stealing things from Korea. I think that's a totally fine thing to do.

647
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,400
When they find out what we're doing with it, they'll be happy.

648
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:28,800
I think it's time to start talking about Michael Eisner's cool complex. He, I think, was very concerned with getting cool stuff into the parks.

649
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:36,240
He was influenced by his son Breck, who thought Disneyland was lame, and he wanted to jam some cool stuff in there.

650
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:37,900
And let me say...

651
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:38,980
Jam cool stuff he did.

652
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:48,440
He really did. Well, and think about this. What a recipe for disaster it is to try to get rock music and MTV culture into your theme park.

653
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:55,820
You know, think about any time today, there's a corporate impression of what the teen's like. It's usually a disaster.

654
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:57,920
But if you think about it, look at this list.

655
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:01,340
Alien Encounter, which we all agree we really like. Splash Mountain.

656
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:02,640
Yacht and Beach Club Resort.

657
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:07,720
The Beach Club, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, The Swan and The Dolphin. Nothing cooler than those places.

658
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:14,040
No, but I, there's, as you look into Vidiopolis, I think Vidiopolis was legit.

659
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:21,220
I don't think it was even, like, a lame corporate impression of a teen dance club. I think it was pretty cool.

660
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:24,280
They did not mess around. They had lasers shooting everywhere.

661
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:36,580
Video crews taping people dancing and projecting them on screen. So you would be, there would be music videos playing on, you know, hundreds and hundreds of TV screens.

662
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:47,080
And then you yourself would be projected on the biggest screen of all with, like, 80s effects, like, superimposed over you while you're dancing.

663
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,620
Man, you're the star.

664
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:58,740
That long video, that's the home movie, basically, like, it shows how it starts. So, like, there's an appearance on the video screen by K-Rock DJ Swedish Eagle.

665
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:59,720
That's right, yeah.

666
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,000
Which, that was news to me as far as that gentleman. I didn't, I was not.

667
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,480
He's still, he's on XM Radio channel 33, first wave.

668
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:06,920
Yeah.

669
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:07,540
That's great.

670
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:07,880
Yeah.

671
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:14,720
And he announces a bunch of 80s specific prizes, like Tower Record gift certificate and tickets to Oingo Boingo.

672
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,200
And a GM car.

673
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:20,020
A limousine that will take you to the concert.

674
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,240
That you're, yeah, you get prizes at this place.

675
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,560
I mean, no one gets prizes at Disneyland.

676
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,020
No, not since the 35th anniversary in the prize machine.

677
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,840
Oh, let's not forget the year of a million dreams.

678
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:32,660
Okay, okay.

679
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,680
Let's not forget the gift giver 5,000.

680
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:36,640
Oh, that's what I'm thinking.

681
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:41,980
Every park wins, excuse me, every guest wins a prize upon entering the park.

682
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,200
Wow.

683
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:51,320
I did, I should retract my statement because in 2014, Lindsay and I went and went to this special 59th anniversary celebration.

684
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,540
We got a bunch of prizes.

685
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:59,260
We got a paperweight, a little diamond paperweight, and we got fast passes to every ride.

686
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:00,160
Wow.

687
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:00,640
That's insane.

688
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,760
I got free mouse ears once during the year of a million dreams.

689
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,880
Like, I have year of a million dreams mouse ears.

690
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:06,760
Alright, so I take it back.

691
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:08,160
Disney gives free stuff all the time.

692
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:09,980
Not in a while, though.

693
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,700
Maybe more to APs, annual pass holders.

694
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:21,800
And I went, Mike, when we went to watch the Oscars at the venue where the great moments with Mr. Lincoln show happens.

695
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,320
They show, they put the Oscars on in the Lincoln Theater.

696
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,420
The Jimmy Kimmel hosted Oscars last year.

697
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:28,900
I don't know.

698
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,600
This might have been new, I don't know.

699
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:34,260
But we watched Justin Timberlake's opening and Jimmy Kimmel's monologue.

700
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:34,960
You should go to that.

701
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,400
And I won the raffle.

702
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:41,160
My seat was called after lots of empty seats were called because there were lots of empty seats.

703
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:41,800
What did you win?

704
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,160
I won the Guardians 2 mixtape.

705
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,880
No, you won the Guardians TV show soundtrack.

706
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,680
The cartoon soundtrack.

707
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,720
Wow, that's a very specific prize.

708
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,240
I felt bad because I, you know.

709
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:57,340
People were excited.

710
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:03,000
People were very jealous and shot me dirty looks, I think.

711
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:06,200
There was some tension with the weirdos watching the Oscars.

712
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:11,300
Speaking of soundtracks, Doug, I want to, from your Dangerous Minds article.

713
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:12,960
This was a highlight for me.

714
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:20,920
Every night, Videopolis would play two tribes by Frankie Goes to Hollywood during the fireworks show.

715
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:24,120
Which took place right above the dance floor.

716
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,200
Which, that is great.

717
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,260
That's awesome, isn't it?

718
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:27,940
It's awesome.

719
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,780
That's such an 80s sentence.

720
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,600
Spectacular view of the fire.

721
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,820
Because there was so little information on the internet when I was writing this article,

722
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:40,400
I believe I picked up that tidbit from a YouTube comment.

723
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,400
Which I don't want to give away all my secrets, but YouTube.

724
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,420
You guys troll message boards.

725
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:47,260
I troll YouTube comments.

726
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:54,340
Because if you keep scrolling, you'll find some really, really helpful little tidbits like that.

727
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:57,580
My trend of being the slang boy.

728
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,760
We lurk at these. We don't troll them.

729
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,740
We're not going like, you idiot.

730
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:06,300
We're quietly lurking and observing.

731
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,280
Firing shots is trolling.

732
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,280
My deepest apologies.

733
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,420
I found a blog where somebody was describing that,

734
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,840
okay, well first of all, because Videopolis is at the top end of the park,

735
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,500
which is where the fireworks still are shot off from.

736
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,940
So you're essentially right under the fireworks as they're going off.

737
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:28,480
And I saw a blog that described it as sort of a little scary in a way.

738
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,380
That everything's trembling around you and ashes are falling on you.

739
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,300
It was very intense to be right.

740
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,280
They closed Toontown because they don't want people to be right under the fireworks.

741
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,560
But back in Videopolis days, kids are breathing ash.

742
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:46,720
I've still gotten some ash at certain parks if I'm too close to the fireworks.

743
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,940
Going to a kid at Disneyland in the 80s,

744
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,260
I don't remember them shutting off all of Fantasyland while the fire...

745
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,720
I feel like that's a newer thing.

746
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:59,740
Because now you can't even walk through certain areas of the park

747
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:00,840
while the fireworks are going on.

748
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:05,400
If you're not interested in seeing the fireworks, it's such a nuisance.

749
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,100
It's like you get trapped and you can't go anywhere.

750
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:11,400
Oh yeah, they got to split parts of Main Street up and whatever.

751
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:13,560
Yeah, it does get a little annoying around that time.

752
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:18,620
I guess also in the super legal world that we're in now,

753
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,500
probably they have to block off areas.

754
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,160
But not then. Kids are high on firework fumes.

755
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,940
Also, here's the other thing I want to say.

756
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,940
Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Two Tribes.

757
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:31,320
I've never heard of that song. I didn't know that song.

758
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:32,180
Really?

759
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,140
I didn't actually. Do you guys?

760
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,400
I was going to say, a lot of this music...

761
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,120
I was born in 1985, so shortly after Videopolis.

762
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:45,440
So a lot of this music, my context for it,

763
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,860
and I do like a lot of the New Wave 80 stuff,

764
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:54,580
was either commercials for compilations on TV in high school.

765
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:59,000
And then a big thing, and I'm sure a lot of our millennial listeners will agree,

766
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,500
the Grand Theft Auto Vice City soundtrack.

767
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:05,160
The multi-disc soundtrack of 80s...

768
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,600
That's how I learned about 80s pop music.

769
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,160
Just playing back 80s for hours.

770
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,080
Yeah, and Two Tribes is in there.

771
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:13,520
Oh, gotcha.

772
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:21,800
What I think is cool is that you might expect the Disney opening in 80s nightclub

773
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:26,360
that you'd get the biggest top 40 kind of songs,

774
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,240
but they played deep cuts from what I could tell.

775
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:32,480
They played really cool, legit...

776
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,920
Yeah, it was not all hits.

777
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,660
I feel like if today they said,

778
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:37,180
we're doing 80s night at Disneyland,

779
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,320
you would hear Girls Just Want to Have Fun,

780
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,220
you'd hear Relax, you'd hear The Top Top Sub.

781
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:44,360
But this place had taste, I think.

782
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,160
It's interesting because they've done...

783
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,880
And this is another episode,

784
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:52,400
but they did a show called The Mad Tea Party at Disney's California Adventure.

785
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,520
I was hoping we could get into that.

786
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,380
You knew we would get there.

787
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:57,120
Once we're done talking about Videopolis.

788
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,060
Because I'm sure we all have...

789
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,960
This is something that we've all been to,

790
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:02,840
and probably have a lot to say about.

791
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,520
I certainly do.

792
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,920
Right before The Mad Tea Party, actually,

793
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,720
they had a different show that was called Glow, I believe.

794
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,800
Let's start, if you want to...

795
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,200
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

796
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,560
I have the chronological order.

797
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:15,120
You do the chronological, yeah.

798
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,320
It started... This all came about...

799
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:22,140
It's similar to the Disneyland story in 1985,

800
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,640
where Eisner's like, we need to get...

801
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:28,020
In the late 2000s, they realized that California Adventure was like a bust.

802
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,160
No one likes this park.

803
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,000
We need to do something drastic.

804
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:34,680
And some genius realized,

805
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,020
oh yeah, we sell alcohol, let's do something there.

806
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:45,300
And Glowfest was the first experiment in doing something like this.

807
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,500
This was in 2010.

808
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:52,480
And this Glowfest coincided with the debut of World of Color.

809
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,500
Well, wait, wasn't it Tron Legacy themed?

810
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:56,440
That came later.

811
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:57,000
That came later.

812
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:58,920
Excuse me, that was 2011.

813
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,100
No, that came out by the end of the year,

814
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,420
because Glowfest was... People didn't like it.

815
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,040
They hired a third party to make it,

816
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,660
and people were like, this isn't very Disney.

817
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,200
This is too adult-oriented.

818
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,740
It was not successful.

819
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:15,940
By the end of the year, Electronica was up and running,

820
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,900
which was the word Tron, all caps,

821
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,220
to promote the movie Tron Legacy.

822
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,920
Which I thought looked cool.

823
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:25,200
I remember being at the park.

824
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:26,020
It was awesome.

825
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:30,980
There was a lot of Clockwork Orange-style furniture outside everywhere.

826
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:36,020
A lot of that blue...

827
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:40,200
The whole Hollywoodland section of the park was projection mapping

828
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,240
to make it look like the Tron grid.

829
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,880
They had Tron characters throwing Frisbees at you.

830
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,760
They had a stage show called Laser Man.

831
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:51,460
There was an arcade.

832
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:54,160
There was a replica of Flynn's arcade.

833
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:58,880
They even recreated the facade of the building perfectly

834
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,120
with the neon sign that said Flynn's.

835
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:01,800
It looked really good.

836
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:06,460
The Tron game right in the back with a glow on it calling out to you

837
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:08,160
as in the first film.

838
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:11,900
It was the perfect time for people like us to have an annual pass

839
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,340
because I went to that thing every other weekend.

840
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:15,380
It was so cool.

841
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:18,140
It was not overwhelmingly crowded usually,

842
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,540
like for a tea party.

843
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:23,620
It was a pretty low-key, underappreciated thing

844
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:28,660
because such a big change to California Adventure came right after it.

845
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,460
I did think Electronica was a pretty neat idea.

846
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:32,060
It was.

847
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:34,320
Every time I'd go to Electronica,

848
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:38,960
it was when the whole first section of the park was completely under construction.

849
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:43,480
So you were walking down a tunnel of construction to get to Electronica.

850
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:46,760
And there was alcohol was flowing.

851
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,080
They had the glow-hito.

852
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,720
Oh, I remember the glow-hito.

853
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,060
They had the digittini.

854
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:57,020
For those who didn't drink alcohol, they had the laser light lemonade.

855
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:04,200
And then the Muppet Vision 3D Theater was showing a sneak preview of Tron Legacy.

856
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,400
With lasers in the theater and the glow of the ships or whatever

857
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,160
would be reflected with lights and there'd be smoke machines.

858
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:14,820
It was like a 4DX experience of Tron Legacy,

859
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,200
which made you think Tron Legacy would be great.

860
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,960
And it looked great.

861
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,860
Everything was so well done from top to bottom.

862
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,640
And then you wonder how you have all these kids and young adults

863
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:28,680
and teenagers and there's alcohol.

864
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,580
How are you going to monitor this?

865
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:33,000
And they had so much security.

866
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,300
To drink you had to have a wristband.

867
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:40,780
And if one of your friends took a sip from your drink,

868
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:44,920
they would just swoop in like a hawk.

869
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:50,740
And it was very, very well monitored to make sure that you didn't have any underage drinking.

870
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:54,360
And I loved it. I miss it.

871
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:58,240
It was cool. I remember it and it was cool.

872
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:00,580
But then the next thing is the Mad Tea Party, right?

873
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:06,820
And the Mad Tea Party, I will say I do love it in a very similar Jimmy Buffett style way.

874
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:07,740
I'd always want to go there.

875
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:11,460
But it is what you think of Disney doing something, trying to do something cool.

876
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:14,560
It is a Disney attempt at being cool and hip.

877
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:17,700
And of course it's kind of lame. It's pretty lame.

878
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:19,440
I remember.

879
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,440
That is what you think Disney when they think cool.

880
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:24,340
Mike and I were at the Mad Tea Party once we both went to the Tea Party.

881
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,000
We went there many times.

882
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,360
We went there many times because any time we were there, Mike's like,

883
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:29,200
well, we got to swing by the Mad Tea Party.

884
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:31,200
I would say we got to get mad.

885
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,480
We got to get mad.

886
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:35,560
And he would say it like you were running an errand.

887
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:38,420
It's like, oh, I got to stop by Target. Oh, we should swing by Lowe's.

888
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,460
He'd go like, yeah, well, we got to stop by the Mad Tea Party.

889
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,880
And I remember the one time it was a Friday night we went down.

890
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:48,520
It's like, oh, yeah, let's get some Mad Hitos or whatever the drinks were.

891
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,360
That's correct. I have that here in my notes.

892
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:54,700
And we mostly did get the cool glowing ice cubes,

893
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:59,340
which I'm still finding plastic glowing ice cubes among my junk drawer stuff.

894
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:04,080
And I just remember I could see in through the back of the stand.

895
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,380
And I'm like, they're pouring these out of like milk jugs,

896
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:12,220
like a gallon of, if you imagine a plastic gallon of milk.

897
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:16,740
They had premixed mojitos in those that they were just pouring over ice.

898
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:17,280
Mad Hitos.

899
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,160
Mad Hitos.

900
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:23,740
The other drinks were croquette tinis and a mad Long Island ice tea.

901
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,200
Those croquette tinis would have a delicious chicken croquette floating right in the hole.

902
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:30,280
I think there was probably croquet tinis.

903
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,240
Good point.

904
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:35,960
The Queen. The Evil Queen.

905
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,080
I see. There was not a pronunciation guide.

906
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:41,860
People love the Mad Tea Party.

907
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:48,020
I remember getting my hair cut in at a, what is it called?

908
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:50,520
What's the Rock and Roll Barbershop chain?

909
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:51,960
Floyd's?

910
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:52,600
Floyd's. Yeah.

911
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:54,180
Oh, so Rock and Roll.

912
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:57,000
That's the coolest barbershop in town.

913
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,360
I had a hairdresser there once and she had a tiny Mad Hatter hat on.

914
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,860
And I asked, oh, is that from Disneyland?

915
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,540
Have you been to the Mad Tea Party?

916
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:10,480
And she went, I bought an annual pass to go to the Mad Tea Party.

917
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:11,840
I go every weekend.

918
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,260
Whoa.

919
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:19,520
That's how seriously the Mad Hatter hat became the new Cat in the Hat.

920
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:24,860
People were wearing them to nightclubs outside of Disneyland.

921
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:29,640
It was a rare case of Disneyland fashion sticking outside.

922
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:30,200
Oh my goodness.

923
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,600
And became too popular for its own good.

924
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:36,760
They eventually had to shut it down because it became too rowdy.

925
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:37,660
Really?

926
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,800
Much like Videopolis.

927
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,840
An oddly similar arc.

928
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:50,300
So you guys might not, the final piece of information to that story is 2015.

929
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,940
As you may or may not remember,

930
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:56,920
Mad Tea Party closed and became, very briefly and very unsuccessfully,

931
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:02,780
Freeze the Night, a family dance party inspired by the Disney animated film Frozen.

932
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:04,320
Freeze the Night.

933
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,500
I don't remember that.

934
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:06,220
I remember that.

935
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:07,860
It was a big letdown.

936
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:13,220
Now they kind of play music over there in that section, but it's not the same.

937
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,160
It's not fun.

938
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:17,140
Why do you want to freeze the night?

939
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:19,760
That's not an exciting, that's not a mission statement.

940
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:20,820
Like going to the top.

941
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,060
Have you seen kids dance?

942
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,700
They don't really know what they're doing.

943
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,600
It's embarrassing.

944
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:31,240
For a five year old, the definition of dancing is usually just jumping up and down.

945
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:32,520
Come on.

946
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:34,640
Doing something you wouldn't usually do.

947
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:35,020
Right.

948
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,060
The only way you can screw up is by just walking casually.

949
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:39,320
Right. What a joke.

950
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:43,220
Don't even try kids.

951
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:48,620
When they announced that summer, so Disneyland last year had a promotion called the Summer of Heroes

952
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:51,360
to introduce the Guardians of the Galaxy.

953
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,300
And they were like in a Guardians dance party.

954
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:57,380
And I got kind of excited because whether you think the movies are good or bad or whatever,

955
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,040
the music is pretty good in it.

956
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:01,780
So you could get some fun songs.

957
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:05,340
And I was like, oh, they're going to put a cool 70s, 80s dance party over there.

958
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:06,360
It's not what happened.

959
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:11,660
They just put some like 22 year old dressed as a Chris Pratt character with a boombox

960
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:14,340
and they play like 30 seconds of ELO.

961
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:15,960
And I was like, what? That's a waste.

962
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,880
Put it over by the spot where you used to do cool parties.

963
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:23,420
I'm hoping that because they did after freeze the night was a disaster.

964
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:27,480
They brought Mad Tea Party back for like one hot minute before it went away.

965
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:32,620
I'm hoping that there's a sequel to Tron Legacy that they bring back Electronica.

966
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:34,960
That's my hope. That's my hope in my dreams.

967
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,600
Here's some blue sky for you.

968
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:41,600
If they do turn that corner of the park into some Marvel stuff as speculated

969
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,260
and they get the X-Men back.

970
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:45,020
Oh, Dazzler dance party.

971
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:49,260
Dazzler themed dance party is would be something.

972
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,880
Dazzler's Videopolis.

973
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:53,440
Sure, you can combine.

974
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:57,520
Dazzler wore roller skates and she was like a singer and like a disco singer.

975
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:00,840
She was a pop singer who was a mutant who had like light powers.

976
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:05,160
I think that's only going to happen if we get the Dazzler trilogy of films.

977
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,480
So if that happens then.

978
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,680
But we have yet to see Dazzler in the movies.

979
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,340
Man, I like, I don't know.

980
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,360
These are all movies I don't see or like.

981
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:16,040
But I want them all to happen just so I can get some cool like.

982
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:16,340
Yeah.

983
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:20,020
These Tron, like we're talking about a Tron with Jared Leto.

984
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:21,040
That sounds like.

985
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,440
That sounds apocalyptically bad.

986
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,280
A movie grown in a lab.

987
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,800
Like a movie Tron.

988
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,920
To make Scott Gerner the angriest.

989
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:36,200
But please, if we get that and then we get the Tron coaster in California

990
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,920
or we get the electronica back.

991
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:39,860
I'm all for Jared, do whatever you want.

992
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,700
Just don't play any of his music.

993
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:50,640
Is it safe to say that the Tron dance party and Videopolis are the two coolest things

994
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:51,640
Disney's ever done?

995
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:53,080
Disneyland specifically.

996
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,400
Disneyland, yeah I would say so.

997
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:58,580
That's a pretty good bet to say I would think.

998
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:03,240
Because Disney as a whole is, I think the nice thing about Disney is that it's not trying to be cool.

999
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:09,160
So when it actually has hit two things that, you know, four of us think are very cool.

1000
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:10,440
A Tron dance party.

1001
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:12,000
They've actually sort of done something impressive.

1002
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:13,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know.

1003
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:19,200
The fact that people found this club to be legit is pretty impressive to me.

1004
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:27,260
For my childhood at Disneyland, the two story Starrcade when it had all the games you could ever want.

1005
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,440
Starrcade is kind of gone finally.

1006
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:39,400
Yeah, it's sad. It got reduced to like eight to ten games and then the rest of the area merchandise only on the first.

1007
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:46,040
That second story has been vacant for like 25 years.

1008
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:54,080
It is crazy how these corners of this, like the happiest place on earth, this hugely popular theme park.

1009
01:06:54,600 --> 01:07:01,780
No matter how much money or how well the parks are doing, there's always going to be corners that just kind of like...

1010
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:05,500
Or big empty spaces that are just storing boxes of Stitch t-shirts.

1011
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:11,520
How is that possible? It's like the most valuable real estate in the world and how do you end up with just an attic?

1012
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:18,400
Yeah, it's crazy. I hope you've heard that we've been just being so upset about what's happening at Tomorrowland at Disneyland.

1013
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:22,200
That's another part of that is just Starrcade being empty.

1014
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:28,040
Yeah, it's pathetic. I don't like the H.D. Wells-Jules Verne makeover.

1015
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:31,620
It's barely there.

1016
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:37,820
It's like they had something that they're trying to do and then they even abandoned that and now it's...

1017
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:51,280
The Tomorrowland in Tokyo is perfect. It's the time capsule. It's the Tomorrowland we remember from like 1983.

1018
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:57,240
That version. Nothing will ever be cooler than that.

1019
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:06,620
Honestly, what I've seen of the building that the Tron coaster is in in Shanghai and will be coming to Orlando in a few years...

1020
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:17,180
Again, the look of Tron Legacy I think still looks really good. So just cover the Anaheim Tomorrowland in glowing neon colors.

1021
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,200
Yes, that will always be the future.

1022
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:29,140
The future ever... Well, it's not really a current future. The future is always lasers. When will you learn it, Disney? It doesn't change.

1023
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:38,060
Even at the opening Olympics. The opening Olympic ceremonies in Korea just happened a day or so ago.

1024
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:49,520
There was visualization of what a future Korean cities could look like and a lot of that was glowing blue.

1025
01:08:49,980 --> 01:09:00,640
It looked amazing. We were at the soft opening of Splitsville in downtown Disney watching the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics on the TV with the sound off.

1026
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:05,560
Wait, is it just soft opening? I didn't even realize it was that far along.

1027
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:10,440
It was in the bowling alley of downtown Disney. How is it? What did you think?

1028
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:11,320
It was fun.

1029
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:17,800
Great. Well, it's another place to get beer at Disneyland so I'm happy as long as it satisfies that.

1030
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:18,960
Full bar. They'll make any drink you want.

1031
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:27,840
Wonderful. While we're jumping around Tomorrowlands, I'd like to say that the name Vidiopolis, in addition to Pleasure Island, also made it to Disneyland Paris.

1032
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:28,640
Good point.

1033
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:39,640
Which has the Discoveryland, the Jules Verne overlay. I got to go to Vidiopolis Paris and I was curious if it felt anything like the 90s Disneyland Vidiopolis.

1034
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:47,680
But in fact, it's kind of a cafeteria and all of the seats and the risers people go and take food over there.

1035
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:59,040
So I ate my lunch at Disneyland Paris at Vidiopolis and there was a stage which had a bunch of big thunder kind of rock work.

1036
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:05,220
Like big jutting out rock pieces. And I was like, I wonder what show we're getting today.

1037
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:12,040
And the show we got was the stage being empty and all four monitors quietly playing clips of Star Wars Rebels.

1038
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:26,800
Which is kind of a nice little synopsis of Disneyland Paris in general and our Disneyland Paris experience as I sat and watched quiet clips of a cartoon while eating the worst burger I've had in my life.

1039
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:40,280
Very strange. I think they did want Vidiopolis Paris to be a teen club a la Disneyland but it was apparently cancelled due to lack of interest from the public.

1040
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:41,560
There you go.

1041
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:47,060
So they never played music there but they did do a show which you can look up on YouTube. A show called Rock Shock.

1042
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:59,800
And I would describe this, they did this in 1995 and I would describe the show aesthetically as being done by people who thought that the in sync pop era was too tasteful.

1043
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:13,900
It's a real nightmare. And the description of Rock Shock on Wikipedia, it featured a gang of teenagers journeying in the footsteps of Jules Verne to the beat of rock music.

1044
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:24,520
It was a relative success. Which is maybe, I'm not sure I agree with even that praise, the opening, it's a 20 minute show you can watch on YouTube.

1045
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:37,400
I'll happily watch any weird Disney live show. This thing, it starts with Mickey being brought out in like a little space rover and then trying to plant a flag in the ground and then failing.

1046
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:50,120
And he eventually gives up and takes the flag back with him on the space rover and then a bunch of teens flop around for 15 minutes and there are no characters. Doesn't feel remotely like Disney in any way.

1047
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:54,680
So mixed reviews from me on Vidiopolis Paris.

1048
01:11:54,680 --> 01:12:07,380
Well speaking of teens flopping around with no direction, watch this transition. Ken, let's talk about some of the clips we have seen of the Vidiopolis TV shows.

1049
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:17,340
Absolutely, sure. Yeah, so they made a syndicated television show a la American Bandstand or Soul Train using the name Vidiopolis.

1050
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:27,440
And I also thought it was funny, they did not just use the name Vidiopolis but they took another part of the live experience of Vidiopolis, the Snack Bar Yums with a Z.

1051
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:32,780
Which was right next to Vidiopolis which offered pizza, ice cream and nachos.

1052
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,060
Oh man, the best foods!

1053
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:52,660
I'm sorry you can't go to Yums today. But there was a part in the middle of when it got to the interview section of the Vidiopolis show, a big sign that says Yums came down and a bunch of teens all sat at tables and talked to that day's guest.

1054
01:12:52,840 --> 01:13:00,560
Which would have included, I believe guests on the Vidiopolis show included Debbie Gibson, New Kids on the Block and in the one that's the most on YouTube, Pebbles.

1055
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:04,540
Yes, 80's singer Pebbles. What are the Pebbles hits?

1056
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:09,160
Mercedes Boy, Girlfriend, which is a wonderful jam.

1057
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:17,280
And the interviews are so awkward and stilted. First of all the host of the show, this guy Randy Hamilton, who is like a local actor.

1058
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,640
The squarest square I've ever seen.

1059
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:22,420
So square, like late 30's hanging out with teenagers.

1060
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:24,040
Yeah, he's too old, why is he hosting the show?

1061
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:26,220
Yeah, way too old to be hosting that show.

1062
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:37,980
And there's a strange thing with him where he comes out and introduces the show and hosts it, but then when you go to Yums he's on a TV monitor, even though you've established that he's on the main set of the show.

1063
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:45,920
Well video conferencing was amazing back then. It was the idea that you could talk to a television was incredible.

1064
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,500
Even your visage through time and space.

1065
01:13:48,880 --> 01:14:00,880
That was so funny, the opening credits of the episode. There's a lot of clips of online just hearing the announcer go, with special guest Pebbles and your host Randy Hamilton.

1066
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:07,520
And out comes a guy in the palest khakis I've ever seen wearing a quilt, like the bougiest.

1067
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,480
A big thick sweater.

1068
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,180
Yeah, Martha's Vineyard attire.

1069
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:13,580
He was just yachting.

1070
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:18,100
Yeah, he was yachting. Another Michael Eisner obsession. Michael Eisner wanted cool stuff.

1071
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:21,120
And he loved his childhood summers in New England.

1072
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,180
So he wanted to reflect that in the host of Videopolis.

1073
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:24,960
Yeah.

1074
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:31,880
Yeah, so it's an odd show. Pebbles is real dour. She's kind of, she's not wannabe interviewed.

1075
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:38,400
She's very like Prince in her answers, I felt. Like when Prince was in an interview he didn't want to be in and he would just be like, I guess so.

1076
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:51,820
I did like in the interview when Randy Hamilton asked her, who are your guys? In sort of a proto Mark Maron, hey who are your guys? Hey Pebbles, are we good?

1077
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,800
Pebbles said Bill Hicks.

1078
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:05,140
There's a Randy Hamilton, I wrote down a quote that Randy says too, just with this like unknown young dancer. And he says this, I don't know if you guys saw this, I'm sure you did.

1079
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:10,880
He goes, ever since show business started, audiences love to see new unknown talent get a chance at stardom.

1080
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:16,740
Stardom. He mispronounces the word or he's like being funny. I don't know. So he says, yeah.

1081
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:23,720
And then he goes, now being the swell guy that I am, he's like, I'm going to send this kid up and then he's going to become a big star or whatever. And then like a kid dances.

1082
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:34,460
It's bizarre. And they, it's like, he either makes them, I mean, he makes a mistake. He called, he says stardom stardom, and then he like quickly corrects himself. I don't know why they didn't do another take of it.

1083
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:39,340
Or he was being funny and like saying stardom and like thinking like, Oh, this is a bad, I don't know.

1084
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:56,400
Speaking of cumbersome transitions, they try to set up a song at one point in one of these episodes. And he, and his line was, after two people have been together for a while, people start to take each other for granted.

1085
01:15:56,440 --> 01:16:12,020
And everyone is clearly distressed and confused. And I believe it was to set up a Janet Jackson song. Like there's, there's like 30 seconds of weird banter and he was trying to get them to setting up this Janet Jackson song. They were all going to dance.

1086
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:41,340
Why didn't they get Scott Valentine, the splash mountain rap guy or better yet, Mark Price, AKA the guy who did all the splash mountain promotional, you know, like, uh, well he was Skippy from, I believe growing pains, but the, oh, yes.

1087
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:58,400
I did like, uh, it's, uh, uh, Hamilton does a good job introducing the start of the clip. I watched like, uh, uh, the boy, this, uh, you know, there's, there's an interstellar phenomenon known as a Sonic boom. And that's exactly what this song is doing on the charts.

1088
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:01,220
This is Westworld with Sonic boom boy.

1089
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:09,060
Song I'd never heard of, but I enjoyed highlighted different odd Randy Hamilton line.

1090
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:21,980
Randy Hamilton is creepy too. He's like, there's that clip where he's trying to like, get like one of the kids on the show to dance with pebbles. Yeah. And he's like, uh, pebbles. Uh, there's a, this guy's got a question for you. And then she's like, what?

1091
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:36,480
And then the kid doesn't ask the question and he goes, uh, weren't you saying you wanted to dance with pebbles? And then, and then he's like, yeah, oh, would you dance? He goes, uh, pebbles, uh, he's asking if you guys can go to the dance floor together. And then she's like, yeah, that'd be fine.

1092
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:39,080
Yeah, that sounds nice. Okay. We'll do that.

1093
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:44,560
When a disembodied man on a TV tells you what to do, I guess you got to do it.

1094
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:48,400
Um, it's weird. He's very weird. He comes off so poorly.

1095
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:55,620
He makes you feel so uncomfortable, much like your dad would like if you were at a cool place and your dad was there.

1096
01:17:56,160 --> 01:18:00,180
Like dad, please go away.

1097
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,040
Just ask the girl out, Tommy.

1098
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:10,620
Randy Hamilton should not have introduced himself as the host. He should have said, I'm the chaperone for tonight. I'll be keeping an eye on you guys.

1099
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:19,780
If my dad hosted a dance night at videopolis and declared at the top, well, we're gonna have a lot of fun. Won't be playing any of that damn rap though. I'll tell you that much.

1100
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:26,660
Who's the girl you like, son? I'll ask her for you. Where is she? Oh yeah. Hey, Tiffany, get over here. My son's got a question for you.

1101
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,580
My wiener son's being a wiener.

1102
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:34,960
Did you do a little pity make out with him? Come on. Yeah, be nice. Make him into a man.

1103
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:46,600
The creepiest host that we've talked about maybe since the Jurassic Park guy who was the first man accused of gerbaling, who hosted the Jurassic Park opening special.

1104
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:52,100
There's one to look up. Go back to our Jurassic Park episode for a determination of gerbaling.

1105
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:56,400
I may have to go back to that episode. Okay, yeah, now I remember. Okay, yeah.

1106
01:18:57,140 --> 01:19:10,340
Anyway, well, there's a whole big, before there was a TV show, there had to be the dance party, but before there was the Disneyland dance party, there's a whole other wrinkle in this saga.

1107
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:17,580
The other thing that's interesting about this genre is that Eisner, in addition to wanting to make the park cool, he also wanted to siphon business away from Knott's Berry Farm.

1108
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:32,780
Because Videopolis opens in a rush job in the summer of 1985, partially because in the summer of 1984, Knott's is doing gangbusters business with two dance clubs, one called Cloud 9 and one called Studio K.

1109
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:45,060
So we're huge. Like the first all-ages dance clubs anywhere. Really? Yeah, they had huge DJs like Richard Blade from K-Rock. They're attracting 2,000 teenagers and young adults a night.

1110
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:49,380
Oh my god. So, of course, Michael is like, we need to get on this ASAP.

1111
01:19:51,540 --> 01:20:05,360
And Knott's also kind of pioneered a different kind of ticketing specifically to appeal to youngsters. I think there was a special pass you could get. If you paid $8, you'd go in after 6 o'clock.

1112
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:13,620
You don't get the full day at the park, but to encourage people to go to... And Disney did the same thing. But with a much pricier deal.

1113
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:22,180
You could get a summer pass. Summer's night's pass. Summer's night's pass. And you got a Videopolis membership card for it. How cool is that?

1114
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:28,980
You could go every night for the summer after 5pm. This would cost you $40.

1115
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:35,920
Wait a minute, the entire summer... The entire summer... This pass being pricey. Oh my god. It wasn't every night.

1116
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:46,940
No, no. You paid $40 and then for the rest of the summer you could come after 5pm. To all of Disneyland. Not just to Videopolis.

1117
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:57,660
If you told me for a summer now, this is going to be a pass. You get into Disneyland past 5 o'clock. And maybe you don't get to do all the rides, but you get to dance to Janet Jackson.

1118
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:06,640
Nobody would ever see me again. I'd have to get an apartment in Brea just to be nearby. The summer's blown. I'm gone.

1119
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:18,960
This was common practice in Florida too. You could buy half day passes for the parks to get in because they wanted to get people in the parks. Now they want people out of the parks.

1120
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:28,880
This is how they started attracting the wrong element which ultimately led to Videopolis' demise. It was gone by the late 80's because of gang wars in the parking lot.

1121
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:33,760
Wasn't there also a stage in Tomorrowland where local bands would play?

1122
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:43,700
Yeah, they still have that. It's now the Star Wars Jedi Academy and for a brief time in the 2000's it was called Club Buzz. Meaning Buzz Lightyear.

1123
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:52,100
But I think in the 80's people would buy this pass and hang out there too. Or maybe it was the 90's they had a similar teen pass.

1124
01:21:52,600 --> 01:22:00,420
I definitely remember cool stuff happening at that Tomorrowland stage. It's so cool the way it rises out of the ground.

1125
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:14,440
And I believe that was maybe the 90's. Someone who grew up here was telling me about that and that also had some violence and then they shut it down. But kids were just hanging out there in lieu of the mall.

1126
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:18,640
It's like, well we could go to the mall or we could just go hang out at Disneyland.

1127
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,780
I wasted my youth.

1128
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:30,360
My friend Ska Bad in the mid 90's opened up for No Doubt at the Tomorrowland stage on grad night.

1129
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:36,560
Even back in the old days they would have cool bands. They would have up and coming bands.

1130
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:47,320
Which they probably stole from Magic Mountain. Magic Mountain in the 70's had huge huge bands and Disneyland probably wanted to get on that. Disneyland stole everything from other people.

1131
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:53,820
They kind of wait for other people to test the waters and once they get it working they have an example and they take it.

1132
01:22:53,840 --> 01:23:07,840
I learned from the defunct Land series on Videoopolis. The local attitude was that the rich kids went to Videoopolis and everyone else went to Studio K.

1133
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,640
A little wilder, a little more fun it seems like.

1134
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:21,180
That is what it sounds like. Disney did have to be a little more... they had to censor the music. There's certain songs, certain videos they aren't playing.

1135
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:28,100
But it sounds like it was a little more all bets are off at Studio K. Studio K does sound a little more legit to me.

1136
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:36,880
And also to go back to No Doubt there is a quote when Gwen Stefani was promoting her 2004, her first solo album she said,

1137
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:44,220
The goal was to make a record that had that feeling I got when I'd go dancing at Studio K at Knott's Berry Farm. You don't feel that anymore.

1138
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:49,800
Which is the album, I like some of that album. It's got Hollaback Girl, it's got Cool which is a good song.

1139
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:55,840
There's like other, Bubble Pop Electric is a good song. So mission accomplished Gwen.

1140
01:23:55,840 --> 01:24:03,840
If you were making a period piece of that era, you open up on a shot with Hollaback Girl playing, you're immediately taken back to that time period.

1141
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:09,540
When there is a 2000s coming of age film or show, yes the trailer will have Hollaback Girl.

1142
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:15,180
The Videoopolis, it seems kind of odd that they would do something like this or even they would do it at Knott's.

1143
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:20,320
But Disneyland has had a history of having people come at night and dance.

1144
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:27,900
That actually is a date night at Disneyland. It's a song that was made and it was attracting couples to come and dance.

1145
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:28,980
Is the song called that?

1146
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:35,280
Yeah it's on this Disney competition and it's like, hey everybody it's a something something orchestra get ready to dance.

1147
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:39,980
And it's like, Date Night at Disneyland. It's an old timey song and it's very fun.

1148
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:44,680
But it's like this is a tradition and they've actually just been doing the new version of it every year.

1149
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:51,340
I guess they haven't really done it in a while, but they still have people go and do a weird swing dance over in front of the castle once in a while.

1150
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:55,580
That's always it. This isn't the first time they did dancing a bit at Disneyland.

1151
01:24:55,740 --> 01:25:00,400
My mother grew up in Southern California and she'd go as a teenager every weekend.

1152
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:06,360
I think there was a cover band that they would go specifically to see perform at Disneyland and dance.

1153
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:10,780
And then try to hang out with them after the gig and go on rides with them.

1154
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:16,740
Disneyland and Knots has always been a cool way to date.

1155
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:21,860
I would go to Magic Mountain when I was in high school and we would try to meet girls.

1156
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:26,920
Before Tinder and dating apps it was like, this is how you did it.

1157
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:29,140
And I still prefer this way.

1158
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:35,800
I still go to Disneyland looking for hookups. Not true.

1159
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:44,640
But they spell it all out in the special Disneyland Summer Vacation Party.

1160
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:49,740
That two hour special, the whole storyline is about trying to meet cute girls and guys.

1161
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:56,960
Right. I guess that is just on the opening day, Walt said, this is a place for all to come.

1162
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:02,180
And also for hot young singles to meet and hook up.

1163
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:09,060
And where families can have fun together and where the ages of consent get fuzzy.

1164
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:14,300
Scott, you were surprised by the date night at Disneyland single.

1165
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:19,600
But nowadays you just make a Twitter account or an Instagram account to promote something.

1166
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:23,180
Back in the day someone would just cut a single as advertising.

1167
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:27,200
That's when they would just be like, alright, I'm opening a hamburger restaurant.

1168
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:34,140
Hire those kids down the street to cut a single. Call it like hamburger Mary.

1169
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:40,100
Sorry, I was right. It's Let's Dance at Disneyland. I'll play a second of it for you.

1170
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:47,080
It's date night at Disneyland with the Elliott Brothers and the Disneyland Date Nighters. Let's dance!

1171
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:58,940
Let's dance at Disneyland. Date nights are late nights at Disneyland.

1172
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:03,780
We're rolling to the park once one AM. Friday and Saturday nights.

1173
01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:08,200
That's your original videopolis. Wow.

1174
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:10,340
It was recorded on Friday. It's always been cool.

1175
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:13,500
Press it on Saturday. Sell it at Woolworths on Monday.

1176
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:17,020
Watch the tickets skyrocket next Friday.

1177
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:22,320
Rowdy, horny teens have been coming since the 50s.

1178
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,780
Amorous young people.

1179
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:30,260
It does seem like Disneyland has always had it. I think maybe less so now.

1180
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:35,100
I feel like if you see Disney band now, they're more likely to be kind of handpicked.

1181
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:38,400
They feel like it's sort of a more corporate entertainment.

1182
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:41,820
But it does feel like in the first 40 years of Disneyland's existence.

1183
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:47,060
Somebody fact check me on any of this, but I feel like I've picked up from various sources.

1184
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:56,960
Bands that played at Disneyland before they were famous include the Beach Boys, the Jackson 5, the Osmonds, all the coolest bands.

1185
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:06,220
The Carpenters. Bands that went on to be big legit bands. It was a legit place to start and get their name out there.

1186
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:12,380
Jackson 5's first gig in Southern California. Golden Horseshoe.

1187
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:13,040
What?

1188
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:14,180
Not true. Sorry.

1189
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:17,900
I like that so much. I wanted it to be true.

1190
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:19,020
Sorry. Sorry.

1191
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:22,800
Wally Bo doing the teeth spitting gag for a young Michael.

1192
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:35,000
Also, I didn't realize they would have legit bands play at Grad Night at Disneyland in the 80s.

1193
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:40,000
Where they would deploy the high school graduation event at Disneyland.

1194
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:44,840
And now that's a month long event. So it would be impossible to book incredible bands for every night of that.

1195
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:49,200
But it was more limited in the 80s. And I was seeing people shout out on a message.

1196
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:56,380
I was lurking and I found people saying, who played at your Grad Night? Expose and Zap. Crazy legit.

1197
01:28:56,900 --> 01:29:05,440
And my favorite one was that Cheap Trick performed on Tom Sawyer Island where Fantasmic now takes place.

1198
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:09,500
Cheap Trick playing over the river. How cool is that?

1199
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:16,560
That is awesome. This is not quite as cool, but I think for New Year's two years ago, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy played in New Orleans Square.

1200
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:17,700
And that's not a joke.

1201
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:22,240
So they still have hot young bands.

1202
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:23,900
That sounds too crazy to be true.

1203
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:25,120
No, no, believe it.

1204
01:29:25,180 --> 01:29:30,940
Now they've kind of shifted. I mean, Epcot every year has free bands play during one of the festivals.

1205
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:34,900
The Food and Wine Festival. I believe it's called Eat to the Beat.

1206
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:36,240
Eat to the Beat. Yeah.

1207
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:37,500
And then...

1208
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:42,000
Lineups are crazy amazing. Like I was there three months ago and they have this schedule.

1209
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:46,780
And it's like the Pointer Sisters. Like huge names.

1210
01:29:46,780 --> 01:29:47,680
The Naked Ladies.

1211
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:49,420
Rick Springfield maybe.

1212
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:53,440
And then Universal always in Orlando does a big Mardi Gras thing.

1213
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:56,780
And they always have free bands and theirs tend to be pretty good too.

1214
01:29:56,900 --> 01:30:01,040
Like Jason Derulo is doing it this year and it's just included in your park admission.

1215
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:06,700
Our list of who we have considered cool bands at this point is so...

1216
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:07,100
Really spanned.

1217
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:08,120
All over the map.

1218
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:14,040
Robin Thicke and Jefferson Starship.

1219
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:15,860
And all the coolest bands.

1220
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:19,780
Two of the four Boys to Men.

1221
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:21,760
The Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

1222
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:25,600
Wally Bogue's Daughter.

1223
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:33,960
Anyway, I want to shout out specifically the band that you were most likely to see at Vitiopolis on a Disneyland Summer.

1224
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:37,140
That played a half hour of cover tunes every night.

1225
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:41,560
Of course, everybody at home say with me, Donna McDaniel and network.

1226
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:48,620
We all know Donna McDaniel riding high from the success of her film Hollywood Hot Tubs.

1227
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:51,160
Have you seen Hollywood Hot Tubs?

1228
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:53,920
It seems like something you would have run into.

1229
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:59,860
Yes. I have a video somewhere in my garage as well as the sequel Hollywood Hot Tubs 2.

1230
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:00,860
Hollywood Hot Tubs 2.

1231
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:04,460
Teaching, it's a name. Like teaching Donna or something.

1232
01:31:05,620 --> 01:31:08,660
Anyway, she would play...

1233
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:12,160
And I found an article that was a little complaining in the LA Times about like...

1234
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:15,840
I don't know about this unsavory lyrics and this element.

1235
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:20,800
They're singing songs and they clearly quote the lyrics of Jungle Love.

1236
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,780
That's presented as the trashiest song.

1237
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:26,920
Funny enough in that video, Pebble says she's going on tour with Morris Day.

1238
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:28,260
Oh, hey.

1239
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:31,280
Morris Day ever hit the Disneyland circuit?

1240
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:32,560
Oh, that's an interesting question.

1241
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:33,500
He still could.

1242
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:35,400
I think that's possible.

1243
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:39,160
New Year's Eve with Morris Day in New Orleans Square.

1244
01:31:39,820 --> 01:31:40,380
Sounds like a blast.

1245
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:45,180
I'd like to see DeBarge perform at the Tomorrowland Terrace.

1246
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:46,920
That would be amazing.

1247
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:48,680
If they're still around.

1248
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:51,280
They are. They performed...

1249
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:51,460
Really?

1250
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:53,640
They were making those rounds this past summer.

1251
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:54,260
Oh, no kidding.

1252
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:58,060
Because I feel like the scoop on DeBarge is always like...

1253
01:31:58,060 --> 01:32:00,340
Well, one of them was passed out under the freeway.

1254
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:01,660
They've had some serious...

1255
01:32:01,660 --> 01:32:06,280
If you want to get the full scoop, I recommend the DeBarge episode of Unsung,

1256
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:09,840
which is an amazing TV show I'll throw out there.

1257
01:32:10,580 --> 01:32:15,280
Kind of like the BBC-produced version of Behind the Music.

1258
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:15,980
Ah, gotcha.

1259
01:32:16,420 --> 01:32:21,340
But focusing on the type of R&B and 80s one-hit wonders

1260
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:25,580
that were never popular enough to get their own episode of Behind the Music.

1261
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:27,340
They'll cover it.

1262
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:30,540
Shouldn't be overlooked. Like the Whispers, wonderful band.

1263
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:31,500
The Whispers, yeah.

1264
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:35,640
Zzap, which is an amazing heartbreaking story.

1265
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:36,400
Oh, okay.

1266
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:41,440
Did the vocoder tube get caught down his throat?

1267
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:43,560
Oh, boy, it did it, unfortunately.

1268
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:47,580
He was murdered. I found that out today.

1269
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:48,140
That's horrible.

1270
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:48,600
Jesus.

1271
01:32:49,140 --> 01:32:49,420
Sorry.

1272
01:32:51,180 --> 01:32:53,580
I just ruined your podcast. Sorry.

1273
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,600
From the heights of Grad Night in 1989 to the lows of being murdered.

1274
01:33:00,180 --> 01:33:03,940
I didn't have a spot to bring this up earlier.

1275
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:07,980
In researching for this episode, I found a videopolis.

1276
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:11,700
I don't know if this is authentic merchandise from the time

1277
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:15,560
or if it's a throwback pin, but it's a Disney lapel pin

1278
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:19,840
featuring one of my favorite versions of Mickey, 80s Mickey.

1279
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:20,780
Oh, yeah, I know.

1280
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:23,380
This is casual 80s Mickey, not businessman Mickey.

1281
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:23,920
Hell, yeah.

1282
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:27,100
And he's looking real sleazy, this 80s Mickey.

1283
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:29,420
He's ready for a night out at videopolis.

1284
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:33,280
Pomped collar, half-down eyelids, sly look into the side.

1285
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:34,860
Yeah, I know.

1286
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:37,920
Hands in pockets. There's a lot of tells about this guy.

1287
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:45,540
Maybe if he's in the corner of videopolis, don't go up to him.

1288
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:47,720
The rival camp.

1289
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:48,760
The rival rich kid camp.

1290
01:33:49,060 --> 01:33:49,660
Yeah, yeah.

1291
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:52,460
That's another interesting thing because a couple summers ago,

1292
01:33:52,540 --> 01:33:55,820
they introduced a version of Mickey at the parks called Hipster Mickey.

1293
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:57,300
Oh, God, I've seen this.

1294
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,660
Yeah, and he's got glasses on and he's very nonplussed

1295
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:03,820
and he's looking at a phone and he's got a backpack on.

1296
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:04,900
And every time...

1297
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:06,060
Wait, this is at the parks?

1298
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:06,800
Yeah, it's on the parks.

1299
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:07,620
You've never seen Hipster Mickey?

1300
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:08,820
No, no, no, no.

1301
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:10,060
Yeah, he's on merchandise and stuff.

1302
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:11,360
It's at the Wonderland Gallery.

1303
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:12,420
I'm sure you've seen him.

1304
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:14,200
He's not yet a walk-around character.

1305
01:34:14,380 --> 01:34:16,780
Thank God I'd smack that phone out of his hands.

1306
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:18,020
Look me in the eye, Mickey.

1307
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:22,140
I want to get a picture with the Mickey who won't stop fucking with his iPhone

1308
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:24,080
and reading a Tao Lin novel.

1309
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:29,160
Shout out to Brooklyn literary scene piece of shit, Tao Lin.

1310
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:31,620
I don't know.

1311
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:34,120
The current Mickey's fun and nice and all,

1312
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:36,340
but I don't know where he stands on Pod Save America.

1313
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:38,920
Is he a fan or not?

1314
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:44,000
Hipster Mickey's much more of a Chapo trap house listener, I think.

1315
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,040
Does he like Cum Town?

1316
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:51,560
I think you're just putting your socialist beliefs on this Hipster Mickey.

1317
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:55,580
You're projecting the socialist Mickey you want.

1318
01:34:55,580 --> 01:34:59,680
There is no way that Hipster Mickey did not pledge to the Sanders campaign.

1319
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:00,840
Hipster Mickey definitely donated to the Sanders campaign.

1320
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:01,660
I don't know about that.

1321
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:04,260
He feels more like a hashtag resistance kind of guy to me.

1322
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:05,060
I'll be honest.

1323
01:35:05,860 --> 01:35:06,820
He was more of a centrist.

1324
01:35:07,420 --> 01:35:07,580
A mainstream Democrat.

1325
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:08,740
He was a mainstream Democrat.

1326
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,340
Anyway, so Hipster Mickey, when we all saw it on shirts and stuff,

1327
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:13,900
we all went, oh, this sucks.

1328
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:15,860
And it felt like a new thing.

1329
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:17,760
Like, oh, look what they're doing with Mickey now.

1330
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,760
But obviously with this videopolis thing,

1331
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:22,440
I think if you were walking around then and you were, you know,

1332
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:26,660
a grumpy person in their thirties, you'd go, oh, oh, gross.

1333
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:28,320
Look what they're doing on Mickey now.

1334
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:30,280
Like, and now it feels again, this is,

1335
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:32,740
I guess now we're learning that this is all just cyclical.

1336
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:35,180
Everything happens over and over and over again.

1337
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:36,580
And it feels like a new thing.

1338
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:39,000
So, you know, good point.

1339
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:39,720
Thank you.

1340
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:42,880
I'm trying to make a point about the Skywalker family.

1341
01:35:43,180 --> 01:35:43,420
Yeah.

1342
01:35:43,420 --> 01:35:44,660
These same things repeat.

1343
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:45,240
Yeah.

1344
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:48,900
Except that they cut off the Skywalker family in these new movies and it's

1345
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:51,420
not about the Skywalker family anymore, but that's a different story.

1346
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:57,680
We have to mention the Totally Minnie, which was a huge thing.

1347
01:35:57,860 --> 01:35:58,520
Yes, that's true.

1348
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:03,880
It was the new cool Minnie that they were selling around that same time.

1349
01:36:04,140 --> 01:36:07,900
There was a TV special called Totally Minnie starring Suzanne Somers,

1350
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:10,020
which I highly recommend.

1351
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:11,860
I watched that together.

1352
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:12,720
Maybe not Jason.

1353
01:36:12,860 --> 01:36:14,460
I don't think you were there, but did we?

1354
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:20,180
Yeah, I think we had a wild weekend with a drunken viewing of the...

1355
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:23,220
Just the boys watching Totally Minnie.

1356
01:36:23,620 --> 01:36:24,600
Oh, gosh.

1357
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:28,220
This podcast has just entered evidence in a courtroom.

1358
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:29,960
Jason, here's Minnie.

1359
01:36:30,020 --> 01:36:31,180
Here's what Minnie looked like.

1360
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:32,160
Welcome back to haunted.

1361
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:36,480
Yeah, Minnie was also susceptible to the 80s fashions, of course.

1362
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:41,420
But I think that 80s Minnie is cooler than 80s Mickey.

1363
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:42,240
Yeah, for sure.

1364
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:45,220
And 80s Minnie kind of...

1365
01:36:45,220 --> 01:36:48,280
I feel like current hipsters still look like 80s Minnie.

1366
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,300
We'll tweet out this photo, see if you agree.

1367
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:55,380
But I feel like it reminds me of the recent Cardi B performance

1368
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:57,820
of Finesse on the Grammys.

1369
01:36:58,220 --> 01:37:04,120
I might not know Cardi B's style other than when she was retro with Bruno Mars.

1370
01:37:04,660 --> 01:37:10,080
80s women's fashions are a lot more fun and come back around.

1371
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:17,400
They feel like a lot more than 80s men's Wall Street or Ralph Lauren polo wear,

1372
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:18,800
which is exhausting.

1373
01:37:19,180 --> 01:37:20,560
80s men's wear is exhausting.

1374
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:25,760
Like the hard, hard, slicked back hair, which you only see make a comeback

1375
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,180
with the Trump children.

1376
01:37:28,580 --> 01:37:29,400
They're such...

1377
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:30,740
It never went away for them.

1378
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,000
They're still living their...

1379
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,340
They're living their father's youth.

1380
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:34,840
The 80s never stopped.

1381
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:36,480
They're yuppies from birth.

1382
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:39,760
What have we missed?

1383
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:43,160
Well, I guess we're getting towards the end.

1384
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:45,800
So the sad demise of Vidiopolis.

1385
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:49,440
Well, you know, one thing before we get to the end.

1386
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:52,840
So there was kind of the step one of controversy,

1387
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:55,300
which is the same-sex dancing.

1388
01:37:55,900 --> 01:38:00,060
Before Vidiopolis opened, there was that Tomorrowland rise-up stage,

1389
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:01,080
as we talked about.

1390
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:05,700
And in the early 80s, two young gentlemen were dancing with each other there

1391
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:08,720
and were asked to stop by a security guard.

1392
01:38:08,860 --> 01:38:11,420
They ignored him, started again, then they were asked to leave the park.

1393
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:12,860
They sued Disneyland.

1394
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:17,400
Sorry, according to the defunctland video,

1395
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,060
they described it as homosexual fast dancing.

1396
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:22,020
Jesus.

1397
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:24,840
This is a long way...

1398
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:25,800
Again, we phrase this place.

1399
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:28,140
We love that they spy on people.

1400
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:30,460
They use phrases like homosexual fast dancing.

1401
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:32,020
It's a very gay-friendly park.

1402
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:34,260
There's a long time before gay days.

1403
01:38:34,420 --> 01:38:38,120
And it switches in the course of this controversy

1404
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:40,460
because they ban homosexual dancing.

1405
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:42,500
But then it goes back and forth.

1406
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:43,220
It's in court.

1407
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:47,720
And then Disney's trying to pretend that that's not really why we're banning it.

1408
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:48,880
Very confusing.

1409
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:51,400
Then they said, according to the...

1410
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:53,600
I can't say the word defunctland, apparently.

1411
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:59,000
They didn't want two women to dance because it would have excited the men too much.

1412
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:02,260
So they were trying to do some weird work around to say,

1413
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:04,500
no, that's not why. We're not anti-gay or anything.

1414
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:07,580
Whereas, as all this is happening,

1415
01:39:08,380 --> 01:39:11,300
then Studio K and Cloud 9 opened to Knotts,

1416
01:39:11,380 --> 01:39:15,280
which according to my research, very gay-friendly from the beginning.

1417
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:20,340
Legitimately a place where gay teenagers in Orange County could feel comfortable

1418
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:23,320
and not get hassled and a lot of the DJs were gay.

1419
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:29,480
So, seemingly, Knotts was way ahead of it and cooler way before Disney was.

1420
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:34,280
Yeah, so then eventually in the defunctland thing,

1421
01:39:34,580 --> 01:39:37,080
it shows a newspaper article that says,

1422
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:38,680
Gays Can Dance at Disneyland.

1423
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:41,740
That wasn't their ad campaign.

1424
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,980
Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

1425
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:47,800
Randy Hamilton announced it on the show.

1426
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:49,740
Gays Can Dance in Disneyland.

1427
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:50,460
Okay.

1428
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,640
That's what you kids are into.

1429
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:57,080
Look, I'll look the other way. I won't be there.

1430
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:59,340
It's not my thing, but whatever.

1431
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:04,660
That other DJ we mentioned being on the screen at...

1432
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:05,520
Swedish Eagle?

1433
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:06,620
Yes, Swedish Eagle.

1434
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:08,980
Also dressed very similar to Randy Hamilton.

1435
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:10,720
E-G-I-L, by the way.

1436
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:12,740
Oh, weird.

1437
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:14,820
Yeah, I know. It's weird.

1438
01:40:14,860 --> 01:40:15,500
Very confusing.

1439
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:20,440
But anyway, so by the time Videopolis opened in summer of 1871,

1440
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:23,420
in 1885, they were cool about it.

1441
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:28,920
They did, like, yeah, they had switched their policy, which is great.

1442
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:35,600
But then, but they, but different issues arose at the play, at Videopolis.

1443
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:38,280
I'm not, I'm actually not as familiar with this.

1444
01:40:38,420 --> 01:40:40,760
There were, there was an incident in the parking lot.

1445
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:44,240
Like, like they, like there were gang affiliations.

1446
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:49,220
Several, supposedly several high profile gang related incidents

1447
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:51,440
in the old Disneyland parking lot.

1448
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,460
Which you did Mickey and Friends.

1449
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:55,300
You have to do a whole episode about the old.

1450
01:40:56,020 --> 01:40:57,520
Yeah, yeah, we'll get to that. Don't worry.

1451
01:40:57,940 --> 01:41:02,340
But, yeah, one involved, like, a 15 year old kid being stabbed to death.

1452
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:03,120
It was horrible.

1453
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:05,400
So that quickly went away.

1454
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:07,780
It is, it is interesting, as you mentioned, Jason,

1455
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:12,180
that this is around the same time that Pleasure Island opened.

1456
01:41:12,180 --> 01:41:15,520
So I kind of feel like maybe Eisner took what,

1457
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:17,840
the lessons that he had learned from Videopolis

1458
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:20,800
and brought it to Orlando.

1459
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:26,020
Well, Pleasure Island, I remember being at Pleasure Island a lot as a kid.

1460
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:28,940
Like every trip we would go at least once or twice.

1461
01:41:29,260 --> 01:41:33,600
And it was, I, again, I never saw Videopolis,

1462
01:41:33,820 --> 01:41:38,940
but like Pleasure Island was like secure, pretty secure

1463
01:41:38,940 --> 01:41:42,280
and like pretty tame walking around outside the clubs.

1464
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,860
It was not all ages like Videopolis was, correct?

1465
01:41:44,860 --> 01:41:47,820
No, everything, well, a lot of it was.

1466
01:41:48,740 --> 01:41:50,080
Ease was of all ages.

1467
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:52,580
Most of the venues were 21 and over, correct?

1468
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:56,140
At certain times, like I remember going to the comedy warehouse

1469
01:41:56,140 --> 01:41:58,460
like in middle school and also to,

1470
01:41:58,940 --> 01:42:01,340
I talked a lot on the show about going to the Adventurers Club.

1471
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:02,860
I could not go alone, obviously.

1472
01:42:02,860 --> 01:42:04,440
I had to have an adult with me.

1473
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:08,300
But then there were certain ones, like I think, was mannequins the one?

1474
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:10,280
There were some of them where it was like, no kids.

1475
01:42:10,440 --> 01:42:11,800
Like this is an actual nightclub.

1476
01:42:12,140 --> 01:42:15,020
But I never felt weird walking around Pleasure Island.

1477
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:17,320
It was always pretty safe and sanitized.

1478
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:22,440
If the Adventurers Club were still open, you could and would go there alone.

1479
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:25,740
Yes, I would just not be in Hollywood.

1480
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:27,000
I would just work there.

1481
01:42:27,340 --> 01:42:28,560
You would be a performer.

1482
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:31,920
I would live there in the building and also work there.

1483
01:42:32,060 --> 01:42:34,240
Was there, is there a character that you could have,

1484
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:35,600
I'm not familiar with the Adventurers Club,

1485
01:42:35,620 --> 01:42:38,360
but if you had to pick a role to play.

1486
01:42:39,380 --> 01:42:42,160
I, there was, there was definitely an old man

1487
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:47,260
and there was definitely a jolly scientist

1488
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:51,120
that I probably could have played in my chubbier phases.

1489
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:53,680
So if you were auditioning, you could say,

1490
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:56,280
I also have a take on the jolly scientist?

1491
01:42:56,740 --> 01:43:02,320
Or if, I believe the general was an animatronic or a puppet of some kind.

1492
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:03,660
So not open to casting?

1493
01:43:03,660 --> 01:43:04,680
Probably not.

1494
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:06,760
But that would be ideal.

1495
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:07,000
That's too bad.

1496
01:43:07,020 --> 01:43:09,960
If you promised to stay there all the time and stand real still,

1497
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:12,360
maybe they would have hired you and replaced the robot.

1498
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:12,900
For sure.

1499
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:16,180
Just to not, just to lose those hydraulic oil fees.

1500
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:19,260
Yes, I cost much less than hydraulic oil.

1501
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:22,340
Your oil, your normal oil is cheaper than hydraulic oil.

1502
01:43:22,540 --> 01:43:24,540
Yeah, yeah. I'm a canola boy myself.

1503
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:30,880
Okay, so with gang activity and, you know, issues concerning Disney,

1504
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:35,620
they shut the place down, but obviously they kept the infrastructure of it

1505
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:38,620
and still that initial base of videopolis they built

1506
01:43:38,620 --> 01:43:40,040
is the Fantasyland Theater.

1507
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:44,400
It was a Beauty and the Beast show for many years

1508
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:49,660
and the spirit of Pocahontas with a talking grandmother willow,

1509
01:43:49,740 --> 01:43:51,780
a very impressive puppet.

1510
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:54,640
One of my favorite things as a young child,

1511
01:43:54,860 --> 01:44:01,220
the Plain Crazy show as part of the Disneyland afternoon avenue promotion,

1512
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:05,800
you know, with some great, I put it on last night,

1513
01:44:06,220 --> 01:44:09,360
a killer song between Fat Cat and Don Karnage.

1514
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:12,400
It was great to pair up a couple of the great villains.

1515
01:44:13,460 --> 01:44:16,480
But anyway, I said that weird, but I meant it.

1516
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,820
I am like, yeah, it's really good. It was cool to see them.

1517
01:44:19,780 --> 01:44:22,840
But so, yeah, that place is still there

1518
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:25,420
and they've done a good job of folding it into Fantasyland,

1519
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:29,000
but you know, you can't help but miss what once was

1520
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:34,000
and Disney's legit entry into cool youth culture.

1521
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:34,460
Yeah.

1522
01:44:34,860 --> 01:44:37,160
I think they did a good job. I don't know.

1523
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:40,960
I think it does sound like some people either you get a spectrum,

1524
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:43,460
some people say not as cool as the Knotts Clubs,

1525
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:45,400
not as permissive as the Knotts Clubs,

1526
01:44:45,700 --> 01:44:49,780
but other people seems like had a lot of great summers hanging out at videopolis.

1527
01:44:50,020 --> 01:44:53,520
We need to find some older us's that were there.

1528
01:44:54,460 --> 01:44:56,820
So let's maybe in the audience at this point,

1529
01:44:56,820 --> 01:45:00,720
there are a few older us's and they could tell us what it was like,

1530
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:03,160
like what was the cool, like what was the scene like,

1531
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:05,200
what would you go to both?

1532
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:07,860
Did you get much out of your friend who,

1533
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:11,960
like were there any weird details that he told you about the place?

1534
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:16,700
No, unfortunately I didn't press him at the time.

1535
01:45:17,260 --> 01:45:20,180
I had no idea what I was about to stumble onto.

1536
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:22,300
It was just something that was casually mentioned.

1537
01:45:22,860 --> 01:45:28,180
I've enjoyed watching the video photo montages on YouTube that people have made.

1538
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:33,540
Some people have saved like a hundred photos from the videopolis years

1539
01:45:33,540 --> 01:45:38,700
and have uploaded them to YouTube in the form of a slideshow with like 80s music.

1540
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:40,840
And I find that quite delightful to watch.

1541
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:46,520
That and the one hour unedited Take It to the Top video that's on YouTube

1542
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:51,320
do make you feel like you were there as much as possible.

1543
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:56,020
And you posted as part of your article from that long unedited video,

1544
01:45:56,020 --> 01:46:00,560
you posted like a set list of some of what was played at a random rate.

1545
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:01,100
A sample playlist, yeah.

1546
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,080
Which as we said had some great stuff.

1547
01:46:03,180 --> 01:46:08,020
You heard Pleasure Principle and David Bowie, Time Will Crawl and Depeche Mode.

1548
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:13,440
It's a cool list. Yeah, I don't know, legit stuff.

1549
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:16,840
I feel like they were actually letting these DJs play what they wanted

1550
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:22,840
as opposed to a DJ White Rabbit who probably had to have anything he wanted to play,

1551
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:25,260
had to probably be approved in their gold boxes.

1552
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:27,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1553
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:29,220
That's a real clear channel situation.

1554
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:33,840
I feel like this is probably one of the best examples of a thing we've talked about before

1555
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:37,740
where we do think about these parks as like an escape from the real world,

1556
01:46:37,740 --> 01:46:41,120
but they definitely exist in the context of their times.

1557
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:46,980
Just like the parks now exist in our current craft cocktail brew pub hell that we live in.

1558
01:46:47,740 --> 01:46:50,340
I don't know why I said it like that. I like it.

1559
01:46:50,980 --> 01:46:52,320
What's wrong with the craft cocktail?

1560
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:53,820
It is a little exhausting.

1561
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:58,380
As long as the thing I want to keep out of the parks is politics.

1562
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:02,900
As long as there aren't town halls being held at the fake town hall.

1563
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:04,980
Like Mr. Knotts used to have.

1564
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:07,000
Yeah, yeah, I don't want any pamphlets.

1565
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:10,260
Bring back the Freedom Center. That's what I say.

1566
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:16,680
But I would like to say also, you were very cool to put at that playlist

1567
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:19,900
to transcribe what you'd hear at a night of videobolus.

1568
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:23,420
I looked at a bunch of other comments and message board posts

1569
01:47:23,420 --> 01:47:26,340
to see the kind of thing that they played at videopolis.

1570
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:31,760
I made a playlist on Spotify that's almost two hours long.

1571
01:47:32,140 --> 01:47:33,760
That is what you might hear.

1572
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:37,900
Hopefully two hours that take you into the world of videopolis

1573
01:47:37,900 --> 01:47:41,060
and we'll tweet that out when the episode comes out.

1574
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:45,200
That's a little gift from me to you, the podcast, the ride fan.

1575
01:47:45,860 --> 01:47:48,680
Go disappear mentally into videopolis for a little while,

1576
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:50,940
as I would like to forever.

1577
01:47:51,260 --> 01:47:54,660
A lot of good stuff that we will have to combine our notes

1578
01:47:54,660 --> 01:47:57,000
and tweet out for this one, because the pictures

1579
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,460
and the marketing material is really cool.

1580
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:02,400
It can't be described by words.

1581
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:03,700
Yeah, it cannot.

1582
01:48:03,820 --> 01:48:08,240
Not really. We can't explain just how creepy Mickey looks in this pan.

1583
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:12,320
And the wonderful Everything is Terrible videos

1584
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:15,100
that you are responsible for.

1585
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:15,680
Thank you.

1586
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,620
Absolutely, yeah. We'll definitely tweet that out.

1587
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:20,580
And hey, well, I don't know, with all that being said,

1588
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:23,580
I think Doug Jones, you survived podcast the ride.

1589
01:48:23,860 --> 01:48:24,120
Awesome.

1590
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:26,200
Thanks so much for being here.

1591
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:29,080
Any closing thoughts or anything you'd like to promote

1592
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:30,440
or make people aware of?

1593
01:48:31,260 --> 01:48:35,820
Everything is Terrible on tour now,

1594
01:48:35,820 --> 01:48:38,540
the great Satan tour coming to a city to you.

1595
01:48:38,860 --> 01:48:40,840
You're the first guest with a tour to promote.

1596
01:48:41,020 --> 01:48:41,740
That's so exciting.

1597
01:48:42,740 --> 01:48:46,640
Drunk History season five, it's back in Better Than Ever.

1598
01:48:46,940 --> 01:48:48,700
Oh, yeah, you were in episode two,

1599
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:52,420
and you told a tale that Bob Odenkirk acts out.

1600
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:53,740
The tale of who?

1601
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:59,840
WC Minor, the murderer who wrote the Oxford English Dictionary.

1602
01:49:00,340 --> 01:49:00,520
Oh, right.

1603
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:03,740
No, but he was actually a good guy.

1604
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,480
You'll see when you watch it.

1605
01:49:06,580 --> 01:49:09,840
It's a great tale, very well and drunkenly told by you.

1606
01:49:10,180 --> 01:49:10,380
Thank you.

1607
01:49:11,020 --> 01:49:13,920
Yeah, please check out, look up Dante Fontana

1608
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:17,420
and everything you've done in the Disneyland remix world.

1609
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:22,160
You've made me aware of so much of the crazy, weird pop culture collisions

1610
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:23,300
that have happened at the parks.

1611
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:24,900
You've made me aware of a lot of cool stuff.

1612
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:27,780
That Pablo Cruz thing that I talked about for a while

1613
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:30,440
on the Pablo Cruz playing Worlds Away.

1614
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:34,740
I was in Reno, Nevada, like two years ago

1615
01:49:34,740 --> 01:49:36,760
and just wandering through the casinos,

1616
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:40,840
and it was like, tomorrow night, 10 p.m., Pablo Cruz.

1617
01:49:41,220 --> 01:49:43,620
They are still doing their thing.

1618
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:46,040
And Reno looks like Videopolis.

1619
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:49,580
That's a locked in time kind of place.

1620
01:49:50,140 --> 01:49:51,720
Thanks for not changing.

1621
01:49:52,120 --> 01:49:54,660
Thanks for maybe not having the option to change, Reno.

1622
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:56,260
Much appreciated.

1623
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:59,480
Well, fellas, closing thoughts.

1624
01:49:59,860 --> 01:50:01,640
We didn't rank the thing.

1625
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:03,040
I just want Videopolis sounds.

1626
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:06,280
The only thought I had is if you work in Disney,

1627
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:09,460
and I don't know if it would be Imagineering or Events or something,

1628
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:12,280
that Hollywood lot is open.

1629
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:17,400
Why is there not just a bunch of Videopolis retro nights at this point?

1630
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:21,580
I mean, it's just all you're doing is you want to suck money out of people like us,

1631
01:50:21,580 --> 01:50:24,420
and you've been doing it so well, let's suck even more money out of us.

1632
01:50:24,780 --> 01:50:29,020
Let's do the Videopolis nights.

1633
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:33,160
Because they do these ticketed events now, which are crazy, and you go,

1634
01:50:33,340 --> 01:50:34,800
well, why would I do that with the annual pass?

1635
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:36,940
But if it was Videopolis, how much?

1636
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:40,900
I want to say, I mean, my actual answer is like $70.

1637
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:46,200
It's not an incredible, I should say, all the money in the world.

1638
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:52,180
I could tell you, I just invested $150 in a reservation for the Saved By the Bell.

1639
01:50:52,460 --> 01:50:53,280
Oh, the max.

1640
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:57,680
Saved By the Max, which won't happen until

1641
01:50:58,160 --> 01:51:00,340
the end of 2018.

1642
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:03,460
That's the recreated restaurant?

1643
01:51:03,780 --> 01:51:07,320
Is that also going in next to a Mendocino Farms, right?

1644
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:11,000
I feel like I walked by the build. Is it in West Hollywood?

1645
01:51:11,300 --> 01:51:12,140
It is in West Hollywood.

1646
01:51:12,140 --> 01:51:13,880
I think it's next to the Boiling Crab.

1647
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:16,420
Yeah, it's next to the Target.

1648
01:51:17,060 --> 01:51:18,140
So then you're right.

1649
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:19,400
That's weird.

1650
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:22,440
So that's where the max is.

1651
01:51:22,440 --> 01:51:25,720
I think it's in between a BevMo and a Mendocino Farms sandwiches.

1652
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:28,440
Hey, maybe the rent was cheap there. That was the best they could do.

1653
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:31,060
Yeah, noted cheap rent spot West Hollywood.

1654
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:38,140
So yeah, Disney's listening. We will spend our hard-earned money on something like that.

1655
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:41,880
And looking down the line, I'm telling you, Dazzlers Videopolis.

1656
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:45,560
If we get those X-Men sorted out, it's right there in front of you.

1657
01:51:45,860 --> 01:51:50,280
It's really good. I don't, look, I can't start thinking too far ahead,

1658
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:53,260
but the idea of like somehow off of the podcast,

1659
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:57,100
you Jason being brought in to consult on Dazzlers Videopolis.

1660
01:51:57,340 --> 01:52:02,160
I mean, if you go back to her first appearance and the Hellfire Club is trying to interrupt it,

1661
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:05,300
and then the X-Men and Dazzlers stop them, and now it's,

1662
01:52:05,420 --> 01:52:06,980
now let's get back to the tunes.

1663
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:08,860
I mean, it's right to itself.

1664
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:12,580
Wait, so there's like stories unfolding between the songs and your vision?

1665
01:52:12,980 --> 01:52:15,440
Like maybe instead of some DJ who's married?

1666
01:52:16,020 --> 01:52:19,240
This might get cut, you know, as we start to look at budgets.

1667
01:52:19,260 --> 01:52:23,200
Like the Hellfire Club and their goons invading.

1668
01:52:23,380 --> 01:52:26,640
You mean like Sebastian Shaw will interrupt the dance party?

1669
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:31,000
Because Dazzlers first appearance was in the Hellfire Club Phoenix stories.

1670
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:31,460
Yes, of course.

1671
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:34,840
So yeah, but she was a cosmic singing superstar.

1672
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:37,460
Eventually, yeah. Well, no, that's Lila Chaney.

1673
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:38,660
What?

1674
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:39,940
Lila Chaney was the inner-factor.

1675
01:52:39,940 --> 01:52:40,940
Dazzler wasn't a singer?

1676
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:44,420
No, Dazzler was a singer, but on Earth. This is too complicated.

1677
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:47,900
You guys, you're speaking Japanese to me.

1678
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:50,380
I don't know what's being said, but I like the sound of it.

1679
01:52:50,380 --> 01:52:54,160
And whatever it all means, get it all into the park is what I say.

1680
01:52:54,160 --> 01:52:58,040
If you want to hear all about us arguing about Dazzler, tune into the after show.

1681
01:52:58,280 --> 01:52:59,940
Yeah, tune into the after show.

1682
01:53:00,020 --> 01:53:03,200
We're going to end up with a dense network at some point.

1683
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,380
On Podcast Network the Ride.

1684
01:53:05,780 --> 01:53:07,260
Podcast Network the Ride.

1685
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:12,520
I've been seeing more and more Powerline World Tour t-shirts at Disneyland lately.

1686
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:14,060
I did just see one two days ago.

1687
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:17,720
So why not do that? He could come back.

1688
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:18,520
That's good too.

1689
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:19,760
He would fit right in.

1690
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:25,280
Boy, you start with the Videopolis song, you close with Powerline.

1691
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:25,920
Eye to Eye.

1692
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:26,680
Eye to Eye.

1693
01:53:27,260 --> 01:53:28,020
That's a, oh man.

1694
01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:28,960
That really works.

1695
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:33,100
They play that at some club at Disneyland. Everybody loses their minds.

1696
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:36,240
Is there anything else? Are there any other cool Disney songs?

1697
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:38,140
If those are considered cool.

1698
01:53:38,580 --> 01:53:39,880
Eye to Eye is a cool song.

1699
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:44,460
Like if you get an EDM guy to remix some Annette Funicello songs.

1700
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:45,920
There is to have that.

1701
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:49,140
There's a techno version of I Can't Do The Sum from Babes in Toyland.

1702
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:50,940
Yeah, I want to hear that.

1703
01:53:51,160 --> 01:53:56,920
Where's that remix? Where's that plussed up Monkey's Uncle with the Beach Boys, Annette Funicello?

1704
01:53:57,600 --> 01:54:02,100
What's this? DJ Khaled has remixed, yeah, Monkey's Uncle?

1705
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:05,800
Featuring Mike Love.

1706
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:12,440
Oh yeah, he's still around. He's there. His vocals are heavily auto-tuned as it is.

1707
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:16,100
They would never do that because they would have to cut him in on the hat sales.

1708
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:22,220
Well, look, we're throwing a lot of great ideas out there.

1709
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:27,920
And they're there for the taking. We will not get upset if you use our ideas. We will just be delighted.

1710
01:54:28,100 --> 01:54:33,160
As long as we get to participate in them and enjoy them and waste our money experiencing them.

1711
01:54:33,740 --> 01:54:41,800
So yes, all that. And if you can help us achieve these dreams, then tweet at us at Podcast The Ride.

1712
01:54:42,180 --> 01:54:48,120
Hit us up on Instagram at Podcast The Ride. Email us at PodcastTheRide at Gmail.com.

1713
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:53,140
Yeah, if you're an Imagineer and you want to go off the record, just DM or email and be like,

1714
01:54:53,180 --> 01:54:56,040
here's what's going on and here's what I'm going to try to give Videopolis back.

1715
01:54:56,280 --> 01:55:00,900
And we'll work some sort of shadow campaign with you to get this thing back.

1716
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:02,800
DMs are open, folks. DMs are open on the show account.

1717
01:55:03,180 --> 01:55:05,840
And for me. And all my personal account.

1718
01:55:06,700 --> 01:55:14,940
For dating purposes. Well, we have a chance here to create the place to take dates and then you get to go there.

1719
01:55:15,940 --> 01:55:17,360
I'm thinking several steps ahead.

1720
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:17,900
That's great.
