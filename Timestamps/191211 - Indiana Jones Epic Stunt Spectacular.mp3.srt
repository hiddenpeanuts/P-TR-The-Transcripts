1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,080
Hi, welcome to Podcast the Ride, the Second Gate.

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,120
I'm Jason Sheridan and I'm here today

4
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,680
where we're recording second unit,

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,400
podcast footage for Podcast the Ride.

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,320
Here with Scott Gardner.

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,280
Hey, what's going on everybody?

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,920
Yeah, pleased to be here standing in

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,600
for the great Harrison Ford.

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,760
And Mike Carlson.

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,680
Hey, yeah, I'm here too.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,160
Standing in for Karen Allen.

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,200
Standing in for great Karen Allen.

14
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,080
We're talking about the-

15
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,840
My pronunciation is bad today.

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,400
The Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular.

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,240
Yeah.

18
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,960
A historical stunt show.

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,000
Well, long running,

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,920
one of the largest running shows in America.

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,320
30 years running.

22
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,080
Like Cats or Phantom of the Opera.

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,920
Yeah.

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,740
Or The Simpsons.

25
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,880
Or The Simpsons, yes.

26
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,320
It's much like The Simpsons.

27
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,080
It's been on since 19, been going since 1989

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,200
and there's been no significant change or drop in quality.

29
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,080
That's right.

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,360
Yeah, exactly the same.

31
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,520
Stunned silence.

32
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,920
Stunned silence.

33
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,600
Okay, so I saw this when we were in Orlando recently.

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,920
I was the only one who went and watched this show.

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,760
Yeah, we did.

36
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,840
Yeah, we bailed on it.

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,320
I saw it a few years ago.

38
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,400
You saw it a few years ago.

39
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,600
I gotta say, you say that jokingly about The Simpsons,

40
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,760
I thought the show was running great.

41
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,400
Yeah, you can attest.

42
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,480
Yeah, I've only seen videos.

43
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,600
Yeah, all of those stunts still look good.

44
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,680
The audience still fired up for it.

45
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,120
The audience still into it.

46
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,640
A large audience.

47
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,120
This amphitheater holds over 2,000 people.

48
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,400
This is a people leader.

49
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,240
Geez.

50
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,680
And this, yeah, as we have said,

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,760
this has been running since 1989.

52
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,560
It opened three months after then

53
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,640
Disney MGM Studios opened.

54
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,720
Or was it an opening day?

55
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,760
It wasn't an opening day.

56
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,880
It opened a little after.

57
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,440
And Lord knows they needed attractions at the time

58
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,440
because there was really just a great movie ride

59
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,480
and a two hour studio tour experience.

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,120
Their tram thing with Catastrophe Canyon.

61
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,960
Yeah.

62
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,160
But yeah, that's when it opened,

63
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,280
you would pass by the New York backlot sets

64
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,120
but not walk around in it.

65
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,120
So they had to do a lot of quick plugs to fill capacity.

66
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,440
Or to make it seem like there was more stuff there,

67
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,280
like that Honey Has Shrunk the Kids Playland.

68
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,120
Yeah.

69
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,440
This wasn't a last minute ad, but it just opened late.

70
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,280
It opened late.

71
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,960
And it is like, I mean, I,

72
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,440
reading more about it and watching it,

73
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,120
it is kind of incredible that they replicate

74
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,640
the big sequences from this movie,

75
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,840
the big stunts from the movie in a linear,

76
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,160
like it makes sense.

77
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,320
Like when they were filming these stunts in a movie,

78
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,480
they were probably shooting them

79
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480
in all crazy kinds of orders.

80
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,480
And you have to have so much safety.

81
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,840
And all of this runs now for 30 years,

82
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,560
multiple times a day.

83
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,120
Partially run by,

84
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,120
I said historical, this was the first stunt show

85
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,720
to use what's called a programmable logic controller.

86
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,640
So to be run by computers.

87
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,520
And logic controllers are originally used

88
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,600
for like manufacturing,

89
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,600
where you need to be able to repeat the same processes

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,160
again and again and again with like fire going

91
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,280
or harsh conditions.

92
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,720
So like the computers are what's called like rugged

93
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,040
or ruggedized.

94
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,880
Ruggedized.

95
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,920
Ruggedized is a logistical term

96
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,120
for a computer specifically designed to operate reliably

97
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,040
in harsh usage environments and conditions.

98
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,440
And in 30 years, the computer hasn't gotten smart

99
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,520
and gone rogue and guided people off the ladder

100
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,680
to their death.

101
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,120
No, no.

102
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,640
Not even one, not even one time did it go rogue.

103
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,560
No, there has been one death associated with this show.

104
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,400
Oh no.

105
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,280
But it was. Not the computers.

106
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,120
Not ruggedized.

107
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,080
It was a simple, it was a like normal like tuck and roll.

108
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,800
It's like when the one of the bad guys

109
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,320
like jumps over another guy,

110
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,480
he just didn't land the tuck and roll.

111
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,400
Oh. Right.

112
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,520
And passed away.

113
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,560
The same summer as the monorail death.

114
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,720
And another actor passed away that summer too,

115
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,200
like hit his head on the wall

116
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,720
at the Jack Sparrow pirate training show.

117
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,560
Jesus.

118
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,400
I didn't even know about that show.

119
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,240
It was like a cursed summer.

120
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,040
Yeah, 2009 was a rough summer.

121
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,600
Yeah, cause this is a.

122
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,280
It was also the rise of that Barack Hussein Obama.

123
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,120
Oh yeah.

124
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,960
Scott, not here.

125
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,800
Not now.

126
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,640
Not even on the second gate.

127
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,480
I can say what I want.

128
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,880
Don't limit my first speech.

129
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,160
Then you're on the third gate that we secretly do

130
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,760
that only real listeners know about.

131
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,600
Sure.

132
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,440
That's where you can.

133
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,360
We only promote it, QAnon.com slash podcast.

134
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,960
Where do you, what's the source of QAnon?

135
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,800
Jason would know.

136
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,480
Is it a website or is it a.

137
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,360
Well, it's called the truth, Scott.

138
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,600
It comes from Lady Liberty herself.

139
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,720
That is QAnon.

140
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,560
In association.

141
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,380
Where do you find it?

142
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,440
Is it a Reddit or is it its own?

143
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,240
Is there a website that is QAnon.com?

144
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,080
I don't know the answer to that.

145
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,240
It's, they are Legion.

146
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,080
I know that.

147
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,440
I know JFK Jr. is still alive

148
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,840
and a lot of the source of information.

149
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,960
Oh, he's giving the sources down the QAnon?

150
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,280
Well, you know, do your research.

151
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,840
It's all out there.

152
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,840
So the way I can't go to a website,

153
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,600
I have to meet JFK Jr.

154
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,800
They're starting, I'm sure they're starting spots,

155
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,080
but real heads got to dig, you know.

156
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,080
I can't just sign up like a mailing list on a.

157
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,920
Well.

158
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,400
We'll explore it on the third gate,

159
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,840
the secret Patreon we do on the dark web

160
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,400
that only real listeners know about.

161
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,200
And then where we say what we really.

162
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,040
That's right.

163
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,400
It's an all right podcast.

164
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,280
Yeah.

165
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,160
We storm area 51 like Indiana Jones.

166
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,000
Yeah.

167
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,200
Kingdom of the crystal skull.

168
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,040
Mm-hmm.

169
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,880
We have.

170
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,760
Which we've learned on the third gate,

171
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,720
we realized that it's all of it's real.

172
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,040
That's what's, people didn't like the movie

173
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,760
cause they didn't realize it was depictions of real events.

174
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,600
Yeah.

175
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,440
Mm-hmm.

176
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,600
But it's real, yeah.

177
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,520
People saw that refrigerator flying through the air.

178
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,840
And we did learn the lesson.

179
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,960
There's photographs in the background.

180
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,880
We learned the lesson of the movie

181
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,840
that knowledge was their treasure.

182
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,840
That's what the big revelation is at the end.

183
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,480
That's the lesson of most movies.

184
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,320
Mm-hmm.

185
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,680
Knowledge, knowledge was their treasure.

186
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,520
Yeah.

187
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,240
Knowledge, knowledge was their treasure.

188
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,520
Yeah.

189
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,600
Barely, barely awake in the whole fourth movie.

190
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,440
Great.

191
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,680
If you've ever also seen the,

192
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,120
I think it's the red letter media of crystal skull.

193
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,040
I'm sure we talked about this in the other episode

194
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,480
where there's a take where he as either go,

195
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,720
oh, you're a teacher asks Shia LaBeouf.

196
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,480
And he goes part-time.

197
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,880
And he says it in a way as if it's like a question.

198
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,960
And in the trailer, he goes part-time.

199
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,280
He does it. Part-time.

200
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,120
Like normal.

201
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,960
A lot of gusto.

202
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,800
It's great. Normally.

203
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,080
And then in the film, part-time.

204
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,200
Part-time. Part-time.

205
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,000
Part-time. Part-time.

206
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,640
It's such a bad take.

207
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,960
No one knows why it's in there.

208
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,240
It's one of my favorite things to just watch

209
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,800
over and over again is that take of him just going part-time.

210
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,960
Like it's very strange.

211
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,080
Anyway. Yeah.

212
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,880
They should have hired one of these stunt actors

213
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,680
to play Indiana Jones in the actual film.

214
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,520
Yeah. I mean.

215
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,240
It probably would have been more enthusiastic.

216
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,440
With the James Dean technology now,

217
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,320
you can have probably a much more energetic actor

218
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,000
and then just paste Harrison Ford's head on it.

219
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,360
James Dean.

220
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,080
Well, okay. So James Dean will play Indiana Jones.

221
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,920
Yes.

222
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,000
And then you'll put Harrison Ford

223
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,040
over the James Dean CGI face.

224
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,160
Or will James Dean be Mutt Williams?

225
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,120
I was gonna say James Dean would be better as Mutt Williams.

226
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,080
That might have been where CGI James Dean was developed

227
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,040
to begin with was as the, like they only hired Shia

228
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,200
because they had to.

229
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,040
Right.

230
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,880
Because the technology wasn't ready yet.

231
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,520
So maybe there'll be a re-release of Crystal Skull

232
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,400
with James Dean instead of Shia.

233
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,880
Just placed over his face, placed over Shia's.

234
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,760
Not to jump too far ahead of ourselves,

235
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,040
but there is a rumor that in 2020, this show will go down.

236
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,200
The Epic Stunt Spectacular will go down

237
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,800
and be changed a little.

238
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,040
Cause it really hasn't changed much in 30 years.

239
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,880
Right.

240
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,480
There's a little thing that's changed in it

241
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,480
and it will go down and then come back

242
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,560
a little different in 2021, which would align it

243
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,000
with Disney's 50th anniversary celebration

244
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and the current planned release of Indie 5.

245
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,240
Which is when?

246
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,880
2021, summer 2021.

247
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,160
They've been pushing that thing back.

248
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,560
Have they done anything?

249
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,320
There's been many different versions.

250
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,240
I think there's been like five different big drafts

251
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,680
by big writers.

252
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,520
One by one of the, the Kasdan boy who wrote Solo.

253
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,920
The Kasdan boy.

254
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,760
The Kasdan boy.

255
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,600
I believe I called him once.

256
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,960
Don LaScreete, the Kasdan boy.

257
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,160
Like this is us guy was writing one.

258
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,840
Oh, Danny Collins.

259
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,600
He wrote my, of course we all know Al Pacino's Danny Collins.

260
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,440
Oh yes.

261
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,240
Yeah, hotcha.

262
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,080
So this.

263
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,640
Kieva Goldsman probably wrote one.

264
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,640
Maybe.

265
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,480
I think everyone's taking a swing.

266
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,600
I think everyone's taking a.

267
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,960
I don't know if that, I feel like they were like,

268
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,240
every time anyone asks, like Frank Marshall's like,

269
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,520
oh, look, it's, yeah, we're doing good.

270
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,480
Like he just gives sort of an answer.

271
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,320
So who knows?

272
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,160
Who knows if it will make it?

273
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,520
Harrison Ford is 78 years old, I believe.

274
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,160
I was trying to, you know what?

275
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,600
I'm remembering now, I was trying to think of,

276
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,280
cause I was listening off to some friends,

277
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,120
the weird action figures you've given me

278
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,640
for birthdays over the years.

279
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,480
Yes.

280
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,560
And one of them was Mutt Williams.

281
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,760
Yes, I've given you a Mutt Williams toy.

282
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,160
Todd McFarlane, the comic book artist.

283
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,160
Yeah, of him.

284
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,600
It's a toy of him made by his toy company.

285
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
It was a, you know, like mail in for it.

286
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Mail in, yeah, it was a limited run.

287
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,720
Specifically the character he plays

288
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,480
in the Spawn movie, the bum.

289
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,200
So it's Todd the bum.

290
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,480
No, isn't Todd the artist?

291
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,280
But okay, wait, but is he dressed as a bum?

292
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,240
He might, he's dressed in like 90s, like street wear.

293
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,120
Like 90s.

294
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,720
I think he's the bum,

295
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,920
but maybe he's called Todd the artist on the toy.

296
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,360
And the third is this character Zeb Coulter,

297
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,360
who was an unhinged old man manager character from WWE,

298
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,280
who would come out waving a don't tread on me flag.

299
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,080
But he had like a vest and a big beard.

300
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,640
He had a vest and a big beard.

301
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,480
Yeah.

302
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,760
And his real name is Dutch Mantel.

303
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,600
Dutch Mantel, yeah.

304
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,440
Is that right?

305
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,280
He is like a wrestling booker and stuff,

306
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,080
but he's a squirrely old man.

307
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,240
Oh yeah, he's a crazy guy.

308
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,880
On stage and in real life.

309
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,880
Who's winning in a fight between those three action figures?

310
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,440
Probably Mutt, cause he's got a giant sword.

311
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,920
He's younger too.

312
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,320
But Dirty Dutch, they used to call him Dirty Dutch.

313
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,360
That's not a thing I made up.

314
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,400
He is a, he's got some skills too.

315
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,000
He's just an older fella at this point,

316
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,680
but he could probably still go.

317
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,520
Yeah.

318
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,360
That's probably right.

319
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,240
Although Todd, who knows?

320
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,640
Todd's probably jacked.

321
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,160
Todd McFarland's probably jacked, who knows?

322
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,640
He's in good shape.

323
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,600
Can he croon like the other McFarland?

324
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,400
Can anyone croon like the other McFarland?

325
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,440
I know the answer to that.

326
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,560
Yeah, the answer's fuck no.

327
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,520
Don't even ask that question.

328
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,240
So Indiana Jones Epic stunt spectacular.

329
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,320
Would you guys see this a lot when you go down to floor?

330
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,440
This was like a must do for my family.

331
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,280
Yes.

332
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,120
Like everyone agreed on this.

333
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,960
I battled with it very much.

334
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,800
Yeah, I liked it.

335
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,680
I wasn't crazy into it.

336
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,080
I think honestly, cause the shows

337
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,200
would stress me out a little bit.

338
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,840
But it wasn't like, I saw it and I liked it,

339
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,160
but every stunt spectacular, I kind of thought was real.

340
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,920
I kind of thought that we were all in

341
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,440
like a little bit of danger.

342
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,280
I'm not going to lie though, when I saw it a few weeks ago,

343
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,920
I was like, are they gonna get out of that airplane in time?

344
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,720
Even though I know like everything is going

345
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
exactly how it is supposed to.

346
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,480
And it has to do that six to eight times a day.

347
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,320
Right, yeah.

348
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,040
You hadn't learned about ruggedized yet.

349
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,600
I hadn't learned about ruggedized.

350
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,840
You didn't know everything was safe.

351
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,480
I did kind of know and confirmed it that with the logic,

352
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,960
the logic computer, some of the big sequences,

353
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,640
the actors are queuing themselves.

354
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,480
Like after Indy comes down through the ceiling

355
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,000
at the beginning and he goes through the,

356
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,600
I believe it's called the pungy minefield,

357
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,520
the spikes that come out of the ground.

358
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,520
There's pressure points that next to each spike

359
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,360
and there's a path.

360
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,200
They step on, right?

361
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,040
And they step on.

362
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,520
That makes it come out.

363
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,360
So.

364
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,720
Interesting.

365
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
Which is interesting to think about like a guy,

366
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,720
a stunt man has to hit that exactly right

367
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,040
and then pretend to be startled, has to react to it

368
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,760
and do it in the right sequence for it to make sense

369
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,320
in the Florida heat with a leather jacket on.

370
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,720
I didn't even wanna sit and watch that in the floor

371
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,040
in the heat, let alone do it.

372
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,120
And then there's like, he has to swing

373
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,640
through the booby trap arms that come down,

374
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,640
climb up to get the fertility idol

375
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,000
and then the giant boulder comes out,

376
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,720
which does weigh 500 pounds.

377
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,720
Wow.

378
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,440
Yeah, that's why, like that is what we,

379
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,640
yeah, that's why as a kid,

380
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,160
it wasn't like my most favorite thing

381
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,240
is cause all of that, what you just described,

382
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,400
that sequence really had me worried.

383
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,360
But I loved those movies as a kid.

384
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,880
Like I loved Raiders.

385
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,080
I'll pose this also.

386
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,080
Was there any event in your childhood

387
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,000
that didn't make you very worried?

388
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,840
That's an excellent question.

389
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,880
Oh, it's a good question.

390
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,840
I mean, maybe sitting and watching.

391
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,720
No, TV would stress me out, I guess too, a little bit.

392
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,280
But if it was like the Ninja Turtles,

393
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,800
I knew they were gonna take care of business.

394
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,320
So I think I was confident in their abilities,

395
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,280
but they might've been the only team I was comfortable,

396
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,360
like I knew they would do it,

397
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,200
but I wasn't so sure.

398
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,040
You were just meeting a group of characters

399
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,160
for the first time. Yeah, I like,

400
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,880
the Cowboys of Mumaesa,

401
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,360
I didn't know if they could pull it off every time.

402
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,440
Like that was another cartoon that I liked.

403
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,200
And you were worried about

404
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,560
that the cartoon characters would perish?

405
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,400
A little bit.

406
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,000
I mean, there have been comics I read.

407
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,800
I've probably talked about this on the show before.

408
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,280
There was a comic, a Ninja Turtle comic,

409
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,880
where all of a sudden they killed off

410
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,000
nine of the characters,

411
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
and it had not been a comic where that happened.

412
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,560
And nothing was ever gonna be the same in my brain,

413
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,520
as far as like fiction is concerned,

414
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,840
where I didn't even know they could do that.

415
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,400
Like I didn't know I could see these cartoon characters

416
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,200
have something bad happen to them.

417
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,560
So I do feel like that changed me.

418
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,360
I think I knew on TV- Did you like mourn it?

419
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,400
Did you like-

420
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,080
I don't, did I like sit and- Dress in black that day?

421
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,680
I don't think I knew how to do it.

422
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,000
I don't think I knew how to mourn properly.

423
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,240
We were in the generation that saw the death of Superman.

424
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
That's true.

425
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,160
I didn't read this death of Superman though.

426
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,880
In the 90s. It affected me.

427
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,680
Were you too afraid to read it?

428
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,520
I, it's a good question.

429
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,200
I don't think I was actually reading

430
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,160
superhero comics at that point.

431
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,440
What's that, 91?

432
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,720
91, yeah, around that.

433
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,440
I think I read X-Men in 92 or 93

434
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,040
and that starts my superhero thing.

435
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,040
Yeah, kind of the same.

436
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,440
I was also like not a big DC kid.

437
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,200
And also I was less DC.

438
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
I loved Batman, but I was a Marvel.

439
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,760
I started Marvel.

440
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,600
I was, I was going, I would see it though.

441
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,680
Cause I'd go in the comic store to buy Ninja Turtles

442
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,680
and Sonic. I read Sonic comics.

443
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,160
And I remember seeing all of it.

444
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,720
And it very, that image is very disturbing to me too.

445
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,320
Cause I was six years old and Superman's dead.

446
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,120
And it's like,

447
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,920
I think I remember that freaking me out.

448
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,760
Yeah.

449
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,840
Anyway, I'm scared.

450
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,880
The most scaring image of your childhood.

451
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,120
So scar, a death of a drawing.

452
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,520
The death of a drawing.

453
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,600
I mean, I think another big thing of like

454
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,160
that ratchets up the tension at the show

455
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,120
is they are blasting the John Williams score.

456
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,960
Yeah, yeah.

457
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,200
In conjunction with like,

458
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,040
like when they were doing these stunts,

459
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,360
filming the actual movie,

460
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,080
they weren't blasting the John Williams score.

461
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:21,080
No, this is a sort of a logistical error

462
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,480
in the idea that you're watching the making of a movie.

463
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,960
Because yeah, that's as implied by your intro, Jason,

464
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,040
if you haven't seen this show,

465
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,280
it's not like Waterworld where you're just in the world

466
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,640
of modern worlds.

467
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,920
You are, it's the construct,

468
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,800
the thing before that Miami Vice had

469
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,240
where there were filming scenes and it's cut and reset.

470
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
And we're gonna, we're doing a scene and stunt guys

471
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,680
and blah.

472
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,000
So what was my point with all that?

473
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,800
It's, oh yeah, you're there watching the filming

474
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,120
of second unit Indiana Jones scenes

475
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,240
and they explain how this guy's supposed to be Harrison Ford

476
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,720
and Harrison Ford wouldn't really do the stunts,

477
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,000
but they would not be playing the score of the film.

478
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,280
Yes, or doing it in the order.

479
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,560
And part of that framing is to cover

480
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,240
the major set changes.

481
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,400
There's a giant multi-ton movable temple set

482
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,960
they need to move out of the way

483
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,480
so they can move the streets of Cairo in

484
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,760
and then move that back a little

485
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,680
so they can move a Nazi airfield in.

486
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,480
It's crazy how in every performance,

487
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,080
I mean, the stunts are obviously what you should be impressed

488
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,920
by happening over and over again every day,

489
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,280
but I'm like, they have to just move these giants,

490
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,360
hit these back and forth constantly over and over again,

491
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,120
maybe like eight, 10 times a day.

492
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,240
And I, so there's a guy, there's an account on YouTube

493
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,400
I think it's called Wicket Lenzer.

494
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,800
And it's a guy who was for in 94 and 95 was Indiana Jones

495
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,840
and had a lot of home movies.

496
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,000
And he, I watched this five part thing

497
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,480
and he explains how a lot of stuff is done.

498
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,080
For one thing, there's mats everywhere that you cannot see.

499
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,880
So when people take pratfalls or fall off buildings,

500
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,120
they're landing on a mat.

501
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,520
The, I thought this was interesting.

502
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,960
I never knew how they did this.

503
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,520
When he goes to swap out the fertility idol

504
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,040
that activates the boulder,

505
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,560
there's two sets of lights that he can see in,

506
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,840
the actor playing Indy can see in their like eye lines.

507
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,920
And when they go off, that means the boulder

508
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,800
has been launched and it launches at 14 miles an hour.

509
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,640
Whoa.

510
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,280
And you just have to start running

511
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,280
and there's a trap with a mat.

512
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,800
You just have to fall flat.

513
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,640
Right.

514
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,520
And he said, he, you do, people do mess up sometimes

515
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,160
and the boulder scrapes the skin off his top

516
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,360
of his nose once.

517
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,960
And then another time he accidentally landed

518
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,840
on the fertility idol and broke his nose.

519
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,680
Oh my God.

520
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,600
Oh my God.

521
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,320
And they had, I guess they have other actors on standby,

522
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,240
just in case something happens.

523
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,560
There's always another Indy,

524
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,400
or they can like get somebody ready.

525
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,240
He said they finished the show.

526
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,360
They were able to get another Indy in to finish the show.

527
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,520
I guess at that point, that's his disappearance.

528
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,680
You just, after he couldn't like pop up and say,

529
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,440
I'm fine everyone, cause he's not.

530
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,280
Right.

531
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,120
Yes.

532
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,960
Besides that.

533
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,280
There is, he said there is at some,

534
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,640
I think it's before the airfield sequence.

535
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,640
All of the actors get to take a break

536
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,080
and have a glass of water as they move everything

537
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,960
out of the way.

538
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,800
Oh, okay.

539
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,640
Oh yeah, yeah.

540
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,280
Cause there is not like cast present for all of that.

541
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,600
Oh, so that's by design to sort of give them a breather.

542
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,440
Sure.

543
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,440
Interesting.

544
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,960
I saw a video of the, like a,

545
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,240
there was a general interesting special

546
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,680
of the making of the MGM, all of the MGM studios.

547
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,320
And there's a big section devoted to the Indiana Jones show.

548
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,680
And they, they show like a test in a backstage area

549
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,920
of the Boulder as just like a, it's just the basics.

550
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,640
Like it's just the big wire path that it's on

551
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,360
and none of the rock work around it.

552
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,600
It was really crazy to see.

553
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,000
It's just this huge, big marble on metal pipes essentially.

554
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,720
But whoever the show designer is talking about how

555
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,560
we knew we wanted to do a Boulder thing,

556
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,240
but how are we going to do it?

557
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,560
And then we overthought and overthought.

558
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,640
And then just like, I think it's just,

559
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,440
let me just make a Boulder.

560
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,600
I think it's, I think it's gravity is what we're going to do.

561
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,080
Because like, you know, hey, like things are crazy

562
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,000
to pull off in theme parks, but gravity works.

563
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,520
So let's just have a big Boulder

564
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,000
and we unleash it down a ramp and that's how it goes.

565
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,640
And then it's not, I like that it's not even like,

566
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,080
he has to go through some trap door.

567
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,800
There's some real hidden, you know, way that he ducks.

568
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,840
He just, he just drops right under it.

569
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,120
Lie as flat as you can.

570
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,080
They said, if you fuck it up, just lie as flat as you can.

571
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,240
Cause there is a little bit of clearance.

572
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,000
And you're so in now in this,

573
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
you're watching a scene where Indiana Jones is crushed.

574
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,800
I suppose, unless we find out more information later.

575
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,040
I mean, they don't really connect the dots

576
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,680
of the plot for you in this and how he ends up then in Cairo.

577
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,880
But yeah, unlike the film, he goes,

578
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,520
are we watching like some alternate ending

579
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,280
where he is just, his bones are flattened.

580
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,920
He's just crushed like Indiana Jones.

581
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,800
What happens in the movie?

582
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,760
Doesn't he duck down?

583
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,880
Doesn't he find a divot?

584
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,920
Doesn't he just fall and then pops back up?

585
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,360
Yeah, it does seem like it's a boulder place.

586
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,200
I think that is.

587
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,120
For something I've seen so many times, why can't I remember?

588
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,280
It's not quite like a memory.

589
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,240
It just feels like he just like ducks out of frame.

590
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,760
Because there's also, you forget, this is like a cold open.

591
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,040
And then there's his buddy.

592
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,760
Remember his buddy was like, throw me the idol,

593
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,840
throw me the idol.

594
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,840
And then the buddy eats it really quick.

595
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,040
He betrays Indy.

596
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,120
Alfred Molina, correct?

597
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,960
Yeah, yeah.

598
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,800
Oh yeah.

599
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,400
Wow, a young Alfred Molina.

600
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,040
And then Indy has to get out of the, does get out,

601
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,000
find his buddy dead, and then gets back into the plane

602
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
with Doc and takes off and gets out of there.

603
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,840
So yeah, they didn't want to portray all that live.

604
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,760
So they just crushed him.

605
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,600
Yeah, they just crushed him.

606
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,440
Indy's dead.

607
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,360
I'm looking at the clip here.

608
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,720
Yeah, there's Molina.

609
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,880
This is the big thing that's rumored,

610
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,320
is that they're gonna take away that framing sequence

611
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,720
of it being the second unit.

612
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,800
Oh really?

613
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,640
Okay.

614
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,880
And take that away.

615
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,840
But that said, that does let them get a few audience members

616
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
to play extras in the crowd.

617
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,680
Yes.

618
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,680
And it lets them have that audience plant

619
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,600
who the Karen Allen stunt double beats the shit out of.

620
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,280
And he does a lot of funny pratfalls.

621
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,120
Yeah, yes.

622
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,320
That is all, and it tricked me re-watching the show.

623
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
I forgot there was that construct.

624
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,520
There's a big group of extras and then one guy volunteers

625
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,680
and is particularly too confident

626
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,840
and telling people in the audience,

627
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,920
take a picture of me and not playing it safe.

628
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,680
And then he eats it and we realize he was a stunt man

629
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,520
the entire time.

630
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,320
Yes, and that joke still works 30 years in.

631
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,520
People still loved it 30 years in.

632
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,360
And I like it too.

633
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,200
I mean, I think it's really fun.

634
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,280
I totally forgot, yeah, it lured me in.

635
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,080
Now, losing that construct of we're filming a movie,

636
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,360
I think is probably the right move

637
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,440
and as all of the studios, parks, Disney,

638
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,520
and Universal move away from we're a real studio.

639
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,200
It makes sense.

640
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,520
Just be immersed in the world of it.

641
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,920
But I think it's probably also a good move

642
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,920
because if I'm buying into that they are filming

643
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,800
like stunt sequences, second unit sequences

644
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,600
meant to be Harrison Ford and Karen Allen,

645
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,240
when are they gonna be done?

646
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,200
It's been 30 years.

647
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,080
Raiders of the Lost Ark came out eight years prior to that.

648
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,280
What nightmare are these people trapped in

649
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,640
where nearly 40 years after the fact

650
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,440
they are still filming these scenes

651
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,520
over and over again every day?

652
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,320
When will this ever, what Kubrick nightmare are they in?

653
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,640
It's like the people who were shooting Titanic,

654
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,920
they must've felt like when they were just like

655
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,600
on that production first, it was going over budget,

656
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,320
so many over days, James Cameron was dumping

657
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,480
just the lights into the water to get rid of them.

658
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,880
That's a famous story, I think, or somebody told me that.

659
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,560
There's something where he's like,

660
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,280
just like I'll do it, I'll light it.

661
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,680
He's just grabbing lights and putting them up himself.

662
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,360
But I feel like they were like, all right,

663
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,640
we're done here, just dump the lights in the water.

664
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,480
It's like crazy.

665
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,280
They just left to like, there's rusting in the ocean?

666
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,640
Even though he loves the sea,

667
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,160
he supposedly loves the sea, maybe that's, you know.

668
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,520
He polluted, he just took a light?

669
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,800
There's some crazy stories,

670
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,960
who knows if they're true or not,

671
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,720
about just the big epic mess that Titanic was.

672
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,200
So it must've felt like this,

673
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,440
where they're just like every day you're still on this movie

674
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,560
and you can't believe it's still going.

675
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:28,560
Some future deep sea diver will unearth the fake Titanic

676
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,080
and all of the lights that were just left behind.

677
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,080
He'll just do it himself.

678
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,480
In the submarine.

679
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,920
But people who worked on it say,

680
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,440
hey, it feels like I haven't worked a day in my life.

681
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,160
Some people have worked on, there was-

682
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,000
On the Indy Stunt Show.

683
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,840
On the Indy Stunt Show.

684
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,400
Oh, okay, I was gonna say.

685
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,000
Everyone who worked on Titanic, I think, they worked.

686
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,840
They were working.

687
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,920
That's where it's funny watching,

688
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,280
his supplemental material for anything,

689
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,200
but especially the world of Pandora comes to life,

690
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,320
an animal kingdom.

691
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,880
I couldn't believe when they showed it to me.

692
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,960
It's like I was in the movie and then you imagine him

693
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,280
just like, just fucking do it.

694
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,800
I don't give a shit if you're sick.

695
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,440
Fucking get in the water, you fuck.

696
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,520
Like, knowing what a monster he for sure has been.

697
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,960
Zero degrees, I don't fucking care.

698
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,480
He projects an image of so calm and composed

699
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,880
in those special features.

700
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,160
Yeah, he always seems just so, yeah,

701
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,520
just mellow and with it.

702
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,760
He must really clamp down on there being any actual video

703
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,600
of the real James Cameron.

704
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,440
Oh, yeah.

705
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,720
Yeah.

706
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,480
Oh, with the cell phone technology now,

707
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,960
he must have the stand-up comedian bags

708
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,000
that you have to put your phone in when you get on set.

709
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,120
So there's no screaming.

710
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,960
I mean, maybe he's-

711
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,780
I mean, those bags are important.

712
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,360
Comedy can be dangerous.

713
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,920
Mm. You know?

714
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,760
You're right.

715
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,600
Can't let it get out there.

716
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,680
Dangerous as a stunt show.

717
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,520
Unfiltered.

718
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,360
But yes, but these people, the stunt performers

719
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,880
have a lot of fun on this thing.

720
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,720
Yeah.

721
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,920
Yeah, it seems like you maybe watch the same,

722
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,160
like there's a good recently done video of, you know,

723
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,880
showing what it's like for these folks.

724
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,040
Oh, on the Parks blog.

725
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,880
Yeah, and the guy showing at it like,

726
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,480
well, we don't even fake the punch.

727
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,040
Like, you have to actually do it.

728
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,520
So I'll just tighten my stomach

729
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,040
so just actually go for it.

730
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,920
Yeah.

731
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,560
So the punches are real in some cases.

732
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,400
Mm-hmm.

733
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,640
Now, I thought it was interesting,

734
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,080
and again, they fooled me.

735
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,200
Like, the ladders and the poles

736
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,000
that people are flying through the air on

737
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,600
have buttons on them.

738
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,400
Like, that's a machine.

739
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,480
Like, so it falls the same way every time.

740
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,120
So it can be repeated every time.

741
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,160
Oh, so when the ladder falls.

742
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,960
So when the ladder falls on the top rung,

743
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,960
there's a button that lets the guy,

744
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,200
like when he wants to go back, releases it,

745
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,440
and then comes back forward

746
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,480
because they have to do the wobbly ladder.

747
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,840
And then, I mean.

748
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,240
Okay, that's kind of probably the most iconic stunt

749
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,280
of the second act of it, the Cairo sequence,

750
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,000
where he's like fending off, what would you call it?

751
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,840
Some street ruffian, I don't know.

752
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,680
Yeah, bad guys.

753
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,520
A bad guy.

754
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,600
Let's just say bad guys.

755
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,440
Uh-huh.

756
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,280
Yes.

757
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,560
Culturally in 2019, probably just.

758
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,720
I don't know what they were calling it then.

759
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,640
They're just trying to kill Indiana Jones.

760
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,480
They're bad guys.

761
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,320
They're just bad dudes.

762
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,520
Bad, these are bad fellas.

763
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,960
Bad hombres. Bad hombres.

764
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,800
Let me tell you.

765
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,920
The language is familiar.

766
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,080
And yeah, but they all, that is like,

767
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,720
I should have seen it when I was in Florida,

768
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,280
but I even watched in a video of it,

769
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,680
like oh man, all this ladder stuff is bonk,

770
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,960
like just constant pushing back and forth

771
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,080
on a big tall ladder.

772
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,920
Yeah.

773
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,200
It ends up not good for the bad guy.

774
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,640
And there's not a lot of harnesses in this one.

775
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,400
Like Waterworld or Sindbad, when it was running,

776
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,400
you could see people hook in to harness it.

777
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,360
This, it's just a lot of mats.

778
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,880
Like there's some like multi-story,

779
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,680
like someone did it in the behind the scenes,

780
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,920
like hopped off the building and landed on a mat

781
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,360
two stories below them.

782
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,280
Like it's a lot of.

783
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,240
Also, yeah, these people, I was just gonna like,

784
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,800
even mats, like you get beat up.

785
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,640
Yeah.

786
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,640
Like you like, I think a lot of things happen

787
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,600
when you're a kid, you're a kid, you go,

788
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,400
oh my God, this, these people must be really hurt.

789
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,720
They need a little, the older they go,

790
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,840
well, they're stunt people, they're trained.

791
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,040
So they know how to do all this stuff.

792
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,200
And you go, oh, got it.

793
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,480
It doesn't hurt them at all.

794
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,200
Then the reality of course is that,

795
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,560
yeah, they get beat up all the time.

796
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,320
Like, they're just like tough people

797
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,120
that are willing to jump off a high thing.

798
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,960
Cause even landing on a mat high up,

799
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,960
doesn't feel good unless it's like,

800
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,920
you're going into water.

801
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,040
But like, if you've ever taken like,

802
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,560
I have in like commercial audition or a shoot or something,

803
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,040
you fall on a mat, it's you'll go,

804
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,200
the wind gets knocked out of you.

805
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,520
Like it's not like, it's still like miles on the body.

806
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,720
It's so, I'm just saying like, it's crazy.

807
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,560
Well, this is why the insanity of like,

808
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,880
and you like, you know, wrestling is fake.

809
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,720
Yeah.

810
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,120
It's pretty, that simplifies it.

811
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,080
And there's still, it's this like incredible ballet

812
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,440
of performance that's being done in there.

813
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,960
Like fake implies that none of it hurts.

814
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,800
Right.

815
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,360
Well, that's very much not true.

816
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,200
It's hard to fake a jump kick to the chest

817
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,680
or like a chair to the back, you know?

818
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,280
Now of course I'm making that argument,

819
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,280
not with anybody actually,

820
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,080
nobody even says that in 2019.

821
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,000
I'm making that argument to like a six year old

822
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,640
in elementary school in 1991.

823
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,480
Sure.

824
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,960
I think my mom says that too.

825
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,480
She'll be like, oh, do you know it's not real?

826
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,280
Is she still trying to help you out?

827
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,200
Well, she doesn't, she's still bothered that I like it.

828
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,760
There's something about it that bothers her.

829
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,160
I think she probably,

830
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,680
I think a lot of people who say that

831
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,240
are looking at it straight as sporting and less,

832
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,120
and if they look at it more as a theatrical event.

833
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,040
Right.

834
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,840
Where there is some planning and coordination and stuff.

835
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,640
Because there are stories like in a play or a movie

836
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,000
or something going on.

837
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,960
She just probably doesn't like that.

838
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,080
Like some of them have like a tattoo.

839
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,960
Well, certainly she doesn't like that.

840
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,160
It's a good thing you bring that up.

841
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,640
Yes, she does not like tattoos.

842
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,360
So that's probably number one.

843
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,160
And then I guess it's just, you know, the violence.

844
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,000
It's just violent.

845
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,080
It's just so violent.

846
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,120
So violent.

847
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:56,960
Terrible.

848
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,800
Bad influence.

849
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,280
Bad influence on me.

850
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,400
Who knows what I'll get into.

851
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,480
You might, it's, you don't even realize

852
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,240
how what a violent 60 something you'll be.

853
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,080
Yeah.

854
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,480
It's going to take a while, but eventually I'm going to be bad.

855
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,280
And in my sixties, it's going to be bad.

856
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,800
This is a violent show.

857
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,240
Yeah.

858
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,400
They simulate the there's the part where the guy comes out with the sword

859
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,840
and he just like throws his whip away and shoots him.

860
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,480
But like there's booby traps.

861
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,040
There's a lot of like gun blanks, gunfire,

862
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:35,360
explosions, the plane with the gun, high falls, pratfalls, whip work.

863
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,880
I was, I think, stressed out by the all of the plane stuff at the end,

864
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,720
because you don't know the degree of safety of that plane.

865
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,840
And everybody is very near it.

866
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,520
And that's right.

867
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:51,360
If anything, as a kid reeled me in, it was that because I couldn't get my head

868
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,440
around a plane that was extremely dangerous and wouldn't just decimate you

869
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,080
into powder, waltz blades.

870
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,280
Yeah.

871
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,880
The propellers, the propellers.

872
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,160
I think I was just like, oh, the propellers are coming for me.

873
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,560
Here's something.

874
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,680
Like it was going to come loose into the audience.

875
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,720
I don't know what I thought.

876
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,880
I mean, that's probably part like I was like, oh, I think the guns in my takeoff.

877
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,480
The plane might take off and hit us in the audience.

878
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,520
Yeah. Take your head off.

879
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,640
It was so real.

880
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,680
That's look, that's why I'm doing the podcast is because all this stuff damaged me.

881
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,440
I learned today that plane is electric.

882
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,640
It doesn't make noise.

883
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,160
The sound effects of the plane are pumped in.

884
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,640
Wow. So that they were saying that plane is actually very quiet.

885
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,480
And one of the two big two changes that I have seen when I saw it,

886
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,160
last time they did not do because what they used to do

887
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,840
is that propeller would come pretty close to the big mechanic

888
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,240
and he would stand over a trap door and a lot of smoke would come out of the propeller

889
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,040
and he would fall through the trap door, as if in the movie, of course, the propeller.

890
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,520
It's implied that the propeller cuts him to bits.

891
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:59,240
So the alternate version of that is that he just gets out in front of the plane

892
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,480
and Marion blows Marion blows him away with the gun on the plane.

893
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,040
Oh, so there's like the explosions in the ground.

894
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,120
So a lot of the guns, too, they demonstrate it in one of the behind the scenes things.

895
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,000
The guns just like shoot out a little fire.

896
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,840
And then the it's completed by squibs further away or whatever.

897
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,000
You call that the gun.

898
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,040
OK, gunfire further away.

899
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,240
That's I guess a thing, because those well, some of the some of the weapons

900
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,440
in any of these shows are what's making the sounds to some extent.

901
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,520
But it's all it's all amended revolver is just a gun loaded with blanks.

902
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,360
I see. Right. OK.

903
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,400
Yeah, I'm sure I have said this on the show before, where I'm even to this day,

904
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,360
I still get fooled by plenty of sounds that I think are coming from something,

905
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,240
but they're obviously just being piped in.

906
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,400
Sure. Like it's still such a good illusion.

907
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,240
Yeah. And so many different rides and things.

908
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,720
Yeah. Well, I think to appreciate about this show, for sure.

909
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,200
I think you know what's fun about this show is how much it is.

910
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,680
It is so much Raiders of the Lost Ark.

911
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,320
Like it's called the Indiana Jones of Extent Spectacular in general.

912
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,320
But if you are specifically a fan of Raiders, I like that it I mean,

913
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,560
there'd be an equally satisfying show that is set pieces from all of the movies.

914
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,720
But I do kind of like

915
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,400
because I don't even know if I'd call Raiders.

916
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,040
I just think it's neat that it's like that, like whether or not it's your favorite.

917
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,760
It's such a great movie.

918
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,000
And I like that it is narrowed down to you get to see like three major set

919
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,880
pieces from what is an undeniably great movie.

920
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,800
It's not a greatest hits.

921
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,000
Yeah. Yeah.

922
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,080
Which would probably be an excellent greatest hits show

923
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,000
with a stunt, you know, Indy senior.

924
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,680
But I think I maybe this is I'm trying to think of this as the right way to

925
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,560
the right metaphor.

926
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,600
Sometimes when you see a rock and roll show, I'm more interested in sort of seeing

927
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,640
peace or something like the artists, the new stuff versus just the greatest hits.

928
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:03,480
Well, it's like you go to see, you know, Steely Dan's play in Asia tonight.

929
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,000
That's what a general Steely Dan concert.

930
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,840
Exactly. Yes. Or yeah.

931
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,400
Or the different interesting greatest hits would be great, too.

932
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,360
Yes. Different formats.

933
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,800
But all of one piece sometimes is a satisfying experience.

934
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,040
And I also like because the Indiana Jones

935
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,840
rides, I guess sort of you could say multiple.

936
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,480
It's a slightly different plots between Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland,

937
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:31,000
Disney, but like the that's sort of like this new Indiana Jones adventure,

938
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
which is great. And it synthesizes elements of the original.

939
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,320
But I don't know.

940
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,640
Cool to just like and they didn't like do a lot of invention.

941
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,160
It's it's Raiders and Raiders if he had been crushed by the fault.

942
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,600
Yes. Yeah.

943
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,400
Also, that guy had been gunned down instead of chopped up.

944
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,960
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yes.

945
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,880
I have a feeling they probably don't do the trap.

946
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,560
The trap door seemed like the most logistically difficult

947
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,360
because I don't know what those propellers are made of.

948
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,920
I know the spikes that come out of the ground are not solid wood.

949
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,200
I think they're like painted plastic or foam or something.

950
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,240
But I mean, they still hurt coming out of the ground that.

951
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,760
Sure. It's still there's still footage of the one guy shows footage of like,

952
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,560
well, here's one time I fucked up the last pressure pad

953
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,720
and tripped on the last spike.

954
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,560
But he recovers really nicely.

955
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,600
But he got hit a little bit.

956
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,360
He got hit a little bit. Yeah.

957
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:28,440
There is a another special that I flipped through like a Disney

958
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,480
MGM Studios is opening kind of special in 89.

959
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,240
There's a there's a little like little skit in front of there

960
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,080
in the set of the stunt show,

961
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,880
initially with John Forsythe, who hosts all the theme park thing,

962
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,520
the Charlie from Charlie's Angels, those incredible universal videos

963
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,880
where he drones on about.

964
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,520
But by those for forty dollars, I think it was that expensive.

965
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,360
Forty or thirty bucks, the video souvenirs, right?

966
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,080
For you, Hollywood and Florida. Yeah. Yeah.

967
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:01,720
Yeah. That to watch a man stand in front of the train

968
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,640
taking off at the end of Back to the Future three and saying,

969
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,960
movies are the wizards wand.

970
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,680
It's a look, make illusion a reality.

971
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,480
Sounds like Blue 32.

972
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,440
Yeah, yeah. I have so much vocal.

973
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,600
I'll work on my job.

974
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,720
He might just sound like I'm a little bit.

975
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,800
You're limited. It's a little well, it's also a little the Hanna Barbera.

976
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,160
They sure are.

977
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,920
But so you can watch him talk for a while.

978
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,320
But the whole special is hosted by John Ritter,

979
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,840
who is the construct of the specials that he's been put in charge

980
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,880
of the opening of the park for some reason.

981
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,040
He's an actor. He has better things to do.

982
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,960
But he comes in kind of hurried and like the park's opening in two hours.

983
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,600
We have to and he's all stressed out.

984
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,280
And then he on his way out the door with, you know, with his clipboard,

985
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,160
he does the spikes sequence.

986
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,720
And I may have said before, such a big John Ritter fan.

987
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,960
Sure. So sad he passed away.

988
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,800
And it was such a great, agile, physical comedian.

989
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,920
And watching him do the spikes gag, now realizing he had to do all that stuff

990
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,000
where he's triggering it himself.

991
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,080
I just really appreciate the work that he did.

992
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:11,440
And then fun to see not Indiana Jones, but, you know, a fun, silly guy do it.

993
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,040
And, you know, and he takes it to where it like almost gets his crotch

994
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,760
or almost like gets him up the butt.

995
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,040
He implies it without, you know, using language.

996
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,080
And that's the you know, that's the main thing I wanted to say about that special.

997
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,000
However, this morning I'm flipping through trying to like,

998
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,160
is there an indie part in this? Oh, yeah, there it is.

999
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,840
I found this other thing, and this is completely off the Indiana Jones topic,

1000
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,960
but I have to talk about it or else I'll think I hallucinated it.

1001
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,720
I'm flipping through the commercial like, OK, so where is it?

1002
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,560
Wait a minute. That's a McDonald's ad.

1003
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:45,000
Is there a McDonald's ad starring Kathy, the comic strip character?

1004
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,920
Yeah, of course. Excuse me?

1005
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,400
Yeah, you know, Kathy. Kathy Geist?

1006
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,560
What's her last name?

1007
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,520
I forget her last name. Kathy Geist?

1008
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,600
Is that her name? I'm not sure.

1009
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,280
Is that the character's name or just the creator's name?

1010
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,960
I think it's implied to be both.

1011
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,560
I see. It must be. It must be both.

1012
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,240
Yeah, but it's, you know, Monday's arg.

1013
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,000
It's that Kathy. And I don't I guess maybe I knew there were like

1014
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,680
there's maybe an animated special or two of Kathy.

1015
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,600
I don't think a regular series, but I'm like, I got to go back and watch this.

1016
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,520
And I put it on and it is.

1017
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,320
Yeah, it's a McDonald's commercial that's animated starring Kathy.

1018
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:26,200
But Kathy is in line at McDonald's with Mike Ditka.

1019
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,840
What? Coach of the Chicago Bears.

1020
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:33,200
Where is this? Did you see this in this Disney in this 1989

1021
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,560
Disney MGM Studios special?

1022
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,040
This was one of the ads that was left that was taped off.

1023
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,480
This is the culture of 1989.

1024
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,520
Kathy MGM Studios Ditka, like a perfect synthesis.

1025
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,720
And all that you come to in that time, the Muppets are right around the corner

1026
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,720
from R2D2 are right around the corner from Indiana Jones.

1027
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,560
There were icons and they're all hanging out together.

1028
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,880
Not least among them, Kathy and Mike Ditka.

1029
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,680
And the point of putting

1030
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,920
him in there, it was first of all, Mike Ditka in Kathy style.

1031
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,200
Very strange. And he's doing the voice.

1032
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,640
And OK, so the whole thing is animated.

1033
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,880
Yes. Oh, I thought it was real.

1034
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,400
Did kind of like Roger.

1035
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,520
Oh, no, not superimposed in there.

1036
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,000
No, no, no. It is a rendered in case it's Mike Ditka.

1037
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,240
Entering the Kathy verse.

1038
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,520
So I feel like I'm making it up. It's so bizarre.

1039
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,440
It does sound fake.

1040
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,520
And the whole reason to have the both of them was that

1041
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,320
it is for McDonald's salads.

1042
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,760
And they're trying to prove that salads can be good for a rough and tumble man.

1043
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:39,080
Like Mike Ditka or, you know, like complainy watching her figure

1044
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:43,760
gal like Kathy, it's a very reductive kind of thing.

1045
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,080
And even it even includes when I wrote it down, you know, it's like this little

1046
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:50,800
like back and forth showing the difference between, you know, a gruff guy

1047
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,440
and, you know, and this woman.

1048
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,840
And then he calls her

1049
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,520
did the ditzy girl and she says big ox.

1050
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,320
They throw little insults at each other.

1051
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,040
It's kind of it's a moonlighting.

1052
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,680
That was our Spencer and Hepburn.

1053
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,400
Tracy and Hepburn was in Geist.

1054
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,920
They sparse, sparring is the dance that makes them fall in love.

1055
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,440
Yeah, yes.

1056
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,560
And this is long before because Kathy in continuity did get married

1057
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,480
the last few years of her strip husband, not to real life.

1058
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,440
Chicago Bears coach, not to Mike Ditka.

1059
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,720
Did you say the late Mike Ditka?

1060
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,320
Is he alive? Yeah.

1061
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,280
Oh, I thought he passed. No, he's alive.

1062
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,400
OK. Yeah.

1063
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,160
Um, anyway, just a bizarre thing.

1064
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,280
Is this also the special where Alan Thicke sings putting on the ritz?

1065
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,280
Or was that a parade?

1066
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,320
I think that's a Christmas.

1067
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,400
OK, so there's similar who opens it.

1068
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,160
I want to say the Pointer sisters are in there.

1069
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,400
Thicke might be in there, too.

1070
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,760
They had a real revolving cast.

1071
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,880
John Ritter hosted a few.

1072
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,000
He has to the Living Seas special. Oh, yeah.

1073
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,920
He was there a lot.

1074
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,560
But yeah, I don't know.

1075
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,760
Kathy at McDonald's and the salad looked terrible.

1076
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,000
I remember when they started with the solids there.

1077
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,240
I feel like I have a memory of that.

1078
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,840
Those have been bad.

1079
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,600
Yeah, they're better now, I think, but still not good.

1080
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,600
Yeah, they think they described I think in this is they're showing like

1081
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:24,600
it's vegetables, you know, for a girl and then big manly, you know, like

1082
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,360
it's almost like barbecue sauce.

1083
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,000
And there's I think they describe it as red ranch.

1084
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,960
It's being poured on and it looks like mesquite barbeque.

1085
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,400
Red ranch. That's the other thing.

1086
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,160
It's not most. I remember McDonald's

1087
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,480
bed salads mostly being like chicken and ham or turkey and ham.

1088
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,280
Oh, yes. Exactly.

1089
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,800
Big old ham pieces and like, yeah, and just rubbery cheese.

1090
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,680
And then you smother some red ranch on there that can tickle Dick's mustache.

1091
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,320
Did it was it called Red Ranch?

1092
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,000
It wasn't Catalina.

1093
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,640
It's I want to say red.

1094
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,560
You probably right.

1095
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,880
Yeah, they all snippet and put it on.

1096
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,680
I don't even see.

1097
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,520
I just see West.

1098
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,120
Sweet and sour dressing, classic Catalina,

1099
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,480
which is what my grandmother always had, which honestly tastes like red ranch in

1100
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,640
my head now.

1101
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,200
Interesting. I don't know.

1102
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,320
And why did why would why did they go to McDonald's together?

1103
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,840
How did Kathy meet Mike Dick?

1104
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,240
Was it just on a single site?

1105
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,400
Is he just trying to find love?

1106
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,800
So they were together.

1107
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,640
They were together.

1108
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,200
I don't know that it was a date.

1109
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,240
It might have led to a future date, but somehow Kathy and Mike

1110
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,920
Dick commit and went to McDonald's.

1111
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,400
This is going to keep me up at night.

1112
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,440
Yeah, yeah.

1113
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,240
I'm going to have to fill in.

1114
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,240
I will have to write a fan fiction prequel explaining the back story and

1115
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,600
learning about their dating life after the fact.

1116
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,800
Do you remember talking about animated comic strip specials?

1117
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,760
Do you remember there was a couple of far side specials?

1118
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,480
Really?

1119
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,040
The couple of animated far side specials as a kid.

1120
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,800
I thought they were hilarious because they just animate.

1121
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,440
It was just a million shorts.

1122
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:55,040
They just animated strips and they were so funny.

1123
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,920
And the only way you could acquire them, I'm sure they're online for free

1124
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,080
on YouTube at this point.

1125
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,240
Was at the back of the page a day calendar.

1126
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,960
You could fill out a form and write a check again for 30 or 40 dollars

1127
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,720
and get a VHS copy of them.

1128
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,960
That was the only way.

1129
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,200
It seems that I did.

1130
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:13,880
Well, you got them.

1131
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,640
I never got them.

1132
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,160
I saw them when they aired.

1133
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:16,800
Right, right, right.

1134
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,200
But yeah, they were they were super fun.

1135
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,240
We're in the experiment with those things and then it doesn't take off as a show.

1136
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:24,520
Right.

1137
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,800
I think Garfield might have been special to show.

1138
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,680
I'm not sure.

1139
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
But like but some totally left behind or there was a think oddly late.

1140
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,920
There was a Will Ferrell voiced baby blues.

1141
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,760
I remember that.

1142
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,120
I remember.

1143
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,160
Yes, I remember that.

1144
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,200
Yeah, there's a handful of them.

1145
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,160
Those are all jumpstart TV show.

1146
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,240
Is there a drabble?

1147
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,960
They must have tried with all of them because I would think there was a

1148
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,760
Doonesbury special or two.

1149
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,640
Yeah, there was that.

1150
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,200
That was like the most biting satire in America.

1151
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:53,800
You had Hunter S.

1152
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,640
Taunton and Rolling Stone and Doonesbury in the comic strip.

1153
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,480
Little Abner.

1154
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,400
I mean, a little after was still ubiquitous.

1155
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,600
They tried to do jumpstart in 2014 at Fox 2014.

1156
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,200
Wow.

1157
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,960
Yeah, that's late.

1158
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,560
I'm sure they'll try it again soon.

1159
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,360
Yeah, I'm trying to think.

1160
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,520
I was surprised we didn't get a high and lowest show.

1161
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,920
It's a foxtrot in the late 90s.

1162
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,880
That seems like a missed opportunity.

1163
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,960
Blondie Blondie.

1164
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,320
I think there was some animated Blondie Dagwood stuff.

1165
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,280
Yeah, yeah.

1166
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:25,760
There was.

1167
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:30,440
OK, there was a Cathy special and voiced by I think the name you were.

1168
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,560
Oh, no, no, no, that is not the creator of Cathy.

1169
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:37,040
Different different person named Kathleen, who later voiced the character Pepperan.

1170
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,360
I and I'm only there's not too much

1171
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,360
Rob Paulson in there.

1172
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,280
Hey, the way you love David.

1173
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,560
Love David.

1174
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,440
But what's jumping out of me is it was produced by Bill Melendez,

1175
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,080
who produced the peanuts Christmas special.

1176
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,160
And I found this great clip of him talking about like entertainment tonight,

1177
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,440
interviewed him to ask him if he was like now in Disney,

1178
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,920
when it says sex in the letters in The Lion King or when Aladdin whispers

1179
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,480
all the teenagers take off or whatever that is,

1180
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,520
teenagers take off their clothes like, you know, like, hey,

1181
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,680
you're a real working animation.

1182
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,920
Is this on purpose or not?

1183
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,200
And he's like, yes, of course, it's on purpose.

1184
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,480
And if I were if a you know, if I were Walt,

1185
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,920
I would have fired these guys right on the spot.

1186
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,240
If I were old Walt, you're fired.

1187
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,600
You put this in the show.

1188
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,040
Oh, that's funny.

1189
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,640
And this is so many levels of tangent now, I realize.

1190
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:36,240
Well, it's we'll get out of the tomb of Kathy and escape the tomb of Kathy.

1191
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,320
So I talking about behind the scenes stuff.

1192
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,840
I think it's time to once again talk about Jerry Reese.

1193
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,760
Have we? Oh, yeah.

1194
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,240
Looking back on because Jerry Reese directed this

1195
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,760
stunt show like came is credited as the director, George Lucas,

1196
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,920
credited as executive producer.

1197
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,680
Spielberg, I think probably already would have been contracted

1198
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,400
by Universal Studios, so he's not really mentioned,

1199
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,520
maybe offhandedly mentioned.

1200
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:08,720
But like Jerry Reese's theme park credits, again, either directed

1201
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,200
or produced, had some involvement in Sounds Dangerous,

1202
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,760
the live action parts of Cranium Command.

1203
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,080
This show Rock and Roller Coaster,

1204
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,760
extra terror, Estriol, Alien Encounter

1205
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,440
and Cinemagique

1206
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:28,880
and the pre-ride film for Dinosaur at Animal Kingdom.

1207
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,120
I think he also did the thing where Robin Williams

1208
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:38,080
is animated into Peter Pan and Walter Cronkite's around.

1209
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:41,240
And remember that thing that's familiar.

1210
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,360
Remember, it was on the it was on the studio tour

1211
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,760
and they might have even played it in early.

1212
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,080
Yeah. Yeah.

1213
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,640
Yeah. Yeah. But God, he was the guy.

1214
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,440
He was the guy.

1215
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,960
And what I want to talk about, and I cannot remember if I've just

1216
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,880
totally forgotten that we've talking about talked about this or not.

1217
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,960
If we haven't, I'm shocked.

1218
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,920
Michael and Mickey is Michael and Mickey.

1219
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,680
Have we now? I don't think we have.

1220
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,680
I think we may have because how else would we it must have come up

1221
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,720
because that's the source of the Mickey Mouse watch.

1222
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,080
And then that that Michael Eisner is wearing a Mickey Mouse watch.

1223
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,520
And and Mickey Mouse is wearing Michael Eisner.

1224
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,800
Right. That's right. You're right.

1225
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,040
Originally done for the MGM, Disney, MGM Studio Tour,

1226
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,480
Michael Eisner, then CEO of Disney Studios, is en route to a screening room

1227
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,840
for viewing with Mickey Mouse. Yes.

1228
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,680
Jerry Reese directed this is apparently the only time

1229
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,920
Mickey is second build on something.

1230
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,000
He is second to Michael Eisner.

1231
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,240
Yeah, as it should be.

1232
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,080
And he and that's the thing where, yeah,

1233
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,480
we go down the hallways of the Disney offices and they are rounding up

1234
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,200
all the characters. The screenings about to start come along.

1235
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:56,800
And the Fantasia brooms and the babes in Toyland, the toy soldiers.

1236
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,720
And then everybody gathers in a screening room.

1237
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,920
The huge devil from Fantasia

1238
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:09,080
is in front of Mickey and he says, could you sit down, please?

1239
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:13,880
And he's like, and is going to like bring health rain, hellfire onto Mickey.

1240
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,800
But then Eisner says, hey, could you sit down?

1241
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,960
And he's like, oh, yes, sorry. Sorry, Mr. Eisner.

1242
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,560
I don't read. Sorry. No, I'll do it again, sir.

1243
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,840
Shockingly, a full version of this is not on YouTube, but I would like to see.

1244
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,720
And it's in the supercut.

1245
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,760
We the the Eisner Hello Supercut.

1246
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,760
It isn't OK. Yeah, I had a feel.

1247
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,960
OK, now that we talked about the watches, now it's coming back to me.

1248
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:41,000
But reading so explicitly for a long time.

1249
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,360
Yeah, we need to cover this more in depth that there is this.

1250
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,920
I mean, casual Mickey makes an appearance.

1251
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:50,240
Mickey with like a casual jacket and a t-shirt on.

1252
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,040
It's a lot of our little obsessions.

1253
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,880
Nineties Mickey interacting with Michael. Michael, I think

1254
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,000
it's a great mix of live action animation.

1255
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,120
It's like insular and done on the lot.

1256
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,360
Yeah, I was a big fan of this.

1257
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,160
It's well, here's why.

1258
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,680
I know that it is the beginning of a special called Best of Disney

1259
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,640
that aired on TV in 1990.

1260
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:15,200
And that's where they filmed this and then made it a generic intro

1261
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,360
and said, like, like tonight's best of Disney special, which made it

1262
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,960
made it so that it could work in the theme park and on.

1263
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:21,800
Oh, great.

1264
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,720
So it was the beginning of this one special.

1265
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,160
And that's where you see you have to find the full.

1266
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,160
That's the spell. OK, there we go.

1267
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,040
We have to do a full episode on that special.

1268
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,280
Yeah, cooler than laying all that out.

1269
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,160
My off the do that. I was very impressed.

1270
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,760
Yeah, I was very impressed, too. Yeah. Yeah.

1271
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,920
I mean, I love this thing very much.

1272
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,000
And I knew that, of course, to make the Michael Eisner Hello Supercut.

1273
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:43,960
I was like, oh, and there's that one.

1274
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,080
It's Michael, Michael and Mickey.

1275
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,920
But I have to find that I have to go find the best Disney special.

1276
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:55,000
I had so the finding all of those was I was consulting an episode

1277
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,440
guide of like, OK, so fuzz bucket.

1278
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,240
Can I? All right.

1279
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,760
So there was a fuzz bucket episode of the Disney.

1280
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,200
Let me search by I was searching by air date.

1281
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,720
Yeah, that's great.

1282
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:10,320
Here's raw ABC programming for this night in May 1987.

1283
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,560
It was a wow commendable.

1284
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,880
Like Indiana Jones, it was on it.

1285
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,080
It was like scouring the, you know, the storage room

1286
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,040
where the Ark is ultimately kept.

1287
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,440
Sure. Yeah.

1288
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,560
I opened it. I don't I don't know.

1289
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,880
Maybe it should have stayed sealed.

1290
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:29,800
Probably probably could not have replicated that sequence for a stunt show.

1291
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:33,880
Probably couldn't have done Indy hanging off the speeding desert truck.

1292
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,800
Well, Crystal Skull makes all these things possible that. Yes.

1293
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:43,800
It couldn't have been done in real life by using digital effects.

1294
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,360
We're able to have Shia LaBeouf sword fighting monkeys straddling two cars

1295
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,600
and possibly far from each other.

1296
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,640
And also one of my the most unnerving things about Crystal Skull to me,

1297
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,880
where people keep implying like the specter of McCarthyism, like Dr.

1298
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,400
Jones, how do we know you're on our side?

1299
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,880
Mm hmm. It's like, oh, God, I I don't like this.

1300
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,200
It's Indiana. You trust Indiana Jones?

1301
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,720
Well, America is a little paranoid now in the 50s. Sure.

1302
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,360
Is he going to get I

1303
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,160
talking to, you know, to bug me about some of this stuff?

1304
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,760
And he was saying, like, is it if they make a new one, shouldn't he?

1305
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,520
Shouldn't Indiana Jones be in like the 80s at this point?

1306
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,520
Like it's been it's a long time.

1307
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,480
Yeah, he's in the late wait, the mid or late 50s in the last one.

1308
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,320
And that's already 10 years ago.

1309
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,000
So I guess not the probably six.

1310
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,440
It's probably honestly, it's probably American graffiti.

1311
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,440
It's probably I mean, Lucas isn't involved, though.

1312
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,920
So like you're not going to get or at least not that involved.

1313
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:51,040
I swear to God, if I have to see some bullshit with Indiana Jones and hippies,

1314
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,440
get the I think there every draft I mentioned earlier has hippies in it.

1315
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,240
I would bet money on that because he has to be in the 60s.

1316
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,880
And that's the big, the big funny gag.

1317
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:06,720
But really, HDR hippies, like the colors of their faded, like, you know,

1318
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,240
peasant blouses are going to be really bright.

1319
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,960
You're saying that it wouldn't be a little corrected.

1320
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,400
Yes, everything will be very art, like very like

1321
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,640
saturated way up, like a lot like live action Aladdin.

1322
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,840
I may have said this before. I'm going to say it again.

1323
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,920
I don't I remember when Crystal Skull came out.

1324
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,680
It was like it like everyone agree.

1325
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,840
Everyone I was with was like agreed.

1326
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:35,320
It looks horrible. All you could do, like every trailer, like this is going to be shit.

1327
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,400
It's going to be such shit. You read a review. It's shit.

1328
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:41,560
It's awful shit. And then like like, God, I can't believe how bad it is.

1329
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,520
But you got to go, right? Yeah, you got to go.

1330
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,280
I and I was there was a minute where I was like, what if I don't?

1331
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,400
Maybe I don't have to go.

1332
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:54,000
And then I got talked into going this new one, especially if there's hippies.

1333
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,320
Fuck, no, I don't need to see Indiana Jones.

1334
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,400
If there's no this franchise, anything.

1335
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,560
If we all say no collectively as a united people,

1336
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,080
then maybe these things have to not be so.

1337
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,080
Oh, it's a tough question.

1338
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,840
Saying no to Star Wars for a few years now.

1339
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,480
Trickling in to say no to Star Wars.

1340
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,560
That's a different it's a tough situation because there's certain things

1341
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:21,560
that I'd like to say no to, but I am interested in it either way.

1342
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,480
That's the problem.

1343
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,040
There's a lot of stuff I say no to movie and TV wise.

1344
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,480
But you are you are.

1345
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,960
But I don't truly after knowing what they did with a fifties greaser.

1346
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,360
And now you're going to give me hippies.

1347
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,400
I am out. No way.

1348
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:41,120
If it's 60s, that's obviously it seems obvious that that's going to be a thing.

1349
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,680
It goes early 60s.

1350
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:45,600
That's too much culturally too close to the fifties.

1351
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,960
Yeah. American middle to.

1352
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:47,360
Yeah.

1353
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:52,520
Mid to later 60s, you're going to get, you know, in the white room.

1354
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,160
No, is it Indiana Jones at Woodstock?

1355
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,200
Is he like kind of like there's a high jinx backstage at Woodstock?

1356
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,480
And he's scaffolding.

1357
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,520
Yeah, maybe.

1358
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,280
Indiana Jones in the 70s.

1359
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,480
Now you have my attention.

1360
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,040
Indiana Jones in gritty 70s New York.

1361
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,800
New York. Oh, well, he's got to stop by.

1362
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,760
He's never really stopped by New York, has he?

1363
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,480
If 80s Indiana Jones, that was interesting to me.

1364
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,080
What you were saying.

1365
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,880
But will that be like carrying out some weird secret Reagan?

1366
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,640
Is he like getting arms to Nicaragua?

1367
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,640
I think the first thing I think of when I think of 80s is he's got like a Captain

1368
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,600
EOS outfit that like somebody forces him to put on to like play it cool

1369
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,800
at like a weird club.

1370
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,240
But see, that's they're already going to get Wonder Woman,

1371
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,400
the 80s Wonder Woman out first.

1372
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,640
Oh, OK.

1373
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,160
We're also playing in dangerously close territory to

1374
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,320
Ackroyd Hanks, Dragnet, like the stiff shirt.

1375
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like punk clothes.

1376
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,280
I like that when I was a kid.

1377
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,480
I knew it was weird.

1378
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:56,400
I got the the gimmick that it's still Joe Friday stuck in the 50s,

1379
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,000
but in like like, yeah, I liked it.

1380
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,440
I did too. No, I'm a fan of the also funny Hanks, funny young Hanks.

1381
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,520
Yeah, yeah. Hard to deny. Great. Yeah.

1382
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,400
Yeah. Yeah.

1383
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,520
Grimes major crime.

1384
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,000
They're going to have to do a sacrifice.

1385
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,520
I love the rap city of crime.

1386
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:19,520
The movie ends with implying that Joe Friday finally has sex to

1387
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,720
you. Remember that?

1388
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,280
Yeah. Does that make him?

1389
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,520
Does he now just talk like, hey, what's going on?

1390
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,680
No, he whatever he's repeating about like top secret, like whatever

1391
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,960
file case closed, like he says as a callback.

1392
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,640
OK, when Hanks is like, so did you finally like just the fact,

1393
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,120
just the facts, I think.

1394
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,560
Yeah, of course, just the facts.

1395
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,880
It would have to be.

1396
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,360
Hmm. Anyway, yeah.

1397
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,800
If we're if it's the right maybe we have maybe we got to be 70s.

1398
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,000
Is he in Vietnam?

1399
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,680
If he's in Vietnam.

1400
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,760
Oh, well, that might be depressing.

1401
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:58,040
Probably. Yeah. Why am I like, no, I would.

1402
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,200
Yeah. He's in like Apocalypse Now.

1403
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,760
It's indeed Apocalypse Now.

1404
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,040
I don't we have enough movies where Creedence.

1405
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,280
I want to know now.

1406
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,840
I would say like Indiana Jones.

1407
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:16,160
Satanic panic could be fun, but again, it's the name of the plot of it.

1408
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,800
They have to stop this franchise.

1409
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,480
Every story is just a great extragnant.

1410
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,720
I I'm sure I said this on the other episode of it about Indiana Jones.

1411
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,040
Lucas's original idea, which I think was the right idea,

1412
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,640
was every movie would be a totally different genre.

1413
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,960
Yes. And he wanted to make, you know, the second Temple of Doom is like

1414
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,160
whatever you'd call it, a horror kind of a horror movie.

1415
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,560
Yeah. And then he wanted to make Indiana Jones and the Saucer Men from Mars,

1416
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:42,600
which to me sounds like Mars attacks Indiana Jones, which is awesome.

1417
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,480
Yes. But then they got scared because Temple of Doom.

1418
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,480
People were cranky about.

1419
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,000
So now they've just tried to remake the same movie every time.

1420
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,680
I like Las Curses.

1421
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,320
Yeah, yeah. Las Curses a lot.

1422
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,280
But I do, too.

1423
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,640
But I'm just saying it's obviously in the same vein as the first one.

1424
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,960
It's obviously a correction back to like, well, this is what we do with Indiana

1425
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:03,640
Jones. So I think which is back when course corrects in franchises worked.

1426
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,320
I guess, honestly, that's a it's a good point

1427
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,400
that everyone was like, yeah, that's right.

1428
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,360
We like that. Imagine that.

1429
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,400
Imagine with anything now like, well, the last movie wasn't so great.

1430
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,400
But hey, we kind of I think we fixed it.

1431
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,200
And everybody going, you're right.

1432
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:21,520
Yeah, it's like Terminator, like Terminator instead of like seven tries.

1433
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,040
Yeah. Yeah.

1434
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,840
The first one works done.

1435
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:28,280
And the one that was a problem, quote unquote, everybody likes now.

1436
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,480
Temple of Doom. Yes. Yes.

1437
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,760
And that was so that's yeah.

1438
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,520
So I mean, I do think it's a little claustrophobic.

1439
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,600
I like it's my favorite in Last Crusade and Temple of Doom that

1440
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,320
Raiders that they're like crisscrossing the globe.

1441
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:45,760
It's it's a Temple of Doom is, you know, there's a little

1442
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,600
some problematic elements of it.

1443
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,520
Yeah, very confusing racially.

1444
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,600
But that being said, screen in India.

1445
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,000
But the movie is insane.

1446
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,640
It opens with anything goes.

1447
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,360
It's a crazy musical number.

1448
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:59,320
Like it's just bizarre and weird and language.

1449
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,840
And it's awesome. I don't know.

1450
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,080
It's awesome. I think the other movies are great.

1451
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:07,000
But except for, you know, although I do like Mutt Williams, I like the

1452
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,520
motorcycle chase in four. That's fine.

1453
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,280
All right. We've tan.

1454
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,840
This isn't a tan. Yeah, kind of a tan.

1455
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,720
Can I go? Is it possible we went back?

1456
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,440
Like if you will go back to our Indiana Jones episode, we said all the same.

1457
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,440
It's very possible.

1458
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,240
I know the ride. It's been long.

1459
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:24,560
It's so long that I probably said the same exact thing about wanting the sauce

1460
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,880
or men from Mars movie.

1461
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:30,200
Can I tell you my favorite thing about this or one of my favorite things about this?

1462
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,200
It was this is something that was used.

1463
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,760
This Indiana Jones stunt show was used in a lot of different TV shows.

1464
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,360
Yeah. And I don't know.

1465
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,040
This is this is probably the my favorite one.

1466
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,720
So maybe I'm leading with the best one.

1467
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,960
I'll say quick because I know there's not a lot to say about it.

1468
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,560
But as the TGIF historian of this part, I was waiting for that.

1469
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,000
Great sequence involved.

1470
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,680
I think I think I even brought it up.

1471
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,280
The only way to handle this is piecemeal.

1472
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,400
It's too much to get into the full full house arc.

1473
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,000
It's two episodes to talk about.

1474
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,880
But the story of the two

1475
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:06,760
the two episodes of Phil Os film in Disney World is that DJ

1476
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:10,320
misses her boyfriend, Steve, so much because she has to be away from him

1477
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:14,720
for four days that she keeps seeing him everywhere all over the parks.

1478
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:18,600
And that leads to this huge sequence where you're watching the Indiana Jones

1479
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,240
stunt spectacular.

1480
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,640
And like, I think I forgot how they got into it.

1481
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,760
And I watched it this morning.

1482
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,720
And she says, like that Indiana Jones, he's so brave.

1483
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,240
He reminds me of Steve.

1484
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,080
And then then when he like looks up, it is Steve.

1485
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,680
And then he does the whole sequence and goes and gets the goes

1486
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,920
and gets the idol and then fall and then is crushed by the boulder.

1487
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,600
And then she stands up.

1488
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,360
There's a full the audience all gasps.

1489
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,800
I remember that.

1490
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:51,200
And then only she stands up and says, Steve.

1491
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:55,440
And then it's very embarrassing because the Indiana Jones gets up

1492
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,200
and it's it's really stunning.

1493
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,640
And then she said, oh, my God, I just yelled in front of this audience.

1494
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,640
I got a cover.

1495
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:07,120
And she covers very gracefully by saying, I'm sorry, it's Steve.

1496
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:11,920
No. One thinks you're really here,

1497
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:16,400
which is completely fine to the audience.

1498
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,160
They're like, oh, good.

1499
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:22,560
Doesn't has not heard any of the lead up of her seeing her boyfriend.

1500
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:27,840
I don't know why this quells them, but it does a masterful exit from.

1501
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,400
And she sits back down and that's like it didn't happen.

1502
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:35,480
Does the guy from step by step also do this?

1503
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,960
Maybe. Am I just imagining?

1504
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:40,720
Am I misremembering and I'm imagining I'm mushing up

1505
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,360
the step by step in Disney World and there's a lot of things like that

1506
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:48,200
where I believe both family matters and step by step of the same tower

1507
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:52,720
of terror sequence with the same elevator guy like going up.

1508
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:53,640
Oh, yeah.

1509
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:54,960
Filmed the same.

1510
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,600
The footage, the shots of the riot are the same.

1511
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:01,080
It's like the story to give the dad something to do

1512
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:04,280
because they didn't really figure out and I haven't be scared on terror there.

1513
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:08,960
So it's very possible that I could be Mandela affecting myself,

1514
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,600
which I have done before.

1515
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:15,120
But I swear it was either the oldest son or the neighbor from step by step

1516
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:19,960
coming through the ceiling dressed as Indiana Jones and one of the other kids.

1517
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:23,120
It's like and yeah, he does the sequence.

1518
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:26,400
It might be the step by step plot is that a friend of theirs

1519
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:31,360
who you rarely see in the series beyond this one episode that he carries,

1520
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:36,640
he is trying to reclaim the international gone on the most rides

1521
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,600
in a day title for America. Yes.

1522
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:45,120
Yes. And I think his credit for Indiana Jones is he does the show.

1523
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,040
He does the indie show.

1524
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,920
No, I don't know. I can't remember.

1525
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,880
I'm trying to think. I'm not saying I disagree.

1526
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,040
I'm just thinking. I don't know.

1527
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,280
I looked I don't have I looked up my step by step.

1528
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:57,960
So I don't I don't know.

1529
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,680
I looked up step by step Indiana Jones, but it's not even maybe step by step.

1530
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,360
Disney World. I don't know.

1531
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,920
And obvious. And of course, the family matters one is that he uses the

1532
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:14,520
Urkel the Steve Urkel to Stefan or Kel transformation with the transformation

1533
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:18,840
machine at interventions, defeating David Lander of Lenny and Squiggy fame.

1534
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:23,080
Just want to make sure I get that out there. Yeah, yeah, that's important.

1535
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,800
These are the finest pieces of art alongside Michael and Mickey.

1536
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:29,680
If you want to keep looking, I'll say what I have.

1537
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,720
Yeah. Yeah. You were really excited.

1538
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,800
I can you just do Hulu on your phone without the app?

1539
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,480
Hey, audience, my Hulu isn't working.

1540
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,360
How does it look? I guess I have to log in.

1541
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,680
Yeah, probably. Please talk.

1542
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:47,680
And because I I didn't understand your your clues that you gave.

1543
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,680
I'm so curious what you're going to tell us about.

1544
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,880
I'm well, look, I think other other TV shows that use this.

1545
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,760
And it's going to make a lot of sense when I say it.

1546
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:59,840
OK. But of course, a show that shot a lot around Walt Disney World.

1547
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,800
Here we go. Thunder in Paradise.

1548
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:08,920
You use the full like sequence like Hulk running through.

1549
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,480
Yes. The sequence.

1550
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,880
Of course, it was not just they were at Disney World.

1551
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:18,440
They were in another country, a fake country that doesn't exist.

1552
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:23,640
Northern Tana Asia or Tana Asia or something.

1553
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:28,960
That's like the name of the country, the country, the dictator rules.

1554
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,280
Yeah, right. Or is it the country that where that guy got stuck

1555
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,560
in the airport terminal because of the war?

1556
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,400
Oh, right. It's the same country.

1557
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,560
The term is correct.

1558
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,320
Hoja. What am I talking about?

1559
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,320
Crocosia. I should know better.

1560
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:47,920
This is Tana Asia, Tana Asia, I think is maybe what it's pronounced.

1561
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,720
Tanzania combined with.

1562
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:55,040
Yeah. And it's they shot at the Morocco Pavilion.

1563
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,480
Yes. Oh, I can watch this.

1564
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:01,560
And I finally found right before we started, I found the episode.

1565
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,840
Yeah. It's let me know.

1566
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,400
I have too many windows open full of thunder and pear.

1567
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,960
So if you don't know what we're talking about, Thunder in Paradise

1568
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:14,800
was a Hulk Hogan starring syndicated show in the vein of Baywatch,

1569
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,600
where he and Jack Lemmon's son

1570
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,840
drove a boat around that was named Thunder.

1571
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:23,440
That was kind of like Nightboat from the Simpsons was like night.

1572
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:25,720
It was Knight Rider's car.

1573
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:29,200
They could talk to them, it could transform, and they would go around

1574
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:33,520
talking to beautiful ladies and solving crimes

1575
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,760
and like busting drug smugglers or whatever.

1576
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:40,680
Let me I'll give you a few of the we're going to do a full episode eventually.

1577
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,000
Hulk Hogan played, of course, ex Navy SEAL Randolph,

1578
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,240
J Hurricane Spencer and Chris Lemon.

1579
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:50,480
Jack Lemmon's son played Martin Brew, Brew Baker.

1580
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,000
And then there were other obviously other folks on the show as well.

1581
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:59,560
So the clip, if I can find it here, it's in a it's episode seven

1582
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,320
Sealed with a Kismet part two

1583
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:06,680
sealed with a Kismet.

1584
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:09,120
And you just here, I'll show you a little bit.

1585
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,320
Obviously, we'll post a link to this.

1586
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:15,160
But let me see. Here we go.

1587
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,400
Like there here is Hulk there.

1588
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,920
This is the Morocco Pavilion.

1589
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:24,320
They're getting chased very slowly by, again, bad guys.

1590
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:28,800
Yeah, let's just say these these are bad hombres who are following them.

1591
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,880
This is an underwear ad.

1592
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:31,840
And then here you go.

1593
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,600
That's the Indiana Jones stunt set. Wow.

1594
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:38,200
And they're just having Chris Lemon, Jack Lemmon's son

1595
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,840
has just kicked a bad guy off the third floor.

1596
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,680
Noticeably worse at it than actual the actual.

1597
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,160
Yeah, like in the Indiana Jones Hulk Hulk.

1598
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,000
Yeah, punching him in the face.

1599
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,800
And they do. There's the there's a swing, the swing.

1600
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,200
This is so smart.

1601
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,480
The producers of the show were so

1602
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:58,080
this is a job I would have loved to have had being the guy

1603
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,280
who knew everything there is to do at Disney World.

1604
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,960
There it goes that we could film the whole we can make up this

1605
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:07,360
tan Zoja episode and just film it at the stunt show.

1606
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:10,600
Yeah. So it's a working TV and movie studio right here in Orlando.

1607
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,920
Florida. Right. It's not a place with the worst weather in the world

1608
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,520
for filming television movies.

1609
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,280
And Chris Lemon on the ladder gag.

1610
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,480
And then Hulk pushes it back.

1611
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,520
It's like really like it looks pretty good, honestly.

1612
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:27,680
Like it looks like you wouldn't have thought that this was a theme park

1613
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,040
stunt show set.

1614
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,480
It's a zip line.

1615
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,080
Why is there a zip?

1616
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,200
That's in the show.

1617
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,280
Yeah, but why in the body?

1618
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,240
You have a zip line.

1619
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,040
Yeah. So there she is.

1620
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:38,840
And then, yeah.

1621
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:43,440
So, whoa, it's yeah, they really they really use it very well.

1622
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,720
And if you like

1623
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,280
Thunder in Paradise is one season,

1624
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:53,600
there's an underwater base where they use the living seas on one episode.

1625
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,320
Yeah.

1626
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:58,480
Well, the whole thing is insane for how much it's shot on the grounds.

1627
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,320
Much of it because Hulk Hogan did not want to commute,

1628
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,600
like did not want to drive very far.

1629
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,000
I think well, I think part of it, I think it was it was a cheap.

1630
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
It was a like cheapness thing like they could make it.

1631
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,520
They they were desperate for productions.

1632
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:14,160
Yeah.

1633
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:18,280
I think I think like they were they were banking on this being Baywatch

1634
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,120
and making just so much money.

1635
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,920
Yeah. And as I said before, I don't know.

1636
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:25,760
The premise of a big boat that takes you to made up foreign countries.

1637
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,960
Night. It's Nightboat.

1638
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,200
The crime solving boat.

1639
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,200
Also, the inside of the boat is so funny.

1640
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,840
Just old. Yeah.

1641
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:37,200
Yeah. Like, yeah.

1642
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,440
Equipment borrowed from, you know,

1643
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,120
originals from the lost in space bat cave.

1644
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:47,120
Yeah. So there's other stuff that's filmed there, but that one man

1645
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,600
is really a big one thing.

1646
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,760
So smart, so crafty.

1647
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:55,880
Good job. Location manager for Thunder in Paradise.

1648
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:59,120
Oh, I wish I had the most in this world.

1649
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:04,040
One of the big changes to this attraction over the years in 2004,

1650
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:06,560
they took out the swastika.

1651
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:07,960
There used to be.

1652
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:09,480
Let's not lose sight of.

1653
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,280
Now it's just kind of more a generic looking.

1654
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,800
If someone called it a Greek cross, but I don't know if that's right.

1655
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:19,920
More generic looking like bad guy symbol, probably for the best.

1656
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,920
They got rid of the crossians.

1657
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,440
It's like the first order.

1658
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:28,480
It's a big, weird, fascist order flag that is hanging in the message.

1659
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:32,080
So they don't seem to crossians for over three years.

1660
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,040
Dina Jones is to take care of it.

1661
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,600
No propeller trap door.

1662
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,640
No swastikas.

1663
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,920
Those were the major changes, but still running.

1664
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:40,280
Still a big crowd pleaser.

1665
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:43,920
Still a good way to get 2000 people out of the Florida sun.

1666
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:48,080
We'll see what changes come to it.

1667
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:48,960
They certainly do.

1668
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,440
You think anybody out there is mad when they see a cross

1669
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:56,680
because they were reared on the Indiana Jones stunt show

1670
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:59,040
and they assume a cross is a symbol of hate.

1671
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:04,920
If they see they see a hospital and they're like, what is this a hate rally?

1672
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:08,520
I mean, they must be really confused if they watch Last Crusade

1673
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:12,800
and see the Knights Templar guy at the very end covered in crosses.

1674
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:18,640
I have just landed at I've been skimming Daily Motion

1675
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:22,320
this whole time you've been talking and I've I'm about to find out

1676
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:24,960
they're in line at the Indiana Jones stunt spectacular.

1677
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,840
Dude is concerned about time.

1678
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,800
Their friend who we never see otherwise.

1679
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:33,120
They stop being friends after the stressful world record ordeal.

1680
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:37,640
There's a kid who wants to see the show.

1681
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,480
This is it. Yes, he wants to see the show, but they have to get to their plane.

1682
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,160
They have to. They're leaving that day.

1683
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:47,080
And the only way is if oh, no, it must be that.

1684
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,040
Yeah, you're totally right.

1685
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,160
The kid is sad.

1686
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:53,600
He came all this way to see Indiana Jones, but the actor is sick.

1687
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,160
So they have to cancel it.

1688
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,200
Oh, I wish there was something I could do.

1689
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:02,400
But and he volunteers to be Indiana Jones in the show right on Jason.

1690
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,720
Yes. Not a Mandela. Great.

1691
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:09,440
Of course through the ceiling does the it's just the whole thing.

1692
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,880
Watch it again. You just watch this beautiful sequence.

1693
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,520
What a great in the same way.

1694
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,680
And these were all my favorite.

1695
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,840
I never liked the stories of the sitcoms.

1696
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,960
I liked when a band played a bunch of songs.

1697
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,600
And I like when they just did have the whole theme parks show

1698
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,280
and ate up most of the act.

1699
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,560
And that's what this is. Yeah. He falls in the pit.

1700
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,800
Disney found a way for to make two of their shows.

1701
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,680
Just do Indiana Jones and eat up five minutes of the episode.

1702
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,640
Don't try this at home.

1703
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:43,160
But the child characters on your favorite shows can try this at home.

1704
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:47,080
They can put their untrained lives in the hands of stunt professionals.

1705
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:50,640
They need to where the show is canceled and a child.

1706
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,960
I'm not I'm not sure if he's a sick child.

1707
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,920
That's all possible.

1708
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,320
He could be a sick child.

1709
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,760
And his day is saved by this brave friend who, again,

1710
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,520
I cannot remember the name of because he's never in the show otherwise.

1711
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,040
And we are saved by daily motion.

1712
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:09,520
The last wild wild west on the Internet.

1713
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,720
The lawless lawless where some of your favorite shows are.

1714
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,280
And you don't want to go by in one of the many, many streaming pay walls.

1715
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:21,440
If you don't want to pay for it, do you want to find some full wrestling

1716
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:24,360
pay per views in odd aspect ratios?

1717
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:25,640
Yeah.

1718
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:28,720
I was you know, I'm looking at Moonbeam City right now.

1719
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:31,320
It's pretty low qual, so I wouldn't recommend that.

1720
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:35,040
I would. OK. I'd recommend the tried and true method of DMing me.

1721
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,080
Yeah, it's gone. It's the only way now.

1722
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,400
So Daily Motion is letting me down on the movie.

1723
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:43,200
Of course, DM Jason for Crowdman Dude and the flaming sword of fire.

1724
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:47,440
You know, I I read the biggest crowd man dude, flings or fire fansite.

1725
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:50,000
Thanks for thanks for storing those.

1726
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,600
You know, it's your one man library.

1727
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:55,000
It belongs in a museum.

1728
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:00,360
Well, let me skim any other notes I had.

1729
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,920
Oh, I forgot I had the name.

1730
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,320
They're what they're they're the crocs.

1731
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,720
They're not Nazis. They're cross seas.

1732
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:11,320
OK, really? I know that's what I'm calling them.

1733
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,120
That's what he's got. All right.

1734
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,840
Cross. Yeah, guys.

1735
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:18,680
Um, I don't I don't know.

1736
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:20,920
I mean, I might not have anything else. Any any final?

1737
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,640
We hit the major sequences.

1738
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,960
Yeah, I mean, it's it's a good show.

1739
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:28,080
I think, you know what you're saying when it comes back.

1740
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,640
Is it the first Disney stunt show?

1741
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,080
It's very much borrowing that universal template.

1742
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:36,000
And they still are not universals done way more than Disney.

1743
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,080
You know, it's done more.

1744
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:40,480
But Disney, this doesn't have any like canned dialogue.

1745
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:43,360
They're all saying their own dialogue, I feel like.

1746
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:47,880
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think it's in the traditional way a stunt show is.

1747
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:51,560
Obviously, they had shows where like performers would do like stuff

1748
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,920
like Zorro was at New Orleans Square and their whatever.

1749
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,800
Or I guess Frontierland.

1750
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,200
But this was their first arena show.

1751
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,480
And Universal had a lot more old West stuff.

1752
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,680
Oh, man, what was I going to say?

1753
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,800
Yeah, I mean, Universal clearly

1754
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,480
took nods from some of this for Waterworld.

1755
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,160
Yeah, but they use the cart.

1756
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:16,800
They use the like canned dialogue a lot more in that.

1757
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,240
Oh, this is exclusive.

1758
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:22,000
This has never been replicated at another Disney park,

1759
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,880
exclusive to MGM Studios and now Hollywood Studios.

1760
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,720
I do things that I don't really do that make me maybe like maybe subconsciously

1761
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:31,040
or why didn't go when we were down in Florida?

1762
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:36,120
I don't like how much of it is teaching extras to do stuff.

1763
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:40,640
It's a big percentage of time to make all those set changes happen.

1764
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:41,960
I don't love that.

1765
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:45,600
And I also don't love that while all of the moving the sets apart is very cool.

1766
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:47,800
The boulder sequence is right in your face,

1767
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,840
but then there's progressively and progressively further away.

1768
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,880
So you have a man's seat in there.

1769
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,560
You're really that's true.

1770
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,000
Like the plane sequence is very far.

1771
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,760
Yeah, compared to Waterworld.

1772
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,440
Yes. Which is your face action. Right.

1773
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:06,240
That's that is that is a bummer to me.

1774
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,640
I'll say this, they play a little more downstairs now, I think,

1775
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,600
because they're not using that trap door.

1776
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:14,920
So the plane, they start to the fight kind of

1777
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:19,880
you need to get the big mechanic in front of the plane closer to the mat.

1778
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,360
And so the gunshots go off.

1779
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,400
I see a little closer to there.

1780
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,240
But yeah, I mean, it's a little bit of work to watch, too,

1781
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:31,760
because they want you in the seat like 30, 20 to 30 minutes beforehand.

1782
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:35,040
And then they do that pre show, like get the audience members,

1783
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,240
get them into wardrobe.

1784
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:39,960
That's my memories. It's a long time to commit.

1785
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:42,640
The show itself is 25 minutes plus another

1786
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,680
10, 7 to 15 minute give or take.

1787
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:48,480
So it is a long, yeah, a long stunt show.

1788
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,040
Especially when we were there the first day.

1789
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,320
You're there the first day. You want to ride things.

1790
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,240
You want to see things. Yeah.

1791
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,320
It's like you got to take it.

1792
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,840
I think we just walked to identical galaxy's edge.

1793
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:00,120
And what did we do?

1794
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:03,080
And then I took it. I took I took a skyliner to Epcot.

1795
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:06,000
Saw the Bahamian. Yeah. Yeah.

1796
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,000
Hmm. Very fine.

1797
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,240
We didn't go go go.

1798
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,280
It's a good break. I saw different show.

1799
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,880
I saw one of the Bahamian doing flips. That's true.

1800
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,360
Yeah, they did stunts.

1801
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:19,920
The what if the Bahamian were added to the show permanently?

1802
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,960
I mean, look, we can go a little like this.

1803
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,080
I read the press release about Disney's holiday specials coming up,

1804
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,840
and there's a sting and shaggy duet in one of them.

1805
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:32,040
Oh, I saw that.

1806
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:35,160
You just come triumphantly from the

1807
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:38,320
universally beloved Little Mermaid Live.

1808
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,560
Mostly animated movie with some live song.

1809
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,400
Is he in that? Yeah, he's Sebastian.

1810
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:47,520
He's Sebastian. Wow. Shaggy's on a comeback tour. Yeah.

1811
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:52,400
Wow. Yeah, I don't.

1812
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:56,240
The he had to he had to act a little bit.

1813
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:59,560
I didn't see this myself, but apparently at the he's

1814
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:04,160
kiss the girl at the end of Kiss the Girl, he has to do like a

1815
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:05,960
like

1816
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:10,000
I he is like the kiss doesn't work out and they fall.

1817
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:14,360
And then he has to do just like a take of like, oh no, he like slaps his head

1818
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:18,920
in some shaggy, maybe not the finest actors is what I'm saying.

1819
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,160
Hmm. I don't know.

1820
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,560
His comeback might be limited in that regard.

1821
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:27,720
I don't know. I I'd love to disagree, but we don't have time.

1822
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,400
Love to have an argument about this.

1823
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,960
Well, have we survived? I guess we have. Yeah.

1824
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,120
Survived. Yeah.

1825
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:36,760
Yeah, we did. We dodged all of the pitfalls.

1826
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:39,800
Thanks to the magic of every spike. Yeah.

1827
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,640
And the bad guys is important.

1828
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,880
So bad dudes. We were those.

1829
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:48,160
Yeah, those I don't know where they're from or what they're mad about.

1830
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,800
No, they're bad. They're bad.

1831
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,160
Now, it matters that they're bad.

1832
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:54,320
You got bad guy attire and symbols.

1833
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:01,360
But not from the real but not the real world.

1834
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,320
Say that for the movies.

1835
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:05,600
Yeah. All right. Well, yes.

1836
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:10,400
The upcoming film where Indiana Jones solves Vietnam himself.

1837
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,360
Bionnual Bionnual.

1838
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:15,880
All right. It inevitably says we're better than this.

1839
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:22,080
Great. Hollywood's Hollywood's big contribution to the cultural conversation.

1840
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,080
We're better than this.

1841
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:27,200
Come together and meet in the middle.

1842
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,200
Compromise is where we'll find our.

1843
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:34,000
True, true power.

1844
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,080
Avoid the boulder of oppression.

1845
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,160
Compromise is our treasure.

1846
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,680
OK, so long.

1847
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:42,640
Bye. Goodbye.
