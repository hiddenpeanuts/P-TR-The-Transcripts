1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,600
Let's talk about Madam in Manhattan.

2
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,920
Yeah, go ahead.

3
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,120
Yeah.

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,520
Yeah.

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,960
Yeah, well, it's on my mind because Madam in Manhattan was the, uh, where did it land in the poll?

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,320
It's the, oh, the last, last place.

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:46,480
Uh, that makes the second to last, not the second to last, the second last place finish for Madam in one of these polls.

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:56,440
In this, in this case, uh, accidental PTR legend and completer, Griffin Newman, uh, made a plea for us to consider it rather than the

9
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:06,160
broader topic of, because it's too much to take on Whalen Flowers and Madam all at once that we should start piecing it off.

10
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,760
Right, right, right.

11
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:13,040
And doing smaller areas at a time of the, of the Madam universe.

12
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:20,000
And the, how, by the way, how the Club3 polling works, you know, sometimes we'll remind you to, to vote with your likes.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,800
If you look at those, look, look at suggestions in the comments and hit like on it, if you, because we do pay attention to that.

14
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,320
That's what, uh, forms what we call the popular vote, the one that does well enough that, all right, well, that's the people's choice.

15
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,520
And, uh, we should put that into the poll and Griffin's plea won the popular vote.

16
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:45,880
Like, wow, people are maybe into, let's just, let's just do Madam in Manhattan, which seems to be a special from 1981.

17
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:55,080
Uh, and, uh, and I'm like, wow, geez, maybe Madam is, this is the way to, and with, with Griffin's endorsement, one of the strongest endorsements,

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:05,000
you can have over in Club3 and instead straight to the bottom, as soon as the poll went live, could not have been faster to the bottom.

19
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:16,600
Uh, and I guess what I'm getting at here is, and this is not, uh, you know, I don't, I don't like to say this, but I, I just, I'm just going to call it how I see it.

20
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:16,920
Yeah.

21
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,400
I don't believe that a puppet candidate can win the Club3 poll.

22
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,560
I don't think that the, the Club3 electorate is ever going to accept a puppet candidate.

23
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,880
And I don't know if that's, maybe that's not a good thing.

24
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,880
Maybe that's backwards.

25
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:39,000
Maybe we should be more free thinking, but I'm just like, you know, in our lifetime, in this, in this century, I don't know that we're going to see a puppet win the poll.

26
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:39,920
Okay.

27
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,640
That's a good question.

28
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,680
I mean, there has to be, there will be a puppet candidate that will win this poll.

29
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,360
I believe I'm an optimist.

30
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,080
Because I also, this isn't just Madam.

31
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm going off of a lot of cold plays, weirdos came in with a lot of hype and then, uh, not, not the bottom.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,080
That was like, that was strong showing four puppets, but, uh, uh, at this point, Madam has lost twice.

33
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,280
And so somehow Mike's excitement is toxic.

34
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,840
I don't get it.

35
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,720
Thank you for saying that.

36
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,320
You don't get it.

37
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,000
I appreciate that.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,120
I like, you, you, you always take us on such fun rides.

39
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,880
So I'm willing to give it a shot.

40
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:22,320
Dummies, I mean, I guess dummies, dummies versus puppets also.

41
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,320
Cause I almost feel like Madam is more of a dummy than a puppet.

42
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:34,680
Weirdos are puppets more in the Jim Henson muppets variety, but Madam, I think, and maybe I'm not the expert on this.

43
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:43,080
Madam is closer to sort of like a knight of the living dummy, uh, you know, Charlie McCarthy, of course, the famous, the famous ventriloquist dummies.

44
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,200
Even, even like Terry fader or Jeff Dunham's puppets, um, what's the old man?

45
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,120
Jeff Dunham puppet.

46
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,040
Do you remember Walter?

47
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,560
Walter.

48
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,160
Thank you.

49
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,160
You are a puppet.

50
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,640
You're a puppet fan.

51
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,400
You're just fully a puppet guy.

52
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,120
I love, well, am I more of a puppet guy?

53
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,160
I mean, I am a puppet guy.

54
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,400
You're right about that, but I also dummy.

55
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,080
I like dumb.

56
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,440
There's something about dummies too.

57
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:12,920
Is the difference, does puppet maybe more connotate that I'm not sure that the lines here, this is, you know, I don't know exactly the rules much

58
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:23,160
like the rules between what makes a dildo and what makes a vibrator, but does, does puppet imply more that the, the operator is not seen?

59
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,320
Yeah, I think so.

60
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:31,040
Because if we know the name of the, and we see the person operating, does that put us more in the dummy territory?

61
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,360
Yeah, I think that's probably part of it as well.

62
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,160
There is an interesting culture around ventriloquists and dummies.

63
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,040
Yes.

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,480
That does, that does sound interesting and like an interesting area for a different podcast to pursue.

65
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:52,560
Oh, you don't like the museum they all go to when the ventriloquist dies and the dummy goes.

66
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,640
Oh God, that sounds very grim.

67
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,320
Where's that?

68
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,520
I forget, I forget.

69
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,960
There's at least one, if not more, resting places for the dummies.

70
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,720
You'll like it.

71
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,280
It's nice.

72
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,640
There's other dummies there.

73
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,400
You'll make a lot of, you know, these could be the golden years of your life.

74
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,320
You know, life without an operator, without a puppeteer can be the greatest life you've ever had.

75
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,440
Mike, you found, we were talking about on one of the Scott Free episodes, ventriloquist.

76
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,520
Your favorite new character you didn't know about, Knucklehead Smith.

77
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:25,880
Yeah.

78
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,080
Yeah.

79
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:35,200
Well, this is a whole other, okay, because like some behind the scenes, there's been some behind the scenes, puppets, dummies, discussions,

80
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,920
whatever you want to call it, in text message form.

81
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,760
And I was kind of wondering if it might go here because the reason why Knucklehead Smith came up.

82
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,120
Excuse me, Scott.

83
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,560
Smith, S-M-I-F-F.

84
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,280
Very good.

85
00:05:49,400 --> 00:06:00,080
The reason why Knucklehead Smith came up is because you were talking about this show that had Tigger in it and thus the original voice of Tigger, Paul Winchell.

86
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,560
Yes.

87
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,240
And, oh, thank you.

88
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,280
Thank you for the visual.

89
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,520
Paul Winchell and Knucklehead Smith.

90
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,040
Oh, thank you.

91
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:14,800
Well, yes, of course, Jerry Mahoney, the very famous, the very famous reference that certainly you don't need someone on the episode to say, what the fuck is that?

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,800
Here's what happened.

93
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,920
We're still in Scott response territory a little bit.

94
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,520
I'm listening to this.

95
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,600
I contributed to that episode, but I wasn't on it.

96
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:32,920
And this just went by and this is, we plowed past this in the first four minutes that Mike said at some point, now Paul Winchell and his

97
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,040
dummy, of course, Jerry Mahoney.

98
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,840
And that's a reference you hear a lot.

99
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,880
And Jason said, and I went, I have never heard of this in my life.

100
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,600
Jerry, I'll reference you hear a lot.

101
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:55,080
So I started going at you in text message form about this and your proof that it is a reference made a lot is that it was referenced on a Seinfeld 30 years ago.

102
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
I've never, ever heard of it.

103
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
I feel like I heard it.

104
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,520
It's just a given that we barely even need to go over this, that Paul Winchell's dummy is Jerry Mahoney.

105
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,240
Yes, of course.

106
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,040
I look at my life.

107
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,640
I come across dummies more often.

108
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,600
I guess I did explain it.

109
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,480
I didn't just say, I, you know, if I didn't explain it, I think I would be on the hook here.

110
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,280
Were you scared and sloppy?

111
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,800
But you were explaining in that way of like, okay, I guess let's say it.

112
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:27,000
But of course, everybody knows Paul Winchell, Jerry Mahoney, he was done with that rushing through it air, which then Jason's like, Jason didn't fucking know.

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
He said he didn't know.

114
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,880
Yeah, I didn't know.

115
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:36,640
But when I saw him, I was like, oh, okay, I kind of recognize now partially because he looks like what all dummies look like.

116
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,040
In the mid 20th century, they look very similar.

117
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:47,600
I mostly associate it with this, with Slappy, the night of living dummy from Goose Bums, who I was scared of.

118
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,120
Well, right, he is scary.

119
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,440
That is part of my fascination with the dummy, I think, is that I'm scared of dummies.

120
00:07:52,680 --> 00:08:02,560
And this is now and this came up in a recent episode that I think that we're trying to put this on that in that Chukko territory of like, is it is the fascination because of the fear?

121
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,200
And on my end, it's not fear.

122
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,400
It's it.

123
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,920
I don't like these things because they stink.

124
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,800
And I do believe that the I think the stats on Madam prove that ultimately people do not know what the fuck this is.

125
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:24,880
To allude to another another recent campaign in the last few months, I think that the Madam team has failed to tell the Madam story.

126
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,760
I think that ultimately they have not created a compelling story.

127
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,480
Yeah, well, that's a good point.

128
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,560
And it's that's on me to tell a more compelling Madam story.

129
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,000
I such as step one.

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,640
What the fuck is Madam?

131
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,520
You need like the oomph of like two storytellers, Vicki Lawrence and Mama.

132
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,400
No, no, no, we are not.

133
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,920
I'm not engaging any more with Vicki Lawrence and Mama.

134
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:53,320
Can I ask, do you know the the dummy that do you know?

135
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,920
I think it's Edgar Bergen's dummy.

136
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,200
Well, that was said earlier.

137
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,240
It's Charlie McCarty.

138
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:06,920
Yeah, I just had a conversation with friend of the show, Andrew Grissom, about this because Grissom watched whatever Disney movie.

139
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,760
One of those like war era Disney movies with the wraparounds are Edgar Bergen and his his dummies.

140
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,040
And he brought all this up to say, hey, I watched this this movie with these ventriloquist dummies in it.

141
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,760
I hated it.

142
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,040
I hated every second that these stupid dummies were in it.

143
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,720
And he didn't know the names.

144
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,640
He'd never heard of any of this before.

145
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:36,880
For the Disney fan out there, the famous the Mickey and the Beanstalk short was originally presented in this package where there were it was all narrated by.

146
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,200
Who is the other one?

147
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,400
I think I did. Is the other one Mortimer Snurd?

148
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,000
Yes.

149
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,760
OK, yes.

150
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,560
I do know my dummies, dummies.

151
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,760
But originally, if you watch Mickey and the Beanstalk, it was all narrated by these like, oh, what's he going to do?

152
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,160
And then they they did it in a more palatable packaging, which is how we saw it.

153
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,760
I think I think I'm right about all that.

154
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,040
Was it unpleasant?

155
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,880
Yeah, life on the home front was hard during the war.

156
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,800
Give him a pass.

157
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,080
Anything unpleasant from during the war?

158
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:12,000
It got very confusing when Charlie McCarthy was drafted, but not Edgar Bergen.

159
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,040
And so is it possible Mortimer Snurd's voice being annoying?

160
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,640
Is he ever thought about that?

161
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,960
Maybe it was due to shells going off.

162
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,560
Very possible. Yes.

163
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,880
That's ringing in his ears.

164
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,800
You need to talk normally if he could.

165
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,920
He recorded his audio in the Pacific Theater.

166
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:42,720
The look, I'm trying to think about my relationship with dummies in general, and it is something because, like, one of my favorite Batman villains is Scarface.

167
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,920
That's the name of the character.

168
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,320
Scarface and the Ventriloquist.

169
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,480
And and so that's like one of the only my Batman animated series figures are in a box except for that one.

170
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,920
OK, this is not on purpose.

171
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,200
This is just now that I'm thinking about it out loud that I must have something.

172
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,040
That's the one that you kept out of.

173
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,560
Well, it's just, yeah, it's out of the box and eventually they'll all be displayed, hopefully.

174
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,280
So he's watching you sleep on your nightstand.

175
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,600
Yes, correct.

176
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,640
Well, he's not in my nightstand.

177
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:17,600
And also, and just to do just to do further math, then you are at once the most out of the three of us concerned about seeming youthful and aware of new music.

178
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,160
Yes.

179
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:24,520
And also you are, as the years go by, becoming more of a Ventriloquist fan.

180
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,720
Do you feel you can reconcile these two things?

181
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,880
I was listening to M.J.

182
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,800
Lenderman today, his album from twenty twenty four.

183
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,640
That's a young man.

184
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,360
He's in his mid 20s.

185
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,960
Now, you surprise me there.

186
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,320
That's a name that I don't know.

187
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,560
And when you said that, I think what I went to was M.J.

188
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,120
Lenderman. Now meet my friend Skippy.

189
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,640
Hey, hey, M.J.

190
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,480
It is. It kind of sounds like a Ventriloquist.

191
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,560
It does sound like that.

192
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,360
But but in addition to that, then I also will watch a clip from Madam's Place.

193
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,800
The episode that I think is really the one I want to do is the one with the army clip.

194
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,560
I keep mentioning.

195
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,680
That's the thing that really started my love affair with wanting to talk about Madam.

196
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,920
So, yes, I got both.

197
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,880
I mean, look, I can't fight you on this.

198
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,240
I've mostly been exploring the works of

199
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,560
Barbara Stanwyck and exploring, you say?

200
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:21,120
Yeah, she made so many movies exploring me besides watching the movies.

201
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,240
Wait, hold on. I don't think he's watched them necessarily.

202
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,520
That's right. We might be reading with you.

203
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,280
Yeah, yeah. Wait a minute. Hold on.

204
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,400
No, I have been watching.

205
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,600
OK, how many? How many?

206
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,320
Uh, just a couple so far.

207
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,400
OK, so two. One and a half.

208
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,760
But I think the Lady Eve is like really funny, like really terrific.

209
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,680
It's a Preston Sturgis movie.

210
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,200
Now name a young person that you're interested in as well.

211
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,000
Give me the youngest person that you've interacted with their art in the last two weeks.

212
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,480
Sabrina Carpenter.

213
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,240
Sabrina. This is another thing that I have, by the way, is that all of our

214
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,160
that the desire to be relevant on this show, like like like.

215
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,080
Mitcham is the other very old actor I've really been.

216
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,520
I'm going to say that's the next youngest person you've been enjoying.

217
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,000
Being relevant on this show is completely hand in hand

218
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,120
with just knowing the names of the most popular singers in the world.

219
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,680
That's how that's how we get like how I'm relevant.

220
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,920
I know what this is.

221
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,520
I know about this artist who is big enough to play in arenas.

222
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,240
It's kind of like saying, I'm I'm hip.

223
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,400
I know who the Clippers are.

224
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,160
Well, that would make you at least, you know, sports, you know, if you do.

225
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,160
That's one of the that's one of the freshest teams on the scene.

226
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,640
I recognize Lucy Arnaz

227
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,800
within 10 seconds or getting out of a taxi cab.

228
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,000
Right. And that's cool.

229
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,880
Well, and we'll we'll start making our way that way.

230
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,560
But I do have to say that, look, you might not.

231
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,640
There's some listeners who might not like how these polls are going,

232
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,680
but it is democracy. There's a lot of people.

233
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,960
You can't you can't argue with the numbers here.

234
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,840
And look, Madame was dead last.

235
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,800
And what's second place? Let me check.

236
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,480
Oh, Bugman does whatever he wants.

237
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,240
Second place again.

238
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,920
Bug's numbers are growing.

239
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,560
Bug went from twenty one to twenty five to twenty six.

240
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,600
A certain presidential candidate every every election.

241
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,960
I will say bigger and bigger every time.

242
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,880
Jane was excited to be considered,

243
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,160
but not thrilled to lose third place to Bugman.

244
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,800
But I suppose that's just karma

245
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,640
because of how much of the

246
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,600
she's been playing the Bugman album around the house.

247
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,040
This is the fiction that people invent

248
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,040
because I'm seeing people say a vote for Jane is against Bugman.

249
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,200
And I'm like, Jane likes Bug. I know this.

250
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,640
I know this for a fact.

251
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,120
Yeah. Bug is a friend of all of us.

252
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,960
This is insane. The notion that this is a troll, a troll.

253
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,560
How could it be a troll?

254
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,400
Bug is one of my good, my dearest friends,

255
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,080
a close collaborator for nearly 15 years.

256
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,360
He was one of the groomsmen at my wedding.

257
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,240
This he's even he has grown into.

258
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,760
Yes, I'll say an uncle figure to my son.

259
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,600
He's Uncle Bug, don't you see?

260
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,840
This is a this is a dear friend and not you guys aren't as close,

261
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,480
but you're but you're you're friends and fans of this friend.

262
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,960
The notion that we are only doing this as some just to rile people up.

263
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,880
Is it is it a troll to invite one of your closest friends into your home?

264
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
Not not where I come from.

265
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,600
So what can I say?

266
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,560
I guess this month,

267
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,320
listeners, if you see it in your hearts, bring Uncle Bug home.

268
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,720
And with that

269
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,360
and also somebody made of I think I think Ryan was the user.

270
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,880
Somebody made the very good point.

271
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,880
Every time that Bugmane loses anybody's in second place,

272
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,840
we're going to have to do this again.

273
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,280
And the bug haters are going to hear this name and the name is too much.

274
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,960
Here, just Bugmane.

275
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,080
I just they all just shivered.

276
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:10,000
They all people are so upset at the mere mention of I.

277
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,960
So look, he keep it.

278
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,240
We're between a rock and hard place here.

279
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,680
He stayed. He's he's not moved from that second.

280
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,200
But we've been doing this in September.

281
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,200
I have a I don't even know. I want to say it.

282
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,040
I feel like there's only one way he wins.

283
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,280
And that's if you split up,

284
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,440
you split up maybe like the anti-bug vote in a perfect way.

285
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,840
I don't have the equation for it, but I almost feel like

286
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,080
he cannot win the way that the club three is gerrymandered.

287
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,640
It's like it doesn't.

288
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,720
I'm not sure. I think there's a way.

289
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,040
I think as long as I make a separate new emotional appeal

290
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,360
at the top of every episode, this one was shorter than last time.

291
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,960
No, it's help. Yes. Yeah.

292
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,160
Well, I'm trying to keep it tight.

293
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,080
I don't want to waste it because that's going to rile people up.

294
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,240
Yeah. But the more that I speak to this man

295
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,960
and what I think he's capable of and what I think he's going to bring to an episode,

296
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,840
the voting options were Bugmane does whatever he wants

297
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:08,560
and then four slots for the short lived Lucy Arnaz show on CBS

298
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,560
that aired the year Scott and I were born.

299
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,320
That might work. Yeah.

300
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,280
Or four different episodes of Madam's Place.

301
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,440
That sounds good to me. Well, let's lock that in.

302
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,320
Yeah, it'll all be it'll all be separate Lucy Arnaz votes versus Bug.

303
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,880
And just to see how that that makes things play out.

304
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,200
I think we'll be doing this for another five years.

305
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,160
Yeah, that's this might be a perennial aspect of Club 3.

306
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,040
Yeah, just always we have to by what we and this is not new.

307
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,080
We always talk about what is the runner up.

308
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,040
And if that's how it's going to if he's going to be the runner up

309
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,600
and he has the votes to at least be the runner up, I think every time.

310
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,760
Is there any do we want to amend the concept?

311
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,760
Like, is should there be a year limit on something like this?

312
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,440
Ooh, you know what I mean? I don't know.

313
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,960
I'm not saying I even believe it.

314
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,120
Well, I think that's something to consider the next time there's one of these.

315
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,080
Oh, OK. Like, I don't know.

316
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,240
I think Bug deserves it because that's a new rule.

317
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,640
And I don't think that's fair. Bug should be able to,

318
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,400
you know, let it play out as long as he wants.

319
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,800
But let's say there was some other topic that, I don't know, was kind of a

320
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,200
like, let's say there was, you know, something more unpleasant

321
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,920
and ball chinned that got stuck in that second slot for a long time.

322
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,840
Yeah, I think then you might want to start creating some term limits.

323
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,200
I understand what you're saying. There's no way that ever happens.

324
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,200
Yes, we are.

325
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,080
The Club 3 Constitution is protected against,

326
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,160
you know, a madam type zealot from rising up because Madam

327
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,080
loses every single time.

328
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,640
Yeah, for a split second, I went, is he talking about the movie 43?

329
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,800
Does someone have a ball chant in that?

330
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,960
Yeah, right in the first.

331
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
Might be Jackman.

332
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,280
Oh, OK. I forget.

333
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,800
It's you and I watched that.

334
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,920
Do not, if I have to hear you talk about what apartment you watched

335
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,600
movie 43 at again, how is this becoming a five timer?

336
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,920
Where we watched movie 43.

337
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,720
And that's today's topic, movie 43.

338
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,960
Is Barbara Stanwyck in movie 43?

339
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,560
She is not, and Robert Mitcham isn't either, unfortunately.

340
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,880
Which Barbara Stanwyck's movies have you watched of her?

341
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,240
Lady Eve, there's one.

342
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,280
Lady Eve, right. What's the other one?

343
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,720
I have to find the other one.

344
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,880
All right. Well, so let's move on to the Space Mountain

345
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,080
opening special, which is what won the poll,

346
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,120
what did end up winning the poll this month.

347
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:33,160
This is something from from 50 years ago this year.

348
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,920
Now that we are in 2025, which I didn't realize.

349
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,520
You know what? This very month is the month.

350
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,280
January 1975, 50 years ago is when Space Mountain opened.

351
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,520
Now, does that mean that this will be the year that we talk about

352
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,720
Space Mountain on the show?

353
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,600
My money's on. No.

354
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,240
We're not brave enough.

355
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,840
I don't know if we're ready.

356
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,760
I don't want to rule it out, but I don't know if we're ready.

357
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,840
There's quite a lot of them.

358
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,080
There are a lot of them being demolished as we speak.

359
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,320
That's true. Yes, that's true.

360
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,520
All right. New ones being rebuilt.

361
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,120
New times for Space Mountain.

362
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,400
But I would say then, if you find the name of the movie,

363
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,240
I just wanted to keep things, I just wanted to keep things moving.

364
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,320
No, I forget.

365
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,200
You didn't. There's no other movie.

366
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,880
I got to search my private letterbox.

367
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,280
You've been exploring the filmography.

368
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,400
I watched one movie.

369
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,320
Well, I certainly have read about both of them quite a lot.

370
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,240
Why? I've been exploring the Lyle Wagner filmography.

371
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,360
I watched one special and I for another one.

372
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,320
I think I forget.

373
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,360
I remembered the existence of the Linda Carter Wonder Woman.

374
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,320
Oh, that's right.

375
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,080
That was Lyle Wagner in his big role.

376
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,520
That and the Carol Burnett show, I think.

377
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,360
Yes. Yeah, Lyle Wagner, one of the hosts of this special,

378
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,000
has been on my radar not from watching anything,

379
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,760
but he's just kind of an interesting figure in Hollywood lore

380
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,360
because he apparently screen tested for Batman

381
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,080
and lost to Adam West, of course, and rightfully so.

382
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,240
But he ended up on Carol Burnett.

383
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,880
Thus, he was in kind of the like cool world of people

384
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,840
that P.T. Anderson's dad, Ernie Anderson, was in.

385
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,880
And because I'm interested in old Valley lore,

386
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,920
because I grew up in the Valley and licorice pizzas

387
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,800
set in the 70s and shot in the Valley,

388
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,320
all the scenes with Bradley Cooper as John Peters,

389
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,480
that's the guy's name, producer,

390
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,120
Robert Streisand's husband, the crazy Tudor style,

391
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,680
manor style house where all his scenes take place,

392
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,320
that is the former home of Lyle Wagner.

393
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,160
When he filmed this, that is where he lived.

394
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,440
He lived at that house. Wow.

395
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,520
Way up the hill in Encino,

396
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,760
and I know that because there's a really cool,

397
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,720
if you are into old San Fernando Valley stuff

398
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,560
or just licorice pizza, P.T. Anderson,

399
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,000
he did this great interview with a writer,

400
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,920
Esther Zuckerman, who wanted to talk to him

401
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,680
because that's the house she grew up in.

402
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,000
Her parents bought it from Lyle Wagner.

403
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,840
Oh, wow.

404
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,480
And then like, would he give me five minutes

405
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,320
to talk about this?

406
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,720
And he gave her half an hour.

407
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,560
And she started like,

408
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,200
no, I don't know if it was communicated to you why you were,

409
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
and he's like, no, no, no, I know.

410
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,840
Okay, so did you buy it from Lyle Wagner?

411
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,920
Like he just wanted to drive straight to it.

412
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,200
Love his old Valley shit.

413
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,200
That's cool.

414
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,640
And so this guy in the special, Lyle Wagner,

415
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,680
he left the Carol Burnett Show,

416
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,200
thus vacating the announcer spot,

417
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,520
which was taken over by Ernie Anderson,

418
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,440
P.T. Anderson's father.

419
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,520
The second Barbara Stanwyck movie is called

420
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,360
Sorry Wrong Number.

421
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,880
It was her fourth Academy Award nomination.

422
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,800
And the second lead in it is Burt Lancaster,

423
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,080
another great actor.

424
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,920
Yeah.

425
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,760
He is great.

426
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,040
Sweet Smell of Success, great movie.

427
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,880
Great.

428
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,720
I've never seen that.

429
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,540
Well, we got it.

430
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,400
You're gonna watch all four of those Oscar noms?

431
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,240
Let's make it true.

432
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,080
I don't know the other ones.

433
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,200
I should search them out.

434
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,520
You know, Tooby has quite a few classic movies.

435
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,080
Shout out to Tooby.

436
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,440
What about Jason takes us through the filmography

437
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,960
of Barbara Stanwyck as a club three suggestion?

438
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,440
Bugs shaking now.

439
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,760
You know what is very funny?

440
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,760
If you read the politics tab on her Wikipedia,

441
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,840
it is like the worst.

442
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,840
Like was anti-communist supported Dewey over Truman?

443
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,120
Like she kept picking losers.

444
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,160
Well, that'll be on the episode.

445
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,000
Yeah.

446
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,840
We'll explore it.

447
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,400
Explore her political leanings as well.

448
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,720
Okay, but to step back, the big stuff here.

449
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,920
This is an episode of The Wonderful World of Disney

450
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,760
that aired on March 23rd, 1975.

451
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,200
And though it ran through the poll

452
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,080
as the Space Mountain opening special,

453
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,920
and that is what it is,

454
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,680
and that's the thing that it leads to,

455
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,440
it is actually called Welcome to the World.

456
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,480
World is in quotes referring to Walt Disney World, you see.

457
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,560
So what this is is a special that is largely musical

458
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,560
in nature that runs throughout the vacation kingdom.

459
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,600
Those vibes are very strong.

460
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,120
That 70s leisure sports kind of vibe of early Disney World

461
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,760
because Disney World's only been open for,

462
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,120
not even for full years at the point that this is filmed.

463
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,360
Context, also the night that this aired,

464
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,320
March 23rd, 1975, this was on NBC.

465
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,120
On CBS, there was a new 60 Minutes,

466
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,320
an interview with Nixon Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman,

467
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,240
then serving a prison sentence

468
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,280
for his role in the Watergate affair.

469
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,640
That is considered an early example.

470
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,880
I might've helped coin the term checkbook journalism,

471
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,000
where he was given a good degree of money

472
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,200
in order to do this interview.

473
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,880
And it's like, is that weird to be given money

474
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,320
to prisoners to talk about things?

475
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,760
But hey, you get the ratings.

476
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,240
Hey, look, Wonderful World of Disney

477
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,480
has Lucy Arnaz and Lyle Wagner.

478
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,840
We have Tommy Toon.

479
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,680
Holy shit.

480
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,480
Pay up to Haldeman.

481
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,840
Checkbook journalism, I think,

482
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,520
because I was always taught in college,

483
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,480
don't ever pay a subject.

484
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,320
Don't ever do this.

485
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,520
So I think it's paying the subject in general.

486
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,120
Now, jumping to Tommy Toon,

487
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,080
we said Mike knew something as just a reference.

488
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,720
Growing up, I always just knew Tommy Toon.

489
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,480
I feel like as a reference.

490
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,600
That's correct.

491
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,160
Any kid of our generation, if it's more than that,

492
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,360
there's something wrong.

493
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,800
It is a funny name.

494
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,120
You were raised correctly, is what that means.

495
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:39,120
Yeah, very acclaimed Broadway choreographer and dancer.

496
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,560
Yeah.

497
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,240
And one of the hosts of this,

498
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,080
it's a three-hander, right?

499
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,440
Lyle Wagner, as mentioned.

500
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,720
Tommy Toon, who's doing dance numbers throughout the thing,

501
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,560
who's, I don't think the only Disney special

502
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,480
with Tommy Toon in it, but a very lanky man,

503
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,520
the tallest man.

504
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,920
Very tall.

505
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,720
His Wikipedia online was talking about

506
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,560
how when he would go to auditions,

507
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,240
he would learn how to play, like bend a little

508
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,720
and like play down the stage.

509
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,360
So it looked like he was not that tall.

510
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,640
He's 6'6".

511
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,800
Yeah, wild.

512
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,960
Yeah, a 6'6 dancer feels weird.

513
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,800
That isn't common.

514
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,200
It feels like dancers are usually shorter.

515
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,040
Yeah, that's true.

516
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,880
Maybe not.

517
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,960
I can't think of a very, very tall dancer.

518
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,800
No.

519
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,640
Look, not that I know a lot about dancers.

520
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,520
I don't have an encyclopedia of dancers in my head.

521
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,720
No, ventriloquist.

522
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,080
No, dummies, maybe.

523
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,760
Very tall ventriloquist.

524
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,080
I believe that height was difficult.

525
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,920
Like he had to learn to work around that height

526
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,760
as a dancer.

527
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,520
That's why I never got good at dancing,

528
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,680
because I'm 6'3".

529
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,000
You think without the height?

530
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,360
Without the height, I would have been on,

531
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,560
yeah, I would have been on Broadway.

532
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,600
I would have been in a ballet.

533
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,720
Who knows?

534
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,440
I was in a dance show in high school and I sucked.

535
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,040
I was bad.

536
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,920
And that's because of the height.

537
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,640
That's the only reason, the only reason.

538
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,800
Center of gravity weird.

539
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,640
Yep.

540
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,800
You were cursed with height.

541
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,800
Bad dancer.

542
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,080
But the third host of this,

543
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,480
and kind of the most present host in it,

544
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,760
I would say is Lucy Arnaz.

545
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,840
Oh my God, I forgot to do the thing

546
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,680
where I read the person's suggestion.

547
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,520
Oh, right, right.

548
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,360
I'll try to do that to make sure,

549
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,960
because that might also illuminate.

550
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,000
Here, I'll search for that.

551
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,760
Well, I'll search for that.

552
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,160
Well, I will give the floor to you guys,

553
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,960
because this seems like a good opportunity

554
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,800
for you to say a bunch of things about Lucy Arnaz

555
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,440
that are quickly proven untrue by our audience.

556
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,880
Well, this, Scott said this was a three-hander.

557
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,000
I think it becomes more of a one,

558
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,320
like there is a lot of Lucy Arnaz.

559
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,840
Lucy Arnaz is a star is what you're saying.

560
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,280
Yeah.

561
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:48,280
And Lucy Arnaz is the daughter of both Lucy and Desi.

562
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,440
And Desi, yes.

563
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,920
Not adopted by one, they, yeah, both of them.

564
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,120
Biological daughter.

565
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,840
Had a lot of projects, but my funny,

566
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,000
the funniest one I feel like is that Lucy Arnaz show

567
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
that aired in 1985, the New York Times Review said,

568
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:12,080
the always ingratiating Miss Arnaz as a psychologist

569
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,960
who not only writes an advice column,

570
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,240
but also takes calls from listeners

571
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,280
on her own radio program.

572
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,200
What?

573
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,240
That sounds like a show I've heard of before.

574
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,080
That's right.

575
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,920
What?

576
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,600
She did a Frasier before Frasier.

577
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,400
She did Frasier before Frasier.

578
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,240
Wow.

579
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,080
Wow.

580
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,960
It's interesting with Lucy Arnaz.

581
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,840
I don't, did anything, did anything work necessarily?

582
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,840
Yeah, that's what I, yeah,

583
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,400
that's one of the things I wrote down.

584
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,960
It's like, what am I supposed to think about her?

585
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,200
Am I supposed to watch her and go very funny?

586
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,680
Or am I supposed to say, excellent singing?

587
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,520
He's not so.

588
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,720
Excellent dancing.

589
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,640
I don't know what my response to her is supposed to be.

590
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,760
None of it's bad.

591
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,200
Yeah, she's not bad.

592
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,680
She's like 24 years old in the special,

593
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,200
which is funny, cause she seems like she's 50.

594
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,280
I thought she was much older, yeah.

595
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,280
She's a good host.

596
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,120
I think she's a pretty good host.

597
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,040
She's got a very much like,

598
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,200
can you believe this guy?

599
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,280
Like that's sort of the delivery about with everything.

600
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,880
Yeah, yeah.

601
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,920
But certainly, you know,

602
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,600
was not even on my radar as a kid who knew about Lucy

603
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,440
growing up.

604
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,280
This was not present,

605
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,120
well, if I'm gonna be a fan of this,

606
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,240
then I have to know about what Lucy Arnaz is up to.

607
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,640
Right.

608
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,800
But that, I think I really learned about her

609
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,320
at the old Lucy museum.

610
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,160
Lucy Attribute.

611
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,800
Yeah, Lucy Attribute,

612
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,840
seeing the DVDs for sale for Here's Lucy.

613
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,160
And I'm like, what the hell is this?

614
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,000
This isn't I Love Lucy or the Lucy Show.

615
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,840
You said this, yeah.

616
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,080
We're talking about Here's Lucy.

617
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:45,920
And I'm like.

618
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,760
You were getting furious that you didn't know.

619
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,600
She had a show with the kids?

620
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,440
Yeah.

621
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,280
Like.

622
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,120
Yeah.

623
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,680
We talked about this in the Recently Unlocked episode.

624
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,520
So this is, we're in the middle of a five-timer right now.

625
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,720
We're in the middle of a new one, yeah.

626
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,640
And the story is you saw the show

627
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,760
and didn't know what it was.

628
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,600
Oh, yeah.

629
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,280
It was Gaston, it was Gaston episode

630
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,120
and you brought up the fact

631
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,640
that O.G. Simpson had just passed away.

632
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,120
And Jason and I were like,

633
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,240
duh, he was on Here's Lucy.

634
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,080
That's all we knew.

635
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,080
We didn't even know what happened

636
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,760
other than that he was on Here's Lucy once.

637
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,880
Who is the old movie star who's on Here's Lucy

638
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,600
and dances with Lucy and Lucy?

639
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,440
Ginger Rogers.

640
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,440
Ginger Rogers.

641
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,760
But you make a joke that that's the same episode

642
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,800
which I don't believe is the case.

643
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,360
It's not the same episode, no.

644
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,560
But you did say the same thing.

645
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,760
You went to Lucy's tribute and you said,

646
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,400
well, what the hell is this?

647
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,240
I've never heard of this before.

648
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,080
I was pretty intimidated.

649
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,000
That's strange, why are you mad?

650
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,840
I wasn't mad.

651
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,680
Something I don't know.

652
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,000
I was just shocked it never showed up in syndication.

653
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,800
The way you make it seem,

654
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,840
and you made it seem like this today

655
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,760
was that you were a little bit upset.

656
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,600
That's how I read to me, I agree.

657
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,800
I was a little upset that I didn't know about it.

658
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,640
Yeah.

659
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,720
Oh, you were mad at yourself for failing.

660
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,680
I already lived a Tommy Toon-less childhood.

661
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,520
Now here I am.

662
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,080
I've wasted years on this planet.

663
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,920
Punching yourself.

664
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,760
Not knowing about a show not good enough for syndication.

665
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,320
God, stupid Jason.

666
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,080
Tommy Toon, one of his big Broadway things,

667
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,640
he choreographed Nine,

668
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,640
which is the musical based on Fellini's Eight and a Half.

669
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,480
Okay.

670
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,520
And that's, Jane loves Nine and I love Eight and a Half.

671
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,040
And somehow we make it work.

672
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,080
That's a joke that Lucy Ernest would have done

673
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,920
on a special.

674
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,760
That's right.

675
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,880
Right.

676
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,000
Get out of here.

677
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Somehow we make it work.

678
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,760
Let me read the thing now that I have it.

679
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,960
This is from Iceberg77779.

680
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,480
With Disney World Space Mountain turning 50 next month,

681
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,320
I think it's finally time

682
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,600
to cover the ride's opening day special.

683
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,520
This special features very little Space Mountain.

684
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,800
Ah, our ears have perked up.

685
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,920
Very little of the ride in the episode.

686
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,120
Sounds like a podcast the ride, doesn't it?

687
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,160
But it does have unsafe dancing,

688
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,960
a 10 minute banana themed musical number.

689
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,000
And I have to say, I wish I'd read that part

690
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,960
before I allowed this to be in the,

691
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,280
although this was the popular vote,

692
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,120
so it's in No Matter What.

693
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,480
And most importantly, Scratchy Voiced Mickey Mouse.

694
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,320
We'll make it to that.

695
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,160
Yeah.

696
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,640
A little later.

697
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,000
But yeah, so that is correct.

698
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,240
We, what we have, I feel like this might've like,

699
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,840
this might've fooled people in a way,

700
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,800
calling it the Space Mountain opening special,

701
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,240
because like, if we had to put a percentage on it,

702
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
what do you, Space Mountain content

703
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,600
in this Space Mountain special.

704
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,760
3%?

705
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,040
God, I was gonna go higher even,

706
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,880
but I think you're right.

707
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,720
I think it's, yeah.

708
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,560
So little.

709
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,400
Yeah, yeah.

710
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,520
And I both don't like it and like it.

711
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,720
Because like, do I wanna see Lucy Arnaz

712
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,240
in like some green, like early green screen space situation?

713
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,280
Yes.

714
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,960
Do I wanna see Tommy Toon dancing on the moon?

715
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,080
Yes.

716
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:36,920
Yeah, it should've been more,

717
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,480
yeah, what they did, but more about space.

718
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,600
Right, so like that's where I'm upset by the lack of space.

719
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,760
But it's fine, it's good.

720
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,600
Yeah.

721
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,440
For what it is.

722
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,280
Well, let me play a little of what you do get.

723
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,520
This is a good, where like, what,

724
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,360
now you might wanna alter that 3%

725
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,040
because the song I'm gonna play

726
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,280
technically counts as Space Mountain content,

727
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,200
because they do say Space Mountain in it.

728
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,000
Okay, fair enough, fair enough.

729
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,040
But I think you'll find that it is not particularly on brand

730
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,000
with the Space Mountain that we know today.

731
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,960
We've been invited to Disney World

732
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,720
to see Space Mountain.

733
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,680
We're travel and life, we brought a smile,

734
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,000
a dance, a song.

735
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,400
I'd like to sing.

736
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,240
Fresh flowers?

737
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,080
A tub.

738
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,200
I'll need a key size bed.

739
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,680
That, by the way, they're all checking in

740
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,680
at registration desks.

741
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,640
They're checking in at the then three places

742
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,560
you could stay on Disney World property.

743
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,640
One's at Polynesian, one's at Contemporary,

744
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,480
and one is at, what is it,

745
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,720
I get the wildernesses, was it Fort Wilderness

746
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,560
at the time?

747
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,400
Yeah.

748
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,240
Okay, okay.

749
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,640
Seems like logistically terrible,

750
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,920
they'd probably put them all up

751
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,240
at the same place, but go on.

752
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,480
That's, yeah, yeah, true, yeah, yeah.

753
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,120
But they wanna feature the different places

754
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,400
and amenities and vibes, you see.

755
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,240
Well, you have to.

756
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,280
Did you say Space Mountain at Disney World?

757
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,780
Walt Disney World?

758
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,280
That's a frequent facet of this is ghostly applause

759
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,000
that comes from nowhere and often you're like,

760
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,680
what are you applauding for?

761
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,560
Yeah, laughter and clapping when they're outside

762
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,000
and there's no studio audience.

763
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,840
What I just showed you, why did they clap?

764
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,200
To signal to a viewer that this is over.

765
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,920
Because they walked away?

766
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,960
Well, they sang and then they finished it,

767
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,480
walked away, the song ended.

768
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,640
Somebody was watching it and went,

769
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,360
people are gonna be confused, where are they going?

770
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,560
Why are they leaving?

771
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,000
So clapping signifies that the number is over.

772
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,200
Because you have to check in

773
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,400
and then you drop your bags with the bellman.

774
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,720
What a hotel is.

775
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,240
Yeah, that's true.

776
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,480
Yeah, that is a weird,

777
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,080
that clapping is weird the whole time.

778
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,280
There's a lot of it and there's times where,

779
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,560
one thing that happens in this,

780
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,320
not to jump around too much, but we certainly get,

781
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,960
it's not like the plot is so confusing

782
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,560
that we can't jump around,

783
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,560
but Tommy Toon does dancing in a lot of odd places

784
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,720
in the park.

785
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,120
You know, he'll be, you'll see his feet

786
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,000
and then you'll see that he's on a boat.

787
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,920
And then you'll see his feet

788
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,200
and then you'll see that he's up high on a building.

789
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,800
And sometimes the reveal of where he is gets a laugh

790
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,280
and sometimes it gets a clap.

791
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,200
The claps are impressive and the laughs are funny.

792
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,160
And I don't, why is the boat a laugh?

793
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,240
But then he's like next to balloons and that's a clap.

794
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,080
It's a good question.

795
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,520
I actually didn't even think about that.

796
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,440
I feel like they may just wanted to have varied it up.

797
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,360
Cause it doesn't seem like it has too much.

798
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,560
I mean, I guess he shouldn't be dancing on the boat.

799
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,680
That's silly.

800
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,520
This must be the unsafe dancing

801
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,400
that the iceberg referred to.

802
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,320
Right.

803
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,040
Jason, what did you think of when Tommy Toon

804
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,200
was dancing on the boat?

805
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,080
Well, I thought it was very fun.

806
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,720
I assumed this was topic was picked

807
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,200
cause they're like, oh, this has vintage,

808
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,960
I love vacation kingdom Disney world.

809
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,800
Yeah.

810
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,040
And once I saw- You're saying it's for you,

811
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,880
it's picked for you.

812
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,000
Well, that part is for me,

813
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,600
but I think especially for you,

814
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:06,600
these very old now, or in some cases, dead actors.

815
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,440
Or for you-

816
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,920
In almost all cases, dead.

817
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,760
No, two of them are still alive.

818
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,600
Toon's alive.

819
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,600
Oh, of the people we're talking about.

820
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,440
Oh, I see.

821
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,400
Oh, you mean in this.

822
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,760
I just meant that Mike veers to dead actors in general.

823
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,600
Right.

824
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,440
Wagner has passed.

825
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,280
Winchell is dead.

826
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,120
Huh?

827
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,960
Paul Winchell is dead.

828
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,800
Winchell is dead.

829
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,760
And Jerry Mahoney, where's Jerry Mahoney?

830
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,600
Oh, good, good.

831
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,440
Remember we talked about this.

832
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,040
The kingdom is alive, and Wayland Flowers is dead.

833
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,520
What's that word?

834
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,720
And potentially staying in a home.

835
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,560
All right.

836
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,240
And Mama thriving.

837
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,080
Well, that's a whole different thing.

838
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,040
I disagree, disagree.

839
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,280
That's a whole different topic.

840
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,200
Not here, she's not.

841
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,760
But this just had so many,

842
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,080
and it had some little numbers.

843
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:44,920
I love that.

844
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,880
I love that number, the opening number was great.

845
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,600
I love the split screen.

846
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,880
That must've been very hard production wise,

847
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,280
but they got it done.

848
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,360
Well, here's what we're learning is that, so you,

849
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,240
all right, I think we're landing at Jason,

850
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,880
who loved it.

851
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,720
Mike?

852
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,560
Here's what happened.

853
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,400
Or here's what happened.

854
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,240
Okay.

855
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,520
So lately on the show,

856
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,240
I feel like anytime we watch something,

857
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:10,240
I will admit that Mickey's Nutcracker, Generation X,

858
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,480
I've been a little like,

859
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,120
eh, what are these things sometimes?

860
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,240
You know, I'm not so into it.

861
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,920
Jason loves everything.

862
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,200
That's just how it goes.

863
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,440
I'm like a child about to be handed a cotton candy thing,

864
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,080
and I'm just laughing.

865
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,400
Jason's into it all.

866
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,720
There's people on screen.

867
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,160
They're smiling and dancing in some cases.

868
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,880
It's late last night, and I'm like,

869
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,240
I have to finally watch the special,

870
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,200
and it's very late,

871
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,520
and I first watch Kenny Omega's Return to Wrestling

872
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,880
after diverticulitis.

873
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,920
I watch this live.

874
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,320
It's around 1130 or midnight.

875
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,560
That's a living person.

876
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,680
I don't know how I feel about this.

877
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,120
Yes, he's a living professional wrestler.

878
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,560
It's in a masterpiece.

879
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,200
It's 31 minutes.

880
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,880
Tanahashi, the president of New Japan,

881
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,360
is crying after the match.

882
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,680
They're in the Tokyo Dome.

883
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,080
They're in the Tokyo Dome.

884
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,160
Kenny's back after a year.

885
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,800
I'm like fucking psyched.

886
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,560
It's late, I'm exhausted, but I'm late,

887
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,720
and I go, now I gotta watch

888
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,040
the Space Mountain opening special.

889
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,920
You have to be welcome to the world.

890
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,560
Have to be welcome to the world.

891
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,080
And I think I was riding the high of this match

892
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,840
that as I'm watching Space Mountain opening

893
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,320
and Tommy Toon is dancing all along Walt Disney World,

894
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,680
I think I said to myself, I love this.

895
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,600
Oh, oh, I wasn't sure where this was going.

896
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,440
Wow.

897
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,680
I think I was in such a good mood

898
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,280
from this bloody match that I had just watched.

899
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,880
You're just like, wow, what the human body is capable of.

900
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,880
I was like, holy shit.

901
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,360
Vigorous wrestling to unexpected dancing.

902
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,520
Tommy Toon on the top of the riverboat,

903
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,200
and I'm like, this is pretty good.

904
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,640
I mean, the second half is less fun

905
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,200
than the first half of the special.

906
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,440
Yeah, that's where I struggle.

907
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,360
But the first half, I'm like, this is pretty good.

908
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,720
And then there would be segments where I'm like,

909
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,920
I don't know about this segment.

910
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,560
Then something would happen and I'd go,

911
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,800
this is a good segment.

912
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,240
Here come the country bears.

913
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,240
This is a good segment.

914
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,440
I love the country bears.

915
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,600
I was skeptical of the toy soldiers.

916
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,200
And then there was a lot of them

917
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,440
and they were all tapping and I liked it.

918
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,120
That's the one I didn't get.

919
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,360
There's like, they reveal, there's just two.

920
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,440
Lucy Hernandez is with two soldiers.

921
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,040
And then it cuts wide and it shows

922
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,160
that there's lots of soldiers

923
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,200
and that gets a big fake applause break.

924
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,520
And I was like, why?

925
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,640
Why is that gonna applause?

926
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,520
They're coordinating.

927
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,560
They're moving in unison, in patterns.

928
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,560
I like it.

929
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,560
It's cumbersome costumes.

930
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,080
I think the adrenaline started to wear off

931
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,880
by the time I got to the toy soldiers.

932
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,680
So you're gonna have my back in some of this.

933
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,960
I'm not trying to, by the way, this is me calibrating.

934
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,360
I'm like, oh, I don't wanna be doing like,

935
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,480
Scott's being a stick in the mud in an episode

936
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,160
where it seems like there's like half the room.

937
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,200
I also like plenty of this, by the way.

938
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,080
But it seems like, don't let me step on your joy here.

939
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,560
It's about halfway when like all the people are there

940
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,920
and it like changes tone that I started to go.

941
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,360
Not that it's such a dark tone or something, but.

942
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,200
The banana midway.

943
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,320
The banana, I'll be the downer here.

944
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,360
The banana is intolerable.

945
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,880
Oh, thank you, thanks.

946
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,200
That was my, thank you.

947
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,560
I don't like the banana.

948
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,080
I don't think Iceberg did either.

949
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,880
I thought that was gonna be a punchline

950
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,760
or like just a non sequitur.

951
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,600
Like they're just, when they were singing,

952
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,520
yes, we have no bananas.

953
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,760
And then it just kept going and going.

954
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,960
I like all the characters.

955
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,720
I like all the old characters.

956
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,400
When my brain slows down and goes,

957
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,720
is this Space Mountain special?

958
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,680
Yeah.

959
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,160
Cause even the first part I'm still like,

960
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,640
it's not Space Mountain special, but look at Tommy Goh.

961
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,720
Like it doesn't matter.

962
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,040
My brain is firing, it's happy.

963
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,120
But then at this point you're like, okay, I don't know.

964
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,480
I'm about ready for, because like a modern,

965
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,880
like maybe today they would blend it

966
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,360
and make it like a sneak preview.

967
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,560
But if they tell you at the beginning,

968
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,440
like a Galaxy's Edge opening special

969
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,440
is not gonna be like 80% dance numbers.

970
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,280
No.

971
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,240
And a song about like a sad song

972
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,600
about how you stayed too long at the fair.

973
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,440
Yeah.

974
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,280
Yeah.

975
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,480
What does that have to do with the songs?

976
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,600
Sobering, yeah, I had too much fun with those bananas.

977
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,840
And now look at me, a broken woman.

978
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,880
I will be very excited if the next Megatrader appearance,

979
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,120
she does the full trolley song

980
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,720
from Meet Me in St. Louis.

981
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,240
For which ride would that be?

982
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,440
What's the next ride opening?

983
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,680
Well, she'll just be riding the main street trolley

984
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,600
up and down.

985
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,680
I know, but would it be like an opening day special

986
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,760
for some new ride?

987
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,000
For the Avengers-y ticket.

988
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,320
For the Avengers-y ticket.

989
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,560
The Avengers, yeah, that's a good one.

990
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,240
Yeah, like I'm Googling every song

991
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,560
and I'm like, what does this song have to do with,

992
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,080
because they do the, the next song is,

993
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,360
it's not where you start from the musical Seesaw.

994
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,200
Did you know this?

995
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,840
I have heard of the musical Seesaw,

996
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,440
but I don't really know it.

997
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,280
Yeah, I'm like, it's not where you start,

998
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,320
it's where you finish.

999
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,160
And you're like, okay.

1000
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,720
That's what I didn't know if these were original songs

1001
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,560
for this special.

1002
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,200
This is like a somewhat popular at the time musical

1003
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,040
called Seesaw, which you look up the original cast,

1004
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,880
which included Tommy Toon,

1005
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,520
and also included Giancarlo Esposito.

1006
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,360
Really?

1007
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,280
Yeah, which is 1973.

1008
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,120
But then-

1009
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,080
He was in shows with Tommy Toon in 73?

1010
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,120
Yes, and he's at his peak today.

1011
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:06,960
Oh my God.

1012
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,280
Yes, it's wild.

1013
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,040
He was at it for a long time.

1014
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,520
But then when the Broadway run ended,

1015
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,880
Tommy Toon went on the road with the traveling version

1016
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,360
of the show with Lucy Arnaz.

1017
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,200
Okay.

1018
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,160
She says at one point we were in a Broadway show together.

1019
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,720
That's what this is, and this is a nod to that show.

1020
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,440
So they're doing songs from Seesaw,

1021
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,600
because the viewers might know them

1022
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,520
from Seesaw coming to their town.

1023
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,920
It's possible the viewers know them from Seesaw.

1024
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,000
Interesting.

1025
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,600
So that inherent chemistry,

1026
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,640
that crackle of Lucy and Toon.

1027
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,720
So they were like, I don't know if they were like,

1028
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,160
yeah, we'll do it, but we gotta do one of our songs

1029
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,280
from the musical.

1030
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,640
And what's happening in that song?

1031
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,560
Do you remember what that's paired with visually?

1032
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,120
Well, that's like, oh shoot,

1033
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:55,720
that's when they're talking about how it's not,

1034
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,760
she's going across the lawn of the Polynesian

1035
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,920
at that point early on.

1036
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,080
Is that when they're getting from their separate hotels

1037
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,560
to the park? Yes, yes, yes.

1038
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,040
Oh, and then they ended the different Main Street vehicles,

1039
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,200
and then they all meet up in all of Main Street.

1040
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,440
Well, I like that.

1041
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,760
That all was fun enough.

1042
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,280
And you're seeing those paddleboats

1043
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,160
out in the Seven Seas Lagoon.

1044
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,880
Oh, the coordinated paddleboats were very fun,

1045
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,960
the putt-putt boats.

1046
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,800
Yeah.

1047
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,520
Tommy is wearing a wild outfit.

1048
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,560
It looks like he's wearing a tank,

1049
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,360
a long sleeve tank top or something,

1050
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,240
or a V-neck long sleeve shirt that's pink,

1051
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,360
an open blue denim shirt.

1052
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,560
He's got chaps on, like a cowboy it looks like,

1053
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,320
unless those are built into the pants,

1054
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,800
and then jeans as well.

1055
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,720
He's got this flowing long hair,

1056
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,560
and he's 6'6", and he's on a miniature horse,

1057
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,920
which is really interesting.

1058
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,280
He's a very, he's a very 70s man.

1059
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,760
The most 70s man I've ever seen, yes.

1060
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,160
And he's riding a tiny horse that he is too big for.

1061
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,120
I liked when he rode the tiny horse

1062
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,440
and all the bicyclists showed up.

1063
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,840
Yeah, and that's a laugh that you understand at least

1064
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,680
why they added the fake laugh to it.

1065
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,320
Yeah, some say, yeah, they aren't all confusing.

1066
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,400
One thing I thought when I was watching this,

1067
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,680
I was like, already he's on a train.

1068
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:17,840
What the hell train is this?

1069
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,240
This ain't the Disney World train.

1070
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,800
This ain't the Magic Kingdom train.

1071
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,800
This is a Four Wilderness train, is what this is.

1072
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,240
I didn't know they had a train.

1073
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,560
Yeah, I didn't either.

1074
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,400
Did you know?

1075
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,240
That yeah was all like, yeah, I know, I know.

1076
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,080
I do know, yeah.

1077
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,240
What else do you know about the train?

1078
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,040
Is it operational?

1079
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,160
That I don't know.

1080
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,960
No, it was very briefly in the 70s.

1081
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,360
It was just a couple years.

1082
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,160
Because they get on it in a weird spot.

1083
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,400
That's when I went, what is this?

1084
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,800
Yeah, that's how I felt.

1085
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,120
Yeah, we're in Disney World, this is a train,

1086
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,200
but I've never seen this train before.

1087
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,640
The train was apparently functional

1088
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,040
and miles long of a track

1089
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,760
because it was to get people from Four Wilderness

1090
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,160
to just pretty far back there over to river country.

1091
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,360
That was the need for that train.

1092
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,240
But they stopped running it mid 70s

1093
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,560
and today at least one of the engines

1094
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,920
owned by John Lasseter

1095
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,760
Well.

1096
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,240
On the winery grounds.

1097
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,480
There's a name I haven't heard in a long time.

1098
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,080
Mm-hmm, the hug express he calls it today.

1099
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,200
Choo-choo.

1100
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,040
Choo-choo, he wants some of that huggy.

1101
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,240
Is he still at Skydance Animation?

1102
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,080
I believe so, yeah.

1103
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,800
So we, oh, because that means

1104
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,320
he would be involved in all the Paramount stuff.

1105
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,720
Jason, I don't know anything about that.

1106
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,360
I feel like people are worried like,

1107
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,960
oh my God, is Lasseter about takeover Nickelodeon?

1108
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,440
Oh, it's possible.

1109
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,600
Anything's possible.

1110
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,880
Now there is a song in this

1111
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,720
that I was previously familiar with

1112
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,920
from one of Doug Jones's great DVDs

1113
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,000
and cut downs of Disney World specials.

1114
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,160
I definitely knew from that,

1115
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:58,160
he pulled out the song by the Rhodes kids.

1116
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,200
At some point we go to a family band

1117
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:07,840
that is so Osmonds, that's so Partridge,

1118
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:12,840
that's so Brady's, I would say that's so Jackson's

1119
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,280
except it's so white that you can't really say

1120
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,600
it's so Jackson's.

1121
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,800
The whitest family band,

1122
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,920
the most 70s family band you've ever seen

1123
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,360
because we're in full.

1124
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,480
You know what, it actually reminded me of Lickersh Pizza

1125
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,560
when Cooper is in the,

1126
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,920
he's with the cast of Yours, Mine, and Ours.

1127
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,760
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1128
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,840
With Lucy, they don't call Lucy

1129
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,280
but on this variety show.

1130
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:42,560
Because it's like a whole band of Danny Bonaducis.

1131
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,560
It's all Bonaducis and they do,

1132
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,280
they come out of what I recognized immediately

1133
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,960
as the sunny eclipse spot.

1134
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,000
I don't think I realized that the sunny eclipse spot

1135
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,920
was a genuine bandstand area that did the Disneyland thing

1136
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,200
where the stage rises up from the bottom.

1137
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,720
I don't think I knew that.

1138
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,240
So they rise up from the bottom

1139
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:11,240
and perform a very groovy song called I Like You.

1140
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,720
Yeah, that's what I wrote.

1141
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,560
All right.

1142
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,080
["I Like You"]

1143
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,280
I like the summer when the sun is shining

1144
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,920
You make me glad in the sun

1145
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,800
And I like to get when the snow is falling

1146
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,040
You make the moon light stay bright

1147
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,880
I like being me

1148
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,880
I like when I see

1149
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,120
When I see you smile

1150
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,680
There's something likable about this

1151
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:44,120
in sort of a, like, I'd like to buy the world a Coke.

1152
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:48,400
I tend to like corporate attempts at 70s music,

1153
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,360
like written by some stiff man,

1154
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:55,240
like yeah, we're gonna make a hit for the now generation.

1155
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,080
Yeah, and it's late.

1156
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,520
Even when it fails, I kinda like,

1157
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,880
it still lands somewhere I like.

1158
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,160
I like all the Partridge music.

1159
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,320
Yeah, and Partridge Family, this is like, this is 75.

1160
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,560
I don't know when that song was written,

1161
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,560
but it feels a little late.

1162
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,400
Yeah.

1163
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,320
Maybe that's wrong, but Partridge Family starts in 1970.

1164
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,160
Yeah.

1165
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,920
So like, come on, get happy, around then.

1166
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,200
By the way, all that Partridge music,

1167
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,560
much better than what I just played,

1168
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,400
but they got some bangers.

1169
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,280
This feels very much like the Simpsons joke

1170
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,080
of the hooray for everything.

1171
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,720
Yeah, for sure, yes.

1172
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,200
I know it reminds you that there was stuff

1173
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,360
very much like that, yeah.

1174
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:34,800
So they're so polyester and vests and matching pants,

1175
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,840
and then they come strolling down

1176
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:40,440
the main Tomorrowland thoroughfare, like arm in arm,

1177
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,520
and that has a really inexplicable applause break

1178
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,000
where the little one gets ahead of the group

1179
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,080
and then realizes he has to run back.

1180
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,720
Oh no, it gets a laugh, it gets a laugh.

1181
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,680
Yes, yes, yes.

1182
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,480
You're laughing at that fake audience?

1183
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,840
We put in a laugh there?

1184
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,960
The joke is that he didn't realize they were stopping,

1185
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,040
and then they do like,

1186
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:01,600
like, it almost looks like an improvised choreographed dance.

1187
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,080
Yeah, yes, they're like.

1188
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,720
They are not too on it, I think there's a reason

1189
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,480
why we haven't heard of the Rhodes kids.

1190
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,840
Yeah, I looked, there's not a lot of Rhodes kids material.

1191
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,120
There's not a lot, did you find though,

1192
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,600
there's almost only one thing you can find,

1193
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,280
and it's from a Houston newspaper,

1194
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,640
because they're from Houston,

1195
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,360
or somewhere in Texas, I believe,

1196
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,440
and they uncovered a very strange fact

1197
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,480
about the Rhodes kids.

1198
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,320
You might have a different thing,

1199
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,840
I just saw that their mom was a pianist,

1200
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,240
and their dad was a chemical engineer for Exxon.

1201
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:35,160
It's not that, I guess the Exxon involvement is sort of dark.

1202
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,000
No, no, no, it's crazy than that.

1203
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,400
So they were on something called GRC Records,

1204
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,160
and that was run out of Atlanta,

1205
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:47,240
and it was run by Atlanta's biggest music impresario,

1206
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,720
Michael Thevis.

1207
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,560
Oh, I didn't see this.

1208
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,280
And Michael Thevis, he,

1209
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,320
not only was the credited executive producer,

1210
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,720
and like the, you know, the head of the label,

1211
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,400
he also put pen to paper,

1212
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,320
and wrote a big old note in their Christmas album,

1213
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,400
Rockin' Rhodes Christmas,

1214
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,360
about like how he, it's not worth reading,

1215
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,760
but just like it blew me away.

1216
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,240
The house lights went down, the spots flashed up,

1217
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,200
and pow, seven kids sang and played,

1218
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,960
not with real pros.

1219
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,520
And he's saying, I had jet lag and fatigue,

1220
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,680
and I was in Vegas, and instead I was just,

1221
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,520
I was with a bunch of pros.

1222
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,480
The 10-year-old did an incredible imitation

1223
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,680
of Tom Jones and demolished the,

1224
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,640
literally demolished the hotel lobby.

1225
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,480
That's one of those wrong,

1226
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,960
you used to literally say Thevis,

1227
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,720
but I get your point.

1228
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,640
Anyway, this guy, if you look up his Wikipedia,

1229
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,680
you will quickly find his nicknames,

1230
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:42,280
the King of Pornography, the Sultan of Smut,

1231
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,600
and the Scarface of Sex.

1232
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,320
I thought those were Jason's nicknames.

1233
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:51,320
He grabbed them in the art sale after Thevis is passing.

1234
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,920
I'm no Thevis, but they were a real steal

1235
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,200
when he got washed up.

1236
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,800
No, this guy, he was like big in not,

1237
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,680
I think, I mean, I think like pornographic films in general,

1238
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,320
but like specifically peep machines,

1239
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,240
like things where you gotta peer in and insert a coin,

1240
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,120
and then you get to peep with some naked ladies.

1241
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,640
And this special, this airs in 75,

1242
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,640
and I think that's around when he wrote this note,

1243
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,320
am I correct?

1244
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,640
Or no, 72.

1245
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,520
All right, what I just read,

1246
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,720
he wrote their liner notes in 72.

1247
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,760
By that point, he's writing that on a typewriter

1248
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,400
or with a pen and paper with his hands,

1249
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,840
his hands that had already been used to shoot

1250
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,960
and kill a rival peep machine maker.

1251
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,800
Oh my God.

1252
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,680
Which he just fully got away with.

1253
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,520
Oh wow.

1254
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,920
It was a guy who used to work for him,

1255
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,440
and then he started his own peep machine company.

1256
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,280
And he said, would you mind coming to my office?

1257
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,000
Okay, Thevis called me in, huh?

1258
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,720
Maybe he wants to do a deal with me,

1259
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,440
the new king of peep machines.

1260
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,600
Hey, come in, pow, pow, pow.

1261
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,440
I did not see this.

1262
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,960
Kills him, wraps up his bloody body

1263
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,840
in padding meant to transport peep machines.

1264
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,720
This poses a body, this is still around.

1265
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,400
Then a couple years later, blew up a guy with a pipe bomb.

1266
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,960
And as always, this is all concurrent with,

1267
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,760
and I got the Rhodes kids out there,

1268
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,640
I put them on Welcome to the World.

1269
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,680
In 78, he was finally caught, went to jail,

1270
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,080
escaped jail,

1271
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,120
thus putting him at that time

1272
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,280
on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list.

1273
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,120
Oh my God.

1274
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,760
He's a graduate of the Ten Most Wanted list,

1275
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,600
died in jail in 2013.

1276
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,240
He, like Lyle Waggoner,

1277
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,600
owned a Tudor-style manor in Atlanta,

1278
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,200
a 30-room mansion.

1279
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,120
That's where he was doing all of this bidding.

1280
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:39,960
The peeping.

1281
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,600
And that mansion was purchased in the 90s

1282
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,960
by Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown.

1283
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,800
Wow.

1284
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,360
Whitney Houston lived in this guy's,

1285
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
in this crazy guy's house,

1286
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,720
when I Will Always Love You was happening.

1287
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:52,880
That's wild.

1288
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:53,720
Yep, yeah.

1289
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,560
Whoa.

1290
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,880
So when you watch this cheery performance,

1291
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,840
just imagine one peep machine

1292
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,840
make her murdering another.

1293
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,160
Did Lucy Arnaz live in a notable house, Scott?

1294
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,320
You know, probably, I actually,

1295
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,200
I genuinely believe that if you asked my dad this question,

1296
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,760
he would know, because my dad,

1297
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,400
I pick up some of this from my dad,

1298
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,480
because he knows a lot of, like,

1299
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,560
if you drive around in C&O and Sherman Oaks,

1300
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,480
he knows a lot, like, oh, that's where this guy lived,

1301
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,320
and that's where this guy lived.

1302
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,160
Oh, wow.

1303
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,000
He also, I remember him telling me

1304
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,240
about Lyle Waggoner a long time ago,

1305
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,280
because Lyle Waggoner is spelled with two Gs,

1306
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,680
as is Star Wagon's, the trailers that you use

1307
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,280
if you're in a movie or TV show,

1308
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,880
and that's because that was a company started by him.

1309
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,360
He diversified his business and started a,

1310
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,120
he was working on, what was the,

1311
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,600
it was the comic show, he was on Wonder Woman.

1312
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,440
When he was working on that,

1313
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,760
he was in some trailer, and he was like,

1314
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:45,960
where'd this trailer come from?

1315
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,920
Oh, they would, like, lease it from this guy,

1316
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,920
and he's like, hmm, what if I could be that guy?

1317
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,080
And he just bought trailers,

1318
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,800
and now it's the main brand of trailers in the world.

1319
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,120
That's crazy. Yeah, yeah.

1320
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:00,440
This guy who makes almost no impression

1321
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,840
in this special otherwise.

1322
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,680
Yeah, no, he's not,

1323
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,280
he's the least interesting of the three.

1324
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,200
No, yeah, it's all off the page,

1325
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,720
what's interesting about Waggoner.

1326
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:10,400
I feel like they had him for a day, day and a half,

1327
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,960
like, I feel like.

1328
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:12,800
Yeah, less time than Tommy.

1329
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,000
Get to show what he can do.

1330
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,040
I feel like he probably wanted to get in and out.

1331
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,440
I would say I have no sense of what he can do.

1332
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,280
I don't know. It's just a guy,

1333
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,440
he's a handsome guy.

1334
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,560
Oh, yeah, I've seen a few Wonder Woman's,

1335
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,600
not recently, but it's fine.

1336
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,280
I don't really remember anything about him.

1337
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,600
But I'd kill to go to a poker game at this guy's house.

1338
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,440
I'd love to hang with him.

1339
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,280
His mansion, yeah, yeah.

1340
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,240
I mean, he's passed away, but I'd love to hang with him.

1341
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,640
Playing Steve Trevor in Wonder Woman,

1342
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,720
same character as Chris Pine.

1343
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,560
Chris Pine.

1344
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,520
Oh, oh, gotcha, oh, he's that character.

1345
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,120
Okay, okay.

1346
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,880
Anyway, well, that's, let's see, other stuff,

1347
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,800
that covers a lot of those, that covers Rhodes,

1348
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,360
that covers Theavis.

1349
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,240
Scotty Plummer.

1350
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,320
Scotty Plummer, would you care to explain Scotty Plummer?

1351
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,320
Scotty Plummer, okay, so in the middle of this special,

1352
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,880
Lucy Arnaz gets accosted on Main Street

1353
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,760
by a kid who's like, I've loved you forever.

1354
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,160
I'm 14.

1355
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,880
And she's like, hey, wait a minute,

1356
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,240
don't you dabble in music too?

1357
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,200
And he's like, yeah, I'm Scotty Plummer.

1358
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,320
He's a little 14-year-old boy.

1359
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:19,240
It looks like he's wearing a plastic red wig.

1360
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,840
He looks like he's a Lego piece or something.

1361
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:26,640
He's got such a perfectly round head of red hair.

1362
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:31,640
His pants, shirt, and belt also look molded.

1363
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,960
It's the most 70s outfit you've ever seen.

1364
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,640
Yes, he's a 70s red-haired little boy.

1365
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,480
Yeah.

1366
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:38,320
14-year-old boy.

1367
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,560
Yet more, they aren't all in the Rhodes kids.

1368
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,560
There's still more.

1369
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,040
But there's different flavors of 70s kids.

1370
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,720
Redheads, 70s redheads, yeah.

1371
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:47,120
So they kind of run around Disney World

1372
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,600
and do like a montage,

1373
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,440
because Lucy's like, we've got so much to do.

1374
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,760
We got to see everything.

1375
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:57,160
And then after that, he's like, I'm worn out, Lucy.

1376
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:01,160
Or he says, I think he says, I'm plum tuckered.

1377
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,920
And then she says, everyone needs

1378
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,080
their plum tuckered once in a while.

1379
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,040
Dare you, Lucy.

1380
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,480
He's 14.

1381
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,960
She's 14 years old.

1382
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,760
Yeah, I was conflicted,

1383
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,320
because I'm like, that's a pretty good line.

1384
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,080
But also, that's very weird to say to a 14-year-old.

1385
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,800
Did you know that I was at Target,

1386
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,320
and they sell a plum tucker in the pharmacy section.

1387
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,160
Oh, yeah?

1388
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:23,980
Bright purple.

1389
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,820
That's right.

1390
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,660
The wellness area?

1391
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:26,560
That's right, yeah.

1392
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,360
Yes, weird.

1393
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,840
That's also one of the old days

1394
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,240
where I feel like you would have asked them,

1395
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,640
and she would be like, oh, that's just nothing.

1396
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,840
They weren't even thinking

1397
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,040
that I'm making a sex joke to a child.

1398
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:38,880
Yeah.

1399
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:39,720
Yeah, I don't know.

1400
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,540
Yeah, it just sounds like something.

1401
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:41,560
It's just like a thing.

1402
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,400
I've said this before.

1403
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,040
You watch some old Bing Crosby stuff,

1404
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,520
and sometimes there's just repeating the rhythm

1405
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,160
of what should be a joke.

1406
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,080
Not even really a joke, if you think about it.

1407
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,440
It just moves fast enough

1408
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,000
that you don't stop and question it.

1409
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,760
Right. Yeah, yeah.

1410
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,840
Yeah, there is a May-December vibe,

1411
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:02,840
but not a two-hour heart-wrenching movie.

1412
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,160
Between the two, you mean?

1413
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,000
Between the two.

1414
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,160
Oh, you got the vibe.

1415
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,000
There is a week.

1416
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,720
No, it's just that long.

1417
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,760
It's an Anakin-Padme situation.

1418
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:12,600
Oh, I guess so.

1419
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,080
From Phantom Menace.

1420
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,840
It's about the same age spread, I think.

1421
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,040
I don't like getting my plum tuckered.

1422
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,320
Well, no, it would be Jake Lloyd saying,

1423
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,480
I don't like getting my plum tuckered.

1424
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,920
This is why we need Bugmane to clarify these things here,

1425
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:29,760
and he would know.

1426
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,320
You're not getting your plum tuckered, right?

1427
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,720
You're not getting your plum tuckered, right?

1428
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,080
Like the meme.

1429
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,480
Yes.

1430
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,440
So then Scotty does a little number,

1431
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:45,200
because Scotty Plumber was a banjo prodigy.

1432
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,400
Yes.

1433
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,280
And he does a little dance, too.

1434
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,080
He does a little tap.

1435
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,640
He dances a little bit.

1436
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,960
He dances. He plays the banjo.

1437
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:53,800
He plays the banjo.

1438
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,360
He has a hootenanny going on.

1439
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:58,400
Yeah, the country bears show up for the hootenanny.

1440
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,080
Seeing the suited country bears is always a delight.

1441
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,600
This is another one where I was like,

1442
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,120
okay, this section's okay, or whatever.

1443
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,440
A little boy's dancing and playing the fucking banjo?

1444
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,480
I'm back in.

1445
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,320
Now I'm back in.

1446
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,640
My adrenaline shoots again through the roof.

1447
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,360
Now I know that you're all about hillbilly nonsense.

1448
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,360
I'm a big hillbilly nonsense guy.

1449
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,960
These things I learned.

1450
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,680
Do you guys know who Billy Strings is?

1451
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,400
That's a guy who plays the guitar.

1452
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,320
He's a young man, 31.

1453
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,960
I assumed that was your name when you...

1454
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,800
Billy Strings?

1455
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,560
Well, when you start out with the ventriloquist Ws,

1456
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,640
because there's so many Strings.

1457
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,200
Well, that's more of a Pinocchio.

1458
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,040
Oh, that's a marionette.

1459
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,000
We didn't even get into how marionettes are different.

1460
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:36,840
Not a marionette guy.

1461
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,080
Not a marionette person.

1462
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,680
You're more of a marionette guy, I think, than I am.

1463
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,000
Yeah, we've done some comedy

1464
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,600
where you made me play with a little puppet boy before.

1465
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,920
Yeah, we bought a marionette for you,

1466
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,320
but it wasn't because I have a thing for marionettes.

1467
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,400
I just think... You just know about them.

1468
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,280
Well, I don't even want to say I know about them.

1469
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,240
I don't know the history of marionettes.

1470
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,760
I don't want to say something wrong here.

1471
00:58:58,760 --> 00:58:59,600
Okay.

1472
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,720
Because there's probably marionette enthusiasts out there.

1473
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,800
Well, anyway, I had a diversion

1474
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,520
because I couldn't remember the last name,

1475
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:09,680
and I saw Scottie Plummer did open for Liberace,

1476
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,760
and I'm like, no way. Oh, yes, I saw that too.

1477
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,800
This isn't the Scott, and then I confirmed that

1478
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,360
Scott Thorson is not Scott Plummer,

1479
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:20,800
or else Mike would have called or texted

1480
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,920
if it had been Scott Thorson in the middle of a special.

1481
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,000
Scott Thorson was playing the banjo

1482
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,960
on a Disney World special.

1483
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:27,800
I didn't.

1484
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,720
I would have said we're doing the episode now.

1485
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,880
Well, we would have done it five years ago, yeah.

1486
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:33,920
Yeah. Right.

1487
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:38,760
So I got a little caught up in that, just confirming that.

1488
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,560
That's confusing, because he does like, yeah,

1489
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,880
he has an affinity for Scots,

1490
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,320
and he likes talented youngsters.

1491
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,560
Surprised he didn't get the Rhodes kids.

1492
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:51,600
They're the new generation, and I'm not just saying this

1493
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:55,520
because Michael Thevis dangled me out a balcony window.

1494
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:59,160
He was on a special that I've never seen,

1495
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:03,320
Scottie Plummer was, called Lucy Moves to NBC,

1496
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,680
which I wouldn't need to watch.

1497
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:08,600
I did see that, yeah, because she used to be on CBS.

1498
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:09,440
I don't know, there was something.

1499
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,920
And they made a big deal out of it.

1500
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,400
Tread lightly, guys.

1501
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,040
You're gonna start getting your corrections.

1502
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,880
I've got the question marks in there.

1503
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:17,720
That's what J.T. Jason said it.

1504
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,280
I think Lucy Arnaz got her show on CBS.

1505
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,480
Well, I'm being very careful about it.

1506
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,400
I didn't say anything untrue about marionettes or anything.

1507
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,040
I just said, I don't know, it's not my business to say.

1508
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,040
And I'm saying I don't know as well.

1509
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,040
Okay, good, good.

1510
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,920
Yeah, and Scottie Plummer passed away, sadly,

1511
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:34,400
in the early 90s.

1512
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,120
He got in an accident, so he did not live.

1513
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,520
He's not currently alive.

1514
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,480
So I guess that's another person who has passed away

1515
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,680
that Jason was missing out on.

1516
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,960
Yeah, I confuse that.

1517
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,480
I thought he was still alive,

1518
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,480
because he was so young.

1519
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,000
Scott Thorson also passed away recently.

1520
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,240
Have you seen Behind the Candelabra, Jason?

1521
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,080
Not all of it.

1522
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Somehow I've never seen all of it.

1523
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:56,840
That's my Scottie's favorite movie.

1524
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:59,120
It's an HBO TV movie, right?

1525
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,560
It's gotta be on Mac still, yeah.

1526
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,200
It's meant for theatrical,

1527
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,280
but it was too daring at the time.

1528
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:07,480
Right, because Matt Damon Kisses, Matt Douglas,

1529
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:08,320
Michael Douglas.

1530
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,320
Well, it goes further than kissing, I would say.

1531
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,720
Well, right, but I'm just saying.

1532
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:12,560
Hand holding?

1533
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,880
You don't see Michael Douglas' dick getting sucked,

1534
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,680
and it doesn't happen.

1535
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:19,760
No, not literally, no.

1536
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,040
No, I'm just saying visually.

1537
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,440
Yes, what they're implying, obviously,

1538
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,640
is more than kissing.

1539
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,880
Yeah, there's a big dance with soldiers.

1540
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,040
Now, see, this is where we're very different,

1541
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,400
because you were like, I love it,

1542
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,000
and that's around where I wrote the word interminable.

1543
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,960
Right, that was my reaction to the next number,

1544
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,160
but I didn't like it when she was floating

1545
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:45,360
with two immobile toy soldiers,

1546
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,840
but then when they started moving

1547
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,240
and all the other guys came out,

1548
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,640
they had a big aerial shot.

1549
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,920
I was like, okay, I like this now.

1550
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,960
They were setting it up.

1551
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,200
Okay, this pays off.

1552
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,200
I think my interminable actually may have been

1553
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,040
for the next thing, though,

1554
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,720
because the next thing is where we get into

1555
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,680
what Iceberg mentioned, which is the banana.

1556
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,880
Do they clear out all of Adventureland?

1557
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,280
Is that what we're looking at?

1558
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,520
Yeah, I think so.

1559
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:12,200
And it's just a big, big nightclub, basically,

1560
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:17,040
in which the two boys, the goofs, Lyle and Tommy,

1561
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:21,440
start with, yes, we have no bananas,

1562
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,440
which I assume was number three on Jason's Spotify raps.

1563
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,720
Only because he doesn't use it often.

1564
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,880
Local files.

1565
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,160
He has that on a local file he listens to more.

1566
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,160
But then we're mixing all these banana songs.

1567
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,200
This is, this is really, oh.

1568
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,480
Can I real quick side note, just a quick question,

1569
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:44,640
because we have this on the last second gate

1570
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,120
that we recorded, or two ago.

1571
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:49,400
You used Apple Music, we had a misunderstanding,

1572
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,360
that you use Apple Music primarily to listen

1573
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,240
to your albums that you have locally?

1574
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,760
Yeah, I always forget it's not called.

1575
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:01,120
Do you do it on your phone or your computer, generally?

1576
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,600
And Shin, would this be a good time for me

1577
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:03,840
to use the restroom?

1578
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,520
If you want, I'm getting somewhere,

1579
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,480
is that Apple Music also has a list

1580
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,880
of most listened to songs for the year.

1581
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,280
So potentially.

1582
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,080
For locally downloaded songs?

1583
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,320
That's what I wanna know.

1584
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:20,000
If you have a list of what actually is your top 10 songs

1585
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
listened to in the year.

1586
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:21,960
I mean, you can take a look,

1587
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,920
and we'll see if it has that.

1588
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:29,360
I mean, I'll look now, any time I touch any tab

1589
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,520
besides albums.

1590
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:33,000
I can find it for you if you want,

1591
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,840
but I'm just saying we will be able to see the actual list

1592
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,800
if indeed it shows local files.

1593
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:38,640
That's all I'm saying.

1594
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,840
So we'll see truly if Sabrina Carpenter is number one.

1595
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:45,080
He's not gonna, Andrew, you're gonna see tab after tab,

1596
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:48,880
open tab after open tab of target sex toys.

1597
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,480
And peep show machines.

1598
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,840
Personal peep machines.

1599
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:54,920
At home peep machines.

1600
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,520
And Apple notes he's made to himself.

1601
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,720
Start peep show machine business.

1602
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,920
No, Thebes is dead.

1603
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,560
There's a new Scarface of Sex in town.

1604
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,760
And there's like a diagram he's drawn with his finger

1605
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,320
on the Apple note of a new machine he's concocting.

1606
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,160
Peep machines are back.

1607
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:12,360
The kids like vinyl, and the kids like peep machines.

1608
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:16,160
The only tabs I have are radio library.

1609
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,240
I'm gonna have to, would you feel comfortable

1610
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,160
sliding your phone to me?

1611
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,400
No. I'm not going anywhere

1612
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,200
other than if I promise you,

1613
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,560
I will not look at your texts or anything.

1614
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,480
Would you feel comfortable?

1615
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,040
And I'm laughing, but I swear

1616
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:31,560
I will not go through anything else.

1617
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:34,480
I know on the air, you maybe would believe me off air

1618
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,000
more than you would on air.

1619
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I do.

1620
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:37,960
Okay, what if I come over?

1621
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,000
I will take the microphone off the stand.

1622
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,800
Yeah, do that.

1623
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,840
And I will guide you and see if we find it.

1624
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:46,440
Scott, you didn't like the toy soldiers?

1625
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:47,280
No, I know.

1626
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,100
I think we covered that.

1627
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:48,940
Yeah, yeah.

1628
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:49,780
Okay.

1629
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:50,600
I think we didn't talk enough

1630
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:53,080
how good the Tommy Toon section is

1631
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:54,480
where he's dancing on top of buildings.

1632
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,320
Do we need to say more about that?

1633
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,400
I think it's pretty good.

1634
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,080
I say it's very good.

1635
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:58,920
What do we do now?

1636
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:01,000
Now that you guys are phone fiddling over there,

1637
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:01,840
what am I supposed to do?

1638
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,080
Well, what else?

1639
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:07,040
By the end of the special, I'll tell you what I find funny.

1640
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:09,800
The actual ceremony for Space Mountain.

1641
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:10,640
Yes, we do get into it.

1642
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,680
They introduce all these astronauts and scientists,

1643
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,360
most of them just nod to the crowd.

1644
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,760
Yes, just kind of angry looking.

1645
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:19,960
This is important that they,

1646
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,320
I think we all associate Space Mountain with space travel.

1647
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,540
We certainly just don't think

1648
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:26,080
it's a cool roller coaster in the dark.

1649
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:29,080
It's like, this is a tribute to our brave astronauts.

1650
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:32,280
So they must be here for the opening, right?

1651
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:35,280
This is impossible to do because I'm talking to Jason.

1652
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,000
We're trying to, but he's peering at his own phone

1653
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,680
because he's afraid that you're gonna end up looking

1654
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:44,280
at his like, save number for a prone boneologist.

1655
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,560
I don't think there's any.

1656
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:46,760
I've only been at Apple Music though.

1657
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:49,280
I think, okay, what it is I think is Jason,

1658
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,920
they don't have the tab because you're not subscribed,

1659
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,000
but I do believe it would show up if you were subscribed.

1660
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:54,920
They would have shown.

1661
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:56,660
So if I wanted to pay $10,

1662
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:59,200
I believe we could unlock it is what I'm saying.

1663
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,360
I would be willing to pay $10 for Jason to unlock,

1664
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,720
but we should do that off the air.

1665
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:03,560
All right.

1666
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:04,440
I'm not going in on this.

1667
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:05,560
I don't need to know this.

1668
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:08,000
I know one of his music lists.

1669
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,360
I don't need the rest.

1670
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:11,560
If the listeners want to go in on it, that's fine.

1671
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:12,400
I do need the rest.

1672
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,320
So should they Venmo you then for the 10?

1673
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,320
If the listener wants to Venmo me.

1674
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:19,680
I don't know how Apple Music also says Chappell Rhone

1675
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,960
like everyone else, but it does.

1676
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,160
This is what I'm saying.

1677
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,880
Every week it's like, I am relevant.

1678
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,120
Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Rhone.

1679
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,440
I said the names again.

1680
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,280
We are not old.

1681
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,160
We are not 40 or above it.

1682
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,920
I could have gone through the list of albums

1683
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:34,960
though he has in the library.

1684
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,760
Maybe I should have done that now that I'm thinking about it

1685
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:37,580
when I was over there.

1686
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:38,420
Cause that does show up.

1687
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:39,260
What is your end game here?

1688
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:41,320
What are we trying to do to our friend here?

1689
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,160
I'm just wondering if Sabrina Carpenter

1690
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,640
would be number one there too.

1691
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:45,480
That's what I'm saying.

1692
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:46,320
I want to know because-

1693
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:47,640
I don't use it that much.

1694
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,440
Okay. You don't use Apple Music that much?

1695
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,280
No.

1696
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:51,120
Okay.

1697
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,400
Well, I just want to see if they lined up.

1698
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,440
Who's listening and going, thank God Mike kept,

1699
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,280
we, they veered out of this territory

1700
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,840
at space mountain speed before.

1701
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:04,240
We need more of Jason, more haranguing Jason

1702
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,080
about his track.

1703
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:08,680
We have arrived at the entryway of space mountain

1704
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:09,520
in the special.

1705
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:13,560
I did have stuff to say before I let Scott talk about

1706
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:14,860
off-brand Mickey.

1707
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,880
Yeah. The scientists, you're right, Scott,

1708
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,440
they mostly glower at the camera.

1709
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,840
One of them says a brief introduction

1710
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:26,840
and then they all clap that space mountain is open.

1711
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:30,600
There is a marching band walking on the people movement track.

1712
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:34,680
But at that time of day, it was mostly in shadows.

1713
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,880
You could hear a marching band

1714
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,200
and see shadowy figures walking on the track.

1715
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,040
Yeah. They're behind rails and yeah,

1716
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,480
nobody's got a good shot of them,

1717
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,960
but they do cover that all.

1718
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,320
It's interesting to see a bunch of people

1719
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:48,080
walking on a track, 2000 member band.

1720
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,520
You have to see how they did ride openings at this time.

1721
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,260
They didn't have to get no fancy Hollywood stars.

1722
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:54,880
They just needed fancy astronauts,

1723
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,640
fancy guys who've been to the stars.

1724
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:57,480
That's right.

1725
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,260
They get Jim Irwin, the eighth man on the moon.

1726
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:00,220
He's there.

1727
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:03,600
They had 2000 marching band guys,

1728
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:07,440
a pageant of nations is something they said happens.

1729
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,320
And I don't remember really what that was comprised of.

1730
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,560
I think they should have put the marching band

1731
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:15,080
in people mover vehicles.

1732
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,120
Like two to four in each vehicle

1733
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,800
and then they're just running and playing their instruments.

1734
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,640
I think that would have been fun.

1735
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,260
I wonder if that would be less safe.

1736
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:25,640
Yeah, possibly to have to operate and just tidy,

1737
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,660
you gotta like space out those horns.

1738
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:29,380
Yeah, probably not safe walking,

1739
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:31,040
but maybe worse in the vehicles.

1740
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,440
I mean, they don't let people have selfie sticks today,

1741
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,440
much less a tuba.

1742
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,120
I looked up these astronauts

1743
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:40,520
and the reason I looked them up, as I said,

1744
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:44,240
do any of these astronauts believe in UFOs?

1745
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:48,280
You're trying anything you can to get your UFO.

1746
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,400
We got a winner, folks.

1747
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,520
Oh, man.

1748
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,760
Gordon Cooper.

1749
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,920
The first man to spend an entire day in space.

1750
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:59,640
Gordon Cooper believes that the government

1751
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,480
has been covering up UFOs.

1752
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,200
He has testified this.

1753
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,560
He says there's been hundreds of reports by people,

1754
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:06,560
different pilots.

1755
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,040
He did not see one in space,

1756
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,680
but he saw one in a mission

1757
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,920
when he was flying over West Germany in 1951.

1758
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,000
So he is a guy, like many other people

1759
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,040
who worked in the government,

1760
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:21,640
who believe that UAP or UFOs are real.

1761
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:24,120
So my guy here, I found an interview with him

1762
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:27,000
where he seems like he never blinks

1763
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,520
and it's kind of a scary interview.

1764
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:29,640
Yeah.

1765
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:30,760
Jesus, Gordon.

1766
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:34,240
Appears to be at a funeral floral this week.

1767
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:35,760
This is 1999.

1768
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,880
The film quality is oddly eerie in some ways too

1769
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,280
that makes it look like his skin

1770
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:43,640
is like some sort of like puppet or plastic.

1771
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:44,720
Like I'm just like,

1772
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:45,560
there's a lot of things going on.

1773
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:49,440
He looks like a damaged wax figure of Ed Harris.

1774
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,600
Yes, that's a very good way to put it.

1775
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,040
And it looks like he's,

1776
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:56,000
the backdrop is like a Sears portrait studio or something,

1777
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,160
like a red silk curtain is behind him.

1778
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,120
So you're saying he believes the government

1779
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,520
is covering up UFOs.

1780
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,880
Yes, he's seen personally has seen something

1781
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,360
like a saucer thing that flies in like inexplicable ways.

1782
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,160
Isn't that a given?

1783
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,640
Is that that unusual to think?

1784
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:13,480
What do you mean?

1785
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:15,720
Oh, I just thought that since I was a child,

1786
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:18,200
the government was covering up UFOs.

1787
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:21,320
Oh, well, some people would doubt you're serious.

1788
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,080
I am serious, yeah.

1789
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:23,920
Well, I think as a kid,

1790
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,360
you're like, oh, probably the government,

1791
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:26,760
it's a big coverup in Area 51.

1792
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:27,600
And then as you get old,

1793
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:28,880
this is my arc at least,

1794
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:29,720
then as you get older, you go,

1795
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,880
wow, that's all kind of nonsense or whatever.

1796
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:34,120
But then slowly, especially in the last 10 years,

1797
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,480
I do believe that they have been covering up.

1798
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,000
Yes, I believe there's something going on.

1799
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,800
I don't know that it's like green man.

1800
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,800
It's like a fun Mars attacks situation.

1801
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,080
But there's definitely a bunch of weird stuff

1802
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,160
that no one can explain that some of it documented,

1803
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,000
some of it not.

1804
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,280
Why don't I care about this?

1805
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,040
A lot of people don't care.

1806
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:55,320
Do you find on the other end,

1807
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:56,960
when you go into this, which I'm sure you do,

1808
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,800
do you find a lot of on the other end,

1809
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,960
just kind of like start to zone as I zone?

1810
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,760
I'm not saying you're wrong or right.

1811
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:07,720
But I think I am saying that deep into a podcast episode.

1812
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:10,200
The majority of people don't care.

1813
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,520
There's been a bunch of public hearings recently

1814
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:15,360
where people say crazy stuff in the public hearing,

1815
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,720
seemingly like reasonable seeming people who go,

1816
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:21,520
there have been bodies recovered from craft.

1817
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,440
People have been injured recovering bodies from craft.

1818
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,640
We don't know what it is.

1819
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:29,240
Like Boeing or other companies like retake technology,

1820
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:31,160
they use it to make some crazy,

1821
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:33,640
like there's all of these crazy statements saying,

1822
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,000
this is nowhere near major headlines.

1823
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
No one's talking about it.

1824
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:37,840
No one gives a shit.

1825
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:38,680
So you're not alone.

1826
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:41,600
Most people are just like, yeah, that was weird.

1827
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,760
Yeah, that's about all I can muster.

1828
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,280
No disrespect to it.

1829
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,440
I just go, oh really?

1830
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,920
I just think it's, yeah.

1831
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:50,440
So you're not wrong.

1832
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,120
It's the majority of people right now.

1833
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,080
They're like, I got bigger things to worry about.

1834
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,760
Call me when the ET is on the TV.

1835
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,560
Like that's the majority of people.

1836
01:11:58,560 --> 01:11:59,520
Put a camera in front of them

1837
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:00,360
when they're ready to address me.

1838
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,200
Call me when the ET is on the TV

1839
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:03,920
and then I'll be interested.

1840
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,360
But let me ask you this though.

1841
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:06,600
What do you think about,

1842
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,760
do you have any opinion on it in general?

1843
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,280
Do you go, ah, that's weird, I don't know.

1844
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:11,240
Is that your opinion? I'm about there.

1845
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,080
I'm about there.

1846
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:15,000
I'm similar to, I got nothing on ghosts.

1847
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,840
I know there's a lot in podcast world

1848
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,200
about like let's tell ghost stories

1849
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,080
and you must have a ghost, I got nothing.

1850
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,960
If that was posed to me on some show, I'd have zero.

1851
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:24,800
I don't know what it is.

1852
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,640
Maybe I'm not imaginative enough.

1853
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,680
I'm not a ghost guy, I wouldn't say.

1854
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:30,520
I'm not a ghost guy.

1855
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:32,120
I'm not a Sasquatch guy.

1856
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,880
It's just the same feeling from, I don't know.

1857
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,000
Yeah, maybe, could be.

1858
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,760
I also don't necessarily think that an alien is an alien.

1859
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:44,600
It's interdimensional, like a crystal skull.

1860
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,760
I'm not married to some sort of philosophy

1861
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:47,960
that I have about it.

1862
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,080
But I do find it fascinating

1863
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,520
and I find that there's more information coming out

1864
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,120
in very public places now.

1865
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,480
I like looking at Jason with his iPad

1866
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:57,000
with the Space Mountain sign on it,

1867
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,360
just sitting and waiting.

1868
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,960
When can I be in there?

1869
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,360
Well, I'm also just like, how much do I chime in on this?

1870
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:05,680
I don't, I- What do you think?

1871
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:06,520
Yeah, chime in.

1872
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,280
Well, I have not had many paranormal,

1873
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:12,400
or any paranormal experiences, I feel like.

1874
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,960
But I'm very superstitious.

1875
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:17,480
So you more think like demons are real.

1876
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,480
I don't know, I don't-

1877
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:20,600
That was a big leap.

1878
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:22,760
No, I didn't say that.

1879
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:25,840
I just more like, I check my,

1880
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:31,680
I check astrology or I check co-star every now and then.

1881
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:34,640
He's worried that Barbara Stanwyck's gonna rise up

1882
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,280
and get be mad at him

1883
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:38,520
because he hasn't watched enough of her great films.

1884
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:39,360
Yeah.

1885
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,720
He's not going through the filmography fast enough.

1886
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:42,880
Tarot cards, I like tarot cards.

1887
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,040
I like all the like Ricky Jay stuff

1888
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:45,880
that he was-

1889
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:48,160
You're a magic, you're a fan of magicians.

1890
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:52,320
I like magic, but I feel like there are things beyond

1891
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,920
that we cannot comprehend.

1892
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,520
There's no doubt there's things beyond

1893
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,680
that we can't comprehend.

1894
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:57,520
It's all interesting.

1895
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,640
I mean, I'm more of like,

1896
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,960
oh, it's like human beings in another dimension

1897
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:04,160
or it's like me from a different dimension traveling.

1898
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:07,120
Like I'm more, I don't know that I think it's like

1899
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:10,280
Klingons coming from the planet.

1900
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,440
I think it's actually something like,

1901
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,680
I can't even like think about,

1902
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:15,960
like your dumb brain can't even conceive of.

1903
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:16,800
Anyway.

1904
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:17,640
It's like abstract.

1905
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:18,640
You know what, Gio, very interested too.

1906
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,400
Gio and I talk about this a lot, so.

1907
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,440
Well, let's get so-

1908
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:22,280
Bring him on, yeah.

1909
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:23,120
Yeah, bring him on, yeah.

1910
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:23,960
Bring him on my way.

1911
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,600
He's reading a book about, he's been one of these guys.

1912
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,760
Yeah, when you're away, we'll do a whole alien episode.

1913
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:31,320
I watched some of, oh, in Hulu,

1914
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:36,320
there's a history channel show called Strangest Things,

1915
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,400
which is like all objects from history

1916
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,400
that they still don't quite know what they are.

1917
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,880
They were involved in mysterious stuff.

1918
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,160
And then I watched a few minutes of Dan Aykroyd's

1919
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:51,880
as a history channel called Unexplained?

1920
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:52,720
Something like that.

1921
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:54,680
I'm gonna be honest with you right now.

1922
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:57,560
I promised my family that I would hang out with them

1923
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:58,440
this afternoon.

1924
01:14:58,440 --> 01:14:59,280
Yes.

1925
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:02,640
If I leave, you guys can do this as long as you want.

1926
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,480
Literally, I'm like, it's too late for Dan Aykroyd

1927
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:06,920
and aliens to be in the picture.

1928
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,480
You could go as long as you want.

1929
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:11,360
But we are talking space, which is related to-

1930
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:12,920
No, I know, I know.

1931
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,560
I'm saying I will leave the floor.

1932
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:17,400
I'm total, I'm done.

1933
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,480
I was going to open up another inquiry

1934
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:20,760
and just the sense of like,

1935
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,320
you're a Space Mountain fan, obviously.

1936
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:25,000
Were you a fan of anything?

1937
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,560
Did you like the concept of space and aliens as a kid?

1938
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,000
Even just like, was that a part of it?

1939
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,440
Or was it just the colors and the traveling in a spaceship?

1940
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,400
Yeah, I think it's dark and a good suspense.

1941
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,240
Okay.

1942
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:36,080
Sure, sure.

1943
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,920
I don't wanna step on this being a thing

1944
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,560
that is talked about.

1945
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:43,600
In this hour that we're doing our second episode in a row,

1946
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:44,920
I think I can't-

1947
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,280
Look, Gordon Cooper, look,

1948
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,720
I wouldn't have ham-fisted this into the episode

1949
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,560
unless my man Gordon, who appears-

1950
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:52,880
But what I'm saying,

1951
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,800
you guys can leave the microphones on.

1952
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,480
You can wrap up the episode.

1953
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,000
I haven't really eaten lunch.

1954
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
I don't need to go another 30 minutes.

1955
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,840
Oh, great.

1956
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,520
I'm just saying this is one of the guys.

1957
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:03,880
I don't know that he thought about aliens

1958
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:06,240
while he was sitting there watching Space Mountain be opened.

1959
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,080
I don't know.

1960
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:07,900
Or this was all very true.

1961
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:10,440
The reason he was so angry, as Jason pointed out,

1962
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,240
is that these guys glaring,

1963
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:14,880
it's because he's like, he knows what he saw.

1964
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:15,720
Right.

1965
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,160
They aren't even gonna, I'm just brought here to,

1966
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:20,120
they're just gonna do a parade of nations in front of me

1967
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,640
and release balloons.

1968
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:25,880
I watched an alien massacre.

1969
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:27,400
I saw what they do to each other.

1970
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,040
I saw, if they could do that to each other,

1971
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,280
what will they do to us?

1972
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,120
Yeah.

1973
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:34,560
I blew an alien's gray, he was a big gray,

1974
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:35,760
and I blew his brains out. I blew?

1975
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,880
Oh, God, that was such a long one.

1976
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:40,880
I fired, I got confused,

1977
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,120
cause I was also- I blew an alien.

1978
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:46,200
I, Gordon Cooper, blew an alien.

1979
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:49,080
I blew his brains out, his head was real big.

1980
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,200
I had to empty a whole magazine.

1981
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,120
I emptied a whole, he emptied a whole magazine

1982
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,120
into my mouth.

1983
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,440
The Vintage Space Mountain sign.

1984
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:00,560
We're gonna go back to an RCA sign after that.

1985
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,480
Mike yelled, I emptied a magazine into his mouth,

1986
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:06,760
and now we're gonna come back to RCA, good font.

1987
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:09,800
You're the ones talking about peep machines and stuff.

1988
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:14,120
Yeah, well, I think they would do a,

1989
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:15,200
they would make a comeback.

1990
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,120
You said come, and then it took a while to get back to it.

1991
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:20,440
If I, yes, they would make a come back.

1992
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,400
They would make anyone come.

1993
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:27,440
If they, if you could look in a peep machine

1994
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,360
and see a guy unloading,

1995
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,120
see an astronaut and an alien together.

1996
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:32,960
Maybe.

1997
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,720
A lot of mob business around this,

1998
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:37,560
coin operated, early pinball and video game machines.

1999
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:38,400
You think the mob was involved

2000
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:39,360
in the peep show machine business?

2001
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,120
Oh, 100%.

2002
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,880
I don't know about the mob, but maybe they were.

2003
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:47,520
I literally talked about this 45 minutes ago.

2004
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:50,400
I talked about a guy who was a mobbed up guy

2005
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,600
with peep machines.

2006
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,600
Did you say mobbed up, though?

2007
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,440
I don't know, I assume.

2008
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,400
Maybe he was just sort of a solo killer, though.

2009
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:57,240
I don't know.

2010
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:58,080
No, I think he is.

2011
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:58,920
I'm pretty sure.

2012
01:17:58,920 --> 01:17:59,740
You think Gordon Cooper.

2013
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:00,580
I didn't say it, you're right.

2014
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:02,000
Do you think Gordon Cooper got confused

2015
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:02,920
by anything at Disneyland,

2016
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:05,760
thinking it was sort of a extraterrestrial phenomenon?

2017
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,480
Do you think he was put up at the contemporary

2018
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:09,560
and asked to move to the Polynesian,

2019
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:10,400
because he's like,

2020
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,200
I don't want to think about this future shit.

2021
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,000
Oh, because of the architecture was so futuristic?

2022
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,560
Well, and the monorail.

2023
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:16,960
The monorail freaked him out.

2024
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,400
Yeah, maybe he saw the five-legged goat,

2025
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,160
and he's like, fuck that, now it's too close to the grave.

2026
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:23,800
It's possible he wanted to go to the Polynesian.

2027
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:24,620
Yeah.

2028
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:25,460
Yeah, I don't know.

2029
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:26,800
If Sonny Eclipse had been there then,

2030
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,000
he would have been unable to keep.

2031
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,840
Unloading a magazine.

2032
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:33,560
He would have unloaded a magazine in Sonny Eclipse.

2033
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:38,760
Anyway, there's about one minute of space mountain footage.

2034
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,200
Less, less.

2035
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:41,640
Yeah, well, and it's not even footage.

2036
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:45,680
It's just weirdly comped, half-opaque ride going by.

2037
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:48,120
Well, this is the biggest punishment for me,

2038
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:51,120
is that I'm like, when are we gonna get to Space Mountain?

2039
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,120
And then we do, and that's mostly represented

2040
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:57,080
by Lucy Arnaz singing a song from the Peter Pan musical.

2041
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:59,560
It's all said to I'm flying.

2042
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:02,640
In which, and it's somebody in that thing that says,

2043
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,400
Wizzin'.

2044
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,240
Wizzin'.

2045
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,060
Wizzin'.

2046
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:07,400
But wait, that's all special for Space Mountain,

2047
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,040
and now I gotta hear about Wizzin'.

2048
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:13,440
Yeah, that really is, that is a letdown.

2049
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,880
Yeah, now Space Mountain is a conundrum.

2050
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:16,760
How do you film it?

2051
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:19,240
They face this challenge to this day.

2052
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:22,280
Now there's better low-light cameras, it's easier to do.

2053
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:25,360
But at the time, that's why we have a mystery

2054
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,840
that's much bigger and more important

2055
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:28,480
than the mystery of are UFOs real?

2056
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,480
Which is, are there fans in Space Mountain

2057
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,200
that make you feel like it's going fast?

2058
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,800
We still haven't had a definitive.

2059
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,240
Someday, the truth is out there.

2060
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,240
Yeah.

2061
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:40,400
Can we ask Gordon Cooper, is he long dead?

2062
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,240
He's dead, yeah.

2063
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:42,080
He passed away.

2064
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,120
Well, I'm glad we implied that this long dead man

2065
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:46,480
had blue and alien.

2066
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,320
Spit out my mouth.

2067
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:49,880
That's good of us to do.

2068
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:50,720
American hero.

2069
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:53,800
That was not my intent, my intent was that he murdered

2070
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:56,200
a gray alien called, what?

2071
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,880
You were just trying to imply murder.

2072
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,920
We were the ones who made it sexual.

2073
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,560
You can't stop at blow and then doing a side

2074
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:04,760
and then come back.

2075
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:06,240
Yeah, yeah, that's what happened.

2076
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:07,920
We got caught on blow.

2077
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,200
Got caught on blow.

2078
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,680
Yeah, yeah, it was going to happen.

2079
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:15,480
Anyway, yeah, look, then, yeah, as Iceberg said,

2080
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:19,960
this does, the riot is ultimately inaugurated by a,

2081
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,120
look, I'm just going to do it.

2082
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,360
I could play the clip, but why would I

2083
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:24,680
when I know I want to talk like this?

2084
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:27,240
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

2085
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:29,600
we proudly present Space Mountain.

2086
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:33,360
Done kind of like, done with that aggression, I would say.

2087
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,000
It's always like aggressive.

2088
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,320
Yeah, that's an aggressive,

2089
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,960
that's where the voice comes from.

2090
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:41,280
He sounds like our aggressive, violent Mickey impression.

2091
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:44,120
That's why we do it, you see.

2092
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:45,960
Because he's angry, yeah, that's the vibe.

2093
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,720
But this one I'm saying really sounds like it.

2094
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:49,560
This reading.

2095
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:51,760
Let me get this straight, you make me wait

2096
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:56,080
after 50 goddamn minutes of Tommy Tune?

2097
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,840
That two bit hack?

2098
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,520
I wait after Lucy Arnaz, huh?

2099
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:01,880
Oh, why do we know her name?

2100
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:03,560
Is it because of the last name?

2101
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:06,360
Is it because of who mommy and daddy are?

2102
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,840
Who are my mommy and daddy?

2103
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:11,720
Nobody's, no one even, I don't even remember their names.

2104
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:14,400
I'm Mickey fucking Mouse, is who I am.

2105
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,400
I had to get up on top of the riverboat

2106
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,280
and clean all the footprints off of it.

2107
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:24,280
This fucking maniac dancing all over the diamond horseshoe.

2108
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:27,040
You're not supposed to go up there.

2109
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,200
We have rules about keep your hands and arms

2110
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,800
inside the vehicle for a reason.

2111
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,640
Cooper, I heard about your fucking request.

2112
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:38,000
You're staying put in your hotel room, you son of a bitch.

2113
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:43,560
Gordon Cooper, I know what you've been doing in your hotel.

2114
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:46,400
I know what you've been doing behind closed doors.

2115
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:49,360
You don't do that shit at Disney World.

2116
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,360
You don't do it.

2117
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:53,440
We had to clean up three dead bodies.

2118
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:57,720
This is a family slap, friendly slap, place slap.

2119
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,040
Who can't it you were in space?

2120
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:05,480
But Nez, if you fuck around with those boots like that again,

2121
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:06,720
I'll have you in jail.

2122
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:11,560
That was a blatant violation of common sense maritime law.

2123
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:13,960
And Waggoner, I've been in your trailers.

2124
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:15,920
They stink.

2125
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,080
I asked for my own.

2126
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:22,400
And Plumber, you're the darkest person I've ever gazed upon.

2127
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,040
I don't care how fucking old you are.

2128
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,480
It's so good that Mickey, like he's just,

2129
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,600
I feel like the newer Mickey cartoons

2130
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,280
are closest to that Mickey, honestly.

2131
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:36,760
They were really taking inspiration from this Mickey voice.

2132
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:39,760
But not enough swearing and not enough violence.

2133
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:40,600
Well, that's true.

2134
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:41,720
And that's what we ask out of whatever

2135
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:44,560
next official iteration of Mickey is out there.

2136
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,000
But now that we've talked for a while

2137
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,520
and done that voice at the end,

2138
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:52,520
I feel like mine's shot, mine's gonna go in about three.

2139
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:57,560
I feel like I just did two straight matinees of seesaw.

2140
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,000
So I better wind it down.

2141
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,560
I'd say you survived Podcast the Ride.

2142
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,200
Thanks for subscribing to Club 3.

2143
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,360
Thank you for the pitch.

2144
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:09,360
Iceberg, that was a blast.

2145
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,800
And yeah, your bravery saved the podcast.

2146
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,480
Well done, Freedom Fighters.

2147
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:19,520
Bug Nation, I wish you luck in one more round.

2148
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,280
May the putty sauce be with you.

2149
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:23,280
We can do it.

2150
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,080
Let's at least get the second again.
