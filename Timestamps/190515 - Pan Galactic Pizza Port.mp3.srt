1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:26,760
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate where you are about to hear the fruits of term

3
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:34,240
paper level research done in order to tell you about a robot pizza restaurant in Japan.

4
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,840
I'm Scott Caron, joined by Jason.

5
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,840
Share it in a mic, Carlson.

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,840
Carlson and Carlson Hi.

7
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,840
Carlson Hi.

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,840
Carlson Hi.

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,800
Okay, this is a big one.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,960
I feel a lot of pressure, much as I did with my previous Tokyo trip report episode because

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,360
I learned a lot and I want to share it all.

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,480
I want to weed through what is important and what is unimportant, but I think all of it

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:01,040
is very important about this topic, the Pan Galactic Pizza Port.

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,000
The Pan Galactic Pizza Port, as I said, is a pizza restaurant in Tomorrowland in Tokyo,

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Disneyland.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,840
I'm beginning the reading my essay, but I also think it's much more than that.

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,020
And that's why I was like, is this going to be like a 20 minute episode?

18
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,000
It's going to be a it's going to end up being a rambler because what I learned is that it

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,880
is not just a pizza, a robot pizza restaurant.

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:31,880
It is the centerpiece of an entire Tomorrowland mini land called the Tomorrowland Astro Zone.

21
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,040
This was I stumbled upon this while starting to look into my beloved Pan Galactic Pizza

22
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,780
Port that it was like they had this whole empty area for development over in Tomorrowland.

23
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,800
And when Star Tours went in, they didn't want to just put in the ride and do it as it had

24
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,920
been done before.

25
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,960
They wanted a bigger, grander presentation complete with a restaurant.

26
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,680
And they did it.

27
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,880
And we have some great Japanese sponsors to thank.

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,720
Mike, did you go to this place?

29
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,720
We did, but I think I didn't take it in.

30
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,680
I didn't absorb it.

31
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,400
Like we talked on the episode, there was stuff that I did that you didn't do.

32
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,560
But I do think I kind of missed it.

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,760
I saw him, but I don't know why I didn't take a little more time with him.

34
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,280
You may have been on the way somewhere or there might have been something like that.

35
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,440
Going to an attraction.

36
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,440
I wouldn't blame you.

37
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,600
Yeah, I think that's probably what it was.

38
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:33,280
And by him we mean Tony Solaroni, who is the head of this specific Pan Galactic Pizza Port.

39
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
It's franchise, right?

40
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,320
Yes, because there are a number of them as implied by the audiovisual materials in this

41
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,320
restaurant.

42
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:49,640
It is a quick service restaurant in Tokyo Disneyland that includes animatronics, a big

43
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:56,240
crazy Rube Goldberg machine, videos that are live action, animated puppets.

44
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:02,280
It is this crazy multimedia endeavor that I was so blown away by.

45
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,240
Mike, I think why I took more time with it.

46
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,440
I was aware of this thing and I thought I would probably like it.

47
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,240
I thought it was probably it was in my wheelhouse of like wrecks and star tours and sunny eclipse

48
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,640
and all that kind of thing.

49
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,080
But I wasn't even like it wasn't I didn't go into the trip thinking and then my beloved

50
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,200
Pan Galactic Pizza Port.

51
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,400
I didn't really know.

52
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,200
But with the first night, as I think I said in the other episode, it was raining so badly,

53
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,520
the worst weather the entire trip and so bad.

54
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,760
There's like, let's just get let's just do everything indoors, which was a fun run because

55
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,560
we got to do the weird tiki room that Stitch interrupts, which I don't think I talked about.

56
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,320
Oh, yeah, we saw it.

57
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,000
It's weird.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,800
I kind of like it.

59
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,720
It's like nothing you'd really put a spotlight on.

60
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,240
But I liked it more than I thought.

61
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,800
And it didn't bother me like that one that Iago and Desu interrupt.

62
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,720
Under new management.

63
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:01,200
Yeah, I thought it made a lot more sense because he has he likes Hawaiian stuff and Elvis.

64
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,000
It thematically does make more sense.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,920
I could have I forget there was I had one.

66
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,480
I'm trying to remember my complaint, but that's for a different episode.

67
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,840
We had like a big note for it, but I can't remember what it was.

68
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,640
Of characters that have become ubiquitous, like I don't mind Stitch.

69
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:23,320
No, I find his story, his backstory very moving and endearing.

70
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,200
Oh, did you do the Stitch like turtle talk?

71
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,080
I did not know.

72
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,040
We did that.

73
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,200
And it's all in Japanese, so we didn't understand any of it, but it's adorable.

74
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,760
Oh, really?

75
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,280
Yeah.

76
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,360
I was wondering if I should have done it.

77
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,880
I didn't do it.

78
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,560
It's pretty cute.

79
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:34,880
Yeah.

80
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,480
In the former space of micro adventure, the right there, what they retitled, honey, I

81
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,600
took the audience.

82
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,680
There's also throughout the parks, you see girl Stitch.

83
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,640
I don't know what girl Stitch is.

84
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,600
I don't see in a movie video.

85
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,840
She's from a video sequel or the TV show.

86
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,160
Yeah.

87
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,960
Video game.

88
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,520
I don't know, but she's in the parks.

89
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,520
I liked girl Stitch.

90
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,000
It's probably disrespectful of me to only say girl Stitch.

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,720
But I mean, keep going.

92
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,200
I'll look up the name of girls.

93
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:10,760
Tony Solaroni in the Pangolac to pizza part also has a wife who has no name beyond Tony's

94
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,760
wife.

95
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,120
He just misses Solaroni.

96
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,320
Oh, her name is Angel, AKA experiment 624.

97
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,000
What's she from?

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,960
What is her origin?

99
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,120
Oh, let's see.

100
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,640
Let's see.

101
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,720
What's her origin or what movie or what thing is she from?

102
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,560
Got to load up Disney Wiki.

103
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,840
Lilo and Stitch 7.3.

104
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,080
The Oahu adventure.

105
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,600
Written by Michael Isner.

106
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,400
Don't wait for me.

107
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,160
I'll keep reading.

108
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,680
OK.

109
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,840
I had to say it at the end during the sign off.

110
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,240
Oh, she shows up in the series.

111
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,800
Sorry.

112
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,720
Yeah, I think she shows up on the TV show.

113
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,800
Well, isn't it weird that they would heavily feature Angel from the Lilo and Stitch cartoon?

114
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,360
But then there's like Max's all over the place.

115
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,040
Yes, that's true.

116
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,680
Especially in Tokyo and now a little bit more out here too.

117
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,560
And he's most, I mean, he was created on Goof Troop.

118
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,720
There's also Leroy.

119
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,760
Oh, I don't know about Leroy.

120
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,040
He's a red Stitch.

121
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,480
Oh, is he bad?

122
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,240
Well, Stitches are a little bad, but they like venoms.

123
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,400
They're like another illegal experiment like Angel and Stitch.

124
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,120
He's a henchman.

125
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,600
Ham Hamster Veal's new henchman and his own version of Stitch.

126
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,440
Hamster Veal is a rabbit hamster creature.

127
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,520
This is like we might have to look into Stitch, the TV show.

128
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,040
This is kind of coming back to me.

129
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,600
I think I'd catch it every now and then.

130
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,920
Perhaps I wouldn't.

131
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,040
I would like to do that.

132
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,280
I wouldn't put it ahead in the order of the Mighty Ducks cartoon.

133
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,520
Yeah, that's that's a whole that that pre predates Prestige TV.

134
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,040
Every week, the Patreon listeners go, will this week be the Mighty Ducks

135
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,800
or the Annette Funicello recording career?

136
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,920
And it's not and they go, not this week or the Schomburg Mall or the mall.

137
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,920
Yeah, there's plenty of reasons to be to be subscribing.

138
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,360
You're on the on the edge of your seat every single week.

139
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,920
It's like when people are sitting around the 60s going like,

140
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,760
when is Revolver going to come out?

141
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,560
We're waiting for Revolver.

142
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,880
They're getting even more experimental.

143
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,680
Yeah.

144
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,200
So, yeah, so I was in this run of a lot of indoor stuff

145
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,520
and we just we just needed to sit and chill for a little while.

146
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,720
And I said, oh, you know what?

147
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,320
This is maybe my opportunity to sit and watch the Panglectek Pizza

148
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,400
Port for a little bit.

149
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,360
I knew it was funny. I knew it was robots.

150
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,000
But I did not intend to sit and watch the entire loop,

151
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,600
which I did happily and was smiling, grinning like an idiot.

152
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,760
By the end of it, it is it is so much fun.

153
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,680
But also, I think is, you know, what something I was really looking forward

154
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,960
to before this trip was that it seemed to me like their Tomorrowland was special.

155
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,040
It seems like it's a fun mix of like,

156
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,320
you know, the early 80s sleekness and they still have the, you know,

157
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:06,000
the the big blue spires outside and there's no weird rocks

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,920
and Astro Orbiter in a place where it's not supposed to be.

159
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,160
It's sleek and clean, like past Tomorrowlands.

160
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,640
It's pure still.

161
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,080
Yes. It's got a pure vision.

162
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,760
It hasn't been like there's not like a couple different overlays they tried

163
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,600
and then failed and still remnants of them.

164
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,000
Not a mishmash yet.

165
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,200
This point, I think there was a unified Disneyland Tomorrowland at some point.

166
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,120
But now, yeah, now it's a clash of like five of them.

167
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,120
And they're trying to make them all work together.

168
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,560
And I think they just need to wipe the slate clean for all that from scratch.

169
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,720
They never had to do it in Tokyo.

170
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,600
And if as if it couldn't get any better than that, then they add in 89.

171
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,320
They added the Tomorrowland Estrosone, which the specific thing

172
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,560
that I'm after future by way of 80s, very back to the future to

173
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,040
all the signage is very Pepsi perfect.

174
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,400
This entire show reminds me a lot of that.

175
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,800
My my favorite scene in any film when Flea calls

176
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,520
and needles calls me to flea as needles calls about some deal

177
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,040
in the terms or we don't even really know what they're talking about.

178
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,240
He's talking about after that, after a scene with Marty Junior about 20 minutes

179
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,400
prior, we're like, so you know, you're out on the deal.

180
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,600
And I don't you don't know what that deal is.

181
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,920
You don't know what the future Marty's deal is.

182
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,760
I mean, it's cool. They don't like we don't need to explain it all in like Star

183
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,160
Wars prequel level detail.

184
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,800
We just need to know, are you in or are you out?

185
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:43,720
And then and then Fujitsu San calls a lot of deals going on, you know, in the 80s.

186
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,040
Yeah. This was the late the future of the 80s.

187
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,400
The future. Yes. Yes.

188
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,040
But I mean, movies in the in the eight in the time the movie was made.

189
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,560
Well, yeah, and it was yeah, it was made in an era with a lot of it.

190
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,840
It's like post Wall Street.

191
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,640
It's a lot of video phones. Yeah.

192
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,320
A lot of people weren't in ties, so they have to add a second tie.

193
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,960
Double tie. Double ties.

194
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,480
So much double ties. So I'm a patient.

195
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,200
But anyway, this

196
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,400
what I am craving always is this this blocky neon future

197
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,480
that is crawling with holograms and robots and bad puns.

198
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,000
And I got it in spades in the Tomorrowland Astrozone.

199
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,880
So so that's why I can't just talk about paying electric beats for it.

200
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,200
I need to explain the Tomorrowland Astrozone a little bit and walk you through it.

201
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:37,040
OK, so as I said, great, clean Tomorrowland, Space Mountain at the end.

202
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,040
Like it's it's you know, if you're in the hub, it is dead set.

203
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,320
You're looking at the castle.

204
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,400
You turn to your right.

205
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,600
Space Mountain right at the end of the right at the end of the line.

206
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,400
It's got the ramp like it used to have in Disneyland, which is great.

207
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,360
Kind of like a cool space mountain in general.

208
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,520
Yeah, it's Disneyland's track layout are very similar.

209
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,880
I think it's the yeah.

210
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,920
Well, more like a queue.

211
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,800
Yeah, but then a little like UFO fide.

212
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,560
Yes. And the logo looks like I think I said on the episode, the the one

213
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,520
the spawn logo, the 90s spawn logo.

214
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,080
Absolutely. It's weird.

215
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,840
I don't know why, but it's from that era, I guess.

216
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,360
It remind it felt to me like a 90s NBA expansion team logo.

217
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,240
Oh, yeah. Hoover Grizzlies.

218
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,480
The Raptors, one of the Raptors logos, maybe when they're trying to get

219
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,360
more aggressive, you've got kind of that classy stately

220
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,280
bulls or Lakers and then you then you want a logo

221
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,000
that's like reaching out and ripping your face skin off.

222
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,440
Oh, yeah, that's a small and all right.

223
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,720
Yeah, I know a spawn when I see one, you got a spawn on your hands, my friend.

224
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,680
So sorry. So that's great.

225
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,920
Then you turn to the right, you start heading to the Astro Zone.

226
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,760
I want to shout out that they have that there I don't know if you saw a show

227
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,120
in this area, but the place where you see shows in Tomorrowland.

228
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,520
Oh, I saw a show. Yeah. It's called Showbase.

229
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,720
Yeah. Wonderful name.

230
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,200
Great Epcotty sign there.

231
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,000
And the only thing that makes it better is that when the park opened,

232
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,920
it was called Showbase 2000.

233
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,600
Oh, wow. And they had to get rid of the 2000 because it became.

234
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,200
No, bring it back.

235
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,360
Did you see a show there?

236
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,600
I didn't see a show there.

237
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
That was the most boring show.

238
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,680
Oh, no. What was it?

239
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,520
I don't remember.

240
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,760
It's just like a mishmash of saw Disney songs and like

241
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,880
there were a couple of people in spacesuits, but it was not like

242
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,200
you dream of like a Tokyo Disney space show.

243
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,640
Nowhere close. Oh, bummer.

244
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,080
A kind of fine, but like very.

245
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,640
I think what was playing there when I was there was called One Man's Dream.

246
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,320
Yes, that's what it was.

247
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,520
We saw One Man's Dream 2. One Man's Dream 2.

248
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,440
Two. Yes. One Man's Dream 2.

249
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,600
Two. I am familiar with One Man's Dream.

250
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,600
Of course, we all are.

251
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,920
It's like unclear sort of like that.

252
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,960
It's about Walt. One Man's Dream has to be Walt.

253
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,240
You'd have to. But One Man's Dream 2 is where Walt goes to the future

254
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,680
and sees his son is a mess.

255
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,920
And there's deals left and right.

256
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,040
Yeah, I hope your kid Walt.

257
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,160
A doc figure takes Walt around.

258
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,360
Wow. Walt, it's me.

259
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,920
I'll buy works.

260
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,520
He punches him.

261
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,240
After you fired me, I started inventing things, including a time machine.

262
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,960
I'm glad you let me off the chain.

263
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,760
I'm trying to find pictures of this show, but to keep talking.

264
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,600
Yeah, I have somewhere.

265
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,400
I just love the architecture of showbiz.

266
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,480
It's still showbiz 2000 in my heart.

267
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,440
But you keep walking and you get to star tours.

268
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,080
You all know big star tours of Vicionado.

269
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,560
And I think this is I think it's the best star tours building

270
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,520
just aesthetically from the outside.

271
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,160
It's very best future to future.

272
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,080
It we're like spiral staircases and a sky bridge extending off of it.

273
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,600
It's a much more elaborate building.

274
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,560
Really cool.

275
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,440
Gives them the room to do a first room that is only there.

276
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,160
This big, tall hangar. Fantastic.

277
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,280
Yes. How cool is that?

278
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,040
There's a star speeder way elevated up on the second floor.

279
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,800
And then like kind of these cool sort of 60s travel log kind of animations

280
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,800
telling you about the different planets, about the Gungan planet,

281
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,240
and then like a scary one for joining the empire.

282
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,760
And then the room that, you know, with C3PO and R2D2.

283
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,080
And then you round the corner.

284
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,480
And as you guys know, very excited about Rex hitchhiking.

285
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,920
He is one of three hitchhiking droids arranged like the hitchhiking ghosts.

286
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,320
I ran to the corner.

287
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,600
I gasped. This was a big deal.

288
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,760
And I've kept thinking about it since, obviously, because it was so nice to see him.

289
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,920
But what I realized is, I think part of what moved me

290
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,400
so about this scene is not just the reference to the dimension,

291
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,720
but the fact that Rex has friends.

292
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,840
It's nice to know that my favorite character in fiction has some buddies.

293
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,840
Am I jealous that I am not among them? Sure.

294
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,880
But, you know, you're not a droid.

295
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,000
No, no, there's there would always be that barrier.

296
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,120
It's like kids need friends their own age.

297
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,600
Right. You need friends who are droids.

298
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,080
I started thinking, who are these guys?

299
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,680
They they have to have a name.

300
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,360
They have to have a backstory at Star Wars.

301
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,400
So there must be something going on.

302
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,600
So I looked up their names. I know their names now.

303
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,120
Their names are F24 and F25.

304
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,720
F25 is also known as the space cap droid because he has a red cap and a bow tie.

305
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,440
He's a very fancy droid.

306
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,440
What are you pulling up? The picture of him.

307
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,640
Oh, OK. I took. Yeah, there you go.

308
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,840
He's dapper.

309
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,880
Uh, nice. He's a sharp looker.

310
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,640
Rex could learn something from learn something from his confidence.

311
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,400
It suggests the like formal dress of the ghosts on Haunted Mansion.

312
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,440
Yes, true.

313
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,480
However, he had those things before.

314
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,120
Now, let me explain.

315
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,600
I thought, oh, really? Oh, I didn't know this.

316
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,880
Yes. And this was all of the new stuff that I found on the way

317
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,480
to the Pink Collective. Wow.

318
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,560
So who are these droids?

319
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,240
They're repurposed droids like Rex using stuff from the old ride.

320
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,040
Were there previous droids that have been cut from the Adventures

321
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:14,640
Continue version? Star Tours Tokyo 1989 was crawling with droids.

322
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,360
I have watched old videos.

323
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,600
There were so many around every corner.

324
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,040
That hangar room had a ton of them.

325
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,440
There's a big set of giant fans.

326
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,440
And these guys who are now Rex's friends were all like bitterly

327
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,960
sitting by fans and checking them to make sure there's no like cracks or whatever.

328
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,480
What the hell? Yeah.

329
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,560
Tons of droids. I don't know what made them take all these out.

330
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,680
Why would you have a shitload of droids and then remove them?

331
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,280
Doesn't make sense to me.

332
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,520
There are so many droids, in fact, that a guide was released.

333
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,320
The guide is cut. You could look this up.

334
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,880
You can find a PDF online.

335
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,640
It is called the complete guide to Star Tours and maybe add Tokyo to that search.

336
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,840
But let me show you guys from afar on my iPad.

337
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:06,200
Here is a giant catalog of who every single droid was in Star Tours 1989.

338
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:13,760
F 22 through F 25, the space cap droid easily spotted by his red cap and bow tie.

339
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,560
S4, Max P6.

340
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,200
There are bird droids like listen to this description.

341
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,960
Diligently looking after their eggs, but will they really hatch?

342
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,600
What are you talking about?

343
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,320
There's bird droids who make edge.

344
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,080
They reproduce. What?

345
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,080
How are there bird?

346
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,280
These droids reproduce their eggs.

347
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,680
The eggs also metal and then

348
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,960
robots inside. Don't understand.

349
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,720
Very bizarre.

350
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,720
You know, I need a diagram to show how robot reproduction works,

351
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,240
but it exists in this world.

352
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,000
There are also mouse droids,

353
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,400
furtive creatures living in droid gnostics.

354
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,200
I know what mouse droids are.

355
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,120
Those existed elsewhere in Star Wars.

356
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,720
Oh, OK. Oh, really?

357
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,960
That's the thing in Star Wars. Yeah. Oh, OK.

358
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,560
Where do they show up?

359
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,080
Trying to think. Kind of zip around, right? On the floor.

360
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,680
Yeah. Isn't that what they are? Let me look up.

361
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,040
Yeah. Yeah. Like what I do if I was a mouse droid.

362
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,520
Yeah. Like these, right?

363
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,800
Oh, no, actually.

364
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,640
Oh, no. Different.

365
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,040
What I am looking at is more like it kind of looks like a snail.

366
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,400
It's pretty small over here, but it's got two little weird eyes extending.

367
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,080
Oh, wow.

368
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,160
So because this is a called a mouse droid and it's like that little thing

369
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,680
that zips around in the first Star Wars, like by the stormtroopers feet.

370
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,320
Oh, gotcha.

371
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,240
Isn't one of those scurry by like in heaven?

372
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,320
We see isn't there somewhere in a Star Wars video or a tease of Rise

373
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,880
of the Resistance? I believe so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

374
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,480
Because there's some troopers walking through that corridor, I think,

375
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,600
and they may have one zip at their feet.

376
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,920
Yeah, they zip at a lot of people's feet.

377
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,840
They zip around.

378
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,000
They add kinetic energy to the world.

379
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,360
Yes.

380
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,640
The films, these Mastroids, their favorite food, nuts, bolts

381
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,280
and other parts all thickly coated with machine oil.

382
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,600
OK, which, you know, a good snack deserves a good dipping sauce,

383
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,320
good, good salsa or something.

384
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,720
Jason can get behind that.

385
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,920
Yes. Love a sauce.

386
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,720
It would be fun if they sold snacks that were like nuts and bolts

387
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,000
and it comes in a sauce that is oil.

388
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,920
I guess that's not super appealing.

389
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
A gray to black snack.

390
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,040
But does this phrase live your Star Wars story?

391
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,160
And if your Star Wars story is being a Mastroid and that's what the hotel

392
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,720
in Florida will allow you to do, eat nuts and bolts.

393
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,720
Are there other rooms that you can live in that are sort of like

394
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,000
utility rooms down in the basement?

395
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Like, essentially, do they offer cages where a robot would sleep?

396
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,440
Yeah, I'm sure they do.

397
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,200
Those are still very expensive, though.

398
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,800
People are going to make a lot of night.

399
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,520
Yeah. People are going to make love in that hotel.

400
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,960
I hope I would hope children will be conceived.

401
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,520
Oh, yeah.

402
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,680
Oh, people will arrange it such that to make sure their children are conceived.

403
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,560
They will like take all of the hormones at that time to make it happen.

404
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,920
So their child will be for sensitive.

405
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,360
They want to make sure you can control gender,

406
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,520
but maybe you can control medical or anything.

407
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,360
I am. I hate to derail.

408
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,480
I know I'm in the middle of I found the pictures from that theater from

409
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,280
from showbiz showbiz, not 2000.

410
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,960
And this is why we were so confused.

411
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,120
It's one man's dream, too.

412
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,680
So it's got to be about wall, right?

413
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:30,440
No, these are the Bob Iger, Bugsland characters or Bugs Life characters.

414
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,000
But what one man had that dream.

415
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,840
Well, there was a character named Hopper,

416
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,960
but his dreams were more what people would call nightmares.

417
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,120
Here's just Peter Pan and the crocodile.

418
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,160
Nothing. I don't think there's almost OK.

419
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,680
Then you get to like then you get to Hollywood, like halfway through.

420
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,920
OK, so they showed us some movies.

421
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:57,800
Then it's like show business and goofy is the director and he screws up.

422
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,360
And that's like it.

423
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,520
So it's all more things.

424
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,120
So is it goofy? He's not a man. He's a dog. He's a dog.

425
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,920
It's very unclear. I think we were just very confused.

426
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,000
And then the next picture, that star speeder in the hangar.

427
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,920
Look at that on Star Tours getting under it.

428
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,560
You can see under the hatch.

429
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,800
There's two star speeders in this line.

430
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,800
Yeah, two Rex's in this line.

431
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,920
It's double the pleasure, double the fun.

432
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,280
These are the Jason. These are the pictures sort of.

433
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,800
Wow, I love that. Really neat.

434
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,560
But here's OK.

435
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,000
Here's where it starts to get disappointing for me, because I do think

436
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,800
they undid some of the cool with adventures continue.

437
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,960
They took all these droids out in the old version.

438
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,520
You would wrap back around to that hangar room.

439
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,040
You would exit that way.

440
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,400
You'd be on the same level as the star speeder right next to it.

441
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,360
And there'd be new droids available to you to see who you couldn't see

442
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,680
from the ground floor.

443
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,680
The place is crawling with droids.

444
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,360
And I was curious why.

445
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,920
And here is why, because the sponsor of Star Tours

446
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,160
when it opened was a company called the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company.

447
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,920
And they were doing a lot of real robotics work.

448
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,000
And they wanted to show it off.

449
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,760
So half of the droids are cartoon fun Disney droids.

450
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,840
The other half are real mechanical arms that work in their factories

451
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,480
that they're showing off.

452
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,840
It's like it is a genuine robotics exhibit, or it was.

453
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,080
I'd never heard of Matsushita,

454
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,120
but that is because they did a brand name rearranging

455
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,880
and they ended up taking one of their smaller brand names

456
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,280
and making that the name of the whole company.

457
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,640
Panasonic.

458
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,800
This is the company that turned into Panasonic.

459
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,040
My goodness. Yes.

460
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,680
Thus, there was a giant Panasonic satellite and I think still is

461
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,320
sort of up at the top of Tomorrowland Astrozone.

462
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,800
Wow. So so basically they took all this stuff out

463
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,880
because they were no longer a sponsor.

464
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,840
Yeah. And maybe the line they didn't need to have the line be that big.

465
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,160
And that obviously costs money to upkeep all of those robots.

466
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,680
Well, it also you know, the trip report, the TDR Explorer that you sent me

467
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,760
seem to imply that Star Tours not super popular there.

468
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,040
I guess I saw it on a Saturday and had a big line.

469
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,520
But the night that I got there, there was no wait.

470
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,120
Yeah. Six star speeders that you can get on as opposed to four.

471
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,640
So the lines move probably a lot quicker.

472
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,960
It's such an eat so much a better loading. Yeah. Area.

473
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,480
Yeah. They're on both sides.

474
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,360
Both sides. That room, that loading room also very cool.

475
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,600
Fantastic. Yeah. Yeah.

476
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,960
Like the extra rooms that they added.

477
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,320
They took advantage of the extra that they were building a space from scratch

478
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,240
instead of jamming it jamming it into the adventures through inner space area.

479
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,520
It's a fantastic terminal in general.

480
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,480
Disneyland Q is such a pain in the ass

481
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,000
because oftentimes it'll be like, yeah, you're in row four,

482
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,320
but you cannot stand in row four. You have to like.

483
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,080
You're right. That does anyway.

484
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,880
I am into like row six.

485
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,160
Yeah. And like you're on the and then you get confused because people come in

486
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,040
and they think you're in row five or six.

487
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,560
But you're not. You're in four.

488
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,440
And there's just not enough space.

489
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,240
And then you're all stressed out instead of letting those beautiful chimes

490
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,640
wash over you. Yeah. Soothe you.

491
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,680
No, it's so much of I think they it's still very cool,

492
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,520
but they dismantled some of what made Starters 89 really cool,

493
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,360
which I have a couple more things.

494
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,200
Yes, that boarding room. Very, very neat.

495
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,480
Right. Here's where here's where you're going to freak out.

496
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,080
So you finish the ride, you're getting off the ride

497
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,120
and you start going back into the hangar.

498
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,240
And they much like today, there is the Patrick Warburton character,

499
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,280
you know, Scanning Yin.

500
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,280
There was a lot more of that stuff on the way out.

501
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,320
Officer Zizek's who we'll talk about in a minute. Rest in peace.

502
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,240
Yes. Which that I don't know why they I'll get to it.

503
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,840
First things first.

504
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,800
So there's all this airport stuff that they used to have.

505
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,920
The the real robotic arms made by this company are deployed

506
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,920
in the quarantine department.

507
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,560
They are checking luggage for insects and such for intergalactic insects.

508
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,960
And there's like multiple are two's.

509
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,200
There's so much going like I found a YouTube user

510
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,320
who posted snippets of Starters videos.

511
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,760
He's got like 50 of them.

512
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,240
And they were all in radically different rooms.

513
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,200
I don't even know how they all fit together

514
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,760
as we're heading for Rise of the Resistance and all this stuff.

515
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,640
I'm like, they kind of did it already.

516
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,760
There was a Star Wars experience with many weird corridors

517
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,840
and nooks that you could explore forever. Right.

518
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,680
And a hundred different animatronics. Yes. Yeah.

519
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,080
They did. It existed before. Wow.

520
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,680
To give Tokyo credit.

521
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,200
And here's my favorite one.

522
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,680
And here's why I needed a lot of time to this to start towards

523
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,120
you end up walking up to a thing called Tour Scan.

524
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,560
What the hell does that mean?

525
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,640
Tour Scan, I guess, is a kind of a travel agency booth

526
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,440
that's telling you about other places that you might want to visit

527
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,680
despite your trip to end or going so badly.

528
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,480
You're told about like planets that only exist within this thing,

529
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,680
but that are acknowledged on wookie pedia, the official start.

530
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,960
So they are canon.

531
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,400
There's a planet called Barnet, which is a desert planet

532
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,280
that advertises a zero gravity golf course, whatever that means.

533
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,520
I hope something has gravity, because if I hope it's the ball

534
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,080
that goes wherever you want it to go and not you, you don't like tumble around

535
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,960
because you'd have a lot of trouble.

536
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,360
Hmm. Hey, anything that'll help my short game, right, folks?

537
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,840
Harrison Ford delivery.

538
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,600
Anything that will help my short.

539
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,440
I was a Blade Runner two.

540
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,400
If Harrison Ford somehow was angrily listening to every episode of podcast

541
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,400
the ride, that would have been the first thing that made him laugh.

542
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,880
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

543
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,800
I'll get more biplane material in there, Mr. Ford.

544
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,160
Finally something.

545
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,240
I start looking up tire jokes.

546
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,240
We can tell. He loves wine.

547
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,400
Haven't you seen all the pictures of him and Calista

548
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,560
showing up at Halloween parties with big with bottles of wine

549
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,120
and their fun costumes? And he loves edibles.

550
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,760
Yeah, yeah, we have a lot in common.

551
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,800
He would love us.

552
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,960
I think we'd pretty much be best friends right off the bat with Harrison Ford.

553
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,880
So much stuff in common.

554
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,320
We have an extra end game ticket.

555
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,360
Oh, no, Harrison, it's so far in the future.

556
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,440
We had an extra end game ticket and I got a vape pen on me.

557
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,120
So we were seeing it in Sun Valley or wherever he lives.

558
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,040
Yeah, I'd rather kill myself.

559
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,360
Hang out with losers in that shitty movie.

560
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,720
OK, but here's the thing.

561
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,960
Well, wait, first of all, all of the footage of these planets

562
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,720
is all recycled footage from Horizons, like when they show you a desert planet.

563
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,160
And so it's Star Wars canon, even though it's recycled Horizons footage.

564
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:32,120
But up in another window is a droid on video

565
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,840
who's a slick pitch man droid who is telling you

566
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,240
about all of these places that you can visit.

567
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,960
And if you have a slick pitch man droid, you know what?

568
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,520
You got to call him. And this is actually what he is called.

569
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,520
Dan Android.

570
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
Wait, what? Like Dan Aykroyd.

571
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,760
There is a droid like like a reference to Dan Aykroyd,

572
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,280
like the Basomatic character.

573
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,520
Yeah, essentially, yes.

574
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,760
He doesn't really sound much like him, but yeah, he is a booklet.

575
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,640
Dan Android PR droid for Star Tours,

576
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,080
seen on tour scan, maybe distantly related to movie star Dan Aykroyd.

577
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,280
I think you're going to say like PT, Barn, Droid or something like.

578
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,640
I like how now it's getting close to like Flintstones territory

579
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,760
where you just had rock or something to. Yeah.

580
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,720
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Name. Yeah.

581
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,720
John Belouchebot.

582
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,680
The Blues bot.

583
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:31,680
So so tragic about what happened to Belouchebot at the Chateau Marmont

584
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,600
in 2000.

585
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,480
At the Chateau Digimont.

586
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,200
Yeah.

587
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,240
Yeah, yeah, you got a robot.

588
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,440
So as the show at the Chateau 101, one, one, one.

589
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,800
There we go. Yeah.

590
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,240
Yeah. OK, great.

591
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,000
Does deserve and there's video of the robot talking.

592
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,320
Is it speaking Japanese?

593
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,680
It's Japanese. So it's not super.

594
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,000
But is he talking like this?

595
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,320
Like is it there's a he is he is not.

596
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,760
And if you look at him, he kind of looks like the doodle of Mr.

597
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,920
Sparkle. He's kind of just like a light bulb head with teeth.

598
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,280
Yeah. So I don't know why he's related to Dan Aykroyd,

599
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,720
but I like that they in this official document, they list that.

600
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,920
So that's own.

601
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:21,680
I like the idea, too, because we all have all have a chance to make a Star Wars

602
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,600
movie probably by the end of our lifetime.

603
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,200
So maybe. But I'm getting anxious.

604
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,080
I know I'll get there by the time I'm 52, but I want to do it now.

605
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,280
But but you can use Dan Android is one of my point.

606
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,640
Yes. Cannon. I'm saying this is cannon.

607
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,240
Yes. And as far as I know, not excised.

608
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,960
I think all of this stuff is safe because they forgot about it.

609
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,040
Yeah. So it was not part of that official excise from Cannon list.

610
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,520
It was like hiding when when

611
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,000
when all the executions took place.

612
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,480
And then now that the dust is clear, Dan Android can run free.

613
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,600
So I won't be well.

614
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,080
Let's all bring you guys in on it.

615
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,640
I need you with the for the Chicago sensibility. Of course. Yeah.

616
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,840
I might got his harmonica already in his little harmonica.

617
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,400
Yeah. Oh, I love the Blues Brothers as a little boy.

618
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,680
Yeah. I wanted to be a little blues boy.

619
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,280
Could you give me a ride out of here afterwards in your police car

620
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,800
with a giant megaphone? Yeah, sure. Of course.

621
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:26,480
Is there any way you could talk jazz festival tonight about how, you know,

622
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,960
you're in comedy, but your real influences were like muddy waters and

623
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,920
mm hmm. How will how will.

624
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,760
I mean, this is a different thing, but I always like to say I was

625
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,240
kind of trying to be like the clash, but for comedy.

626
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,840
Sure. I never know what it means when you see that.

627
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,680
Someone write a paper and tell me what you're talking about.

628
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,440
Or is it just a cool thing to say? I think it's just a cool thing.

629
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,040
I think I correct it. Maybe it's a cool thing to say.

630
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,080
It's a cool thing to say.

631
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,600
And they're the ones who've held up the best.

632
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,640
Like you can get Sex Pistols logos on a crevice and now

633
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,880
well, once you post the Sex Pistols ride at Hard Rock Park, they just.

634
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,720
Sure. Yeah.

635
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,640
The God saved the Queen shooting tragic ending. Yeah.

636
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,920
They've they got it wrong. They took it literally.

637
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,520
They actually had you go save the Queen, which is kind of like they

638
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,560
they kind of missed the circuit. Yeah.

639
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,320
I was going to say, is it a shooting up adventure?

640
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,760
It's somebody overdose.

641
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,240
Oh, that's a fun idea for a shooting, right?

642
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,120
Yes. Where you have a you're looking at a big arm and you have to find

643
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,200
the veins that you can get a needle into. Yeah. Yeah.

644
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,680
That's maybe an aspect of the new Spider-Man ride,

645
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:45,240
because you got to inject yourself with that spider, like radioactive spider goo.

646
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,400
So maybe that'll be part of it.

647
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,040
At the beginning of the ride, you got like a souvenir, like a like

648
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,880
the tight bandaid or the tight like rubber band.

649
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,520
Yeah. Like zip your arm off with for sure.

650
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,240
We'll talk to Binkowski to about it.

651
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,040
I think that, well, the secret clearly is to bring back Hard Rock Park, but way darker.

652
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,520
Yeah. That's what it's got to be.

653
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,200
It's got to be warts and all. Mm hmm.

654
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,680
OK, so we have gotten we've gotten out.

655
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,520
We've gotten away from quarantine.

656
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,880
We've met Dan Android and you get onto the sky bridge, which is beautiful.

657
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,640
Yeah. Sky bridges. That's that's a great addition.

658
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,960
I'm going to say that I I'm always seeking out that kind of 80s future architecture.

659
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,040
There's great sky bridges in Toronto and Atlanta,

660
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,880
but this is one of my favorite sky bridges.

661
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,920
It doesn't have to be this one.

662
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:34,040
But when I die, scatter my ashes in a sky bridge, making that declaration.

663
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,920
OK, if you can pass it on, anyone listening, just remember that I said this.

664
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,800
They the ashes will probably be vacuumed up instantly, but at least all

665
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,600
I'll know they were there for a second.

666
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,440
So you get to the end of the sky bridge or at least you used to.

667
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,440
And you meet Officer Zizek's.

668
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,280
Oh, we talked about Officer Zizek's before,

669
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,720
because Officer Zizek's is the cousin of

670
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,640
Sonny Eclipse, our beloved lounge singer robot from Tomorrowland Disney World.

671
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,160
I say cousin.

672
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,600
What I mean is they reuse the same mold, but that's great.

673
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,600
It's a great mold.

674
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,400
And he is a lot of fun.

675
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,640
He's also not very well documented, unfortunately.

676
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,440
Not a lot. Yeah. No, no.

677
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,080
It's a bummer.

678
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,880
I think people are not agreed on how many Z's or Y's or X's is in Officer Zizek's.

679
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,600
So that hurts.

680
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,440
I was Googling him and I think it's like four Z's.

681
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,520
Ziz, it's Y and then like four X's.

682
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,120
I don't know. I have it. I have it as less.

683
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,720
There's no agreed upon.

684
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,800
How are we ever to find videos unless?

685
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,400
Well, I think there's this we should get there's a guy, Steve Kirk.

686
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,040
Did that name pop up? Yep.

687
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,640
OK, are you getting to him?

688
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,560
Yes, which I can.

689
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,120
Well, I can.

690
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,280
I could certainly talk about him right now because he leads directly into.

691
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,160
OK.

692
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,720
Pete's board.

693
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,560
Yeah, Steve Kirk, a designer,

694
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,840
that's Zizek's he's got a he's got a Star Tours mug.

695
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,080
And I only have one example of the kind of dialogue that he says

696
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,600
because he's the customs guy.

697
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,880
He says, do you have any fresh fruit to claim?

698
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,680
Too bad, I'm getting hungry.

699
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,240
So that's the very wholesome.

700
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,120
Yeah, it's for everybody.

701
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,680
I know I like it.

702
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,880
So here's why any of this came to pass.

703
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,520
This guy, Steve Kirk,

704
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,480
just had two little like clay sculpture, maquettes, whatever you want to call it,

705
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:32,160
of aliens that he just did is kind of a blue sky thing

706
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,760
for no particular reason.

707
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,000
And, you know, I don't know, maybe they could find a place in the parks somewhere.

708
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,520
There is another imagineer named Kevin Rafferty,

709
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:49,640
who saw the two characters, really sparked to them and said, these are great.

710
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,240
We have to find a place for these.

711
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,560
You know, what I know is that Star Tours is going into Tokyo

712
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,560
and they want to put in some kind of new restaurant experience

713
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,000
and they maybe want it to be like bigger and better somehow.

714
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,280
Maybe we can like work up some ideas around these characters.

715
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,600
So that is where Pangolite to Beats of Port came to pass, because the first

716
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:17,280
alien that he did was Officer Zizek and the other was Tony Solaroni,

717
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:23,600
who they spun out this entire story of, well, what is the story?

718
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,440
He is a not a pizza maker so much.

719
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,640
He might even just be the man sort of responsible for the upkeep

720
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,000
of the PZ 5000 pizza machine,

721
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,800
which is a big crazy Rube Goldberg contraption that makes pizzas

722
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,720
that are then sent down to a staff of human

723
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,160
workers who are on their only job is to put pizzas in the oven.

724
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,720
So they don't make the piece.

725
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,280
Somehow we need six people on staff just for oven in and out.

726
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:00,320
And he, Tony Solaroni, also deals with a lot of stress

727
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,680
from the machine breaking down, from the many, many orders

728
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,880
that he gets from all over outer space and from his boss and wife

729
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,160
calling him and nagging him and giving him a more difficult day.

730
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,400
I'm really selling it.

731
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,120
I think this is clearly the most exciting tale in all of theme park.

732
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,920
But the whole thing was so like work.

733
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,480
We're giving the story to this restaurant, which is cool to me.

734
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,440
But they thought there needs to be a character who's like a transition point

735
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,800
between the realistic aliens of the Star Wars world

736
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,560
and the cartoony aliens of the Tony Solaroni world.

737
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,960
Officer Zizek is that transition point.

738
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,480
Later, he is reused as Sunny Eclipse.

739
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,520
Steve Kirk, I want to give a big shout out to just not only for those things,

740
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,560
but do wait, wait, wait. Where are you going with Disney?

741
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:57,240
He became the designer of Disney from these humble beginnings from designing.

742
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,880
He's an imaginary all star if just for having designed Zizek's

743
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,120
therefore, Sunny Eclipse and Tony Solaroni went on to help write Cranium Command,

744
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,480
one of the primary writers of Cranium Command, helped design Dream Finder

745
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,640
Figment and the Abominable Snowman.

746
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,640
And then ultimately Disney Sea.

747
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,480
Kevin Rafferty, who said these are great.

748
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,600
We got to figure out something around these guys.

749
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,920
Went on to help write Tough to be a Bug, Midway Mania.

750
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,360
He came up with the story and name of the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror.

751
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:31,640
He named it and ultimately became the creative director of Radiator Springs.

752
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,880
Racers. These are imaginary all stars.

753
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,120
Two of the best. I was not aware of either of these names.

754
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:42,440
So God bless Pangle X, a pizza port for making me aware.

755
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,680
So anyway, did you see you didn't watch any of that?

756
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,280
You were just in there for a second.

757
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,600
Yeah, we live know I've watched it now since on YouTube, but I have not.

758
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,120
I did not really spend time.

759
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:59,440
It should be said, unlike Sunny Eclipse, Tony Solaroni is like above you.

760
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,680
Like you're above the ordering, but he's not on a stage

761
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,160
where the seating is arranged purposely for you to look at him.

762
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,560
Yeah, it's a really unusual setup where on the ground floor

763
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:17,600
is a quick service pizza restaurant that by from what I could tell is not good.

764
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,480
I don't think it is good pizza.

765
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,600
Yeah, I did not get the pizza there.

766
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,680
None of this is about if you were hoping for any info about this pizza restaurant.

767
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,120
I have none for you, though.

768
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,960
It is one of the places where you can get the green alien mochi, which are pretty cool.

769
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,760
Yeah.

770
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,040
But just regular restaurant down on the bottom.

771
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,400
And then the second floor is taken over by this massive Rube Goldberg machine.

772
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,000
And you have to go up to the second floor to watch this bizarre show.

773
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,560
It's one of the strangest arrangements where you're like watching it

774
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,360
from like a bridge, essentially.

775
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,720
There's like not like there's not really good eye lines.

776
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,360
It's really difficult to get a good seat to watch Tony Solaroni.

777
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,800
I think I was confused by it.

778
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,120
I think we were walking like walking through and like, oh, that's cool or whatever.

779
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,800
And I didn't realize it was part of the restaurant or something.

780
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,880
I think that's we were on the way to something else.

781
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,680
Points because it's very confused, very confused and hard to see.

782
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,280
It got a dog at the menu.

783
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,760
I was like, OK, pizza slices, pretty standard calzones.

784
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,960
The flavors of calzone were chicken and tomato.

785
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,400
Not an orable calzone flavor and seafood cream.

786
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,480
Again, not a seafood cream like that, like squid ink.

787
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,280
What are we talking?

788
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,640
I think like

789
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,320
like a cream sauce or like a chowdery kind of cream like in a.

790
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,320
So it's like a calzone.

791
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,000
Yes. So it's kind of like a soup calzone.

792
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,320
And yeah.

793
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,120
And then I think the pizzas were just like sausage and mushroom.

794
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,200
One thing about the Panglectic pizza port, there are no vegetarian options,

795
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,720
not even salad cups, like not no, not a salad.

796
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,240
Nothing. I mean, how do you make a pizza vegetarian?

797
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:01,800
It's kind of hard to even figure out how to possibly remove me from the equation.

798
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,400
Nowhere to even begin.

799
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,960
There's no way it can't be done anyway.

800
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,880
I'm not here to talk about the food. I'm here to talk about the robots.

801
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,000
I mean, what's great?

802
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,600
I mean, like I said, that clunky version of what the story is.

803
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,480
But really, what's great about this is that this is a Disney restaurant

804
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,400
in which a bunch of animatronics and puppets and weirdos on camera

805
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,640
make your food, which seems to me like

806
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,560
the premise that pizza riso is supposed to have.

807
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,200
Yes. And what it I mean, this premise was pitched back in the 90s

808
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,560
that like there's animatronic rats who you see essentially making your pizza

809
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,720
or perhaps even delivering you your pizza.

810
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,560
Here, this dream is realized via the PZ 5000,

811
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,920
which is a wonderful, very detailed Rube Goldberg machine where there's like,

812
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,760
you know, gloves pulling on stuff and pizza doughs flipping around

813
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,840
and like big foamy pieces of cheese and ingredients

814
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,520
that remind me so much of like a double dare obstacle course.

815
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,960
Oh, yeah, that's true.

816
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,400
Weird foam food is such a 90s throwback.

817
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,960
It's like the final course on double there with multiple like types of things.

818
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,680
And yeah, yeah, aesthetically, it reminded me a lot.

819
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,000
And it's sort of like some 50s kookiness to it, too.

820
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,680
It reminded me a lot of any of those weird levels with like the

821
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,200
the side of the guy's head where you go into the ear, that kind of thing.

822
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,280
So that's what I think like what gives me all the feels, as the kids would say

823
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,440
about this thing. You're getting that you're getting those vibes.

824
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,640
There's like, you know, it's it feels like this Muppet restaurant that never was.

825
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,200
I get the double dare vibes.

826
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,880
It's obviously very Chuck E.

827
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,720
Cheese because it's a lot of pre-recorded material and songs about pizza.

828
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,120
I'll take that anywhere I can get it.

829
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,480
It's very sunny eclipse.

830
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,560
It's animatronics that are similar to something.

831
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,680
It's very cranium command.

832
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:56,560
It is a little cute guy on like an elevated chair that moves around,

833
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,400
who is under a lot of stress and who is trying his best

834
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:04,080
and who is dealing with a lot of animated characters and live action characters

835
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,640
who are not like the same type of species as him. Yeah.

836
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,480
And also all the animation is fantastic.

837
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,040
It's very like on this ton of custom animation made only for this pizza

838
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,200
restaurant, and it's very on Disney.

839
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,760
It's like kind of kooky and more like Nicktoon or

840
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,400
Claskey Chupo or that kind of thing.

841
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,480
It is like, first of all, yeah, like you imagine, like just even

842
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,560
Sunny Eclipse with just this level of stuff.

843
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,520
Sunny Eclipse is bare bones.

844
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,560
Yeah, compared to this, you don't even see his backup singers.

845
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,120
You don't see his backup singers.

846
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:42,240
They had to use like they made up like the space angels to just get out of the fact

847
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,800
that they're like, we don't have money for more.

848
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,040
You're not going to be able to build three backup singers or even just a video.

849
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,080
Yeah. Two video screens with space angels.

850
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,240
Because as we all know about Chuck E.

851
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,680
Cheese, one of the great thrills is watching Chuck E.

852
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,240
Cheese robots in front of you.

853
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,120
And then there is a screen that is showing a totally different

854
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,160
version and media of Chuck E.

855
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,120
Cheese, perhaps multiples.

856
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,040
There's a robot.

857
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,760
There's a man in this in a suit walking around in the restaurant,

858
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,480
a man in a suit of a different style in the video, a puppet in the video.

859
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,120
It is such a mess.

860
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,840
But I love the man. Yeah, which I feel like kids are like, yes, give it to me.

861
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,960
Bum barred me with Chuck E.

862
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,040
Cheese. And then the adults who make it like at least Disney imagineers are like,

863
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,120
well, Mickey couldn't be on this side of the park and that side of the park

864
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,920
simultaneously in reality.

865
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,440
And it's like, I don't know.

866
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,520
Kids don't care.

867
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,960
Just if you bombard them enough, they don't think that hard about it.

868
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,960
Absolutely. That's how I feel about the removal of Officer Zizek's.

869
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,520
This is a point that I missed.

870
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,880
He, I guess, was removed because he's too goofy or something

871
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,400
to be part of the new serious star tours.

872
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,160
Adventures continue. What the fuck? Why?

873
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,120
He's a big, weird rotund.

874
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,120
He's more Star Wars than anything.

875
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,880
He's like a crazy Cantina band.

876
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,400
Well, that's on brand for the current Star Wars.

877
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,160
Lucas felt this way. No, nothing funny.

878
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,040
Go get those two funny guys out there.

879
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,880
Send them off to do their little Spider-Man movie and win an Oscar or something.

880
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,000
Cast the funny guys away.

881
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,440
I bring an opi.

882
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,760
I yeah, it's well, that's what's frustrating about all that.

883
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,640
Why take these things away?

884
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,920
And I think only Pangalaxi pizza port was saved because it's not technically

885
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,480
it's part of Star Tours far away. Yeah.

886
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,000
Really? That's the issue.

887
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,720
Thank God. Plus, he's got a franchise agreement for like probably 50 years

888
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,440
or some insane there.

889
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,240
There's deep sea.

890
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,240
I'm looking I'm looking at the video currently.

891
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,440
Uh huh. And let me say this, by the way,

892
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,720
you'll hear me ranting and raving about this.

893
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,040
Then you'll watch the video and you'll.

894
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,280
And you'll be like, I have to know what Scott was talking about and so excited

895
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,720
about. You'll watch it and not get it like Disney see itself.

896
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,360
You have to be there.

897
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,360
You won't understand until you are experiencing the grandeur

898
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,560
or you'll go and you'll and you'll go, what the fuck was it?

899
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,520
Scott out of his mind.

900
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,080
But maybe I am.

901
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,800
But in the best way, what were you or you?

902
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,600
I was going to say there's the there's like the stretching of the dough.

903
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,840
Uh huh. And there's the I don't know what you would even call it.

904
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,840
What's like a soft?

905
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,520
It's the connector. It's a tube, essentially.

906
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,920
It's not a pipe, but like a like that soft

907
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,720
like a vacuum tube, essentially. Sure, sure. Yes.

908
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,680
Yes. Yes. A pneumatic tube.

909
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,400
No, no. Pneumatic tubes is solid.

910
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,000
Yeah. Doesn't have vacuum abilities.

911
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,200
It wiggling is so satisfying.

912
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,200
Yeah. It like wiggles around like there's dough going down from one.

913
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,640
Oh, it's like an HVAC hose.

914
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,640
Oh, absolutely. It's like a flexible.

915
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,560
Yeah. All these doodads, all these gizmos.

916
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,440
It's such a cool machine to look at.

917
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,840
You can't believe it got built.

918
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,840
It looks like a crazy drawing come to life.

919
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,200
It's like the gag factory in Toontown.

920
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,920
But, you know, only for people that are better mediocre pizza restaurant.

921
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,480
Now, what you're talking about is the machine, the PZ 5000.

922
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,920
And one of the stretches of the show,

923
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:09,240
Tony Solaroni very helpfully breaks down the individual parts of the PZ 5000.

924
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,960
It helps to understand the process.

925
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,600
Well, first, the flour is mixed at the glib globulator naturally.

926
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,560
Next, the dough is tossed into shape at the flip flop you later.

927
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,640
Don't confuse those two.

928
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,560
It's similar names, but you got to get the order right.

929
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,800
Next, it moves along to the tomato salsa Nova,

930
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,800
which is a pun on the music type.

931
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,200
We've broken rank of how we're naming these things.

932
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,800
And then the cheese is applied under the cheese ematic,

933
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,040
which is not clever anymore.

934
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,960
I would challenge them to keep going and stay as good with those names

935
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,840
as global ovulator and flip floppilators.

936
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,400
But what's done is done.

937
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,480
So that's one of the segments.

938
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,880
You also get to see Tony dispatching deliveries

939
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,320
to customers all around the galaxy.

940
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,880
You meet one of his somebody he calls his favorite customer.

941
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,560
His name is Thermo.

942
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,960
He is a monster who calls who's a lot like the 70s,

943
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,440
like the SNL Muppets.

944
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,960
He reminds me of those guys a lot.

945
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,440
The SNL Muppets. Yeah.

946
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,440
They were like unnamed or they were named.

947
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,640
No, they had names. They were like, remember them.

948
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,880
Yeah, they were like like Craig and Stompfoot.

949
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,920
I don't know what they were.

950
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,120
But anyway, he orders 200 pizzas, but he is upset

951
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,280
because he can't get live toppings.

952
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,120
That's fun.

953
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,960
When you first actually, the first thing technically in the loop

954
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,240
is him introducing himself.

955
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,080
And it's one of those like,

956
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,920
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

957
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,000
My name is Tony Solaroni, which is that's how he sings.

958
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,640
But when he speaks, he just sounds like a regular Japanese man.

959
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,560
But he sings in it in English, but in an Italian accent.

960
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,480
So there's a lot of good like.

961
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,960
And there's pizza chefs in the background during that point.

962
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,440
And yeah, there's the live action pizza chefs who work.

963
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,840
But again, not chefs.

964
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,200
All they do is take pizza and put them in and out of the ovens.

965
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,200
So don't give them the credit of calling them chefs.

966
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,280
They're reheaters.

967
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,280
Yes. Yeah, yeah.

968
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,800
They're like in the medical chair.

969
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,480
They're like they they aren't even nurses.

970
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,840
They're like glorified.

971
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,120
I think there's a term for that.

972
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:13,760
Like a sommelier for pizza, like pizza maker seems too simple.

973
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,480
Is it like like Pete's Pete's plopulator or something?

974
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,280
Oh, probably. Yeah, that sounds right.

975
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:21,960
Yeah.

976
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,320
So all these things are great.

977
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,280
It also reminds me a lot of Sesame Street in its mixed media.

978
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,320
That, you know, that it's that it's puppets and animation, all this stuff

979
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:35,120
combining the and the animated segments are notable because I don't know

980
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,320
if you caught this, probably the audio is terrible and what you were looking at.

981
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:43,760
But the animated segments have a very familiar voice, a very familiar voice.

982
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:49,760
The voice of Thorol Ravenscroft, really one of the best voiceover actors

983
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,480
in Disney theme park history in what has to be one of his final

984
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,960
theme park performances, where they die.

985
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,840
Nineties. Yeah.

986
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,280
Don't remember exactly.

987
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,040
But he's Tony the Tiger. Right.

988
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,120
So you're watching animated commercials for Pangolag to Pizza Boy,

989
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,240
where he's saying like, we're out of this world.

990
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,360
And it's so delightful to hear because sometimes he's scary,

991
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,320
but there's also friendly Thorol.

992
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,680
2005. Really? Yeah.

993
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,920
Till then, he made 2005. Was he still going?

994
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,880
Let me see. He was born in 1914,

995
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,280
which means he was very he was 91.

996
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,960
Jesus. And he was active until 98.

997
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,640
Wow. So do you want to watch?

998
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,680
Does it say a last credit or anything?

999
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,240
Look it up. But probably I mean, he was probably doing Tony still right.

1000
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,800
Oh, you'd have to think.

1001
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,400
Yeah. His last credit is the Brave Little Toaster goes to Mars.

1002
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,680
He did the second Brave Little Toaster, really.

1003
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,400
And then the Brave Little Toaster to the rescue in 97.

1004
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,240
Huh? Wow.

1005
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,120
So he was still what was he was like a vacuum cleaner or something?

1006
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,680
He was Kirby, which I forget who that was.

1007
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,840
What does Kirby sound like?

1008
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,200
Is an ably. Kirby.

1009
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:05,280
There was Kirby, a deep voiced, individualistic, upright Kirby vacuum cleaner.

1010
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,240
Vacuum cleaner. I got it right.

1011
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,040
Yeah, I know my Thorol.

1012
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,280
And then I was I was thinking about Thorol Ravenscroft

1013
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,120
because it was so delightful to hear it like, oh, a new Thorol Ravenscroft

1014
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,080
performance in the parks to me. Yeah.

1015
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,560
I was trying to remind myself what are all the things that he is.

1016
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,920
He's buff the buffalo in the country bears.

1017
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:27,000
He's one of the singing busts in the creepy creeps with.

1018
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:32,800
And then I realized via Wikipedia, how did I not put this together before?

1019
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,920
You know what he is in the parks?

1020
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,240
You know, his first performance in the parks? No.

1021
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:43,400
Open the Fantasyland Castle for the children of the world.

1022
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,840
That is him. Opening Day Disneyland Thorol Ravenscroft.

1023
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,400
Wow. Yes. I mean, it's also that I've been so obsessed with.

1024
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,440
And I like I love doing that guy's voice.

1025
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,120
And there he goes.

1026
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,760
It makes too much sense.

1027
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:01,080
Yes. That that we should have known that Thorol wherever you are.

1028
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:05,120
I'm sorry I did not give you the proper respect on that voice.

1029
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,120
Anyway, so that's all exciting.

1030
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:14,800
Let me now move to the third act of the Tony Solaroni story,

1031
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,960
because I was like, do we leave? Maybe we get out of here.

1032
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,600
Wait, I think there's still something coming.

1033
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,040
There's something like with his boss or something or other.

1034
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,640
And the third at the climax of this, I can only equate to,

1035
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,040
you know, the big stretch of the film Magnolia,

1036
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,600
where all of the characters are having breakdowns all at once.

1037
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,040
It is, you know, it's it's it's so unflinching, you know,

1038
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,320
or sort of like the end of Mother.

1039
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,960
It's you're watching a living nightmare occur

1040
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,920
to a character you've become very fond of.

1041
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,480
So here's what happens.

1042
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,560
Tony Tony Solaroni's,

1043
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,800
he's operating the PZ 5000, the PZ 5000 breaks down.

1044
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,800
There's a there's a stoppage somewhere.

1045
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,080
And at this, the worst possible moment, his boss calls.

1046
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,240
His boss is the mean old Mr.

1047
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,880
Fusano, who's chomping on a cigar.

1048
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,400
And his dialogue, I have to perform for you because I'll do it in English,

1049
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,440
not Japanese. He speaks the Japanese, but I love it so much.

1050
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:22,120
Tony, so far you have failed at pizza franchises in ten different star systems.

1051
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:27,440
Do a good job on Earth or it's back to the Fornax Galaxy Spice Mines for you.

1052
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,160
This makes Tony tremble with fear.

1053
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,440
And why would it not?

1054
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,440
And there is so much mythology just in that to pick apart.

1055
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:40,840
The Fornax Galaxy Spice Mines in this world, I guess.

1056
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,440
Like pizza spices are so rare

1057
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:49,080
that like what we take for granted on Earth, that there's just rosemary

1058
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:54,560
lying around, right for them in space for them to blood diamonds.

1059
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,040
Get a blood diamond.

1060
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,520
That's something so dangerous.

1061
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,600
Yeah, yes.

1062
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:02,680
Probably I think a number of people die, a number of creatures die every year

1063
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,800
and Mr. Fusano's hands.

1064
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,040
The degree to I mean, as scared as Tony is, lets you know that this is the real deal.

1065
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,720
I'm worried he's maybe been in the spice mines before

1066
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,600
and he escaped it to get to the coveted job of operating the PZ 5000.

1067
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,120
Right. But he's he's been bad in a few planets.

1068
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,360
Yes. Ten planets. Ten star systems.

1069
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,320
So really, that's a good point.

1070
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:26,120
I think that he's I think, oh, excuse me, Mr.

1071
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,080
What's his name? Fusano.

1072
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,000
Mr. Fusano.

1073
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,040
I think that he's actually maybe more of a pushover than he seems.

1074
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:38,040
Ten chances is so many chances to be a franchise owner.

1075
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,120
Is that I guess what he said?

1076
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:42,400
If you failed at the franchises and does that mean he was pulled

1077
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,920
just front and the franchises kept going or did the did the franchises

1078
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,760
shut down altogether?

1079
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,280
He's just like ten different businesses.

1080
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,480
Business output is Mr. Fusano like the Ray Kroc.

1081
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,240
Is he the founder?

1082
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:01,040
And he's doing like franchise compliance like, you know, I think that's right.

1083
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,040
Is there a moment where Mr.

1084
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,360
Fusano cracks a little and they're showing him like, look,

1085
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,360
this is how you make an instant milkshake.

1086
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,960
You don't need that ice cream anymore.

1087
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,960
That was the well, that was the moment where he realized

1088
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,480
he didn't have to import the spice from Earth,

1089
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,680
that he could create a spice mine and like get people get like

1090
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,760
probably like undocumented.

1091
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:27,040
Maybe look, what if it's a whole dark thing where like that officer Zizek's is in on

1092
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,480
where like there's there's some chicanery going on at customs.

1093
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,200
He's like sliding these people through and just forcing them into the

1094
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,960
forcing them into the mines.

1095
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,960
That's very possible.

1096
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:42,160
I mean, I think that there needs to be maybe we have to do it

1097
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:47,520
a whole investigation into Mr. Fusano and Mr. Fusano's business practices.

1098
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,720
I don't know. It could go either way.

1099
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,880
As you said, you let somebody fail ten times.

1100
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,880
Maybe he's a nice guy.

1101
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,920
However, he's smoking a cigar, which implies that he's not a nice guy.

1102
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,000
I think we should have Steve Kirk on and just ask him about this.

1103
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,040
I wouldn't love that.

1104
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,400
I think no Cars Land, no Disney Sea.

1105
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,520
Just asking questions about this universe of Mr. Fusano.

1106
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,680
Is he still a Disney employee?

1107
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,600
Is he still on staff? I think so.

1108
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,680
OK, or like already still in the business.

1109
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:19,040
Yeah, he's been interviewed on other podcasts, but not exclusively about

1110
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,320
maybe we even shoot past Tony Solaroni.

1111
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,720
Maybe it's straight to Mr. Swing by Glendale.

1112
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,800
Like, could you tell Mr. Kirk his five o'clock is here

1113
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,880
to see if that works?

1114
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,320
No, I didn't think I had a five o'clock.

1115
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,320
Oh, maybe I forgot.

1116
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,200
I'll go down and meet them.

1117
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,800
It is scheduled to run from five to 11 p.m.

1118
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,880
These gentlemen have many hours worth.

1119
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,360
We brought him some sandwich

1120
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:44,760
assortments, assortment of sandwiches, so he has options.

1121
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,720
He won't get he won't get tired out.

1122
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,240
We'll we'll see to his cover.

1123
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,520
I brought a carafe of coffee.

1124
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,000
Actually, let me say this before I keep going with this,

1125
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,200
you know, this tale.

1126
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:01,080
The all the puppets in this thing were designed by a woman named Lynette Eklund.

1127
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,480
Let me say some of the credits of Lynette Eklund.

1128
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,400
She worked on Teddy Ruxpin.

1129
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,960
She built her work on Raptors and Lost World.

1130
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:13,000
She was a puppeteer for the part in Beetlejuice where he turns into a snake.

1131
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,400
Whoa. She is operating that machine.

1132
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,840
Wow. She built the Pee Wee's Playhouse character, Billy Bologna.

1133
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,040
She constructed that.

1134
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:23,040
And all things very Pee Wee to I get that influence in this thing.

1135
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:27,960
When there was a big American Tale live show and the cat tiger,

1136
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,400
the Dom DeLuis cat.

1137
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,520
Do you guys know this thing from Universal Florida?

1138
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,040
I remember seeing this is a gigantic tiger, the cat.

1139
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,520
She built that or was one of the builders of that.

1140
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,560
And the Adventurers Club puppets.

1141
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:45,240
Was built by the same woman who built all who built Mr.

1142
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,000
Fusano and all the puppets.

1143
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,120
Now that you say it, it feels in the same family.

1144
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,880
Yes. That's interesting.

1145
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,840
Now, well, maybe maybe it is a good time to then bring this thing up.

1146
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,560
Here's what happened.

1147
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,720
She they needed to get this done pretty quick and cheap.

1148
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:04,000
They needed somebody who was really good at at puppetry.

1149
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,160
You get it done. Build these things quickly.

1150
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:11,200
She just built she built like 12 puppets in a in her one bedroom apartment,

1151
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,840
probably around Burbank where we're recording, including puppets

1152
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,120
who aren't even in the thing.

1153
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,600
Check out this guy.

1154
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,480
This is on her website.

1155
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,000
He has a little name badge.

1156
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,080
His name is Captain Zonix, clearly a relative of Officer Zizik's.

1157
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,920
And so he's like, I don't know, is he another like customs guy?

1158
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,480
And then on his belt, he's got a buckle that is a little pizza

1159
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,720
with a slice taken out of it.

1160
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,480
My God. He's so cool.

1161
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,360
Also munch munch on a cigar.

1162
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,800
I don't think he's even in the thing.

1163
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,440
He's like Marlon Brando.

1164
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,680
Look, he's got the same jacket from from what?

1165
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:47,520
Is on the waterfront.

1166
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,840
Oh, you know what I'm talking about? Yeah. What is it?

1167
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,240
Hold on. Hold on. Let me find it.

1168
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,240
Leather jacket.

1169
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,920
It's like Zia, the zip. There it is. OK.

1170
00:57:58,760 --> 00:57:59,640
There's the picture.

1171
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,760
The wild, the wild. Yeah.

1172
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,680
Oh, you're talking about that leather.

1173
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,480
Oh, yeah. And that hat. Uh huh.

1174
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,560
It's very, isn't it?

1175
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,520
Very much so. That's what she's going for.

1176
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:12,160
And I bet it's as rich of a character if it had not been cut from the pizza

1177
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,200
restaurant video would have been as compelling of a character.

1178
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:19,840
Is that on there just to show these are examples of my work or for sale, perhaps?

1179
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,640
Oh, now we're talking.

1180
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,160
I actually I did see an interview with her where she said that, like

1181
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,520
a lot of these characters, she said, succumb to old age,

1182
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,800
meaning that they rotted away because they're made of cheap foam.

1183
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:35,000
Yeah. Yeah. But now let me blow your mind with something, which is when

1184
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,720
this is the this is like your Mueller report.

1185
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,520
Yeah, I know. And I'm like, I'm stressed out.

1186
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,240
There's more to go.

1187
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,880
I know it's one of those sincere ones.

1188
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,560
I'm trying to joke, but I believe in this world and mythology very much.

1189
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,240
And I'm trying to not get winded.

1190
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,840
So but here's here's really the big one.

1191
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,840
So she builds all of these puppets. They're amazing.

1192
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:01,440
She brings them to Imagineering just in garbage bags

1193
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,960
from her one better apartment, like takes them all out.

1194
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,480
People everybody's floored because they're just throwing this thing together.

1195
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,440
If we could get these characters done, that'd be great.

1196
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,960
They're they're all fantastic.

1197
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,120
If you look if you look them up in the video, look up Mr.

1198
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,360
Fusano and Tony's wife, who I'll get to

1199
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,320
everybody, Imagineering loves it.

1200
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,200
The person who commissioned her said, oh, my God,

1201
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,600
I have to go tell the Star Tours team about this.

1202
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:28,080
Hey, everybody working on Star Tours, come see these puppets on the spot.

1203
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:33,720
She has offered offered the opportunity to build a puppet of Admiral Ackbar.

1204
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:38,840
Whoa. Which was used in the line at Star Tours Tokyo.

1205
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,240
My goodness. This guy. Great.

1206
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:46,320
There is only one tiny screen that is playing this amazing Ackbar.

1207
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:47,840
I mean, maybe he's not Ackbar.

1208
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,720
He's a Mon Calamari. He's of the same species.

1209
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,960
But if you watch the video of this thing, it's incredible.

1210
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:57,880
He blinks. There is so much there's so much expression in his face.

1211
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And you can tell that he's small.

1212
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,360
So he's kind of cute.

1213
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:06,200
It's like if Edwin was an Ackbar, he's it's the most adorable thing.

1214
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,200
So it's not an Ackbar.

1215
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,200
It's not a Mon Calamari that's in the control room.

1216
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,320
It's honest. A video screen elsewhere.

1217
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:14,160
He's giving instructions to a droid. Oh, OK.

1218
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,280
Did you find it? Yeah. There you are.

1219
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,840
Yes. Only I found that.

1220
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,280
Charming. So blue my mind.

1221
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,120
There's like a couple of grainy videos of it.

1222
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,400
It's hard to find quality.

1223
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,840
So in addition, all that other shit, Dan Android and everything,

1224
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,280
there's an Ackbar that was only for this thing.

1225
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,560
Tying all these universes together, the same puppeteer building puppets

1226
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,640
for both of these places.

1227
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,400
Can she make a puppet of Jason and his ice cream wife?

1228
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,480
Wouldn't that be?

1229
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,480
We know she can. It's would she?

1230
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:42,800
Would she? We just got another drawing of that as we've been recording.

1231
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,640
I know that's what's jogged my memory.

1232
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:49,400
And I what to what to puppets cost at this point?

1233
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,040
I don't know.

1234
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:53,200
What is what is Lynette Eklund's original legend?

1235
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,840
Yeah, she's got to charge something.

1236
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,920
I'd be happy to have a puppet of me, but I'd so much rather have a Jason.

1237
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,920
Oh, my God. That's obvious.

1238
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,920
I would I think we would all three rather have Jason puppets.

1239
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,280
Yeah, different Jason puppets.

1240
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,880
One is a mayor. One is married to the ice cream wife.

1241
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:12,560
And then one is there was got to be a third probably in an old time

1242
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,520
sleeping get a like Scrooge greeting the ghost.

1243
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,400
Oh, with the butthole pajamas.

1244
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,800
Oh, I was going to say night shirt and a cat like a sleeping cat.

1245
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:26,640
Oh, like like you want like a minor, a minor who startled awake by like raiders.

1246
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:31,440
Like you get out of here like that kind of but underwear, like Ghostbusters.

1247
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,760
When they come into the Ghostbusters, too, they come into the restaurant

1248
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,680
covered in goo to interrupt Venkman's dinner.

1249
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:41,200
That was the late 1980s and they were wearing long.

1250
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,160
It was funny. It was funny.

1251
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,480
Would have been funnier if they'd put Dan Android in there, too.

1252
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,160
Yeah. But what can you do?

1253
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,200
All right. Let's all right. New goal.

1254
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,640
We can't we can't even keep track of all the things we do when episodes end.

1255
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,160
But clearly getting this woman to build Jason.

1256
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,840
So anyway, let me get to her next puppet.

1257
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:05,040
OK, so as I was saying, his boss is the pizza machine is broken.

1258
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:08,080
His boss is threatening to send him to the spice mines.

1259
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,440
Dear God, the stakes could not be higher.

1260
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,600
Then everybody, all these human workers are calling Tony.

1261
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,080
We need more pizzas.

1262
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,920
And then another Tony from his wife, from Mrs.

1263
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:24,840
Solaroni, Tony, who this this character.

1264
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,520
I have some Bechtel test questions about Mrs.

1265
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,680
Solaroni, the Helen, the Helen test. Yes.

1266
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,160
If her name was Helen, maybe her name is Helen.

1267
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,200
Her unsaid name is Helen.

1268
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:40,080
Tony, you didn't fix the gaseous atmosphere conditioner

1269
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,600
like I told you to.

1270
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,360
You see her.

1271
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,480
His puppet wife is in a room next to like an air conditioner,

1272
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,480
but that is gas and it's on the fritz.

1273
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,640
And it is. And smoke is or something worse.

1274
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,000
Gas is filling the room.

1275
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,880
She is starting to choke and cough on gas.

1276
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:02,840
Also, she's presented as like a nagging wife who doesn't understand that he's at work.

1277
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:06,160
But she's dying of gas poisoning.

1278
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,160
And she asked him to fix this already.

1279
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:12,400
What does she want? More gas or less gas?

1280
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,920
That's is it like an air conditioner or is it like

1281
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,800
natural gas is like gallons a day to live.

1282
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:26,480
So it's funny because if you read the summary of this character in the show, it's Tony.

1283
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:31,200
Yeah, Tony tries his best to make pizzas while he gets grief from his boss and wife.

1284
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,920
And there's so much more.

1285
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,600
Everything refers to nagging wife.

1286
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,160
I didn't even show you guys. I brought this dip.

1287
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:40,240
This issue of Disney News from when it probably the first I ever heard of this thing.

1288
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,480
Look at this drawing of Mrs.

1289
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:47,280
Solaroni. Look how look how mean and unpleasant she is at the bottom.

1290
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,600
That's her. Yes, she looks like a cat.

1291
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,600
She's opening her arms for a big hug.

1292
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,560
Oh, that's but her but her.

1293
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:56,240
Her eyes are angry.

1294
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,640
She's OK. I guess they're a little angry.

1295
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,120
Yeah, I couldn't really see that nag here.

1296
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:03,920
Yeah, she's looking for that kind of relationship, though.

1297
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,440
I'm kind of I'm a mad.

1298
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,240
And now I'm now I'm shipping you guys.

1299
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,280
I'm literally doing it.

1300
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,240
I'm putting Mrs.

1301
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,240
Solaroni next to you.

1302
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,600
Bost around by Mrs.

1303
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,440
Solaroni.

1304
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:15,040
That's what he's looking for.

1305
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:18,320
Jason, why home the gas, please?

1306
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,360
OK, I'll stop on the way.

1307
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,960
Whatever you say, dear.

1308
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,920
I'll stop at Space Mart.

1309
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,560
Later, the situation sort of gets resolved and they're not quite like still.

1310
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,240
She calls again and more gas is filling up the room.

1311
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,560
She is coughing and coughing.

1312
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:37,040
And then she adds another request, which is bring home something to eat.

1313
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,880
And don't you dare bring me another pizza.

1314
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:46,440
Man, I so now here's where I know I've said how much I love Tony Solaroni,

1315
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,480
but maybe I don't maybe I love the world.

1316
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,560
But I think he has some some problems.

1317
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,640
He's not a good businessman.

1318
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:54,680
No, he lets this.

1319
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,720
I've only been sitting and watching this for 10 minutes and the machine is broken

1320
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:02,400
twice just in this random snippet of watching him work his like.

1321
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:07,280
And then he's trying to slide in pizzas, which he has an unlimited amount of at work.

1322
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,520
Yeah, he always brings that home for dinner.

1323
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:13,400
That's cheating. That's stealing from the restaurant and his wife.

1324
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,680
She's going to get sick if all she eats is pizza.

1325
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,480
And she's already dying of gas poisoning.

1326
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,600
He's got some Tony.

1327
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:23,040
It sounds like there's a root cause for his listlessness.

1328
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,880
What's what's really plaguing Tony?

1329
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:29,800
Um, I mean, is it the just the presser of Mr.

1330
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,320
Fusano? Is it late?

1331
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:36,880
Is this late stage capitalism crushing the salary man crushing this worker?

1332
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:41,240
I think you think about it in sort of a way in a scary German expression,

1333
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:45,880
it like the idea of work being that you're like pulling levers and operating

1334
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:48,120
a big machine and toiling away.

1335
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:52,400
That is like this like scary futurist idea of what your job would be.

1336
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:55,080
Yeah. I mean, there's schools of political thought that say like,

1337
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,720
who really has more influence on your day to day life?

1338
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,560
The president, your senator or your boss?

1339
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:06,240
You know, so I would like to see whoever the president is in this world very much.

1340
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,720
Oh, yeah. I'll take Mr.

1341
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,320
What does he think of the spice?

1342
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:14,080
I mean, I love giving him subsidies to he might have invaded some country

1343
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,920
and like blown up a bunch of people that get them built.

1344
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,280
I think Tony, though, kind of you could use him as like a stand in for corporate

1345
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:25,240
culture where people just fail, fail, fail and keep getting plugged into jobs

1346
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:28,960
they're unqualified for. Like, you know, we are in the entertainment business.

1347
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:32,240
Executives switch places. Maybe they suck at their job.

1348
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,280
We've talked to them. They don't know.

1349
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,280
They don't know how to read a script or interpret things.

1350
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,320
They don't have any ideas.

1351
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,480
That's the thing that happens.

1352
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:41,720
Every like blip blip media that comes and goes in nine months and fail.

1353
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:44,800
The executive is always immediately at another job.

1354
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,440
Yes, it's some crazy.

1355
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,000
No one knows what they're doing.

1356
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,360
And this is what Tony's doing.

1357
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:52,360
He's a nice guy, but he's not qualified for this.

1358
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:54,000
He shouldn't be doing this.

1359
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,440
Lord Lord, give me the confidence of a mediocre Tony Salaroni.

1360
01:06:58,440 --> 01:06:59,880
Right, folks. Tony.

1361
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:03,320
So like my mug, like my mug from Redbubble says.

1362
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,760
I mean, he's also executives is a good metaphor for him, too,

1363
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,000
because he like what is he really doing?

1364
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I you're watching the machine is automated.

1365
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,120
It's doing everything.

1366
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:19,120
Then what the fully made pizzas are going down to like all of his buddies

1367
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:22,800
downstairs who are just putting pizzas in an oven and not cooking them.

1368
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:26,480
Those are his underlings who probably follow him from franchise to franchise.

1369
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,960
And that's why they're singing about him and love him so much

1370
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:33,600
because he keeps giving him work, even though this team does not work well together.

1371
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:38,000
No. In the scene that I'm going to keep describing, the room is soon full of smoke.

1372
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,880
Pizzas are spilling everywhere.

1373
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,640
This is a terrible unit of people.

1374
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:45,640
Yeah. So he's really he's propping up this pointless job that he has.

1375
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:48,840
And maybe Mr. Fusano is really the hero

1376
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:53,440
for shining a light on his mediocrity and that he's not really doing it.

1377
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,680
I agree. I think that this is a really like this is an interesting

1378
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,800
Rorschach test for people, guests that go through this Tokyo Disney place.

1379
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,800
Because what do you see? Do you just go, hey, this is a nice guy?

1380
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,760
Because this is a thing we're talking about with politics now.

1381
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,880
There's politicians seem like great people.

1382
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:10,000
They seem like you'd love to hang out with them and talk to them.

1383
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,480
But what do they represent?

1384
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,560
What is the record?

1385
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:16,320
What is actually going on behind that veneer of the nice person?

1386
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:19,480
This is so you go buy this pan galactic pizza port.

1387
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:23,560
And truly, if you really sit and think about it, you will like learn a lot

1388
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:26,040
about yourself and how you view the world.

1389
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:30,280
And really, the fact that he's you think he's operating this machine,

1390
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:33,840
but isn't the machine really running itself?

1391
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,960
Yes. The answer is yes, it is.

1392
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:39,800
Tony Salaroni is just like a do nothing

1393
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:44,520
consultant class who just if he sticks around long enough, he'll make like

1394
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,760
sixteen hundred Zor block

1395
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:51,080
he sees in cosmic shows every year.

1396
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:55,440
Yeah, he gets he gets pepperoni bonuses every time he leaves the building.

1397
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:58,840
Sure. Do we know his alien race?

1398
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:03,520
We know that he is from the Spumoni galaxy.

1399
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:04,800
He's Spumoni.

1400
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,960
So he has Spumoni privilege.

1401
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:11,680
Perhaps Tony Salaroni is a Spumoni privilege.

1402
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:13,640
He's got Spumoni privilege.

1403
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,040
He's a Monies.

1404
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:18,160
He has Jason also has a bit of Spumoni privilege.

1405
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:21,280
That's because it's all spread all around my mouth right now.

1406
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:21,960
I love that.

1407
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,360
It's like it's like a higher grade Neapolitan.

1408
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,240
As soon as we're done recording, you may even go get some more Spumoni.

1409
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:32,240
And I will say at least Tony

1410
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:35,480
Salaroni, he does make a little cottage

1411
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:39,520
industry selling Friends of the Zuh t-shirts.

1412
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:41,400
Oh, people are going to really.

1413
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,880
That's a real that's a real that's the only thing about sort of

1414
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,400
sixteen hundred Zor block.

1415
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,560
Yeah, he wrote.

1416
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,560
OK, I see what you're saying.

1417
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:53,920
OK, OK.

1418
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:58,440
You know, I went into this thinking I was here to tell you about how much I love

1419
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,920
Tony Salaroni and you now that I actually have been forced to sit

1420
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,560
and talk about it out loud, I don't love Tony Salaroni.

1421
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:05,360
I love the pizza part.

1422
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:08,160
I love the machine and I love the colorful world and characters.

1423
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,160
I hate Tony.

1424
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,520
He is a do nothing.

1425
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:16,320
He's how dare I compare him to a buzzy.

1426
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:21,600
Buzzy means, well, he's a he's a conscience of a little boy who's

1427
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,480
blossoming and figuring out who he is in this world.

1428
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,000
What is Salaroni?

1429
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:29,520
And Buzzy, there's a whole story, this growth there.

1430
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:35,480
When you leave this pizza port loop, it just starts all over again,

1431
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,400
just like the horrible cycle that we're in.

1432
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,640
Yeah, in this in this capital society.

1433
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,320
Wow. All right.

1434
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,880
What an arc for this episode.

1435
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,320
Geez.

1436
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:48,200
Well, what did I miss?

1437
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:52,800
Well, then the orders are piling up and then the wife and the boss and the

1438
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:59,480
employees all say at once, Tony, which is really fun to watch.

1439
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,880
That's collective action.

1440
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,320
That's solidarity.

1441
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,640
And now that I know those are all the heroes of the story,

1442
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:11,200
that's how we all feel sometimes screaming out at our leaders and feeling

1443
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,320
like they don't even hear. And you know what?

1444
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,560
Now that I think about it, you know what his response is?

1445
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,360
Nothing. He doesn't do anything.

1446
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:21,200
He kind of goes like, uh, and then and then the machine fixes itself.

1447
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:24,800
Speaking of Rorschach from Watchmen,

1448
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,520
people will what is the line?

1449
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,720
Say the line for me.

1450
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:30,280
People will look up and say, save us.

1451
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,200
The rain's going to come.

1452
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,800
Yeah.

1453
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:39,160
Solaroni, no, I will not to save you.

1454
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,160
So all right.

1455
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,400
So now I realize that the stress is justified.

1456
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:46,040
He starts to worry it's off to the spice mines for me.

1457
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,800
But then the machine fixes itself,

1458
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,320
which is how this it's how the Trump situation is going to have to work out.

1459
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,960
Yeah, I don't think no individual is

1460
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,680
it's just going to have to take care of itself.

1461
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,040
Anyway, then Mr.

1462
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:03,160
Fusano checks in one more time, Tony, are those pizzas coming?

1463
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,880
And now there's no I miss now the pizza machine fixes itself.

1464
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:10,040
Now there are too many pizzas and his employees are all fumbling around.

1465
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:11,880
So it's just another problem again.

1466
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,040
He fucked up yet again.

1467
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,840
But he does get his justice.

1468
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:19,200
He does. This villain gets just punishment.

1469
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,240
Tony Solaroni.

1470
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,360
Mr. Fusano says, are those pizzas coming?

1471
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,920
He says, yes, better than you'd believe.

1472
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:30,040
And he says, good, keep up the good work and I'll let you stay on earth for 100

1473
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:34,480
more years, but don't tell your wife for at least 10.

1474
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:37,400
And then he laughs for a very long time.

1475
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,080
And then Tony starts laughing, too.

1476
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:43,360
Once again, I'm realizing he is a villain.

1477
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,160
He's trying to murder his wife.

1478
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,200
He's a class traitor, too.

1479
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,000
Oh, yeah.

1480
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,680
Like palling around with the management.

1481
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:51,600
That's a good point.

1482
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,200
He represents himself as a friend of the kitchen staff.

1483
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:55,920
Yeah, it's populators.

1484
01:12:56,120 --> 01:13:00,520
And but really he's buddies with that's like the end of that black mirror where

1485
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:06,920
the guy accepts the money to live in the good planes on TV, but then lives in the

1486
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:10,000
golden floor of that future hellscape.

1487
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,960
And in that thing, you have to like you're

1488
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:14,040
on the treadmills operating the machines.

1489
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,320
That's sort of what he's doing.

1490
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,680
It's a very Tony Solaroni is a black mirror.

1491
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,440
It is the first black mirror.

1492
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,240
It happened at a pizza restaurant in 1989.

1493
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:27,480
Geez. Yeah, really heavier than I realized.

1494
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:28,880
Very heavy.

1495
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,320
It really says something.

1496
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:31,360
You know? Yeah.

1497
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:35,480
Yeah. But thanks for I don't think I would have known that without saying it all out

1498
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:39,480
loud. Yeah, we shine a light on all this.

1499
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:42,040
And there's one more thing I need to say.

1500
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:44,480
When when Mrs.

1501
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,320
Solaroni

1502
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:52,480
nags him as if in his view nags him to come home,

1503
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,160
she says something very important.

1504
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,520
It goes by in a second, but it's very crucial.

1505
01:13:56,720 --> 01:14:00,520
She tells Tony, take a star speeder home right now.

1506
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:01,720
Oh, interesting.

1507
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,240
Star speeder ties it back to Star Tours.

1508
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,800
Star Tours is canon.

1509
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,640
Therefore, all of this is canon.

1510
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:11,680
Earlier, I said, live your Star Wars story

1511
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,320
that they're pushing that with the opening of Galaxy's Edge.

1512
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:21,400
I have already lived my Star Wars story and I'm not going to put it at number one.

1513
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:26,000
The best Star Wars story is original Star Tours, but number two best Star Wars

1514
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:31,040
story above all of the films in my book is the pan galactic Pete support.

1515
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,760
Tony Solaroni loop. Wow.

1516
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,360
It is a tale of good and evil.

1517
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,840
It is a tale of dark sides.

1518
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:41,360
It's a tale of choosing alliances and it is an official Star Wars story.

1519
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,320
Can I ask what three is?

1520
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,600
Well, I made the whole list.

1521
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,840
Oh, go ahead.

1522
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,680
It's a long episode already.

1523
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:49,680
Yeah. And I and I'm

1524
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,960
yeah. All right. My my my top 10 Star Wars stories.

1525
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,720
Number one, Star Tours, number two, the Tony Solaroni loop.

1526
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:59,040
Number three, the Star Wars holiday special.

1527
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:03,320
Number four, the Star Tours special where C3PO wraps in the beginning.

1528
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,200
Number five, Sunny Eclipse, also canon.

1529
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:10,640
Number six, the part in the 35th anniversary special where C3PO and R2D2

1530
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,160
wait for a transmission from Miss Piggy and Gonzo.

1531
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:16,560
But they're worried because Tony Danza is nowhere to be found.

1532
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:17,720
That's number six.

1533
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,800
Number seven, Star Wars adventures continue.

1534
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,920
Star Tours adventures continue.

1535
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:26,800
Number eight is a tie between any time any of the droids present on the Oscars.

1536
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,640
And number nine, Empire Strikes Back,

1537
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:32,640
number 10, when the Star Wars characters are on the Muppet show.

1538
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:35,040
So one of the movies snuck in there.

1539
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:38,840
I would have liked to have gotten more in, but I have to live.

1540
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:39,920
I have to live my truth.

1541
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,960
I have to tell my Star Wars story.

1542
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,480
And that is and that's my top 10.

1543
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:47,080
I would love to see you at Galaxy's Edge,

1544
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:51,080
stop at every store and go like you have any Tony Solaroni stuff?

1545
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,840
Or do I have to go to the first order supply for that?

1546
01:15:56,040 --> 01:16:01,160
Does the Droid Depot do any of these customize into Tony Solaroni?

1547
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,360
Oh, you don't have OK.

1548
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:03,440
But you probably have a Mr.

1549
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,240
Fusano, right? I mean, I'll wait.

1550
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,280
Just go look in the back.

1551
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:10,160
There's a Mr. Fusano walk around character for sure.

1552
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,680
He's at Black Spire Outpost.

1553
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:15,520
I guess what I would end up saying after that interaction is these are not the

1554
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,920
droids I'm looking for.

1555
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,520
Wow, you nailed that.

1556
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,240
God, I did a Star Wars.

1557
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:24,160
You did it despite my list.

1558
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:30,280
So wait, Sunny Eclipse is in there because the mold, the shared mold is a spiritual cousin.

1559
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:36,240
Yeah, because Office is canon because he's part of Star Tours and, you know,

1560
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,720
he's the same species as Sunny Eclipse.

1561
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:41,400
So, yes, Sunny Eclipse is a Star Wars story.

1562
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:42,880
The space angels are great.

1563
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:47,160
OK, yeah. Anything you would kick out of my my list?

1564
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:48,600
No.

1565
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:53,360
Did you move anything around for me personally?

1566
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,080
I'm trying to think.

1567
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,120
What was the holiday special to was it?

1568
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:58,200
There's three.

1569
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:01,920
I guess two is I mean, by the Jefferson Starship performance.

1570
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:05,760
I think I might move that one up in front of Solaroni.

1571
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:06,840
Sure. That's fair.

1572
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:07,920
But you have to.

1573
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,400
But in fairness, you did not watch the entire loop.

1574
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:14,520
And now when you go to having experienced the way we all experienced it here

1575
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,560
together, you're going to see it differently.

1576
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:21,200
Wait a minute. I've got Taco Bell had the promotional tie in for the special

1577
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,480
editions and the Phantom Menace.

1578
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:26,000
Yes, I feel like that might knock out Empire.

1579
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:32,000
Yeah, I'm going to move down the Yoda Man commercials.

1580
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,480
OK, when they were advertising the prequels

1581
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:38,600
and Yoda was doing the when he was flipping around using the lightsaber.

1582
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,160
And they said Yoda Man.

1583
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:43,360
Oh, yeah, it's maybe not in the top 10, but it's hovering.

1584
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:46,680
It's still it's going to force you hope and less.

1585
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,480
Are you counting the story?

1586
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:50,360
It was actually kind of cruel.

1587
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:53,480
And I think they were able to sue for some money where like,

1588
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:59,720
I think it was a waitress at a Hooters, like if they had the most tips or checks

1589
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:03,360
or something, they were told they would get a Toyota at the end of the month.

1590
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:07,360
And the joke was that it was a toy Yoda.

1591
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:10,240
And then they sued because it's like that was fraudulent.

1592
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:11,560
Of course.

1593
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:12,240
Huh?

1594
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:16,800
Well, that is again, there were twists and turns in that story.

1595
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,160
Tale of good and evil.

1596
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,640
Tale of copyright infringement, which is evil.

1597
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,840
But is it good if it's helping people?

1598
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,520
Is it if you rob bread to feed your family?

1599
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:26,320
Is that good or bad?

1600
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,120
So that's a that's a I don't know.

1601
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,200
There's a lot to that story.

1602
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,600
I would have to put it in the top 10.

1603
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:34,440
Yes, I realize this is actually my number one here.

1604
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,160
Let me fast forward a little bit.

1605
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:42,760
I do not.

1606
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:46,360
We did a whole bit about this once years ago.

1607
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:05,720
Now, Mike, I don't know what I'm looking at here.

1608
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,040
This is a video game.

1609
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:08,560
Oh,

1610
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:12,000
I'm still dancing about to be frozen by car.

1611
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,320
It's far away. I can't.

1612
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:14,880
He's going to be frozen in a sec.

1613
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,400
Well, that's or he just got three.

1614
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,200
I guess he got three.

1615
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:25,480
But he is on the carbonite freezing room platform.

1616
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:26,680
Yeah.

1617
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:34,240
The cover is gone.

1618
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,200
What is this?

1619
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,520
The pain is gone.

1620
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:47,000
That is a video game, like a Kinect video game from years ago with all Star Wars

1621
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,280
like pop like parodies, essentially.

1622
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:50,160
Oh, my God.

1623
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:52,560
This is right before the sale to Disney,

1624
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,720
which Disney then like doesn't want to do fun shit like this anymore.

1625
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:56,360
Yeah.

1626
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,160
But it's like my favorite Star Wars thing.

1627
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:02,560
And then I got to put in the unreleased thing where Bugman plays the Han Solo.

1628
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:03,000
Yeah.

1629
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,160
Without having seen it, it's still at top 10.

1630
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:06,640
Yeah. Man, jeez.

1631
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:07,840
The top 10 is getting crowded.

1632
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,520
I'm going to have to bump Adventures Continue.

1633
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:11,800
Oscars are out.

1634
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,880
And yeah, Empire went out a long time ago.

1635
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,680
So, yeah, I'm going to move that up to maybe like four.

1636
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:20,040
I'll dock Holiday special points for the B.R.

1637
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:23,160
third number. It doesn't really do it for me.

1638
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:27,080
But I mean, I'll reach I'll reach out all of this.

1639
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:31,200
And but every one of those songs is its own Star Wars story.

1640
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:35,080
Oh, so that might that might really like six of the slots.

1641
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:38,120
But it's never going to bump the tale of Tony Solaroni.

1642
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:43,640
No, a villain I realized was a villain halfway through our own podcast.

1643
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:46,960
This podcast, you know, I had a good time talking about this with you guys.

1644
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:50,360
I'm going to put this episode in the top 10 Star Wars stories.

1645
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:54,240
I know. I think this is probably now this is Canon, obviously.

1646
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:56,240
But yeah, this podcast is Canon.

1647
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,840
This is this wasn't even planned.

1648
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,280
I mean, this was just you were so excited

1649
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:02,800
coming off your Tokyo trip and we're not even thinking about this is coming out

1650
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,600
like as Galaxy's Edge is about to open.

1651
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,160
So it does tie.

1652
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:10,120
Yeah, it ties together more than we realized.

1653
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:14,240
And that's this customizable adventure where you're you're tied up and you have

1654
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,400
to form allegiances. But look what happened to us here.

1655
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:19,720
Sure. I lost my Tony Solaroni, lost his allegiance to me.

1656
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:22,000
I say send him to the spice mines for all I care.

1657
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,240
He's a he's a bigger

1658
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:29,600
turned coat than whatever Benicio del Toro's character was called in Last Jedi.

1659
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:32,920
J.J. Jason, his character's name was DJ.

1660
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:34,240
Really? You don't remember that?

1661
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:36,000
No, I don't. OK, crazy.

1662
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:38,120
He wasn't the master code breaker.

1663
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,760
No, that was Justin Theroux.

1664
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:42,160
That was Justin Theroux. A very confusing cameo.

1665
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:42,960
I see.

1666
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:45,800
Benicio del Toro was the one who kept going like

1667
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,320
like he had a techie, had like a real good acting tech.

1668
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,240
Yeah, pretty neat.

1669
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:52,000
Pretty cool.

1670
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,760
Not going to make it into the top 10, though.

1671
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,720
Not now that I know about going solo.

1672
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,440
What's that called?

1673
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:59,440
I'm

1674
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:01,880
that's already like mentally checked out.

1675
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:02,840
He's already driving.

1676
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,600
I'm going like, I can't forget.

1677
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,040
I have to get this down.

1678
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:08,440
I got to free myself of the pain.

1679
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:10,920
I got to get all of the government off me.

1680
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,600
Kind of take a shower.

1681
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:13,640
I'm shocked.

1682
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:14,960
All that carbonate.

1683
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:16,000
I'm shocked.

1684
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,360
I didn't show you that within like the first few weeks of knowing.

1685
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,400
Yeah, I know. What were we doing?

1686
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:21,840
A lot of wasted time.

1687
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,520
I'm sure I was sure you knew that.

1688
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,240
I'm not kidding with any of this.

1689
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:28,600
I hate how seriously people take Star Wars.

1690
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:33,240
And I think you'll have a lot more fun if you loosen up, put it all in canon.

1691
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,600
That's the advice I'd give if I were speaking at a graduation.

1692
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,120
I'd say, put it all in canon.

1693
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,200
Yeah, loosen up.

1694
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,360
Have fun out there.

1695
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,360
I live your Star Wars story.

1696
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,120
But I do take everything seriously, too.

1697
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:47,680
Somebody accused me of not being you and I of not being real Star Wars fans.

1698
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,040
And I take umbrage with that.

1699
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:49,840
I love Star Wars.

1700
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:50,880
I'm a big Star Wars fan.

1701
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:52,040
Let me praise.

1702
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:55,080
I'm I am in my own way.

1703
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,880
If you accuse me of not being.

1704
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:57,960
But you just listed.

1705
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:01,920
Yes. So you listed enough like obscure things, which obscure things is truly the

1706
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:03,480
mark of a fan.

1707
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:04,400
Yeah, I think so.

1708
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,040
There's the movies, but everyone knows those.

1709
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:07,760
Yeah.

1710
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:10,600
Tony, the Where is Tony Danza scene.

1711
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:14,400
You have to be a true Star Wars fan to acknowledge.

1712
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:16,360
I'm going to say this real quick about Tony.

1713
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,120
I love this one point I wanted to make.

1714
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:21,360
Yes, I like Tony's hairstyle because I'm

1715
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:25,040
pretty sure it was modeled after Clint Howard.

1716
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,040
Like when you're bald and you just have

1717
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,600
that big kind of patch of brown hair in the back, almost like Hulk Hogan, when the

1718
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,320
bandana would fall off. Sure.

1719
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:35,160
I love it. I love an alien having that hairstyle.

1720
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:36,120
He kind of does.

1721
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:38,320
And he's just got like a little swivel, essentially.

1722
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:40,760
Yeah, that's fantastic.

1723
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:43,120
What is that enough to keep him out of the spice mines?

1724
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:46,960
No, he should live there for all of eternity as far as I'm concerned.

1725
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:49,040
But his hairstyle is super cute.

1726
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,600
Do you think that's genetic or just

1727
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:53,440
from stress and not eating enough or only eating pizza?

1728
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,960
Well, his eyes, they go up.

1729
01:23:56,160 --> 01:24:00,200
So I think it's actually just sort of how the hairstyle of the aliens is.

1730
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,320
I see. I don't think he actually lost his hair.

1731
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:07,880
It just looks like that for us because, yeah, because he has too much

1732
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:13,120
stuff going on up top, I think, for there to be hair surrounding all of it.

1733
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,520
How about what I've determined is I like

1734
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:19,240
everything about this experience except that bastard Tony Solaroni.

1735
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:22,200
We were talking about getting a Jason puppet made.

1736
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,400
What if instead it's a Jason animatronic?

1737
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:25,880
We get Tony out of there.

1738
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:31,240
We replace him with Jason Sheridoni, a man of the people,

1739
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:35,400
somebody everyone can agree on, and which and you as an animatronic would

1740
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,760
just be very buzzy-esque. Yeah.

1741
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:40,120
Everybody's on board with that right away.

1742
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,240
More hair. That's a plus.

1743
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:44,920
Not like this little wisp that Tony has.

1744
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:47,000
I'll say this seafood cream calzone.

1745
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,560
Go on. Japanese curry calzone in.

1746
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:52,520
Damn. Great move. Day one. Day one.

1747
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,920
Yeah. And if he's pizza, how about that?

1748
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,160
Don't overthink it.

1749
01:24:56,360 --> 01:25:00,160
Yeah. Now that I think about it, this is why these franchises are going under.

1750
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:02,160
Seafood cream.

1751
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:05,000
Mr. Fusano should have canned your ass for that idea.

1752
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,280
Day one. Yeah.

1753
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,600
Also day one. Shutting the place down.

1754
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:09,960
Bar rescue profit style.

1755
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:11,280
Shutting it down.

1756
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,840
Cleaning everything. Scrubbing everything.

1757
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:18,000
There's not going to be any smoke, any dough just piling up.

1758
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:20,240
Fresh cheese in the cheese-o-matic.

1759
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:22,640
Yeah. Fresh dough in the flip-flop-ulator.

1760
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:27,360
I want to talk to every employee and figure out what their fucked up backstory is.

1761
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:30,600
That we'll learn for 45 seconds.

1762
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,080
Very passingly, yes.

1763
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:33,440
No animatronic.

1764
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:36,120
Just put Jason there.

1765
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,320
Just ship Jason to Tokyo.

1766
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:40,520
Sure. And have him do it.

1767
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:43,760
Like when I went in to ship you to Singapore to play Awesome Powers.

1768
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:45,560
Shipping is part of the...

1769
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:48,760
I was shipping you with the wife and then she would be your wife.

1770
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,720
And I'm literally shipping you in a crate.

1771
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:54,520
Like Garfield ships Nermal to Abu Dhabi.

1772
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:55,960
But yeah.

1773
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:58,080
You insist I travel that way.

1774
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:01,840
I tried to lure you into that giant crate with the big Abu Dhabi mailing slip on it.

1775
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:03,240
Almost worked too.

1776
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:04,400
Almost worked.

1777
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,960
Trail of candy into...

1778
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:07,880
This is great.

1779
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:11,680
And then you actually turn this pizza restaurant, which does need help.

1780
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:15,400
And it's like very simple fixes to make a pizza place good.

1781
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:16,360
You'll do that.

1782
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:17,840
You will sit in a chair.

1783
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:22,080
I hope you'd be up for singing an Italian ditty every once in a while.

1784
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:22,800
Of course.

1785
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
And me in the while.

1786
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:26,320
Couples counseling immediate.

1787
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:27,400
Let's get to the bottom.

1788
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:28,240
Let's get to the bottom.

1789
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:29,280
What's going on with you?

1790
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:30,960
Well, I mean, I guess first things first.

1791
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:36,200
Let's fix that gas machine and try and figure out whether you want more gas or less gas.

1792
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,040
Because you're asking questions.

1793
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,120
Yeah. That's part of a good marriage.

1794
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:43,880
You know, just like if it's all one sided and you're on your way out the door to work

1795
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:47,400
at your pizza machine job, but you've already opened a dialogue.

1796
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,800
You're going to be a great husband to the former Mrs.

1797
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,840
Solar and an important part of running a successful business that we can all enjoy

1798
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,440
the success of.

1799
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:58,040
Yeah. Yeah.

1800
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:00,240
So she will become...

1801
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:03,040
Solar will become a maiden name.

1802
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:03,880
She's Mrs.

1803
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,000
Sheratoni now.

1804
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:09,720
And also, first, when you get when you patch that relationship up with someone

1805
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:12,400
who's not your wife until now, ask her name.

1806
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:13,400
Find out her name.

1807
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:14,480
Find out the name.

1808
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:14,920
Yeah.

1809
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:18,520
The business will go belly up when I start giving away those little green men

1810
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:21,600
mochis with any order, like even water cups.

1811
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,960
Like, did you want some of these too?

1812
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:23,600
They're really good.

1813
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:24,400
It's a promotion.

1814
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,200
You need to get people in the door with that.

1815
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:26,640
Yeah.

1816
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:27,840
You're clearing the stockpile out.

1817
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,000
That's what Marcus would do.

1818
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,240
Sure. Absolutely.

1819
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:31,920
Mochi don't last forever.

1820
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,520
You don't want freezer burn.

1821
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:37,320
You don't want a gummy mochi and you bite into freezer burn ice cream.

1822
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:37,840
Ugh.

1823
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:39,880
Mochi don't last forever.

1824
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:42,400
Mochi don't last forever.

1825
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:46,280
That's Jason's Star Wars story.

1826
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:50,400
I have certainly found whenever we're done, the music to play us out.

1827
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:52,880
OK, sure. Well, I think we're ready.

1828
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:55,360
You survived podcast The Rioter, a harrowing story.

1829
01:27:55,560 --> 01:28:01,000
You survived our Star Wars story about Tony Solaroni, who is Star Wars canon.

But what do you have to play us out with, Mike?

1834
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:19,400
Well, this song is called Empire Today from the same Kinect Star Wars Galactic

1835
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:23,200
Dance Off game. There's nothing to do with the mattress, Jay.

1836
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:34,800
I said,

1837
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:41,720
there's no need to be unhappy.

1838
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:44,920
Young man, I'm the one in control.

1839
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:50,720
I said, young man, they can't read it, they know it's constriction.

1840
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:58,000
But I'm sure you will find many ways to have a good time.

1841
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:02,720
It's great to be in the Empire Today.

1842
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:06,000
It's great to be in the Empire.

1843
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:09,400
It's great to be in the Empire.

1844
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:11,400
It's great to be in the Empire.

1845
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:33,280
All right, goodbye.
