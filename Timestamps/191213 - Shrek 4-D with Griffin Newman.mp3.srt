1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,900
Warning, this episode was recorded months ago and references the Scorsese Marvel war that

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,400
sadly never went away.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,200
But don't worry, we also talk about Shrek's children, Farkle, Fergus and Felicia.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,360
PTR legend Griffin Newman joins us to talk Shrek 4D.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,360
Better out than in, it's podcast, The Ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:51,760
Welcome to podcast, The Ride, the only podcast presented in digital stereophonic ogre sound.

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,200
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Jason Sheridan, thank you.

10
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,200
Hello.

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
Mike Carlson.

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,200
I'm Jason Sheridan, I'm a director and I'm in ogre sound as well.

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,800
Yeah, I'm always, not just this episode, we're always in ogre sound.

14
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:14,200
Because today we are continuing the 3D film symposium and I'm so happy we get to do it

15
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,280
and that our guest for this series is back once again from the Tic and Blank Check, Griffin

16
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,280
Newman.

17
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,200
We're closing out the trilogy, the wait is ogre, one could say.

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Wow, yes it is ogre.

19
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,200
That was the tagline for one of them, for three or four.

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
I think so, yeah.

21
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,200
Because you did have to wait, there was three years in between each Shrek movie.

22
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,200
Animation takes a while.

23
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,200
It takes a while, it took even longer when this first one came out.

24
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:49,040
I heard a crazy stat which is that Katzenberg was, you know, anytime they found any degree

25
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,800
of success with any Dreamworks property he would just milk it from every angle possible,

26
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,540
as quickly as possible.

27
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,540
And they went into production on Shrek 2 two months after Shrek 1 came out.

28
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,540
Geez.

29
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,540
Wow.

30
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,820
Which I wonder if they were so confident that they had a script ready or if he was like,

31
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,140
you have two months to give us a script that is ready to start animation.

32
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,300
Or he just walked into the animators and was like, start animating, what do you want us

33
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,300
to do?

34
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,060
It doesn't matter, Shrek's involved, he farts and the donkey's there.

35
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,780
There is a story that I think it's Dan Harmon talked about on an episode of his podcast

36
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,780
I want to say.

37
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,260
Or it might have even been, he wrote like an article about what it's like to write on

38
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,260
an animated movie.

39
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,060
Where he came in to Kung Fu Panda and they showed him like all the storyboards on the

40
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,420
wall and they were like, you can only change 30% of this.

41
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:48,580
So you can pick 30% overall of the story to throw out or you can change 30% of each scene.

42
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:53,300
Oh because they were measuring 30% in dollars.

43
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,980
Right.

44
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:00,540
For example, in Shrek they threw out $4 million worth of animation when Mike Myers wanted

45
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,260
to come back and redo the lines in a Scottish accent.

46
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,460
We're going to get into all this but Shrek is kind of fascinating as like the Titanic

47
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:12,260
of CGI animation where it was the one where they kept on funneling money in and it seemed

48
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,260
cursed.

49
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,260
It saved DreamWorks.

50
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,260
Yes, and it saved them.

51
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,260
Yeah, it saved them.

52
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,940
It made them a player when they were not previously so much.

53
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,780
The road to El Dorado apparently almost killed them.

54
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:31,020
And Sinbad comes out I think the year after Shrek and like if Shrek had not worked, Sinbad

55
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,020
would have fully folded everything.

56
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:41,860
Shrek is sandwiched in between two hand drawn boys adventure films.

57
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,940
Oh yeah, dictating that this is what we do and no one was biting on those.

58
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:51,700
Well but the weird thing was the exact same time is Disney doing Treasure Planet and Atlantis.

59
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:57,700
Like early 2000s was everyone being like fuck, CGI is a thing now, we're not going to do

60
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:03,100
princess musicals, now it's like boys adventure films and hand drawn animation.

61
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,100
What triggered this?

62
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,100
Why did everyone decide that?

63
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,100
No idea.

64
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,380
Well it's probably because like stuff in Disney was starting to fail a little bit.

65
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,540
Their like formulas were failing so I think they were probably just trying to figure it

66
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,540
out.

67
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,660
I don't know this to be a fact but this is a guess.

68
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,860
They had their formula for the early 90s and then it sort of started to taper off.

69
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:24,020
Tarzan I guess was a bit of an upswing in terms of box office performance from the couple

70
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,420
before so maybe they took that and ran with it.

71
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,780
Right, it was like okay they like boys adventure now, that's what everyone likes.

72
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:38,860
But it's weird that like Disney did like two sci-fi like futuristic movies and then like

73
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,460
DreamWorks did these two like swashbuckling like boys will be boys movies.

74
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,260
It all merged in my brain.

75
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:51,140
I'm like seeing a Frankenstein of characters from all four of those movies and not individual

76
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:56,500
characters from the I don't know who's El Dorado versus who's Treasure Planet.

77
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,940
But you know the John Resnick song from Treasure Planet.

78
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,940
I'm still here.

79
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,940
Why did we talk about this?

80
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,940
I'm still here.

81
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,580
We were talking about the rockinest moments in theme park history on the Patreon and he

82
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,100
performed that in Disney special.

83
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,580
We did not declare that.

84
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,700
But check out the Patreon, we did not declare that at the rockinest moment.

85
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,700
I'm still here.

86
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,700
I'm still here.

87
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,260
Jim Parentheses, Jim's theme.

88
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,640
I think you made a joke on the episode that was like who even knows who played Jim?

89
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,940
Like you were like Jim I don't know who Jim is, who voiced Jim?

90
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,860
Assuming that it was some Disney star of the moment that was sort of like the tone in which

91
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,860
you spoke of it.

92
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,860
Can I guess?

93
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,860
Is it Tom Kavanaugh?

94
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,220
Jim was played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

95
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,220
Whoa.

96
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,700
It's kind of a Kavanaugh.

97
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,180
Kind of in that skinny like guy.

98
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,980
Maybe hadn't like broken ahead of the pack.

99
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:47,980
It was weirdly, it was like right after like Third Rock from the Sun ends and in the period

100
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,460
where he was like I question whether I want to keep acting and I walked away from acting

101
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,020
for three years and then he came back with like brick and mysterious skin and was like

102
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,560
a serious actor.

103
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,420
But like Treasure Planet was this remnant of his like child star days that just didn't

104
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:08,220
get released because of how long the animation is until he was like I don't know if I might

105
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,220
leave this.

106
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,260
Wait we also, oh no sorry.

107
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:16,740
I was going to say I think the thing too with animation because this is this sort of parallel

108
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,780
thinking or like two things coming out simultaneously.

109
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:26,940
Like people jump studios and companies so much and like oh they didn't really use this

110
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:31,220
kernel of an idea I pitched for this project so I'll do it over here.

111
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,420
And that like happens in animation, that happens in comic books too.

112
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,700
Like they're relaunching the X-Men at Marvel and they're relaunching the Legion of Superheroes

113
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,940
at DC.

114
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,520
Both involve characters in different ways who have seen like alternate time.

115
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,340
Like if you do this, this is what's going to happen.

116
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:54,020
I've seen it and I'm living a different life now but if we do something different something

117
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,020
else will happen.

118
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,420
Both of those.

119
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,300
Captain America and Batman both like died within six months of each other like ten years

120
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,380
ago in college.

121
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,380
Yes.

122
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,380
Yeah.

123
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,380
It's very weird.

124
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,740
Well and Dreamworks and Pixar were like notorious with that where you have like Ants and a Bug's

125
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,580
Life both in 98.

126
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,420
The furthest apart one is Shrek and Monsters Inc in 2001 where they're very different movies

127
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,500
but they're both like CGI monster movies.

128
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,820
They're bulbous creatures.

129
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,740
And then it's Finding Nemo and Shark Tale.

130
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,940
And then I think there's one more and then Dreamworks kind of went like we got our thing.

131
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,900
We can stop picking the same like sandbox that they're in.

132
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,900
They did the Unbelievably next to the Incredibles.

133
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,900
Right.

134
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:44,140
Hey wait while we're I realize we well you mentioned the references we made to animated

135
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,140
films in passing.

136
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,140
Yes.

137
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,140
I emailed you about this.

138
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,140
Yes.

139
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,140
We stepped in.

140
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,140
I think one of us, Madame and me, I don't remember.

141
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,140
Somebody said no.

142
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,140
You said this.

143
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,140
I remember and I hold it against you.

144
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,140
Sorry it's coming.

145
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,140
I'm scarring you with something coming from my voice.

146
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,700
I said something about nobody cares about paranormal.

147
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,460
Right.

148
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,460
In the Amanda Lund episode she said that she had played paranormal at Universal and you

149
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,460
said wow you probably care more about paranormal than anyone else in the world.

150
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,900
You might be the only person who has strong feelings about paranormal.

151
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,060
Which sounds really harsh when you quote it.

152
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,700
It didn't feel harsh saying it.

153
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,340
That was a light jovial tone and I was not I don't think I came on aggro.

154
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,340
No not at all.

155
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,740
We were emailing about schedule this and I just said look Scott I want you to know I

156
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:27,220
happen to consider paranormal to be one of the ten best films of the decade period.

157
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,740
Wow.

158
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,740
No genre qualifiers.

159
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,740
Did Jason and I trash paranormal or did we not say anything?

160
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,740
No comment.

161
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,740
Both of you guys came out clean.

162
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,740
Thank God.

163
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,740
No comment.

164
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:41,300
I feel like in a very early episode of this podcast there was a paranormal joke run but

165
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,580
I don't remember the context.

166
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,580
I don't remember anything about it.

167
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,060
It might have just been about how Universal had the maquettes of paranormal out for a

168
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,900
while at that part.

169
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,020
I just had a flashback when you were saying that to when Doug Jones when I had made a

170
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:59,180
listener and a guest Doug Jones so upset by saying Pizzeria was bad.

171
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,660
Well and he was like oh no.

172
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,660
You reopened the wound.

173
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,660
That was the thing.

174
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,500
I invoked it when I came on the show but that episode hadn't come out yet so then I confidently

175
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,740
doubled down on all the things I didn't know you had said and then I felt so bad for Doug

176
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,740
who I have not met.

177
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,740
I don't know.

178
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:19,520
He's great and it's like yeah you didn't really you weren't like trying to like throw

179
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,020
gasoline on the fire.

180
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,020
Absolutely not.

181
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,140
And then my episode comes out like a week after that episode where he comes on and

182
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:33,940
defends Pizzeria so valiantly and look in my defense I did not go to the disco.

183
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,940
Yeah.

184
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,340
And now we know and we're well by this point we will have been to the disco.

185
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,340
Oh wow.

186
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,340
Oh yes.

187
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,340
We may have even.

188
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,500
I'm not going to eat there but I will walk through it.

189
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,860
I don't think that's even what it's about.

190
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,140
It's about theming not about.

191
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,980
So not by time not at the moment of recording but by the time this episode comes out you

192
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,540
will have done your your Orlando stop.

193
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,820
Yeah this is way in event.

194
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,860
We also will have survived the downtown Disney ordeal by the time we're jumping way ahead

195
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,860
here.

196
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,860
Yeah this is a future one.

197
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,860
It's we're different people.

198
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:08,980
Also we are by the time people are hearing this they will have also heard our journey

199
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,180
through another Eddie Murphy vehicle the Haunted Mansion.

200
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,180
Oh good point.

201
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,180
Which is.

202
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,180
We haven't recorded that yet.

203
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:20,620
I am on my second cup of coffee tonight because I have it from the library at home.

204
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:26,380
And you need to watch the clock is ticking before we leave for Chicago and I'm like doing

205
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,380
it on a plane.

206
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,380
Oh no it's library.

207
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,380
It's a library DVD.

208
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,380
If push comes to shove.

209
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,380
Yeah I'll just read it.

210
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,380
Perfect library DVD.

211
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,380
Perfect free.

212
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:38,420
Oh we had a working lunch and right afterwards I walked to the library and got it.

213
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,060
But then that night I went into my backpack and freaked out because I'm like what's why

214
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,980
is there a fucking DVD in here and I pulled it out freaked out.

215
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,980
Oh the Haunted Mansion.

216
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,780
Why did you freak out.

217
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,780
Spooky DVD.

218
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,940
Haunted.

219
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:55,380
Like you know when you're like I kind of know what's in this bag and you feel like.

220
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,180
I would be like oh that's interesting there's a thing in here I didn't know.

221
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,180
Not.

222
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,180
Oh my god.

223
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,660
Spooked by the contents of my own backpack.

224
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,020
All right well I was exaggerating for the sake of you.

225
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,020
All right that's fine.

226
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,500
You didn't jump up in the air you didn't leave a puff of smoke that was in your shape.

227
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,380
No it was more like what the hell.

228
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,380
Your hair stood straight up.

229
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,380
Yeah.

230
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,020
Can I tell an embarrassing anecdote about the Haunted Mansion movie.

231
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,180
Yeah.

232
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,580
So I went to see it.

233
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,980
The Friday it came out.

234
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,260
My high school the theater I would get out early my freshman year of high school I think

235
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:36,420
was when it came out and I had an early final class on Fridays and there was a matinee pricing

236
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:41,460
at the local theater so it would be like if I'm out by lunch I can go see a movie at like

237
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,380
one o'clock and it will only cost me six dollars.

238
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,480
So like whatever the Friday thing was I would I would go see it.

239
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,920
So I went to see Haunted Mansion with my friend Charlie and about halfway through the movie

240
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,080
just about when things were starting to get haunted because there's way too much wind

241
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,080
up in that film.

242
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,000
Yes that was exactly I don't want to spoil for since we still have to do the episode

243
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,680
but truly I don't know if you've watched it yet as we record this but like not yet there

244
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,640
is a yeah there's my wife and I had this big run of time we're like what nothing's happened

245
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,920
it takes it far in our way and it was like a ghost.

246
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,400
Yeah there's no like plot point.

247
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,960
No it's just slow real estate intricacies it's a lot of fucking shoe leather.

248
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
Get rid of it.

249
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,920
It's a lot of real estate bullshit.

250
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:25,480
But I'm sitting there I'm like finally ghost ghouls goblins this shit's about to get good.

251
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,400
And then my phone starts blowing up and I forgot it was my father's birthday.

252
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,200
And I was supposed to meet my family for like an early dinner or whatever.

253
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,640
I don't I don't know what time it was I guess but I was supposed to meet my family to go

254
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
have dinner.

255
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,200
And and so I always forget when my father's birthday is.

256
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,760
Everyone else my family birthdays are in quick succession.

257
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
They're they're very close to each other.

258
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,600
My father's birthday is at the other end of the year and I always forget when it is.

259
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,400
So I always need to check the release date of Haunted Mansion.

260
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,840
When I need to like which is I call in I believe.

261
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,160
Oh yeah I'm putting you on the spot.

262
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,240
Yeah you have to relook it up.

263
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,280
Usually I look it up.

264
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,080
I believe it's November 26 2003.

265
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,160
I'm sorry it is not October.

266
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,640
Why is it not October.

267
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,280
Way late.

268
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,640
Way late.

269
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,240
It was like a Thanksgiving release.

270
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,360
Yeah yeah it was a Thanksgiving release.

271
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,040
So I think it's the 26th.

272
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,560
I know my father's birthday is within that week.

273
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,000
Yeah it's within that span of like between the 22nd and the 29th.

274
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,760
My mom's is just an unmemorable date.

275
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,160
Like my dad's is more like math symmetrical.

276
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,840
So I remember it.

277
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,800
My mom's is an unremarkable set of three numbers.

278
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:42,080
My mother my grandmother my two siblings and I are all born within between January and

279
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,440
March.

280
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,040
So those are like easy to remember because it's like every two weeks another birthday.

281
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:53,600
And my dad is like this like Haunted Mansion loser all the way back in November 26 2003.

282
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,040
Back to paranormal.

283
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,600
That's an amazing statement.

284
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,080
And I have not seen paranormal.

285
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,560
I have no problem with paranormal.

286
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,080
I just did.

287
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,160
It's ignorance on my part.

288
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:08,720
We're my my co-host on Blank Check David Simmons and I are big fans of making lists.

289
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,840
And so we're preparing for next year.

290
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,880
We're going to do our like best of the decade episode.

291
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,840
So I've been like actually running through year by year and trying to call and like

292
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,360
coming up with rough draft lists and nothing is locked in.

293
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,760
But I will say every version I've come up with so far paranormal is in my top 10

294
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,800
period for the decade.

295
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,280
Which you know I would say it's not an unpopular opinion.

296
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,400
It's just an opinion not wildly widely held because I feel like most people have not

297
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,160
seen it.

298
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:38,560
Sure.

299
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,640
But it is for my money the best American animated film of the decade.

300
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,520
Wow.

301
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:43,760
Yeah.

302
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,840
Oh so it potentially is like there's a world where it's on the list and the only

303
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,920
animated film on the list or one of two.

304
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,000
As of now I think it's the only animated film on my list and I'm a big animation fan.

305
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:55,680
Geez.

306
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,200
Are you a Lica fan?

307
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm a huge Lica fan but that's far and away my favorite.

308
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,520
OK.

309
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,920
I love them overall but that was the one for me where I was like oh shit they're

310
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,760
cooking with gas.

311
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:13,680
Aesthetically it's my favorite and I also feel like it is it's tough to talk about

312
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,840
because the thing I like about the movie so much is like half of the way through

313
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,880
you're like oh this is about an entirely different thing than I thought it was.

314
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,480
Whoa.

315
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:23,960
OK.

316
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,280
And not in sort of like a plot twist way but like a thematic like deepening way.

317
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,800
And I think it is about a very weird nuanced thing that very few films try to

318
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,720
tackle let alone family films.

319
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,200
OK.

320
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,600
And for me the moment where I just realized like oh shit this is what this movie is

321
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,480
expounding on.

322
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,080
It kind of blew my mind.

323
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,720
And I think it's about like morally murky shit in a way that like doesn't back

324
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,320
away.

325
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:57,720
In you know I love Pixar but I feel like it is a less tidy package than any other

326
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,160
American animated film I've ever seen in terms of dealing with a really fucking

327
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,920
complicated thing.

328
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,720
Geez.

329
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,040
Wow.

330
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,880
I don't want to over sell it.

331
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,760
I will see it.

332
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,000
I would like to formally apologize on behalf of Scott when he said that Paranorman

333
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,920
is not cinema.

334
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,600
And that it is a theme park ride.

335
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
And that'd be the ultimate compliment for me.

336
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,560
Were you guys offended when Scorsese said that because it was demeaning to theme

337
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,320
park rides?

338
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,440
That occurred to me.

339
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,080
He can say that about Marvel films who gives a shit.

340
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,840
How dare he denigrate the enchanted Tiki Loon.

341
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,400
I was surprised how many people I saw like on like comedians on Twitter going

342
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,240
that theme parks are fun.

343
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,920
Like I don't really like Marvel movies but theme parks are fun.

344
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,560
I was like oh people starting to show their theme parks are good.

345
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,480
Oh right.

346
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,320
I like this.

347
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:47,880
Yeah.

348
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,360
He I mean honestly I was just like yeah yeah he's right and I like all of that.

349
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,520
Our friend Ryan Perez doubled down on the defending Scorsese and like went a

350
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,840
little further and insulting the broad appeal of theme parks and I was a little

351
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,080
like hey he's a friend.

352
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:03,560
Sure.

353
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,080
We'll get in and we'll corner him on.

354
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,320
Yeah let's get him in here and really rough him up.

355
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,000
I don't want it all to be theme parks.

356
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,280
No.

357
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,680
I also want it to be Martin Scorsese movies.

358
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,920
I think that's the valid point and that's why I appreciate him doubling down on

359
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,800
it because he's like no I shouldn't like get fucking like roasted for saying I

360
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,920
don't like these movies.

361
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,600
It's not like he came out and gave like a stump speech.

362
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:29,080
Someone asked him in an interview do you watch Marvel films and he was like not

363
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,400
really.

364
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,440
This is the truth not unlike my paranormal debacle here.

365
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,800
You pull the quote out and it does seem like oh boy that does seem harsh.

366
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,560
If Martin Scorsese like gathered the press and said I have a statement Marvel

367
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,560
films are like it's just something he said during.

368
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,760
I have that problem with like click bait articles in general.

369
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,880
Like it's not as if he like you know what I'm going to do I'm going to shout this

370
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,240
from a hilltop.

371
00:17:53,320 --> 00:18:00,160
No I mean my big takeaway from that quote blowing up the way it did was oh no one

372
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,480
should do interviews ever.

373
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,840
I love interviews like I am such a fan of interviews.

374
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,560
I feel like I grew up reading interviews.

375
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,360
I feel like you guys are probably the same as like we're the same type of obsessive

376
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,960
dork who want to learn everything about the things we love.

377
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,360
Oh yeah.

378
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,040
And the best way to like more valuable than any film school or education is like

379
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,440
really like getting into the one I realized like oh yeah let me get into the

380
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,080
head of a creative person.

381
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,960
I really yeah interview magazine or like in comedy the and here's here's the

382
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,360
kicker and oh yeah.

383
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,640
I said is it great.

384
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,280
Yeah yeah yeah yes.

385
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,440
Very good.

386
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:32,720
Great.

387
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,040
Yeah.

388
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,720
Like I love shit like that.

389
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,480
That's like the cornerstone of podcast and right.

390
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,320
It's not just like oh here are the anecdotes about how this thing got made but

391
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,960
you're like hearing the person speak in their own words whether it's transcribed

392
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,720
or an audio so you're getting like their version of the thing uncut.

393
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,120
Yeah.

394
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,320
I love it as like a medium and I have become increasingly convinced that it is

395
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,200
in no one's best interest to do any interview promoting anything like it just

396
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,600
feels like it nine times out of ten fucks them over.

397
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,160
Well yeah because now especially because in the old like if you go back and look

398
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,680
at magazines with interview like with any music people or actors or directors.

399
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:10,920
Yeah.

400
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,280
In the old days you'll find insane stuff.

401
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:13,800
Insane shit.

402
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,400
No one even talks about it because it was just in a magazine and everyone went huh

403
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:17,960
that's weird.

404
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,120
Put the magazine aside.

405
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,160
But like every all these film places are like Martin Scorsese talking about Marvel

406
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,720
is yeah make everyone nuts and they're right.

407
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,000
It did make everyone nuts.

408
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,240
Yeah.

409
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,040
He didn't think too other than going like I'm annoyed that there's too many of

410
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,200
these movies in the theater.

411
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:33,520
Right.

412
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,200
He didn't really think much past that.

413
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,120
But some of it was all like him saying you know that these these movies have to

414
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,200
appeal to ages eight to 80 international audience.

415
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:44,440
Yes.

416
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,760
The stuff that theme park stuff has to do.

417
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,160
Right.

418
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:53,760
Which is a different skill and process than making like Bob and Carol and Ted and

419
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,200
Alice like making a grounded like.

420
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,160
Which is the nuance of what he was trying to say that got totally lost which is

421
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,480
like he's not saying that they're bullshit.

422
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:02,960
Yeah.

423
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,640
He's saying that they're not cinema in the way that he considers cinema but like

424
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:13,560
that's that's not as much a judgment of quality as it is sort of like a reflection

425
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,120
of process and their role in like society.

426
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,080
You know.

427
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:25,000
Well I think the other thing is that is bad about the maybe wider bigger picture

428
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,200
is bad about the Marvel movies is what you were saying about Katzenberg like

429
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:34,960
milking stuff is yes when people saw these interconnected giant movies universe

430
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,800
movies every idiot tried to do like dark universe.

431
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,840
These giant app and you have to have so much like as much marketing as production

432
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,360
budget it's just like huge you have to have so much money to get something made

433
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:48,800
now.

434
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,280
And and you know to to I don't want to get off the tangents but to just re center

435
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,000
some for a moment before we go back to tangent the ogre in the room Shrek for me

436
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,560
is a perfect example of that where it's like Shrek the first one is like doesn't

437
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:09,280
hold up great kind of innocuous but my my sort of perception of Shrek is so

438
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,640
negative now because everything Shrek rot and not just the sequels but just you

439
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:19,760
got like 10 years of every non Pixar CGI movie being like one arched eyebrow like

440
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,040
pop culture reference.

441
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,200
The main character looks like the actor playing the dream work space.

442
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,600
All that shit and then like every other studio starts their own animation studio

443
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,840
trying to copy dream works like that becomes the template that everyone's like

444
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,000
these movies that we don't think about anymore that don't exist.

445
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,560
It also seems like that's where we went from.

446
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,360
We've certainly talked about animated films veering to celebrity voices who know

447
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,960
who who cares about who cares if it's a celebrity or not.

448
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,320
But anyway how Robin Williams opened the floodgates on that.

449
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,560
But there was a time OK so even still Robin and then it becomes maybe there's

450
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,760
one big star star and then the rest are very good voice actors Shrek is where it

451
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,880
becomes the big the list.

452
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,240
Those are four titans.

453
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:10,040
I mean the main poster was just 90 percent white text Meyers Murphy Diaz Lithgow

454
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,360
and then Shrek at the bottom.

455
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,680
There were little photos of their faces but the main Shrek poster was just name

456
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,480
name name name title credit block.

457
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:24,920
And that leads us to today where there's like two separate stints in each trailer

458
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,360
where they were like here's now here's our nine celebrities.

459
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,400
And then here's our nine more celebrities.

460
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,960
I think that's sort of a sub issue I'm realizing within the celebrity stunt

461
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,080
casting is like we need to listen to this needs to be fucking crazy.

462
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,840
What child Vito Martha Stewart Dr.

463
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,640
Cornell West.

464
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,880
But now it's that weird thing also of like right.

465
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,440
It's like OK so there was like the occasional like Robin Williams stunt

466
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,000
casting.

467
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,840
And then there are things like even in the 90s when Katzenberg is like starting

468
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,960
to put bigger stars in Disney movies there are things where you're like oh right.

469
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,600
Mel Gibson was John Smith and Pocahontas.

470
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,040
Yeah.

471
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,720
It was not really a selling point and no one remembers that the chicken and

472
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,360
chicken run.

473
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,560
Those are the heist ones.

474
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,960
But then like those movies like everyone else in the cast is like chicken run is

475
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,200
just like British sitcom actors.

476
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:15,560
Yeah.

477
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,600
You know like the rest of the cast of Pocahontas is like voiceover actors or

478
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,720
like theater actors.

479
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,680
And then you get to like you'll have this weird balance where it's like hunchback

480
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,560
of Notre Dame is like Demi Moore and Kevin Kline who are like big at that

481
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,760
moment and then Tom Holtz.

482
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,120
Or you're like Tom Holtz is the lead of this film 15 years after Al Mudeus.

483
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,280
Why is that him.

484
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,560
He's good in it.

485
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,080
He is.

486
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,880
There was like still a balance of like oh let's get people who are like the right

487
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,120
person for the role.

488
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,080
Or let's get like David Odgen Steyer who's like a voiceover pro.

489
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,280
And then some big like 90s movie stars.

490
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,440
And then Shrek is just full stop like it's four huge names.

491
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,160
The movie sold on their names.

492
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,360
The trailers have the footage of them in the booth holding the one headphone to

493
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,160
their ear like it's We Are The World.

494
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,680
Now it's Nen.

495
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,080
But now none of this is a bad thing I don't think because I don't think any of

496
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,160
them are phoning it in.

497
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,680
No no.

498
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,400
Clearly Myers not for going I need to re record like he's invested.

499
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,920
I think they're all very good in it.

500
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,360
But it certainly leads to no shit.

501
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,360
This SNL guy has like an hour and a half between movies.

502
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,120
Let's grab him.

503
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,640
Let's add him to the list.

504
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:25,840
All right.

505
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,800
Throw him in the wood pile.

506
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,960
Shark Tale is the nadir of it for me where I just remember the poster being like

507
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:37,600
18 names including Mr Scorsese where it's like oh it's a blowfish that looks

508
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,000
like Scorsese it has the eyebrows.

509
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,680
The shark looks like De Niro it has the mole on the face like the fish looks like

510
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,120
Angelina Jolie she has the lips.

511
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,240
The Will Smith fish has the ears like everyone's like fish is some weird Mr

512
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:57,360
Limpit abomination of their like persona mapped on to some sort of sea creature.

513
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,960
And everyone's just kind of doing their own voice because the whole bit is like

514
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,440
just do your fucking thing.

515
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,640
Do the thing that you do.

516
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,320
And it's like it's like fucking you know it's just cashing in on the brands that

517
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:09,960
we all know.

518
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:15,440
Now I feel like when you do the 18 names in like the opening you know in the

519
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,200
trailer it's like largely like wait that was Rami Malek but he's got a German

520
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,960
accent.

521
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,840
What do you gain by hiring Rami Malek to do an accent different.

522
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,880
Like now I feel like it's big stars wanting to be like but I don't want to do

523
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,280
my own voice.

524
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,000
I really want to develop a character for this.

525
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:32,800
Yeah.

526
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:41,960
Is it like I think it's also like in the way like like I remember feeling like

527
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,800
doing digital like web video things going like why is there why are we even doing

528
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,600
web videos promoting this dumb thing.

529
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,480
That's what it doesn't it doesn't matter.

530
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,240
It's to show some boardroom guy and we're doing a internet video.

531
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,360
OK very good.

532
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:01,280
I think that the the litany of stars is is to show a Logan Rowe Roy kind of

533
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,640
person all the way up the flagpole.

534
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,680
And you see we have the very good.

535
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,640
Well that will bring in.

536
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,560
It's not for audience or even the makers of the film thinking it's a good idea.

537
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,440
Well I think there's one area in which it is for the audience in a weird perverse

538
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,120
kind of way.

539
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:17,800
You know what.

540
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,200
No it's not even really for the audience.

541
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,640
I think the other element to it is and Katzenberg is the first guy to really

542
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,160
weaponize this because like famously that the Robin Williams Disney falling out is

543
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,040
him being like I don't want to be promoted.

544
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,280
I just want to do the film and like Katzenberg slapping his name everywhere and

545
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,320
putting him in the trailers and everything and him being like fuck this.

546
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,160
This is fucked up.

547
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,920
I was just trying to like be a part of the Disney legacy or whatever.

548
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,240
But like by Shrek it's like oh they're on the red carpet like they're doing late

549
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,240
night talk shows like they're promoting a voiceover role as if it were their live

550
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:51,960
action movie.

551
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,440
Oh yeah.

552
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:53,800
Right.

553
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,360
Maybe that is Shrek like almost the first.

554
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:03,600
I feel like that's a turning point because even like it's it is truly my favorite

555
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,800
movie of all time.

556
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:11,920
But a beginning of the end moment is the Toy Story 2 poster is Hanks Allen Toy

557
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,520
Story 2.

558
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,560
Was Toy Story 1 not?

559
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,320
It was not.

560
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,160
It was like no names above the title.

561
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,280
And like Toy Story 2 was like two last names.

562
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,480
Because it was a risk for them.

563
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,360
That first one was like could have been a lie.

564
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,640
If that tanked like they wouldn't want to be associated with it.

565
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:33,040
And it was like Hanks before both of his Oscars and Allen like Home Improvement

566
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,920
had just premiered but wasn't like dominant yet.

567
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,400
Oh wow.

568
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,480
And for both of them it was like this is kind of corny like we don't want to do a

569
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,440
musical like they like talk about how they had to be sold on like this isn't

570
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,320
going to be like.

571
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,600
You recorded.

572
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,280
Your grandfathers.

573
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,080
Yeah sure sure.

574
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,760
And they recorded versions that were was like where things were bad.

575
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,000
And they're like maybe we don't want to be part of it.

576
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,520
Which ties directly into the Shrek stuff.

577
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,040
Should we before we get into the meat of Shrek 4D should we talk about.

578
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,240
And there's so much to talk about.

579
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,280
Well sure.

580
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:07,240
Well as usual the story behind it is more interesting for sure in this case

581
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:13,400
because the genesis of Shrek period I had forgotten that it was like a picture

582
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:13,760
book.

583
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,680
Which rules.

584
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,920
It's a great book.

585
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,240
It's William Stig.

586
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,320
Stig.

587
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,000
Stig.

588
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,000
Stig.

589
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,280
Yeah.

590
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,360
He's like one of those guys if you if you like if Jason you hold up a picture of

591
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,120
it if you have like a photo of it you'll recognize his art style as like he wrote

592
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,960
like kind of like the weird like edgy children's books.

593
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,480
Like he had this really kind of like scribble like almost like Roz Chast art

594
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,000
style and his books were like a little subversive and the whole hook to Shrek

595
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,440
was like it's like a fucking it's a fairy tale book about shitty things.

596
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,160
It's like an ugly monster who lives in a shitty place and everything's bad for

597
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,160
him and the book is really dark.

598
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,120
Yeah.

599
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,880
Oh there you go.

600
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,040
Oh wow.

601
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,160
Geez that's and that's pretty like specific and odd and grotesque.

602
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,480
Right.

603
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,160
Which is not the rounded off dreamers.

604
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,800
They took the color and the ears.

605
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,440
Yes.

606
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,440
Not the clothes.

607
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,680
The clothes are very bold and very 90s in fact.

608
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,440
So that came out in 89.

609
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,960
Spielberg options it for Amblin in 1990.

610
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,800
That long ago?

611
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:18,240
And the first names attached for it Bill Murray as Shrek and Steve Martin as

612
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:18,880
Donkey.

613
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,600
Whoa.

614
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,440
And they were debating at different points.

615
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,920
Is it like live action with like a couple CGI characters?

616
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,960
They thought about doing a dinosaur style where the characters were all animated

617
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,760
but all the plates were live action.

618
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,600
I want that now by the way.

619
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,800
I think that's still possible.

620
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,040
We have to find a reason to talk dinosaur.

621
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:39,880
Well there's the ride.

622
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,640
It's so weird.

623
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,360
Yeah.

624
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,400
I was playing this game the other day which was now that Disney is just like

625
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,680
the most dominant box office force and they almost never miss and like a miss

626
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,040
for them is like solo making 200 million dollars domestic.

627
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:04,160
It's funny to go back from like 97 to 2008 and look at Disney's box office by

628
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:09,360
year and you're like oh 2000 Disney's highest grossing film was dinosaur.

629
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,480
Geez.

630
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,160
A flop.

631
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,320
Yeah.

632
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,080
A flop.

633
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:18,640
Today and today we lived them just tweeting out images of stuff that's going

634
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,320
to be on Disney plus and it's the same where we started recording.

635
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,120
It worked.

636
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,920
It fucking worked.

637
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,160
That's all everyone talked about on Twitter all day.

638
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,360
Even if they were mad they talked about it.

639
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:33,760
Of a lot of dog shit like so many years of so much dog shit.

640
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,040
So many oddball live action.

641
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,520
I would like look through year by year and you'd be like they have one movie out of

642
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,880
eight that did well and stood the test of time.

643
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,120
And you go through.

644
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,840
Bring down the house.

645
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,720
You're like that's like their highest grossing film of 2003 or whatever or like

646
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,960
1997 I think their highest grossing film is ransom.

647
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,280
Wow.

648
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,080
Yeah but it out grossed hunchback of Notre Dame.

649
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,040
Yeah those those movies are like bomb.

650
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,440
Yeah.

651
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,440
Disney animated films going under 100 million.

652
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:04,880
Yes.

653
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,520
That's that weird period where it's like Hercules and hunchback all do like 96.

654
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,360
Geez.

655
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:10,640
Wow.

656
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,760
Same for the part now that the parks are all these.

657
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,720
Well I guess we dipped a little bit this year but like you know like mega properties

658
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,320
you know you know attendance or like you know entrance fees go up and up and up.

659
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:30,200
And like late 90s early 2000s with you know your superstar limos and bad California

660
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,880
adventure and light magic and all that shit.

661
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,320
Yeah it was like it's hard to even imagine.

662
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,320
Disney being shitty.

663
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,680
Sort of risk proof to an extent that like the worst they can do is like the nut

664
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,040
cracker in the four realms.

665
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,640
Sure.

666
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,640
That's probably the last time we're going to get a movie like that for a decade.

667
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,120
I don't think they'll even take that much of a risk again.

668
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,360
And yeah if something falls through the credit they will of course correct and

669
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,320
like that's the end of that.

670
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,520
We're not going to try five more.

671
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,120
It's never going to be something that isn't a pre-established brand.

672
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,880
Well Jason brought up the point of like now they have Disney plus to like get

673
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,960
metrics totally.

674
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,960
So as soon as like the Tim Allen shaggy dog does very well.

675
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,240
Yeah.

676
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,160
Disney plus maybe there'll be a new Tim Allen shaggy dog if we're lucky.

677
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,680
And we'll never get to see it.

678
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,040
We'll never get to see the metric like in the way that like Nielsen ratings are

679
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,200
reasonably public.

680
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:26,240
It's so like oh god I don't even care as someone who could work on this shit.

681
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,080
I just want to know like what are people watching.

682
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,560
I'm just so morbidly curious.

683
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,120
It is the most bizarre thing to be like for years everything was running off of

684
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,680
the Nielsen ratings which are like the least accurate system in the world.

685
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,800
Grandma and grandpa have to take a booklet.

686
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,200
Right.

687
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,840
And write down in the booklet.

688
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,320
Yes.

689
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,040
Like when I've spoken to people who like were Nielsen families and they were like

690
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,080
at a certain point we just stopped doing it.

691
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,440
We stopped logging it or we just hit random buttons because it was just like I

692
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,320
don't want to I want to flip through and see shit whatever.

693
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:06,080
And now it's like the data has never been more precise and we don't know any of it.

694
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,960
We just know that every Netflix movie gets 30 million views in the first 24 hours.

695
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,040
Every Netflix film is the most popular film of all time.

696
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:19,360
Every Adam Sandler movie decimates 10 pre- Adam Sandler movies we all like.

697
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,400
Not just Gone With the Wind.

698
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:28,240
Paul Rudd doing Us But Funny is gonna blow away any other Paul Rudd project.

699
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,920
Just like all these things it's like yeah it's very odd.

700
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,080
And also like I'll say you know a couple of years ago Disney was like maybe we

701
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,480
need to go back to making like lower budget stuff again and like original like

702
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,400
family comedies and this and that and they produced a bunch and then all of them

703
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,040
just went weirdly quiet.

704
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,440
Like I know people worked on them and I was like whatever happened in that movie.

705
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,400
They'd be like I don't know.

706
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,400
And now a bunch of those are the things.

707
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,560
Premiering day one at Disney Plus.

708
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,440
Or those are all tricks.

709
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,080
Or are they for the next year.

710
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,960
That's what happened.

711
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,960
A lot of like that Anna Kendrick like Christmas movie.

712
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,480
The Bill Hader one.

713
00:33:59,480 --> 00:33:59,960
Oh yeah.

714
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,480
Was shot like two years ago.

715
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,480
I believe Bill Hader was not a co-lead at the time.

716
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,680
They upped him post a train wreck.

717
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,200
And yeah.

718
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:08,600
Very.

719
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,240
And yeah.

720
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:09,680
Yeah.

721
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,040
But like that was one where they were like we want to get back in the business of

722
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,920
making like a 60 million dollar live action comedy.

723
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,160
Like low risk you know like high upside.

724
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,840
And then they watched all of them and they were like not worth the energy.

725
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,880
Keep it on a shelf.

726
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,400
We'll have a streaming service in two years.

727
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,000
There's an Adam Devine Magic Camp comedy.

728
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,320
That was shot three years ago maybe.

729
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,640
That's written by Steve Martin or co-written by Steve Martin.

730
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,640
Based on when he was a magician at Disneyland.

731
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,520
What.

732
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,360
That's just been sitting on a shelf.

733
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,520
I believe Jeffrey Tambor is also in it in the mentor role.

734
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,000
Which is maybe another reason.

735
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,920
That far after.

736
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,880
It's in the vault.

737
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,440
Geez.

738
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,440
We're post transparent finale where he's been killed off.

739
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,240
Is this how we finally get the day the clown died.

740
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:53,680
I cried.

741
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,000
Is this how we cried.

742
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,240
Yeah.

743
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,080
Right.

744
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,480
OK.

745
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,920
Somebody posted that joke on Twitter.

746
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,240
It was.

747
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,080
Oh shit.

748
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,400
Yeah.

749
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,040
Oh really.

750
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,600
Well that and this all happened six weeks ago.

751
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,680
Yeah I know.

752
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,080
Everyone's like wow this is current.

753
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,440
What a Disney plus talk.

754
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:07,920
I know.

755
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,880
It's out right now.

756
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,680
We're listening to people.

757
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,480
Now we're living in it.

758
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,360
Well here's the thing I noticed I want to see if you guys picked up on this because I'm

759
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,480
sure you scanned that thread as thoroughly as I was like the fucking Wi-Fi I need to.

760
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,760
I can't give up.

761
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,680
I need to hit the last tweet in the thread.

762
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,280
200.

763
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,400
But a couple of the old Fox movies that they've now.

764
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:25,760
Oh yeah.

765
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,520
Hired they slapped the Disney logo on it but not all of them.

766
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:35,480
So like in the Twitter thread like classic miracle on 34th Street was Disney's a

767
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,000
miracle on 34th Street.

768
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,760
Oh my God.

769
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:37,960
Yeah.

770
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,600
I saw that.

771
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,000
Home alone wasn't.

772
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,720
It's weird because it feels like that somebody go through it and go which movies feel

773
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,320
like we would have made them.

774
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:46,840
Right.

775
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,360
Like there's almost some like determination of like well miracle on 34th Street so

776
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:55,040
wholesome and wonderful and home alone is fun but it's a little too you know.

777
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:00,160
Apparently a lot of like their weird Netherlands test with Disney plus was it the

778
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:00,720
Netherlands.

779
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:06,200
Yes they were testing it in the Netherlands because someone was posting walkthroughs

780
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,760
of the navigation.

781
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,240
It went up only in the Netherlands like two months ago and there was a bunch of weird

782
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:15,800
shit on there and it felt like it was them being like what breaks the Disney brand.

783
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,600
So something like Adventures in Babysitting which was like Touchstone but now is a

784
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,760
little too raunchy.

785
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,600
They were like but we remade it for the Disney Channel so it's kind of nice to have

786
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,640
both of them on there.

787
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,800
And it was like up there and then gone 72 hours later.

788
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,840
And it felt like there was Adventures in Babysitting not going to make the cuts.

789
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,360
That's what it seems like.

790
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:35,920
Whoa.

791
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,720
They're just filtering and they're being like what isn't Disney.

792
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,440
Like what doesn't pass.

793
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,160
This is funny games.

794
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:43,680
You're out.

795
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,680
Funny games.

796
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,080
U.S.

797
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,600
remake.

798
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:45,960
Right.

799
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,760
Staying.

800
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,240
Yeah.

801
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:47,840
Like Disney.

802
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,040
This is like Disney legend Jack Kirby.

803
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:50,920
Yes.

804
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,720
So it's like rewriting like OK that's comfortable.

805
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:53,960
Right.

806
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:59,440
Now he's been retconned into our museum is totally going to be retconned as a Disney

807
00:36:59,440 --> 00:36:59,840
property.

808
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,000
Yeah.

809
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,400
Yeah.

810
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,520
And like Home Alone will as well which is why they've already said they're going to do

811
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:03,840
the news.

812
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,520
They're making a new Home Alone on Disney Plus.

813
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,520
Like they've identified the Fox properties.

814
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,080
The Dire of a Wimpy Kid I think is another one where they were like this is Fox and it

815
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,160
feels like Disney and we can just juice it up.

816
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,160
This is very very odd.

817
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,520
It's very weaponized memory hole.

818
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,280
Yes.

819
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:20,880
Yes.

820
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,000
Yes.

821
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:26,680
Like we will in like five years we will just think Disney made Miracle on 34th Street.

822
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,920
I saw someone tweet this and it was either terrifying or a perfect Twitter joke but

823
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:38,760
someone tweeted like it's crazy reading that thread having evidence for the thing I've

824
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,480
been trying to tell people for so long.

825
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:48,240
Colon Disney was making largely horse shit for 40 years and was constantly on the brink

826
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,200
of like going under like between like 50 and 90.

827
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:51,600
Yeah.

828
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:56,920
It was like so up and down and they were like how few movies between 50 and 90 are

829
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,680
like really canonical you know.

830
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,040
Yeah.

831
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:05,560
And someone responded either with a perfect joke or the most terrifying like Mandela

832
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,320
effect possible saying what are you talking about.

833
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,160
Star Wars was in 1977.

834
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,120
No.

835
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,480
Whoa.

836
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,320
Yeah.

837
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,960
Either way is interesting.

838
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,280
Right.

839
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:16,680
Good joke.

840
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,480
If it's a joke.

841
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,000
Right.

842
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:24,120
It's either you get the Mark Twain Prize for humor this year or humanity is over.

843
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,760
I don't know.

844
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:32,560
I mean that that's sort of like realizing that yeah there's a lot of garbage in 50 to

845
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,720
90 makes the stuff coming out of imagineering that more miraculous.

846
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,200
Yes.

847
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,840
That more incredible that the epic is when they're making their worst movies.

848
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,200
Yeah.

849
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,840
That's their most of the creative juice in the company is going towards the theme

850
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:53,320
parks at the time where it's all the live action movies that showed up in that thread

851
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,440
where you're like what.

852
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,160
Yeah.

853
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,800
How many Bill Cosby comedies did you make like a big Thunder Mountain occurs to me

854
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,040
too.

855
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,760
I'm sure like the two years surrounding Big Thunder Mountain were all horseshit for

856
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,760
Disney movies but then like iconic perfect right.

857
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,360
Yeah.

858
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:09,760
Yeah.

859
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,320
Crazy.

860
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:14,680
The one that's in my head from Twitter is that they won't leave my head even though

861
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,640
this was six weeks ago.

862
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:20,880
Now the there was a Disney Channel movie that I guess they have determined is Disney.

863
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,240
This will remain Disney.

864
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,320
And somebody tweeted this just with just the tree was just oh no.

865
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:32,240
And the and it was a like basketball player a twin girl basketball player movie

866
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,440
called Double Team.

867
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:42,280
Nobody thought the double team was a problem even then when it came out.

868
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:43,880
This wasn't OK.

869
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,120
This that's not a new phrase.

870
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,760
That wasn't OK in 2002 either.

871
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,600
It's not the Van Damme Rodman movie double team.

872
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,360
No no.

873
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:50,720
Right.

874
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,360
Which is great.

875
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,320
Which is great.

876
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,160
It ends in a big like the fucking the Roman Coliseum explodes.

877
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,600
Oh yeah.

878
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:02,400
There's a bunch of like soda machines in it and the branded soda machines go flying

879
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,040
at the camera.

880
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,480
What.

881
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:03,920
Yeah.

882
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,200
It's really funky.

883
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,840
And Mickey Rourke is the villain in that.

884
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,360
Is that right?

885
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:07,920
I think so.

886
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,480
Yeah.

887
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,080
I believe so.

888
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,360
I haven't seen it in a while.

889
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:10,760
Yeah.

890
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,240
Gosh.

891
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,400
Mickey Rourke when he was in his Disney between 1950 and 1990 period.

892
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:15,800
Yes.

893
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,160
Yeah.

894
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,720
Who owns double team.

895
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,920
Does Disney own double team.

896
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,360
Oh my.

897
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,800
Double double teamed in double team.

898
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,760
Team up.

899
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,480
Let me look it up.

900
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,240
OK.

901
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,040
But here's another link.

902
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:32,880
It's fascinating then that I feel like so much of sort of the cultural knowledge of

903
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:38,080
Disney becomes the theme parks becomes like it's a small world becomes like jokes

904
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,160
about like expensive food and whatever.

905
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:40,520
Sure.

906
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,160
Like that's when people are doing like Disney humor.

907
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,200
It's so often theme park based and merchandise based.

908
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:47,720
Yeah.

909
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,960
And it's not until the 90s then when you like OK they've revived the princess thing.

910
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,400
There are new tropes here and that's combined like the white washing of the fairy

911
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,760
tales with the theme park sort of price stuff.

912
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,600
Oh sure.

913
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,680
Which then what is Disney in terms of pop like the cynical pop culture.

914
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:10,520
Because Shrek is all about cashing in on that cynical pop culture perception of Disney.

915
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,280
Oh yes.

916
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:11,720
Yeah.

917
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,800
It is so much Katzenberg being like I'm I've defacted.

918
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,200
I'm like an expat.

919
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:17,520
Yeah.

920
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,800
I have a chip on my shoulder and now I can finally make the jokes that everyone else

921
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,480
has been making about me.

922
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,040
Sure.

923
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,480
I can do itch and scratchy land.

924
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,200
Right.

925
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:26,680
Yeah.

926
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,120
Now that I'm at this ruggedly independent I do what I want.

927
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,760
But can I make it a family film.

928
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,960
Like can I have my cake and eat it too.

929
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,400
Like can I do the jokes that make all the adults go like yeah yeah totally.

930
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,040
Disney is fucked up.

931
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,400
Also sell a bunch of dolls.

932
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:49,120
Opens with like it says stand in for Tinkerbell almost getting eaten by a frog and then

933
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:54,440
it ends with that same fairy getting shot out of the screen into a speaker and the

934
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:02,000
same gimmick as in Philhar Magic with Donald Duck's little seat like legs waggling around.

935
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,560
The fake Tinkerbell is like sort of.

936
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,000
Yeah I forgot that was in.

937
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,040
This is a thing with me.

938
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,720
I forgot what the four D's were because you can watch water.

939
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,560
Yeah pretty much.

940
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,800
I mean that's the only like sort of like theater environmental thing like that.

941
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,440
Well in the seats there's a lot of like a lot of seats.

942
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,160
She's on a bumpy road.

943
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,000
You're on a bumpy road.

944
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,880
And then and there's a rat gag.

945
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,320
Yes.

946
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,000
Which I think we all hate.

947
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:27,840
They did the honey.

948
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,200
I shrunk the audience.

949
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:29,600
Yeah.

950
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,400
And the ankles.

951
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:30,920
Yeah.

952
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,400
You don't get poked in the back though like bug do you.

953
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,120
I don't think so.

954
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,520
I feel like something like something does happen on the seat.

955
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,360
Am I wrong.

956
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,720
I feel there's a lot of carriage riding and I remember a lot of smells like I

957
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,160
remember that being the one sort of redeeming aspect of Shrek 4D was like

958
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:50,040
they were really kind of because even I was rewatching it on Netflix.

959
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,160
The weird form it exists in.

960
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:57,520
The yester world YouTube channel pointed out this is the one theme park ride you

961
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,800
can watch on Netflix.

962
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,200
Right.

963
00:42:59,240 --> 00:42:59,840
Yes.

964
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,960
Because even like you have like oh like Back to the Future I'd like on the

965
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,400
Blu Ray box set but it's like presented in a context of like here's like a time

966
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,000
capsule of this one element of this thing.

967
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:11,480
Yes.

968
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,600
And this is an example of like they fucking broadcast this on television.

969
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,320
They sold it multiple times in home media.

970
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,160
They sold it to other theme parks.

971
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:20,400
Yes.

972
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:26,520
This was at multiple universal theme parks and also at what are they called movie

973
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,840
worlds Warner Brothers movie world Germany and Australia movie park in Germany.

974
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,480
Yeah.

975
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:38,640
It is I have to say it is no matter that despite being oddly also at a Warner

976
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:43,240
Brothers park and other parks it is no match for the most horrid out attraction

977
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,240
in all of theme parks.

978
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,000
Sponge Bob Squarepants in 4D.

979
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:49,840
This is a.

980
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,080
This replaced.

981
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:51,880
Oh that's right.

982
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,400
Movie.

983
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,200
Yeah.

984
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,200
Oh wait movie park Germany.

985
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:54,480
Yeah.

986
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,360
Let me just say really fast because I didn't really I was in my head that like

987
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,480
things just being really really tossed off to other parks.

988
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,800
So that's like that's Sponge Bob thing.

989
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,680
Then I looked it up.

990
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,720
Sponge Bob Squarepants in 4D has all told in its history played at 42 different

991
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:13,840
locations at Six Flags parks at Paramount parks and aquariums at museums at zoos

992
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,640
at Madame Tussauds at the Excalibur in Las Vegas.

993
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,040
Wow.

994
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,560
I assume there's porn booths somewhere where one of the options is Sponge Bob.

995
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:22,800
Yeah.

996
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,200
I've been I feel like to a weird amount of Six Flags parks that have it and it's

997
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,960
always anomalous because it's like you have no other like Sponge Bob Nickelodeon

998
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,840
presence you don't deal with them.

999
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:38,800
The Paramount parks did have Paramount via com did work was in the Paramount

1000
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,360
parks for a long time Nickelodeon was in those parks for a long time.

1001
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,120
And that makes sense.

1002
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,720
It was built originally for that.

1003
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,520
Yes.

1004
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,520
But then at a certain point it became like Sponge Bob has just like never dipped.

1005
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,720
It has only grown.

1006
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,400
It lasts generations like it still plays.

1007
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,000
So it becomes this safe bet.

1008
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:03,560
If you have some if you got burned building a 4D theater at your like Six Flags

1009
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:10,080
franchise or movie world and you're like I did fucking robots 4DX you know like I

1010
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,480
did an original story open season and smell a vision.

1011
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,320
Right.

1012
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,280
And now like Sponge Bob is a safe bet.

1013
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,520
Like I'm not going to replace this in 18 months.

1014
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,160
Oh sure sure.

1015
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:20,720
Yes.

1016
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,320
It'll get dimmer and dimmer.

1017
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:22,960
Right.

1018
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,480
It's impossible to look at but people will come in.

1019
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,840
That is a bet that I think Warner Brothers movie world may should have taken because

1020
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:37,040
there Shrek 4D replaced Marvin the Martian in 4D or 3D.

1021
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,680
Marvin the Martian in 3D it ran for eight years.

1022
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,360
Yeah.

1023
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:46,520
Then Shrek lasted only five years and it was replaced by Journey to the Center of

1024
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,680
the Earth 4D Adventure.

1025
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,760
Oh yeah.

1026
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:54,320
That's this really bleak thing where a bunch of theme parks once 3D like studio

1027
00:45:54,360 --> 00:46:00,480
film releases started becoming like more prevalent would just take like a show reel.

1028
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:06,160
They'd take like a 10 minute section of a wide released 3D movie put it in their 4D

1029
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:12,440
theater and just show you a thing you could have seen at AMC with a couple extra effects.

1030
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,360
Well this is we're living this currently with you know Star Wars Path of the Jedi

1031
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,320
and this junk that they fill all of the empty theaters with that used to be teaming

1032
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,840
with 3D films Disney parks.

1033
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,200
At least Phil R. Magic is in there now.

1034
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,920
Yeah there's finally a God all those they have like maleficent previews and all that

1035
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,000
shit. Oh my God.

1036
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,640
I mean I just want to contextualize like this is a trilogy obviously we are completing

1037
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,760
a trilogy here.

1038
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,960
Right but there could be other trilogy.

1039
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,640
There'll be other trilogy.

1040
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:47,680
Right for me you know my my sort of role on podcast the ride I want it to be a sort

1041
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:51,160
of loosely connected series of interlocking trilogies.

1042
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:51,840
I love it.

1043
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:52,440
I love it.

1044
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,880
A series within the series.

1045
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,280
A series within the series.

1046
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,880
We got a lot of them going now.

1047
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,960
Oh and thank you again for announcing it at PTR 23.

1048
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,760
It's very delightful.

1049
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,000
I got to say you asked me to do the video.

1050
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,400
I was happy to help.

1051
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:09,320
I you know stepped away from a very busy you know career.

1052
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,040
Flicked on the fluorescent lights in your kitchen.

1053
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,240
Not even in the hallway outside my girlfriend's apartment.

1054
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:20,280
Because she was on a business call and I was like don't mind me.

1055
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,400
Couple power players.

1056
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:21,640
Right.

1057
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,720
Record seven takes of me pretending to be Zachary Levi.

1058
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,520
Oh yes.

1059
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,760
Announcing nerd HQ.

1060
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,880
I love that.

1061
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,680
You asked me to do it like day of.

1062
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,600
I was happy to do it.

1063
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,360
I sent it to you.

1064
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,800
You were like thanks.

1065
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:37,680
And then the episode comes out a week later and I was sitting there listening and you

1066
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,560
started to almost say it and I was like wait a second is he going.

1067
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,200
No he's not.

1068
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:48,280
And I truly I got full body chills at you in a sort of tossed off way going well yeah.

1069
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:48,960
Yeah why not.

1070
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:49,280
OK.

1071
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:49,600
Yeah.

1072
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,240
Well I'm going to say he is a podcast the right legend.

1073
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,040
Oh that's right.

1074
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:58,120
I forgot we haven't seen you since we made since a technicality made you a podcast.

1075
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,360
I was chills.

1076
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:05,800
I was I was walking around a five below and I started beaming the hairs on my neck.

1077
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,400
We're standing up and no one else could.

1078
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:12,560
I was like I want to grab someone and go do you know what just happened.

1079
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,960
I've been inducted.

1080
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,960
I forgot we haven't addressed this.

1081
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:16,720
Yeah.

1082
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,000
Forced by a slideshow.

1083
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:19,520
Yeah.

1084
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,760
Worst for me.

1085
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,080
We did it we could have objected.

1086
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:22,720
We didn't object.

1087
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,240
No the setup was there was a table and I was running the computer right.

1088
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,560
It was like just that our arms reach for every time I had to really lean in.

1089
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,440
Yes I think I feel like I hit hit it twice right.

1090
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,840
The button twice you went past Choco to me.

1091
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,000
And I ended up sneaking my way into that designation.

1092
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,360
That show was chaos.

1093
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,520
That was like preparing for the show.

1094
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,840
Yeah I was joking.

1095
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:51,960
We were at a bar for like my birthday recently and someone went oh how was your.

1096
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,640
You guys did a show in Anaheim right.

1097
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,560
I was like yeah it was great.

1098
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,880
Putting it together was chaos.

1099
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,360
We were Jerry Reagan stuff on the ground.

1100
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,080
Hurry go.

1101
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:01,800
We had a table.

1102
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:05,800
I watched your whole video until it was playing and I got a sense of it.

1103
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,760
Like it worked great.

1104
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,640
He's wearing a forky hat.

1105
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,600
It's fine.

1106
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,880
Yeah it is.

1107
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,120
Welcome to PTR legend.

1108
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,840
Even you saying it again I just got chills again.

1109
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,960
To a PTR legend.

1110
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,440
Such such an honor.

1111
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:23,280
I do want to say though I feel like it didn't happen because she was the guest on the episode.

1112
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:33,080
But I feel weird being inducted and Jenny not being in because I feel like as a fan first I'm like that's clearly the best running guest you have on the show.

1113
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:36,720
I would go to go to go to be in the larger conversation.

1114
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,960
But for me it's inarguably Jenny is like the fourth good boy.

1115
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:41,480
Wow.

1116
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:49,720
You were both though the people yelled at us the most on the internet mega-foe and it's like have them on the show.

1117
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,240
Oh really.

1118
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,040
Jenny Nicholson and Griffin knew that.

1119
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:52,520
Yeah.

1120
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:58,520
I mean look I'm happy to be in the same general zip code but Jenny's at a different level for me.

1121
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:58,920
Sure.

1122
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:04,360
She has the experience and the insights and I just want to say I as a fan will be angry if she's not inducted next year.

1123
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,040
She will be inducted I'm sure.

1124
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,080
I'm just saying you're selling yourself short.

1125
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,720
I wouldn't do that.

1126
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,360
You're up there.

1127
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,080
Once again I'm happy to be in there.

1128
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:17,440
So we'll do it in the way most inconvenient to when we could have done it with her right there.

1129
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:17,600
Right.

1130
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,880
We will do it in some.

1131
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,680
Yeah she'll be somewhere else and then she'll find out from a third party.

1132
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,200
So it's oh it's Chaco Marvel McFay.

1133
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:26,760
No not Marvel.

1134
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,160
Marvel's not there yet.

1135
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,000
Maybe should be.

1136
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:35,640
So then you know what Jenny is actually in pretty good company being right on the outside because she's going to probably get inducted in the next class.

1137
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,440
Chaco.

1138
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,240
With Marvel.

1139
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,720
It's Papa Steve from the Bread Factory tour.

1140
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,080
Ice cream sundae I like.

1141
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:41,440
Right.

1142
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,800
It was the Hollywood's next big star poster.

1143
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,240
Right.

1144
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:45,680
Oh yes.

1145
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,720
Oh yes.

1146
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,680
Poster outside of the bathroom in California Adventure.

1147
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,000
The guy on like actor magazine or whatever it is.

1148
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:00,720
There was another idea that didn't come to fruition and I'll tell you about off microphone.

1149
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,200
Yeah.

1150
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,080
Oh boy.

1151
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,520
You guys know it.

1152
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,120
Yeah.

1153
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,160
Well just within viewing this as a trilogy.

1154
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,560
Right.

1155
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:14,760
You know I've come on and covered two of what I think are the finest American films for me.

1156
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,200
Yeah.

1157
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,800
The 3D Terminator 2.

1158
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:26,360
Judgment Day 3D which I think both work incredibly well as theme park attractions and as movies.

1159
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,840
And when we were like what's like the third one to close it out we were like I guess kind of by default.

1160
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,360
Because like if he did.

1161
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,760
Honey I shrunk the audience.

1162
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,320
Yeah.

1163
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,600
Shrek 4D is the next kind of logical one from that era.

1164
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:38,960
Yeah.

1165
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:46,480
Well and I mean the one that's looming there is a major 3D film made by a major film director.

1166
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,400
But I don't think anyone wants to touch it with a 10 foot pole.

1167
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:49,800
Yes.

1168
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,400
Which is heartbreaking because boy do I love this film.

1169
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:52,800
I know.

1170
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,640
But I don't think we've made you do it.

1171
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:55,920
Right.

1172
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,000
You're doing that or nothing.

1173
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,080
I've also I've embarrassingly only seen that one on YouTube.

1174
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,760
I missed it when they released it.

1175
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,160
I went so I like got a hotel room.

1176
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:06,480
Yeah.

1177
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,640
The night that it came out.

1178
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,560
That's how.

1179
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,320
Can I say a very dark thought.

1180
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,280
Uh huh.

1181
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:15,280
I don't think this is going to be dark in the way people now are fearing it will be dark.

1182
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,680
I'm about to get kicked out of.

1183
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,120
I guess the right legend.

1184
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,080
Get out of this room.

1185
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:27,560
I had this feeling after watching Leaving Neverland where I was like I wish I had seen Captain EO before this.

1186
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,960
Yeah.

1187
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:33,880
Like I wish I wouldn't like I would be able to compartmentalize it now.

1188
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:40,360
But in the way I'm like I'm happy I saw certain things made by monsters before I knew they were monsters.

1189
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:49,440
So now I never have to watch them again and they're sort of sectioned off in my brain because the memory is you have at least a pure memory totally to remember it.

1190
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:54,080
And just in terms of like being a person who wants to have like a knowledge of pop culture and whatever.

1191
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:54,520
Sure.

1192
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,200
Yeah.

1193
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:55,640
Yeah.

1194
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,920
But to like invest in it now.

1195
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:58,520
Right.

1196
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,560
Seems like an odd thing to do.

1197
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:06,640
Like I remember my friend and I like five or six years ago were like we should really see like Bill Cosby live before he died.

1198
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,400
And then when like all the stories came out I'm like dodge a bullet.

1199
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,720
Glad I didn't see Cosby live give him my money.

1200
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:12,160
Sure.

1201
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:19,840
But then part of me is like I wish I had seen it and then found out that he was a piece of shit and felt bad that I'd gone to see it if that makes sense.

1202
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:20,200
Yeah.

1203
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:26,200
Like I wish I just had in my brain the experience of seeing old angry half blind.

1204
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,960
I'm going to yell at everyone in my audience Bill Cosby.

1205
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,400
And go for like longer than this podcast.

1206
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,480
His sets are through three and a half hours.

1207
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,680
And be like oh I got a bad vibe from this guy.

1208
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:36,840
Yeah.

1209
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,720
I did see I saw R Kelly during the window where like everyone forgot before they remembered again.

1210
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,760
And it was something that was the captain you know thing like it was like post Jackson death.

1211
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,280
Everyone was like oh we're just like we totally love him now.

1212
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,880
Completely pulled out of the parks.

1213
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,880
If you look at the timeline when it started getting taken out.

1214
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,880
It was trial one and then we and then he died and then just like never mind.

1215
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:57,280
Fine.

1216
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:57,600
It's fine.

1217
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:58,760
We all agree it's fine.

1218
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,080
Right.

1219
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,680
It was a nice it was a nice era to live in.

1220
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,520
Not it's not good that everyone was ignoring it.

1221
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,320
But it was like terrible.

1222
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:06,760
Yeah.

1223
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,160
Yeah.

1224
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,600
Horrible that everyone's ignoring it.

1225
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,840
But sort of like you know fingers and ears ignorance.

1226
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:12,560
Yes.

1227
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,040
Yes.

1228
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:13,920
It's not ignorant.

1229
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:14,160
Right.

1230
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:19,560
I had that feeling like after watching Leaving Netherland where I was like they're never going to put it back in the parks again.

1231
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:26,320
Like I'm never going to get to see it which is for in the grand scheme of things for the best.

1232
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,320
But oh boy.

1233
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,520
Oh the seats danced.

1234
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,760
Now that's shaking.

1235
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,880
You can take all if you could just take them out and digitally put is there a way.

1236
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:41,000
Well and can we do an episode that avoids aesthetically speaking is it's mostly going to be about Hooter the elephant.

1237
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,040
The alien elephant.

1238
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,200
I know it's first in there.

1239
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:44,760
Right.

1240
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,920
Major and minor domo.

1241
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,280
And we know that's what we'd be taught.

1242
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:53,240
I'd be I would have spent 20 minutes on the plastic egg that's lying on him.

1243
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:53,680
Yeah.

1244
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,200
You know what.

1245
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,400
That is the question.

1246
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,920
This is the big moral question.

1247
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,360
What did fuzzball know.

1248
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,000
You know what I'm saying.

1249
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,720
Like was he complicit.

1250
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:08,120
This is all also making me realize I forgot I never watched the Theranos documentary that came out like right around that time.

1251
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:08,600
Oh yeah.

1252
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,280
About HBO.

1253
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,320
And I'm like oh shit I have that at home.

1254
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:15,320
That thing's like you're just thinking of other movies to watch while we're talking.

1255
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,000
You don't want to talk.

1256
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:19,800
We don't want to watch fighting there like it seemed unpleasant.

1257
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,200
You're going to end up watching a mansion at 5 a.m.

1258
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:22,760
I am.

1259
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,680
Yeah.

1260
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:29,360
You want what you're saying is you want Alex Gibney to make a documentary about what fuzzball.

1261
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,800
Yes sure.

1262
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:31,960
Yeah.

1263
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,280
But but like honey I shrunk the audience.

1264
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:41,000
Captain Muppet Vision Terminator 2 3D are all examples of like this feels like a theme park attraction.

1265
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,320
You're not just sitting in a theater and watching a 3D movie.

1266
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:43,560
Yeah.

1267
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:50,880
And it's a thing that like the resurgence of 3D which was largely spearheaded by and ruined by Jeffrey Katzenberg.

1268
00:55:50,920 --> 00:56:01,280
Like Jeffrey Katzenberg is by all accounts and for all intents and purposes the man who killed the golden goose like this thing that was briefly like reviving theater like ticket sales.

1269
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:07,920
Now allow me to say this that at this exact week that we're recording this I'm working on a Quibi show.

1270
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,680
So I would just like to say Quibi we love you.

1271
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,560
Any comments that have been made in the past were incorrect.

1272
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:18,400
I've been proven wrong and I'm not saying things that Griffin is saying.

1273
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,920
And Scott I would like to add that in a few weeks I will be pitching to Quibi.

1274
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:26,280
This is not a joke either and I would like to say my opinion is that Quibi is probably great.

1275
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,200
We haven't seen it yet when it's launched but I would like to.

1276
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:35,440
Katzenberg killed the golden goose because he had so many more golden geese to raise from babes.

1277
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:39,200
That golden goose was it was going to die of old age anyway.

1278
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:42,960
So these new young golden geese.

1279
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:50,720
If you guys need to step out of the room for another few minutes Griffin and I can continue this conversation because I don't have anything like that.

1280
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,160
I've been trying to get a general with them.

1281
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:53,840
It's a blast.

1282
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,160
Yeah a lot of fun.

1283
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,000
The general sounds so much fun.

1284
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,400
I hear the meetings you can have.

1285
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,240
Fuck.

1286
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,120
I see.

1287
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:08,360
I was going to say you can have the meetings standing up vertically or lying down horizontally.

1288
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,760
And it's got to work both ways.

1289
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:10,480
Yeah.

1290
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,560
It's a golden goose of an idea.

1291
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,920
That is such a crazy thing.

1292
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:22,480
I have heard that corroborated by so many people and I have also talked to so many friends who are actors on Quibi shows and they're like that can't be true.

1293
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:22,760
But.

1294
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,520
They were on the set and they're like that it's not going to work.

1295
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,600
Well no they weren't like technically that's impossible.

1296
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:32,400
They were like that seems weird that no one would tell me that.

1297
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,800
I think that's not complete incredulity.

1298
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,120
That is I believe out the window.

1299
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:37,680
Really.

1300
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,520
No no no.

1301
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,160
I'm in a room on a thing.

1302
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,840
They showed us a chart.

1303
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,400
Really?

1304
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,680
They said remember to frame.

1305
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,880
They said to me a writer not involved in the technical aspect at all.

1306
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,760
To remember that the frame.

1307
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,480
So I shouldn't write anything that says a very wide frame opens up.

1308
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:56,400
I heard somebody there's a show that's being made that they were like yeah we're not doing that.

1309
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:02,080
Maybe maybe some of the bigger creators are getting to just that is what I'm talking about.

1310
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,800
Well it's like they have like news.

1311
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,880
Does the news flip formats.

1312
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,680
I guarantee you the news flips format.

1313
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:08,320
Yeah the news.

1314
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:11,880
Anything's going to be the news.

1315
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,000
I was talking about this the other night too.

1316
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:20,720
Do you know about the shining like the the aspect ratios like when Kubrick shot the shining the monitor.

1317
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:24,400
He could see what it would look like in 16 by 9 and 4 by 3.

1318
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:29,240
Yeah that like the 4 by 3 video release you saw like other stuff in the scene.

1319
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,120
Right.

1320
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,280
Yeah that's like Dark Knight.

1321
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,680
They did that and those all the Imex.

1322
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,920
It's cool if it's done intentionally.

1323
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,960
It is insane the way that they're planning on doing it but also.

1324
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:46,160
You don't think Antoine Fuqua is like look you don't think the key for Sutherland Fugitive.

1325
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,120
They're like all right let's make sure when he's running through this tunnel.

1326
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:54,400
I'm astounded by how many Kweeby shows are remakes of movies.

1327
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:59,000
Like it feels weird that even at that level they're like well we need a baseline IP here.

1328
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,080
We need something.

1329
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,400
No nowhere.

1330
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:06,360
Key for Sutherland Fugitive made me feel like no that already happened.

1331
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:06,880
Yeah.

1332
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:07,800
Did it.

1333
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,200
It feels right.

1334
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,280
It feels like a perfect equation.

1335
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,080
It feels like.

1336
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,160
So many fugitive shows.

1337
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,760
He did that on CBS right.

1338
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,400
He must have.

1339
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,040
It was seven seasons.

1340
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:17,640
Eight seasons.

1341
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,280
That was designated survive.

1342
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,040
24.

1343
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,160
Wait a second.

1344
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,920
Well that means that we do over.

1345
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:23,120
Yeah.

1346
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,160
Let's eventually we gotta get to.

1347
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,280
Well what I was gonna say right.

1348
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:34,680
I feel like Shrek is an example of like all the shit that is sort of more theme parky and

1349
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:41,960
experiential to being in that specifically constructed theater at any one of seven theme

1350
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:47,880
parks where it was playing are so gimmicky and hollow and less successful than the things

1351
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:53,240
like Muppet Vision and I struck the audience and T2 and Cranter now where it's like more

1352
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,120
fully integrated into it.

1353
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:56,400
Yeah.

1354
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:02,040
And it speaks to the fact that they like made a movie that can kind of work without the

1355
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,480
theme park.

1356
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:03,960
Yeah.

1357
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:04,280
Yeah.

1358
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:08,240
And that is the fact that they could repurpose it which you couldn't do with the honey I

1359
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,640
shrunk the audio you can just be watching that on a DVD.

1360
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:17,240
But it's like an ultimate neither nor where like I remember seeing Shrek 4D at Universal

1361
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,640
and being like this is a bad 4D movie and then watching it on Netflix being like this is

1362
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:27,360
a bad animated short film and in either format I'm irked by things that were clearly done

1363
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,440
for the sake of the other format.

1364
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:33,840
There's some cognitive dissonance because the pre show is very theme parky.

1365
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,400
Which I think is the most successful shit.

1366
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:36,880
Yeah.

1367
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:42,520
With like Gingy banging on the camera and then making jokes about like this is what

1368
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:43,680
happened after the credits.

1369
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:46,440
And it being like dungeon security camera.

1370
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:46,880
Yes.

1371
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,520
And it helps because Shrek the first Shrek is so much.

1372
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,240
And the pigs are in the cages.

1373
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:56,760
The just eyes of you can watch the video you can watch that the user cow missing who

1374
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:01,720
releases all the like good raw material of all these pre shows and everything has like

1375
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,960
video feeds of every individual set of pig eyes.

1376
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:05,680
It's pretty cool.

1377
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:06,240
They're good.

1378
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:07,080
They're good.

1379
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,160
I'm glad you brought that up.

1380
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:08,720
I do like the pre show.

1381
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,720
And the show building is good.

1382
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:16,440
It helps that like Shrek has set up that the whole kingdom is like a riff on Disney

1383
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,760
World that's already baked into the cake.

1384
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,040
Yeah.

1385
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,480
So like that's fun to see.

1386
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:24,560
Like it's like oh I'm walking through the real thing because in Shrek there are

1387
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:30,760
turnstiles and there are weird like sort of like velvet ropes you know and there's

1388
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:34,120
like a scene in Shrek where he like gets in a fight with like a dude in a Farquaad

1389
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:37,960
mascot costume where he's in like the ride queue line.

1390
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,600
Oh yeah.

1391
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,000
Yeah.

1392
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:39,720
Oh sure.

1393
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,400
So seeing all that stuff like replicated in real life is like kind of fun.

1394
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,000
I was gonna say the Singapore location that opened up to the other ones.

1395
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:47,280
Yeah.

1396
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,360
That facade is crazy.

1397
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,480
It's like the full castle.

1398
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,240
It's barbed wire.

1399
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,200
Massive scale.

1400
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:51,600
Yeah.

1401
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:56,520
That was rumored to be in the new one in Orlando but I don't think it's happening.

1402
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:57,400
It's not at least in the pictures.

1403
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:01,160
There is like sort of medievalish but that's maybe how to turn your drink.

1404
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:01,320
Yeah.

1405
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:02,560
That's the people think.

1406
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:06,080
But there was yeah it was gonna be a full like reverse Magic Kingdom.

1407
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:06,840
Shrekified.

1408
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,040
Both of those are kind of weird.

1409
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:11,080
Like I mean.

1410
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:17,280
I think how to chain your dragon they must have tested well enough that like OK

1411
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,320
that's a trilogy.

1412
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,400
There's three.

1413
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:25,760
There's I think there's a spin off TV show and people still have goodwill towards it.

1414
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,040
They are very well regarded.

1415
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:32,000
They're probably the best reviewed Dreamworks franchise top to bottom.

1416
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:35,040
And the ancillary stuff has done well for them.

1417
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:39,880
But it also like all three how to train your dragon movies each one makes less than

1418
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:40,880
the previous one.

1419
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:41,240
Sure.

1420
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,040
Like they go down whereas like the other crazy Dreamworks franchises you're like

1421
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,560
Madagascar 3 made that much.

1422
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,320
For sure.

1423
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:52,920
What would have happened though if they had made the other alternate Shrek's like

1424
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,320
Nick Cage Shrek.

1425
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,480
Or you didn't get to all these.

1426
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:56,880
Oh my God.

1427
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:57,120
Yeah.

1428
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,640
Janine Garofalo as Fiona.

1429
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,680
Whoa.

1430
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:04,320
There's like Farley recorded 95 percent of his dialogue.

1431
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,240
That much.

1432
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:05,880
Yeah.

1433
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,720
And then find that online.

1434
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:08,120
Yeah.

1435
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:12,640
And it's just him doing voice but it's it's him just doing his regular voice and

1436
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,320
his sounds very endearing.

1437
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:18,240
And then people they had a 3D model that looked more like the illustration.

1438
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:18,960
Yeah.

1439
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:19,840
And it was Farley's.

1440
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:20,720
That's a whole other.

1441
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:21,200
Oh yeah.

1442
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,160
Completely different character.

1443
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:26,640
And apparently I would so so curious to learn more about this.

1444
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:31,120
Like Mike Myers did not know he was replacing Farley and did not know there

1445
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,680
were recordings.

1446
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:33,240
Whoa.

1447
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,040
When he was.

1448
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,640
They kept that from.

1449
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:39,160
He claims that he asked that when they showed it to was this on his Marin

1450
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,480
episode that when they showed it to him he said.

1451
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,080
It seemed like he had a feeling.

1452
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,560
Was Farley doing this at some point.

1453
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:43,880
Yeah.

1454
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:44,880
And they said no.

1455
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:48,080
Because they had like storyboarded it to his voice.

1456
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:52,840
Like they had like the animatic like showreels of like which I guess they must

1457
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,320
have showed him and then put in some scratch voice of like someone at the

1458
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:57,400
Dreamworks offices to cover it up.

1459
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,720
But the whole character had been defined by like Farley's performance.

1460
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,080
Like they had it all like sort of blocked out.

1461
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:10,040
I mean I as like a weird broken child who was like a reading variety distinctly

1462
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:14,160
remember them announcing that Chris Farley was going to be the voice of Shrek.

1463
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:18,080
But I guess Mike Myers probably just didn't ask didn't care.

1464
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,640
You know or when he asked he had no outside like reference.

1465
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:22,600
He hadn't heard anything.

1466
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,840
It just seemed like it.

1467
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,200
But yet it's like right.

1468
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:31,800
Spielberg wanted to do it his own maybe his live action maybe his hybrid do it at Amblin.

1469
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,840
The Dreamworks bought the rights from them.

1470
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:34,840
Right. Right.

1471
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:38,160
Once he formed that and it was like this is the big idea.

1472
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:41,840
And then they just kept on like resetting it over and over again.

1473
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:47,880
And then like Farley dying and then Mike Myers did it all in the voice of Lothar

1474
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,240
from the Hill people from SNL.

1475
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,040
That was the first where it's like hello.

1476
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:53,800
I am Lothar.

1477
01:04:54,760 --> 01:05:00,120
And he was like he went in and first of all apparently Myers demanded a page one rewrite

1478
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:03,080
per his notes his like control freak stuff.

1479
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:06,280
He like they rewrote the whole script is like sort of interest.

1480
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:10,840
I think they brought in a bunch of his like SNL guys who were uncredited on it.

1481
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,840
Michael McCullers I think worked on track but didn't get credit.

1482
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:19,120
And that is what took out all that was the final nail that killed all the Farley.

1483
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:19,560
Right.

1484
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,040
And he's thing hanging on.

1485
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:21,800
Right. Right.

1486
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,440
Because I think it was like I want to make this thing my own.

1487
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,160
It feels like this is some remnant of some other movie.

1488
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,160
You don't even like what then what is Mike Myers.

1489
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:34,960
I mean for sure that thing that's reprised in Trek 4D of is he compensating for that.

1490
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,680
I can't do Scottish panel.

1491
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,520
Is he is far quite compensating for something.

1492
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,320
There's a few penis jokes in the movie.

1493
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:43,560
There's some funny.

1494
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,280
Obviously he loves that's his favorite.

1495
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:45,800
Yeah.

1496
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:50,480
Trek 4D has a number of callbacks to the first movie like what it is.

1497
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:54,280
Second beats that don't necessarily pay off.

1498
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,040
He just made it like body.

1499
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,960
He made it body with like in his body body.

1500
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,840
Right. And then his his thing was he was like this is too arch.

1501
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:04,160
I'm doing a sketch comedy character.

1502
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:04,880
It doesn't work.

1503
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,480
There's no emotionality to it.

1504
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:09,640
I want to redo it with a Scottish accent.

1505
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,320
And he was like my my like one of his parents was Scottish.

1506
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,160
He'd done the voice a bunch of times.

1507
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,960
And that's that's so Harry Dax murder and fat bastard.

1508
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:19,320
Right.

1509
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:24,640
And he made this argument to like I think it's a soft accent that's also hard.

1510
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:30,120
Like you can sort of balance the warmth and the monstrous side of him and pitch them on it.

1511
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:38,800
And in like one of the rare instances I've ever heard of like Katzenberg choosing the more expensive option was like fine.

1512
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:44,360
And they threw out like six million dollars worth of animation to start over.

1513
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,080
Do we think.

1514
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:51,960
With timeline is that the difference between like what he can request pre Austin Powers and post Austin.

1515
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,440
Like is he like does Austin Powers put him in a position where it's fine.

1516
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,240
Spend the money because we'll get it back.

1517
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:57,600
Yeah.

1518
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:01,440
I mean you go like in between like Austin Powers two and Austin Powers three.

1519
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,080
No one's going to say no to that guy.

1520
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:03,560
Yeah.

1521
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,120
Yeah.

1522
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,960
But then that whole fucking crazy Deeter debacle is part of all that.

1523
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:08,680
And is that dream.

1524
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,120
No that's universal universal.

1525
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,920
But that was probably about the same time as this.

1526
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:13,480
You know.

1527
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,800
Oh and Cat in the Hat was the fallout.

1528
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:17,160
Right.

1529
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,200
That was his punishment.

1530
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:19,480
Make good.

1531
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:19,720
Yeah.

1532
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:20,720
That was his make good.

1533
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,200
Lock him in a suit.

1534
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,680
One of my favorite phenomena.

1535
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:29,640
I would love to like curate a film festival that's movies where actors were sued into being in them.

1536
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,040
Which is like Mike Myers and Cat in the Hat.

1537
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,280
Edward Norton in the Italian Job.

1538
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:34,920
Oh yeah.

1539
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,960
Which is why he clearly doesn't want to be in that movie.

1540
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,920
David Cross in third.

1541
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:40,600
Yes.

1542
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,920
Alvin and the Chipmunks.

1543
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:49,600
Emily Blunt and Gulliver's Travels which she was forced to do because of an option on the contract she signed for Devil Wears Prada.

1544
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:56,400
And because she was forced to make that movie she dropped out of playing Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

1545
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:00,360
She was signed and announced and Fox was like no we got one on you.

1546
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,360
Jesus.

1547
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,240
She's probably had a more interesting career since.

1548
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:03,680
Totally.

1549
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:04,720
Oh totally.

1550
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,840
But it's still a crazy thing to think about.

1551
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,160
And she'll get in there.

1552
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:08,560
Yeah.

1553
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,320
Yeah that means she's available.

1554
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,440
Marvel will devour her.

1555
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:19,080
I have to say I was trying to think back to 2001 when Shrek did finally come out.

1556
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:25,040
And I have such a weird association with it because I was like between sophomore and junior years of high school.

1557
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:25,320
Yeah.

1558
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:29,160
And this is when a couple friends got cars and driver's licenses.

1559
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:34,760
So this was the summer that like we don't need our parents to take us anywhere so and so can drive.

1560
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:38,320
Which resulted in me seeing Shrek twice.

1561
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:40,400
Oh I thought you were going to say 20 times.

1562
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:41,400
20 times.

1563
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:49,440
I think I did see it with my family and then I saw it with friends because there was a friend who saw he was obsessed.

1564
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:52,400
He got obsessed with Moulin Rouge that summer.

1565
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:54,800
And every time we're like well let's go to the movies.

1566
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,520
He's like I want to see Moulin Rouge.

1567
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,600
Let's go to Moulin Rouge.

1568
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:58,360
Let's go to Moulin Rouge.

1569
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,560
We'll see Moulin Rouge at this point.

1570
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,760
And he's like on number four or five screening.

1571
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,480
And it's like no it's not in theaters anymore.

1572
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,280
But Shrek is somehow still in theaters.

1573
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:09,680
Let's just go see Shrek.

1574
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:10,480
I'll see it again.

1575
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:10,760
Fine.

1576
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:11,960
I'll see Shrek again.

1577
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:12,720
And it was fun.

1578
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:13,320
It was fun.

1579
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:13,800
We liked it.

1580
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,880
Summer of Shrek for Jason Sheridan.

1581
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:23,320
This is an insane stat that I'm embarrassed to share and I don't think I cannot think of another example of this.

1582
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:27,800
I believe I saw Shrek three times opening weekend.

1583
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:28,240
Whoa.

1584
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:31,120
I believe I saw it Friday Saturday and Sunday.

1585
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:31,560
Wow.

1586
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,080
Because I just could not get enough of this fucking thing.

1587
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:35,160
Wow.

1588
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:37,560
I saw Red Dragon twice.

1589
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:47,120
Because like I saw it with my dad and then friends we were going to go see something else but got the times wrong and they're like we could go see Red Dragon.

1590
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,080
And I'm like yeah OK.

1591
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,520
But a lot of people I like in that.

1592
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:51,000
Yeah.

1593
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,240
That's Ed Norton too.

1594
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:53,000
Ed Norton.

1595
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,040
Mary Louise Parker.

1596
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,000
Yeah yeah.

1597
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:56,480
Hoffman.

1598
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:57,120
Yeah.

1599
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:03,640
Well the circumstances were there was a kid in my grade named Mack Shrek.

1600
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,120
The villain from Batman Returns.

1601
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,360
And the actor Mack.

1602
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:07,960
Yes.

1603
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:08,720
Right.

1604
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:08,960
Right.

1605
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,200
Nels Feratu.

1606
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:15,880
But at the time that was flying over our heads and we were just like yo dude they made an animated movie about you.

1607
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:19,240
Like it was the best joke and he owned it.

1608
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,440
To his credit Mack Shrek owned it.

1609
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,280
Wore it like a badge of honor.

1610
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,960
Had a Shrek birthday party.

1611
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:26,440
Oh.

1612
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:29,800
And we were like 13 or 14.

1613
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,600
But he was like we're going to buy Shrek party supplies.

1614
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:36,280
We're going to like everyone buy me Shrek presents.

1615
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,320
Like I'm owning this.

1616
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,800
This is my movie.

1617
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:51,200
So that was like Saturday was going to be Mack Shrek Shrek birthday party followed by a sleepover where I distinctly remember at Mack Shrek's apartment watching the cowbell sketch.

1618
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:52,520
That was it.

1619
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:52,920
Yes.

1620
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:56,720
That was the weekend that Christopher Walken does cowbell on Anson out.

1621
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:59,360
I also remember where I was when that sketch.

1622
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,280
The whole room.

1623
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:01,840
Yeah.

1624
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:02,440
Truly.

1625
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:10,960
It just you could kind of I feel like for for the four of us as comedy nerds if you were watching that live you were like this is something.

1626
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,720
If you're going into comedy enjoy this curse.

1627
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,200
This is going to be something.

1628
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:26,640
The guy who hired me and a lot of my friends at Funny or Die was a guy who wrote there at the time Andrew Steele and he at one point said you realize everyone in this building is here because of the cowbell sketch.

1629
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:27,080
Yeah.

1630
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:31,520
Like this would not this building isn't here without cowbells specifically.

1631
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,080
It's not.

1632
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,560
Still sounds bizarre but it's true.

1633
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:50,800
It's crazy also because I remember I was like I guess I was like 13 at that point 12 or 13 and for years it had been my dad would tape SNL on a VHS and I would wake up Sunday morning and have a bowl of cereal and watch SNL because I could.

1634
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:51,600
Take me to church.

1635
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,720
Stay off.

1636
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:53,840
Take me to church.

1637
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,360
Lord is my pastor.

1638
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:11,720
That was my synagogue was watching SNL with like corn pops on Sunday morning but that was a rare one because it was a sleepover where I was like Max's parents let us stay up and I watched it live with three other people.

1639
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:16,200
So I was watching other people laugh at SNL which I didn't usually get.

1640
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:17,960
Oh usually the social experience.

1641
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,400
Yeah.

1642
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,960
You spoke of nerds watching them lose their minds.

1643
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,240
I was like this is this is something.

1644
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,000
Yeah.

1645
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:27,440
I did not think it would become the most dominant.

1646
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:32,520
But like primary if like if we have to explain what is sketch in a thousand years.

1647
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:33,600
It's the thing.

1648
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,440
We only have room to remember one sketch.

1649
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:36,160
I guess it's that one.

1650
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,200
It's the thing we put in the time capsule.

1651
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:42,520
You know it's what we buried outside the Nickelodeon hotel.

1652
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,520
We're so close to where we're recording this to the time capsule.

1653
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:45,880
Yes.

1654
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:46,160
Yeah.

1655
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,920
Closer than we usually record.

1656
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:48,960
Oh wow yeah you're right.

1657
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:49,960
Steps away.

1658
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,120
I can feel it.

1659
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,400
Oh no where you say sorry.

1660
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,720
Well my other thought on Shrek is.

1661
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:56,640
OK.

1662
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:58,880
Two ideas on that one.

1663
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:03,680
They say the first few years of a new decade are closer to the previous totally.

1664
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:06,880
So 2001 still a little 90s the.

1665
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:07,120
Yeah.

1666
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:14,720
My I am wondering is this does Shrek mark the end of the 20th century or did the

1667
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:15,680
matrix do that.

1668
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:18,720
I think in a certain way it's Shrek and the matrix.

1669
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:20,760
And here's another thing I'm going to say.

1670
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:24,800
I think Shrek despite the fact that the franchise continued for another decade.

1671
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:31,320
I think Shrek is so specifically a movie that only could have come out in this

1672
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:36,280
warmly received this successful this beloved the less than five months before

1673
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:36,800
September.

1674
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,120
Yes that was the other thing.

1675
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:39,240
This is the end of innocent.

1676
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:42,360
This is totally the end of innocence.

1677
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:46,720
I think there's something to Shrek coming out in those final moments of like you

1678
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,520
can't fucking touch us.

1679
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,200
America's on top.

1680
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:53,720
Hollywood's like it's big stars big movies.

1681
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:58,760
Anyone can come on a lot without a ton of screening and a certain type of irony

1682
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,640
starts to get questioned right after 9 11.

1683
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,840
There was that whole thing of like is irony dead.

1684
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:08,280
Have we been living in this like sarcastic society does like sincerity need to be

1685
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,360
embraced again.

1686
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:12,880
It's an overnight like entire sea change.

1687
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:16,960
But I do feel like Shrek even when the sequels were doing well and people were

1688
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:17,960
watching it later.

1689
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Some of its success was tied to remember nine months ago before the greatest act

1690
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:28,400
of like international terrorism that our country has experienced in decades.

1691
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,960
It's a different movie but we were all singing.

1692
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,280
Hey here we are now entertain us Shrek.

1693
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:39,680
Yeah we were singing it along to Moulin Rouge.

1694
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:42,080
There's something hedonistic about track.

1695
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,800
It's also funny.

1696
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:44,840
It's a little mind blowing.

1697
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,920
The trick came out the weekend of the cowbell sketch.

1698
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:52,640
Because also so that puts it at like that the cowbell sketch is happening and then

1699
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:57,920
five months later Rudy Giuliani and the firefighters with ashes on them.

1700
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,800
And we still be funny.

1701
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:00,840
Five months later.

1702
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,720
All of this is like this is important cultural content.

1703
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:08,880
Can we still be funny is at least a joke as opposed to like the other tragedy.

1704
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:11,720
How do you know there wasn't one joke.

1705
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:12,320
You're right.

1706
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:12,400
Right.

1707
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,680
Wasn't a joke at that point.

1708
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:19,800
The tragedy mashup or their new biggest recurring or or saying to sir with love

1709
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:23,000
when Obama's term ended.

1710
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,480
Once again these comments are not my comments.

1711
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:25,640
Yeah.

1712
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,080
It's great love.

1713
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:30,680
By the way can I just put in this is not part of a trilogy.

1714
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:34,920
I just want to throw in my name into the ring.

1715
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:41,880
I would love to do the entirely behind the paywall Jimmy Fallon episode.

1716
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,880
It's hard to say no to that.

1717
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,600
You threw it out recently that maybe that's the way you can finally talk about race

1718
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:51,800
through New York the fact that you notice that I have so many thoughts on that ride.

1719
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:52,840
That might have to happen.

1720
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,040
I and if you're willing to go outside the trilogy then yes.

1721
01:15:56,080 --> 01:16:00,600
And if you're willing to jump into the lion's den I mean obviously you won't hear it if

1722
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,680
you don't go by the bill obviously will only say nice things.

1723
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:02,920
Yeah.

1724
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:03,920
But you could.

1725
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:04,120
Yeah.

1726
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:08,200
Because that is like they try to build that as a ride but it isn't more of a 3D film.

1727
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:09,640
This is my argument.

1728
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:14,040
That would be the scorpion king to this the Brennan Fraser mummy trilogy.

1729
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:17,080
Oh you know it's like a little great.

1730
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,080
I love that.

1731
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,320
I agree.

1732
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,200
Perfect analogy.

1733
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:22,160
Well yes.

1734
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:24,160
Now I just want to we're recording this very late.

1735
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:27,040
I just want to roll straight into that right now is the problem.

1736
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:28,440
I can be able to do it for a while.

1737
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:33,480
Now I am thinking about our day upcoming day at Universal and going oh if we blitz

1738
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,920
her original unit Jesus we got we got to make time.

1739
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:37,760
I do it.

1740
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:38,080
Yeah.

1741
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:40,120
I've done it but I haven't done it.

1742
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,120
I don't know.

1743
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:42,000
We have to do it.

1744
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,960
Oh that's why we have to experience.

1745
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:44,920
We couldn't do a bang.

1746
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,440
That's the reason we can't right now.

1747
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,120
I have to experience fake 30.

1748
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,160
So that's the thing.

1749
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,320
So much of it is the fucking Q area.

1750
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:54,920
Oh but Dapper Dan what are they called.

1751
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,560
Oh shoot I can't remember.

1752
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,520
Doodles.

1753
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,000
The camp down racers.

1754
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:03,400
I am more excited for the today show cafe.

1755
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:09,320
But the weirdest thing is just like the Q area being like the front desk that you

1756
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,760
used to check in when you have an audition for an NBC pilot.

1757
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,000
Yeah.

1758
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:14,680
That's all.

1759
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:18,520
And then the tiny little Conan tonight show display.

1760
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,480
It's my favorite.

1761
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:21,560
Yeah.

1762
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,280
Steve Allen has a huge case.

1763
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,320
Everyone's got it and then it's like a little tiny.

1764
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:29,480
It's somehow more disrespectful than if they had removed him entirely.

1765
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,280
Yes I actually yes I agree with that.

1766
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:34,720
There's this should probably be behind the paywall but there's this video of Jimmy

1767
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:41,000
Fallon like talking to Steve Martin in that he's facing that display and saying to

1768
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:46,640
the display as if like a beyond the grave Steve Allen Steve we did it Steve.

1769
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:49,200
We did you ever ride Steve.

1770
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:52,680
God he would have loved this.

1771
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:58,240
And then it just pauses and doesn't cut and it's like a comedy cut again.

1772
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:01,200
No I can't make I can't defend that one.

1773
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:01,920
Watch it.

1774
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,600
All I did was describe a video.

1775
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:08,200
Yeah I didn't say anything that wasn't in the judgments and everyone become a

1776
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:11,920
Patreon subscriber that you get your five dollars worth.

1777
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:14,080
I can vouch for the quality.

1778
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:20,320
Speaking of Shrek also I want to say Shrek premiered at the Cannes Film Festival.

1779
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:21,760
Huge thing to talk about.

1780
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,920
11 minutes standing ovation.

1781
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:29,200
Shrek competed for the Palm or the first animated film since Disney's Peter Pan.

1782
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:35,400
Everyone sat down at Cannes and one of the first things they heard was somebody.

1783
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,440
And people were like it might win.

1784
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:41,520
Like I remember there being the buzz of like Shrek's a solid contender.

1785
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:47,800
Like it's like first animated film Oscar Shrek and Donkey in attendance at the

1786
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,280
Academy Awards.

1787
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:51,600
So on a technological marvel.

1788
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:57,680
I think that's the one year where they animated the animated film nominees in the

1789
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:02,080
audience and like before the animation studios were like this is kind of like

1790
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:03,560
infantilized.

1791
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,280
That would be nice because you know Jack Nicholson is not always there anymore if

1792
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:10,480
they just every year animated Shrek and Donkey in the front row.

1793
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:13,520
Shrek wearing the Nicholson sunglasses.

1794
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:15,160
Coked out of his pants.

1795
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,000
There with Bill Adler and Donkey.

1796
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,120
Yeah throw Shrek in the Lakers game audience.

1797
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,160
Crowd.

1798
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,200
This.

1799
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:23,240
They should.

1800
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:28,040
Shrek should just occupy when Nicholson passes.

1801
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,920
Yeah Shrek should take his seat.

1802
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:35,400
They like kind of bow to the seat and then wave Shrek in.

1803
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,440
Honestly.

1804
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,760
The big the theater shakes.

1805
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:42,760
It would be good if they just sort of like treated Shrek like an actor.

1806
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:43,800
Yes.

1807
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:44,840
And he's just in movies.

1808
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,200
So like Shrek is.

1809
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:52,640
Well that's this thing like Universal buys Dreamworks and they already have

1810
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:57,160
illumination which is doing so well for them and has been doing better than

1811
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,720
Dreamworks for the last five or six years.

1812
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:04,280
And apparently the whole thing was like Chris Melandari who's in charge of

1813
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:07,080
illumination was like I'm not going to leave my post.

1814
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,520
I want to keep illumination going.

1815
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:11,560
These minions are like printing money but we got to figure out something to do

1816
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,440
with these Dreamworks characters.

1817
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:18,720
And by and large like the development of new Dreamworks movies has slowed down

1818
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:23,720
in the name of like these apparently constant meetings of like fuck what do we

1819
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:24,760
do with Shrek.

1820
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,880
Like everyone's banging their head against the wall going like do we do a

1821
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,680
sequel do we do a reboot do we do live action.

1822
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,960
Like what do we do what do we do.

1823
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,480
We got to do something new with Shrek.

1824
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,560
Dark Shrek which will win.

1825
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,240
That'll win Venice.

1826
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:38,280
Right.

1827
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,320
But that's why I'm like.

1828
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:44,440
Just put Shrek in other movies.

1829
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,760
Yes just put Shrek in other movies.

1830
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:52,160
Just like in but like not like period like just a romantic comedy with Kate Hudson.

1831
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:56,720
Right Shrek and Kate Hudson are in a movie about her working in a magazine or

1832
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,760
something.

1833
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,080
He's like a new he's a new Vinnie Jones.

1834
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,120
Yeah.

1835
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:02,120
Shrek's like a villain in a Fast and Furious movie.

1836
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:03,680
Like what's in the Universal stable.

1837
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:05,560
Like he's a little Shrek.

1838
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:06,600
Yeah.

1839
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:10,440
Shrek is a Guardians of the Galaxy cast member.

1840
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:11,480
Yes.

1841
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:15,840
It's interesting you bring up illumination because the way this all played out Shrek

1842
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:19,160
one comes out two years later.

1843
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:20,200
11 happens.

1844
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:21,240
Yeah.

1845
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:21,800
11.

1846
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:26,560
Two years later Shrek 4D is placed in the kind of opens almost

1847
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:29,840
simultaneously not totally simultaneously.

1848
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:36,400
I think Hollywood opened first then Japan and Orlando opened on the same

1849
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:41,000
day and for both of them there the attractions opening within like nine

1850
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:43,360
months of when Shrek 2 is going to come out.

1851
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:44,400
Yes.

1852
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:48,720
And it's such a unique phenomenon of not like we're making another like entry but

1853
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:53,200
like we're making a bridge entry between the last theatrical movie and the next

1854
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:56,720
theatrical movie knowing full well that Jeffrey Katzenberg was like we're going

1855
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:58,240
to make six of these goddamn things.

1856
01:21:58,280 --> 01:21:59,280
Yeah.

1857
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:02,320
But in 2003 as a theme park goer I thought this is cool.

1858
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:03,360
Right.

1859
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,160
It's a picks up right where the first movie left off.

1860
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:09,480
You can't see it anywhere else and it's like an important piece of it's important

1861
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,680
piece as you walk out there.

1862
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:16,080
Well there's a poster in the exit that says coming in 2004 Shrek 2.

1863
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:17,120
That's what happened.

1864
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:19,840
So literally what that is my memory of it.

1865
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:24,720
But it's so weird for this attraction to be like still running after Shrek 4 came

1866
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:25,760
out.

1867
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:26,800
Yeah.

1868
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:27,840
Oh yeah.

1869
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:30,440
Because it's been like I don't I'm not up I haven't seen two through four so I

1870
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:33,600
don't know what happened but I imagine character things are like irrelevant or

1871
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:34,640
changed.

1872
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:35,680
Things change.

1873
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:36,920
Everyone starts having kids.

1874
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,960
Shrek's life gets really complicated.

1875
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,080
Growing up is tough.

1876
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:42,120
I'm sure with those Shrek's kids.

1877
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:44,240
So like I haven't seen the films.

1878
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:46,280
I haven't seen three or four.

1879
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,400
Donkey and Dragons kids are cute.

1880
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:49,440
Oh yeah.

1881
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:51,120
Donkey and Dragons have kids.

1882
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:52,160
Yeah.

1883
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:57,360
Oh and there's a statue in Singapore of the the the the donkey dragon kids called

1884
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:58,400
the dronkies.

1885
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,440
Yeah.

1886
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:02,760
It's a pretty horrifying statue and I didn't recognize them because I haven't seen

1887
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:03,760
the films.

1888
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:06,200
I got the official bug main ruling on the Shrek's.

1889
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:08,240
He said two and four.

1890
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:09,280
Oh.

1891
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:10,320
Two and four.

1892
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:11,360
Two and four are the best.

1893
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:12,400
So he says I don't know.

1894
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:14,080
And can anyone vouch for that or not?

1895
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:15,120
Four. I will say this.

1896
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:16,160
Four is kind of interesting.

1897
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,960
It's a it's a wonderful life.

1898
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Yeah.

1899
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,040
Essentially.

1900
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,080
Oh wow.

1901
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,000
I think I saw two and three.

1902
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,760
I cannot remember any.

1903
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,800
Whoa.

1904
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,000
The parents.

1905
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,680
Fiona's parents show up.

1906
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:29,880
That's two.

1907
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,920
That's two.

1908
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,120
Three is like abysmal.

1909
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:34,320
Three is like memory holding.

1910
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:36,440
I am like reaching for this.

1911
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:42,480
Three is like it feels like it's 60 percent about selling the idea of Justin Timberlake

1912
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:43,520
as a movie star.

1913
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:47,840
Like the same time as Love Guru or whatever.

1914
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:50,520
Yeah. When is Puss in Boots shows up and gets spun off.

1915
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:55,320
Also so Fallon you could also be called the Fallon episode is the Puss in Boots of the

1916
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,360
3D movie.

1917
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,400
Yes.

1918
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:58,640
That also works.

1919
01:23:58,680 --> 01:23:59,840
Separate but real.

1920
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,920
Compare this arc to like Illumination.

1921
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,800
Yeah. Secret Life of Pets comes out.

1922
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:07,520
Huge hit. Secret Life of Pets 2.

1923
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,560
Not so big.

1924
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:09,600
Big drop.

1925
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:14,200
Secret Life of Pets the ride coming 2020 after the big drop.

1926
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:14,960
Yeah. Right.

1927
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:15,840
A different arc.

1928
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:16,880
Right. Right.

1929
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:21,320
That's why the the how train your dragon thing I think aside from the fact that it's

1930
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:25,960
like a good world and it's the kind of thing that like you see a weird amount of how to

1931
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,640
train your dragon at like conventions and stuff.

1932
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:32,200
I think people like cosplaying how to train your dragon and all of that.

1933
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:36,480
But it is like a franchise where the numbers dip every time.

1934
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:41,320
And usually I feel like people like to get in like you know when it's hot.

1935
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:45,320
Right. It is interesting with the way that what supposedly the four lands which are

1936
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:49,760
the Nintendo for the new theme park in Orlando Nintendo how to train your dragon.

1937
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:54,280
Fantastic Beasts but I would be not surprised if it's just Harry Potter land three.

1938
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:57,360
Right. They could just do any other area.

1939
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:58,000
Right. Yeah.

1940
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:01,320
So that might be what happens and then Universal Monsters which is great.

1941
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:06,680
But the monsters and the how to train a dragon maybe they're just letting them

1942
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,520
imagining imagine you whatever they're called.

1943
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,880
Greeners are people do stuff they want to do.

1944
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:12,320
No of course it's not.

1945
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:13,120
It's not possible.

1946
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:14,960
That's how to drag in a cool world.

1947
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
It could inspire cool attractions.

1948
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:17,920
Yeah.

1949
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:21,040
But also in my head I'm like oh man imagine a dragon riding.

1950
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:23,240
Oh well that imagine dragons ride.

1951
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:24,400
But that's the problem.

1952
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,680
Well I first I'd love to see an imagine dragons.

1953
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:29,280
I'd like to hear an imagine dragons ride.

1954
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:33,120
But when I'm like oh it would be cool to do like a ride where you're on the back

1955
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:36,200
of a dragon and then I think oh that's that's Pandora.

1956
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:39,960
That's like they've already done the great American dragon ride.

1957
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:40,400
Sure.

1958
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:42,360
Unless it's a true like coaster somehow.

1959
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,080
Sure.

1960
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:43,720
Which they.

1961
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:45,160
Dueling dragons too.

1962
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:46,280
Dueling dragons too.

1963
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,120
They just move it over.

1964
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:53,320
Can I bring up this thing of you were talking about the connection like it's it's

1965
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:56,800
like a vital connection between one and two.

1966
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:57,560
How.

1967
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,520
That's what I went in rewatching it and I say this not knowing too.

1968
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,040
So maybe I just don't know.

1969
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,960
But I remember them making a big deal out of that at the time and thinking that

1970
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:05,480
was cool.

1971
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:08,360
But now I'm looking back and like OK so Fiona's in Ogre now.

1972
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,920
What else is.

1973
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,640
Oh I wouldn't say it's vital.

1974
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:13,040
It was just like that's what they said.

1975
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:13,880
I'm not putting it.

1976
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:14,600
Oh yeah.

1977
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:16,680
I'm not criticizing you Jason said.

1978
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:20,200
No I remember that was such the angle and now I'm just going back to like what

1979
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:22,880
made them feel like nothing that happens.

1980
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:27,280
In Shrek 4D has any bearing on the following three Shrek movies.

1981
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:27,680
No.

1982
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:30,160
Nor the following eight Shrek TV specials.

1983
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:30,640
Yes.

1984
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:32,680
Ghost Farquaad though.

1985
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,160
Never ever acknowledged ever again.

1986
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:39,160
I guess the fact that they did pick it up from it's not a reset they do.

1987
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:42,400
That's the one happened in Farquaad is dead and Fiona is an ogre.

1988
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:46,000
But also like the fact that it starts with them like in the onion carriage.

1989
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:49,960
That's like the ending of Shrek one and that it ends with them at the hotel for

1990
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:50,560
their honeymoon.

1991
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,480
That is the beginning of Shrek 2.

1992
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:54,200
Like it fits in very tightly.

1993
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,120
That's a little neat.

1994
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:55,520
Okay.

1995
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:55,920
Right.

1996
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:56,720
Between the two.

1997
01:26:56,760 --> 01:27:01,800
So it's not that it like is important to the story at all but it's so specifically

1998
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,360
between those two goalposts.

1999
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:06,600
And it literally is how they move from one location to the other.

2000
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:11,440
I guess then it becomes so strange that it's like it is so specifically not a

2001
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:20,480
Shrek 3D movie but a 3D movie that is a sequel to the first Shrek.

2002
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:23,680
While they're like spinning their wild plans of like a Christmas special, a

2003
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:26,560
Halloween special, you know, like all of this.

2004
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:31,000
They're making this like thing that's going to, you know, it stuck between as

2005
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:33,000
opposed to T2.

2006
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:34,840
It doesn't feel as weird.

2007
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,160
It's clearly between two and three.

2008
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:38,800
But three feels like such a different thing.

2009
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:43,280
It's like one, one, two and T2 3D are one item for sure.

2010
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:43,480
Right.

2011
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,680
And it was like Cameron's final statement at least.

2012
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:48,280
Like even if they make these other entries because they're not Cameron, it's

2013
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:51,720
like, well, that's not canon and it doesn't really count and all that sort of stuff.

2014
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,720
But all the Shrek is all it's all Shrek.

2015
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:58,200
I'm trying to think of like if there was a Star Wars 3D movie in between

2016
01:27:58,240 --> 01:27:59,800
Force Awakens and Last Jedi.

2017
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:00,840
That's what it's like.

2018
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:01,760
The Saber.

2019
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:02,520
Yeah, sort of.

2020
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:07,360
We're in a, this is a land between Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker.

2021
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:08,000
Yes, it is.

2022
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:08,600
As it stands now.

2023
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:09,480
Will it stay that way?

2024
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:10,280
I don't know.

2025
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,920
That's technically what it is currently.

2026
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:12,560
Yes.

2027
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:19,720
So pop culture is just a land between like all of pop culture is Shrek 4D now.

2028
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:22,480
It's just a little connective unnecessary bit.

2029
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:25,600
Rogue One is Shrek 4D.

2030
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:27,320
It's plugging in pieces.

2031
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:27,720
Right.

2032
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:30,480
And taking you right up to the room where the next one's there.

2033
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:31,440
It's right.

2034
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:35,760
That's the Shrek 4D thing where it's like you can start at the original Star Wars

2035
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:38,320
and everything you need to know is in the body of that film.

2036
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:41,600
And Shrek 4D is being like, wait, wait, wait, no, you need to understand how they

2037
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,440
got to the hotel.

2038
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:46,440
And certainly you can get on Star Tours and not know one fucking thing.

2039
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:47,480
Right.

2040
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:52,120
So I find it weird how plotty it is in that sense that it's so directly in

2041
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,920
dialogue with the two movies.

2042
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:58,640
There's this crazy stat where we watched the same Yesterland video.

2043
01:28:58,680 --> 01:28:59,320
Oh, yeah.

2044
01:28:59,360 --> 01:28:59,800
Good video.

2045
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:06,720
And I also watched a iPhone video of it on YouTube where for the pre-show it was

2046
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:08,640
vertical. Then it went horizontal.

2047
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:09,280
A Quibi style.

2048
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:10,120
Quibi style.

2049
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:11,480
Yeah.

2050
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:14,920
And it was obviously a little blurry because it wasn't 4D.

2051
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,600
I think I can summarize it real quick.

2052
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:19,040
Shrek and Fiona are on their way to their honeymoon.

2053
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:22,040
Shrek wants to take a shortcut through a scary part of the woods.

2054
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:27,120
Then Ghost Farquaad shows up and him and Thelonious kidnap Fiona.

2055
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:29,080
There's a chase scene through the scary woods.

2056
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:33,080
They want to kill Fiona so that she can be his ghost bride.

2057
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,480
Yes.

2058
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:41,400
There is a statue with Farquaad on a big pillar killing the dragon.

2059
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:42,600
He's rewritten history.

2060
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:43,520
He's rewritten history.

2061
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:44,480
That's how they get the...

2062
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:46,520
In his death, he's rewritten history somehow.

2063
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,160
He's somehow rewritten history.

2064
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:54,080
That's where we get the second reference to see a compensator for.

2065
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:59,800
But the end of the first Shrek is Fiona and Farquaad are getting married and Shrek

2066
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:05,600
rides the dragon through the stained glass of the church and has the dragon eat

2067
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:10,800
Farquaad alive and then is like, we're getting married and runs off.

2068
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:11,600
I'm a believer.

2069
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:12,720
Cut to credits.

2070
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:13,280
Right.

2071
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:13,840
Yeah.

2072
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:15,000
It's the graduate ending.

2073
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:15,520
Right.

2074
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:16,160
Kind of.

2075
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:21,320
This movie has this weird thing where it's like somehow in death Farquaad.

2076
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,360
And this is a fairy tale universe.

2077
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:23,760
Right.

2078
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:24,160
Yeah.

2079
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:28,320
You have all sorts of magical creatures, but there's no sign of the afterlife in

2080
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:33,040
the first Shrek and like Farquaad is this very well connected ghost who's in

2081
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:38,720
regular conversation seemingly with his living henchmen, Thelonious, and is

2082
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:44,360
planning this multi step, like lure them to the forest with this statue that was

2083
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:47,320
built to correct the narrative of my death.

2084
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:48,760
Which didn't that just happen?

2085
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,040
Just happened.

2086
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:51,080
He hasn't missed a beat.

2087
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:52,960
They're on their honeymoon.

2088
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:53,440
Yeah.

2089
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:53,960
He hasn't.

2090
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,200
There's been no problem.

2091
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:58,520
Like it's just he went from one form to another and it's just business as usual.

2092
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,200
And just immediately started talking with him.

2093
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:01,520
He has as much power as he ever had.

2094
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:01,800
Right.

2095
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:04,240
He's the most powerful ghost of all time.

2096
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:07,840
He inhabits the stone dragon statue, brings it to life.

2097
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:11,240
So then there's a dragon versus dragon chase sequence.

2098
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:11,800
Right.

2099
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,400
Wouldn't it be real?

2100
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:15,360
I'm just thinking out loud here.

2101
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:17,560
Wouldn't that be nice if that is how it worked?

2102
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:20,160
You just like all of a sudden you like died and you were ghost and it's just like

2103
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:24,040
normal, but I'm around and I can talk to my friends.

2104
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:25,240
Yeah, everything's fine.

2105
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:26,520
I just keep doing episodes.

2106
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:27,080
Yeah.

2107
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:30,080
It's all into a go past her day.

2108
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:30,240
Yeah.

2109
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:33,920
Isn't that going to be like one of the tossed out ideas for a Ghostbusters

2110
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:37,160
sequel was like Bill Murray helps train the new Ghostbusters.

2111
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:38,400
But he's a ghost.

2112
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:39,960
That was sounds so much better.

2113
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:45,320
And also with Farley part, maybe his whole thing for years and years was they'd be

2114
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:48,600
like Bill Ghostbusters three and he'd be like, I don't want to do it.

2115
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:50,560
I'll only do it if you kill me off.

2116
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:52,840
And that was just his way of saying like, fuck off.

2117
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:53,040
Right.

2118
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:53,760
I don't care.

2119
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:54,200
Right.

2120
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:59,920
And they like teams and teams of writers over 15 years were like, OK, so act one is

2121
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:03,280
Bill Murray dies, too, is he comes back as a ghost.

2122
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:07,720
Like everyone was constantly trying to crack the like Bill Murray dies in the first

2123
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:10,320
act Ghostbusters movie, they would have called him and he would have been like,

2124
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:11,520
no, that's not right.

2125
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:12,760
I meant, don't bother me.

2126
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:17,840
But there was one that was like it was pointedly like it was him mentoring Oscar,

2127
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:20,560
the baby from Ghostbusters to as a ghost.

2128
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,120
Was that the year one guy's script?

2129
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:23,160
I believe that was that.

2130
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:25,280
Yeah, I bet he died.

2131
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:28,160
I bet they've cracked it in the new one and he does die.

2132
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:29,360
Bill, you think he dies?

2133
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:31,880
I think he gets a Han Solo like noble.

2134
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:32,840
So I bet.

2135
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:36,200
But other but Answer the Call universe, Bill Murray is still around.

2136
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:36,480
Whatever.

2137
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:37,320
No, he died.

2138
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:38,280
He jumped out a window.

2139
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:39,200
I didn't see the movie.

2140
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:41,200
He's dressed like Paul Feig and he jumps out a window.

2141
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:42,440
They killed him.

2142
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:43,440
Oh, yeah.

2143
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:45,360
So that's the joke in there.

2144
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:49,800
I realize now I saw like a grainy video of Akred's cameo, but not Murray's cameo.

2145
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:52,840
So I contend that Murray's cameo was the good one in that movie.

2146
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:55,120
I think Sigourney Weaver's is a good one because it makes sense.

2147
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:56,480
You know what? They're the good two.

2148
01:32:56,520 --> 01:33:00,360
The other ones are all like fucking stab me in the eyes.

2149
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,480
I'm a big Answer the Call defender.

2150
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:03,840
I like it a lot as a movie.

2151
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:09,400
But any time they have someone come on and say the inverse of the line they used to say,

2152
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,440
I want to murder myself.

2153
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:16,480
Which Dan Akroyd pioneered in Casper with when he runs out of the house.

2154
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:17,680
Who are you going to call?

2155
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:18,160
Right.

2156
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:19,360
Somebody else.

2157
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:24,720
Also, we should have of course said at this point, we've defeated boss Dan Akroyd.

2158
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:26,080
Oh, we've already.

2159
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:26,600
Oh, yeah.

2160
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:29,600
It's funny to be talking about this post defeating a ghostly.

2161
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:30,640
These are major spoilers.

2162
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,800
For you, not for a listener.

2163
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:34,360
You know about it.

2164
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,800
We're in the underworld and we fought and defeated Dan Akroyd.

2165
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:37,840
Of course, as one does.

2166
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:38,680
Yeah, yes.

2167
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:40,400
It's all ironic to be talking about this.

2168
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:43,360
Yeah, we survived and you can listen to it at patreon.com.

2169
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:44,200
Slashbox guys are right.

2170
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:44,720
The underworld episode.

2171
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:47,040
That's one of those things where I'm like watching this.

2172
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:50,640
I'm like, I found this so I would have found this so funny as a 12 year old.

2173
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:54,880
And right now it makes me want to vomit when when Donkey says didn't.

2174
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:59,240
Oh, I know you died in the first movie to Far Quad's ghost.

2175
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:00,600
It's not a self reflexive.

2176
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:02,560
If you decide you're that early on.

2177
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:02,840
Right.

2178
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:06,040
Wayne's world knows it's that, you know, pretty quick.

2179
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:06,400
Totally.

2180
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:07,720
He's talking to you pretty fast.

2181
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:11,080
So that's a but you can't if you've never done anything like that, you can't do it

2182
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:13,480
in the 40 theme park movie.

2183
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:16,680
And there's a weird amount of fourth wall breaks where like Far Quad's ghost like

2184
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:18,960
pops out and like shushes the audience.

2185
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Like, don't tell them I'm a ghost.

2186
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:24,960
Fiona does the Matrix jump kick spin again.

2187
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,040
But Philonis gets her this time.

2188
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:27,960
Right.

2189
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,360
They like there are a lot of pop culture references.

2190
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:33,040
But oh, he says I see dead people.

2191
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:34,000
Oh, yeah.

2192
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:35,400
Yeah, sure.

2193
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:39,920
Like there's so much stuff that's so like it's it's dated both in terms of where

2194
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:43,760
they're placing it within the larger Shrek mythology, and it's dated in terms

2195
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:46,160
of every joke they're making there.

2196
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:48,560
This is I'm side noting too much.

2197
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,800
This really all of this makes me think that

2198
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:55,160
Deadpool really deserves a 3D film in a theme park.

2199
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:59,440
Deadpool almost is is being short shrifted

2200
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:03,680
by only getting mainstream theatrical movies and not theme park attraction.

2201
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:04,000
Yes.

2202
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:06,200
That is Deadpool's ultimate medium.

2203
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:09,320
What if also that's the first time we made it out of this before, if you get

2204
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:13,840
carted in a theme park attraction for the first time.

2205
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:15,200
It's not a bad idea.

2206
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:19,360
All these, as I said, all of these theaters are all husks in the Disney parks.

2207
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:24,840
You turn them at that Tomorrowland when the former EO turned that into a 17 and up

2208
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:30,760
only Deadpool attraction as soon as a kid sneaks in, though they're screwed.

2209
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:35,280
So the 12 year old comics are technically like PG 13.

2210
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:35,480
Sure.

2211
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,320
There's like one or two runs.

2212
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:39,560
OK, you could listen to that.

2213
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:40,280
That's more.

2214
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:42,680
You can still make some of his like cutting pop culture remarks.

2215
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:44,560
You call somebody Rosie O'Donnell or something.

2216
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:46,720
You can know that he's part of a theme park attraction.

2217
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:49,040
He can reference how much the tickets cost.

2218
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:49,400
Right.

2219
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,360
And he would also say like he would say,

2220
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:53,640
maybe I can't say the words I normally would say.

2221
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:54,240
Right.

2222
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:55,080
So there's that.

2223
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:57,160
I can't say it's a lot of Bob Chapek.

2224
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:57,440
Yeah.

2225
01:35:57,480 --> 01:36:00,320
And of course, call up parks ahead of consumer products.

2226
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:03,360
Call out the recent loss of themed entertainment,

2227
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:08,280
themed performers in the Bob Chapek, the Farquad of Disney parks.

2228
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:09,280
Yeah.

2229
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:12,240
He'll be bugging us past his death.

2230
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:17,080
There's a weird there's like another there's like stuff that like Donkey calls

2231
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:21,240
himself a noble steed, which I think is a call back to the first Shrek movie.

2232
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:23,480
When he flies away, he yells about waffles.

2233
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:25,280
And Fiona's like, what was that about waffles?

2234
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:27,440
And Shrek's like, oh, it's a long story.

2235
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:27,640
Right.

2236
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:30,360
And it's like that doesn't really pay off.

2237
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:33,880
There are callbacks like that that don't even function as like jokes.

2238
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:35,800
They're just kind of victory laps.

2239
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,360
Yes.

2240
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:38,760
Also, like you remember this thing from a year ago that you liked?

2241
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:42,640
Like Donkey was well, I want to know the logic of the travel itinerant.

2242
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:45,160
Like Donkey was coming on the honeymoon with them.

2243
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:48,120
But then at the end, he goes home back.

2244
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:50,440
Let's go home, sweetie, to the dragon.

2245
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:54,240
And it's like implying they're going to make waffles and fuck.

2246
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:57,960
And like Shrek and Fiona are like, OK, now we can fuck.

2247
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,360
But then there's a big party.

2248
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:02,680
So then there's a party that Donkey and the dragon are not at.

2249
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,240
But the three blind mice are there.

2250
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:09,840
I have not seen Shrek 2 since I saw it probably three times in theaters when it

2251
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:16,560
was released. But from what I remember, it starts on their honeymoon,

2252
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:20,240
opening credit montage of them enjoying their honeymoon set to

2253
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:25,360
Accidentally in Love by Cannon Crows and Academy Award nominated song.

2254
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:26,440
I remember that performance.

2255
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:29,640
And then they're like in bed, like post-coital.

2256
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:32,720
And Donkey like pops up in between the two of them.

2257
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:37,240
Like, I remember Donkey's introduction to Shrek 2 being a joke that he is

2258
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:40,040
showing up out of nowhere in an intimate moment.

2259
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:42,560
I'm all but certain that's how Donkey's introduced.

2260
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:49,040
So they need to explain why Donkey isn't with them for the latter leg of their trip

2261
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:53,400
to the hotel, but also can't make a movie without Donkey.

2262
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:59,520
So they have to explain why he's going with them on their honeymoon to a point.

2263
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:02,160
I feel like the movie is also

2264
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:06,960
is what happened that they go on their actual honeymoon, which is quickly wrapped

2265
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:12,720
up and then it's getting past the honeymoon stage of the relationship where they start

2266
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:15,640
to go through challenges and tribulations.

2267
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:18,680
And it's like the honeymoon is over.

2268
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:20,200
You could argue the honeymoon is ogre.

2269
01:38:20,240 --> 01:38:23,640
And that is kind of the main conflict of Shrek 2.

2270
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:24,000
Yeah.

2271
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:29,760
Does he in that where you end up at the end of Shrek 4D in that honeymoon suite

2272
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:33,480
hotel, whatever is that does he get her pregnant in that?

2273
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:36,040
No, the babies come in at the end of Shrek 3.

2274
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:36,600
Oh, not for all.

2275
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:38,320
OK. How many babies does he have?

2276
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:41,200
I should know the names of all of his babies.

2277
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:42,000
Like you should.

2278
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:42,480
Seven.

2279
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:43,520
OK, I do like them.

2280
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:44,320
I don't know their names.

2281
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:47,120
I don't know what they look like, but I do well say I like all seven of them.

2282
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:48,520
I like the baby Grinch.

2283
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:50,160
Of course, you are like baby Grinch.

2284
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:54,120
Baby Grinch is they all have very distinct names and they have like such extensive

2285
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:59,040
merchandise lines of like these are their different personalities, like Shloopies,

2286
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:02,640
like the sporty one, you know, like things that are not in the movie at all.

2287
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:06,120
But it was so clear they were like, this is like our Cabbage Patch kids.

2288
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:08,960
We can sell a green base and they're multiples.

2289
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,960
Oh, Scott, you're going to hate them.

2290
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,840
Yes, they won't see this.

2291
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:13,840
No wonder three is the worst.

2292
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:15,600
They're fucking shitty.

2293
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:16,080
Yeah.

2294
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:19,400
So they why did you like them?

2295
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:22,080
Contrary, I like them.

2296
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:22,960
Yeah, I like them.

2297
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,440
I met them.

2298
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:25,920
They're like my own children.

2299
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:30,320
I like to be the picture of one of the ogre triplets.

2300
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:32,560
No, it's a big thumb.

2301
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:36,440
Are there only three of I could have sworn there were like this is ogre triplets.

2302
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:42,680
There's three, but a handful of that is like seven Shrek father, Fiona mother,

2303
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:46,640
unnamed paternal grandfather, unnamed paternal grandmother.

2304
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:46,920
Sure.

2305
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:48,120
Why do they list that?

2306
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:48,600
I don't know.

2307
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:49,240
I'm not sure.

2308
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:50,280
Shrek's parents never show up.

2309
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:50,840
Yeah.

2310
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:51,560
Yeah.

2311
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:55,520
Oh, well, that really four movies and Shrek's parents.

2312
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:57,240
There's no Meet the Parents with Shrek.

2313
01:39:57,280 --> 01:40:00,040
Well, Shrek 2 is Meet the Parents with Fiona's parents.

2314
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:01,400
Meet the Fokkers, we should say.

2315
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:04,200
You never get the Meet the Fokkers, which would have been Meeting the Ogres.

2316
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:08,880
The Shrek book is largely about, from what I remember,

2317
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:11,960
I know this was a big part of when they did Shrek on Broadway,

2318
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,800
that Shrek was born so ugly, his parents threw him in a ditch.

2319
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:16,840
Jeez.

2320
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:22,600
And that was part of the anime movies for so long in the various incarnations

2321
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:26,080
of this film before the first Shrek comes into existence.

2322
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:28,560
Like Max Shrek's friend, the Penguin.

2323
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:29,040
Correct.

2324
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:33,000
That it was a Penguin-esque backstory, and that's why Shrek became so grumpy.

2325
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:33,800
Hmm.

2326
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:37,120
Farkel, Fergus, and Felicia.

2327
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:39,680
Oh, Fergus.

2328
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:42,040
Farkel, Fergus, and Felicia.

2329
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:42,880
Everyone say it with me.

2330
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:46,320
Farkel, Fergus, and Felicia.

2331
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:51,520
We got to make Farkel and Fergus and Felicia shirts.

2332
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:53,040
Oh, the ands ands.

2333
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:54,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2334
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:56,600
And unknown paternal grandfather.

2335
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:59,080
And unknown paternal grandfather.

2336
01:40:59,120 --> 01:40:59,640
Why not?

2337
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:02,920
Farkel and Fergus and Felicia and Griffin Newman.

2338
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:05,000
Oh, my.

2339
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:06,920
Shrek and Fiona's four children.

2340
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:08,160
So my memory is right.

2341
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:09,480
Shrek 1 is the courtship.

2342
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:12,600
Shrek 2 is the honeymoon, them getting over the parents.

2343
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:18,280
Shrek sort of overcoming his sense of inferiority about being lower class than

2344
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,240
Fiona, she of royalty.

2345
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:23,400
Shrek 3, she gets pregnant at the beginning.

2346
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:26,040
And then most of the movie is him being like, oh, fuck, I don't know if I can

2347
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:29,920
handle this. And he goes on this weird road trip with Justin Timberlake playing

2348
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:32,600
King Arthur, but he's like a brat.

2349
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:36,440
And most of the movie is just like, we want you to buy Justin Timberlake as a

2350
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:37,560
movie star.

2351
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:40,200
And then the babies are born at the very end.

2352
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:42,920
And Shrek 4 is like House of Handfuls.

2353
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:44,280
I can't take this.

2354
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:46,040
I don't have a social life anymore.

2355
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:49,080
Remember when Donkey and I used to hang out the good old days.

2356
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:52,600
So he wishes that the previous Shrek movies hadn't happened.

2357
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:53,840
Oh, that's why.

2358
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:54,720
It's a wonderful way.

2359
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:55,400
OK, OK.

2360
01:41:55,440 --> 01:42:00,160
So Shrek 4 ends with him being like, I do want to be in this franchise.

2361
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:01,640
OK, franchise over.

2362
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:04,680
And yet, yeah, then it disappeared.

2363
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:09,520
So that we have to explore the children in the next movies, however they come out.

2364
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:10,480
They could be grown now.

2365
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:11,240
That's the question.

2366
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:13,560
Farkle goes to college.

2367
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:14,760
Well, maybe a movie.

2368
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:17,800
A movie for each triplet.

2369
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:20,040
We should see all of their college adventures.

2370
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:23,200
They all go vastly across, far, far away.

2371
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:24,560
Where do they live? Is that right?

2372
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:26,560
Three kids just like the Roy.

2373
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:30,600
Shiv and Kendall and Romulus.

2374
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:32,640
Fighting for the Shrek fortune.

2375
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:33,880
Shrek star.

2376
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:36,080
Shrek session.

2377
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:40,120
That's it.

2378
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:41,760
That's the reboot.

2379
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:48,120
I found a People magazine article from May 1st, 2007, exclusive Shrek's babies

2380
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:51,280
revealed. So Shrek had a baby reveal.

2381
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:54,720
He sold it to the media, to people.

2382
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:55,400
What a whore.

2383
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:56,600
I graduated college.

2384
01:42:56,640 --> 01:42:57,760
Shrek had babies.

2385
01:42:57,800 --> 01:43:02,320
2007, hell of a year for all of us.

2386
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:07,080
So just a little odd little fact I found reading about this that kind of ties into

2387
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:09,960
running stuff into the ground.

2388
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:16,800
The voice actor who was the voice of Pinocchio and the three blind mice.

2389
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:18,640
I thought I had his name.

2390
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:19,760
I've lost his name.

2391
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,680
I don't have this connected to Wi-Fi.

2392
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:29,240
He also directed Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 and Open Season 3.

2393
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:32,120
Did you guys know there were three open season?

2394
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:32,640
No.

2395
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:35,640
I think, are there not four now?

2396
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,960
Are there four open season?

2397
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,600
I feel like there might be a fourth now.

2398
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:39,640
I'll have to look this up.

2399
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:40,520
Yikes.

2400
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:42,480
I have something to say about these.

2401
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:46,000
Me not being a particularly big Shrek fan.

2402
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:48,240
I think it's often a ripe area.

2403
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:54,200
The voices that are clearly done not by a famous person, but by a behind the scenes

2404
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:56,360
member of the animation team.

2405
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:59,840
Joe Ranft as Heimlich in Bugs Life.

2406
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:01,680
That was the big breakthrough.

2407
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:04,040
Brad Bird as Nemoad.

2408
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:08,240
Some fantastic characters have that equation.

2409
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:12,560
Most infamously, Walt Dorn as the voice of Rumpelstiltskin in Shrek Forever After.

2410
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:14,480
Walt Dorn.

2411
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:16,000
Good pull.

2412
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:17,840
I've got a Dorn head over here.

2413
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:19,200
I feel bad.

2414
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:23,000
I don't want to insult these specific people who are clearly great directors and everything.

2415
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,480
I can tell.

2416
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:26,760
I think there's something that bothers me about Shrek.

2417
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:30,400
All of the pigs in the gingerbread myth.

2418
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:34,760
I don't love them the way I love Nemoad or Heimlich.

2419
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:36,600
I feel like that trick doesn't work that well.

2420
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:38,200
The animator doing the voice.

2421
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:42,200
I feel like it's like, voices anybody could do.

2422
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:45,160
That's actually, by the way, very accurate.

2423
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:49,720
I've tried that once at home and that's it.

2424
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,320
It's not very practiced.

2425
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:52,640
So it goes to show.

2426
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:53,840
You can just throw it out.

2427
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:54,920
I don't know.

2428
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:57,840
That's just, I think, a criticism I have about this attraction.

2429
01:44:57,880 --> 01:45:01,600
I watched it and I'm like, oh, and these are animators who worked on the movie.

2430
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:02,320
I know this is...

2431
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:03,400
Cody Cameron.

2432
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:04,880
Okay.

2433
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:10,240
There were three open seasons and an open season, Colin's Scared Silly,

2434
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:12,880
which I think was a Halloween direct to video.

2435
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:18,200
Because we should mention on Netflix, where a form of Shrek 4D is currently viewable,

2436
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:21,480
it is filed under Shrek's Spooky Tales,

2437
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:26,560
which is a little Netflix subheading for DreamWorks Halloween specials.

2438
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:27,840
Can I really quickly...

2439
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:33,840
It's retitled The Ghost, The Tale of the Ghost of Lord Farquaad or something like that.

2440
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:34,840
The Ghost of Farquaad.

2441
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:35,800
I have the breakdown.

2442
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:39,960
So this was released on DVD with Shrek 2 as Shrek 3D.

2443
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:40,400
Yes.

2444
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:44,520
And it's a DreamWorks spooky story as the Ghost of Lord Farquaad.

2445
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:48,160
It aired on Nickelodeon as Shrek's never-before-seen adventure,

2446
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:50,640
despite coming after several of these airings.

2447
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:53,400
And that was aired right before Shrek the Third came out.

2448
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:55,600
It was in the drum up of Shrek.

2449
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:56,400
Okay, okay.

2450
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:57,120
Shrek Third.

2451
01:45:57,160 --> 01:46:01,080
And then also as part of something called Shrek's Thrilling Tales.

2452
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:05,440
And it was published as a comic book by Dark Horse Comics.

2453
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:06,480
So this has been...

2454
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:10,040
They've just fucking beaten this one thing into the ground.

2455
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:11,920
Is there any other prominent thing like this,

2456
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:15,680
where they showed the 3D DreamPark movie on TV and on Netflix?

2457
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:17,160
Captain Eo showed...

2458
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:21,920
There was a Michael Jackson marathon on VH1 in like 97.

2459
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:24,400
And it was the only TV airing of Captain Eo.

2460
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:27,840
And that's the only reason anybody could see it in any way,

2461
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:29,640
because that was taped off TV.

2462
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:32,520
During a Michael Jackson A to Z, they showed everything.

2463
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:33,160
Wow.

2464
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:36,400
But like a non-3D, a 4 by 3.

2465
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:37,120
And that's how people...

2466
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:38,480
So it wasn't the ultimate...

2467
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:40,360
Is that why people even have it on YouTube?

2468
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:41,040
Yes, exactly.

2469
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:41,560
Yeah.

2470
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:42,440
Or they would have to...

2471
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:45,680
That's why it has like credits and stuff you don't see in the...

2472
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:46,400
But like, right.

2473
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:47,880
Like Shrek was released...

2474
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:52,480
Like Shrek 3D was released as a DVD that was packaged with the first Shrek.

2475
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:54,160
When Shrek 2 was coming out,

2476
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:57,520
it has its own case that Shrek wearing red and blue 3D glasses...

2477
01:46:57,560 --> 01:46:58,280
Oh, and they give you glasses.

2478
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:01,040
...comes with red and blue 3D glasses.

2479
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:03,720
And you could watch it DVD quality at your home.

2480
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:06,240
It was a disc with just 12 minutes on it.

2481
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:08,680
DreamWorks was very candy about this.

2482
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:10,600
They had the full team back.

2483
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:15,920
They had like the A-listers working on the Shrek 3D, 4D.

2484
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:17,440
They working on that movie.

2485
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:19,520
Katzenberg oversaw the same thing.

2486
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:21,000
They retained the rights.

2487
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:21,800
That was their whole thing.

2488
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:23,320
Which is how they were able...

2489
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:24,600
We would love a Shrek attraction.

2490
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:27,320
They're like, we'll make a Shrek attraction and give it to you.

2491
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:32,480
And that's how they were able to sell it as a DVD and sell it to other theme parks too.

2492
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:37,320
It would be great if we knew how much money Shrek 4D made.

2493
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:38,040
I would love...

2494
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:40,080
What if it's the most successful film of all?

2495
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:41,400
That is what I'm getting at.

2496
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,560
Per minute, it certainly could be.

2497
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:44,840
12 minutes.

2498
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:52,600
But that's nuts to me in terms of just the beginning of the end of things becoming a little less special.

2499
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:58,840
You go like Shrek 4D opens at two theme parks in the United States of America

2500
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:01,680
and a year later is available on DVD.

2501
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:03,040
Yeah, that's the part.

2502
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:06,080
The attendance stayed high for a while, but you're just like...

2503
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:08,200
Fucking bloom off the rose.

2504
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:11,120
We're two movies past this in terms of chronology.

2505
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:14,080
It's available in four home media formats.

2506
01:48:14,120 --> 01:48:15,880
It's airing on Nickelodeon.

2507
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:16,800
Like, what is this?

2508
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:18,760
It's unrelated theme parks in Germany.

2509
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:22,600
And it's so bad, minus the 3D effects.

2510
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:28,720
Like, there are so many sort of like super sweaty, like someone throws a thing at the screen.

2511
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:31,320
Someone pokes their finger in the audience's eye.

2512
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:37,240
That is one of the worst ones I've ever seen where Shrek goes to the carriage.

2513
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:40,880
That might be the worst 3D in your face I've ever seen.

2514
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:42,760
They were also like these were all sent out.

2515
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:45,320
Like all these tropes have been sent up already.

2516
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:48,200
Many not even just in Muppets or something like just other places.

2517
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:55,240
I think that's what's so embarrassing about it is like Shrek is like trying to get off on being like the Deadpool of its time.

2518
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:56,040
Like, look at us.

2519
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:57,480
We're acknowledging the frame.

2520
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:03,800
We're calling out the bullshit of this other like family entertainment, like the tropes of fairy tales and everything.

2521
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:10,160
But then Shrek is earnestly doing the hokeyist 3D movie tricks without any self-awareness.

2522
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:10,520
Yeah.

2523
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:17,480
And it's like you want at the very least Donkey to be calling out like that would look good in 3D.

2524
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:23,320
As much as I wouldn't respect that comedically, I would respect it artistically as part of an attraction.

2525
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:26,560
It would be more in line with what the franchise is.

2526
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:27,200
Totally.

2527
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:29,560
And that they do it once and it's a bad thing.

2528
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:30,440
It doesn't need to be.

2529
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:33,160
He doesn't need to say you died in the first movie.

2530
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:36,680
He probably does need to say, aren't these some cheap 3D tricks?

2531
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:37,000
Right.

2532
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:41,280
Because otherwise, like the pre-show stuff is all like talking to the audience.

2533
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:43,000
Like the magic mirrors talk in the audience.

2534
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,320
The pigs are talking to you.

2535
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:48,480
They're explaining that they need to keep you in lockdown to interrogate you.

2536
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:53,880
Like the premise is that they're going to lock you in a room to interrogate you.

2537
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:59,240
And then just a movie starts and the movie just occasionally characters look at you.

2538
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,200
You're not like part of the narrative in the way that like T2 3D.

2539
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:09,160
It's like very clear of like they're hacking the system and now you're getting a glimpse into the future.

2540
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:12,040
And they're here at the Cyberdyne presentation and all that.

2541
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:14,080
Muppet Vision is a show for you.

2542
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:17,560
But it begins with the Kimberly Duncan and everything to get.

2543
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:19,600
And then like, and now we go to film shots.

2544
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:21,840
But then you get live action people coming in as well.

2545
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:22,960
Like it's moving back and forth.

2546
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:24,920
Muppet Vision is a show for the audience.

2547
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:28,800
Like Honey, I Shrunk the Audience is a presentation for the audience.

2548
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:33,200
I wonder if they just worked backwards and we're like, all right, we need like the seats will move.

2549
01:50:33,240 --> 01:50:35,840
So we just need a place where they like going fast through something.

2550
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:39,640
And we need a place where and they just like, just throw some jokes in there and no one's.

2551
01:50:39,680 --> 01:50:47,320
But also, nonspecific enough that you can probably transfer it to parks who don't want to pay for the full modification.

2552
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:48,920
Yes, that's true too.

2553
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:50,600
Yes, that you can sort of do that.

2554
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:52,080
I mean, I think that's like pre show.

2555
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:58,760
I think a lot of the success of that SpongeBob movie is that like the brand is strong and they have made it in a way where it works in any.

2556
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:02,400
For the theater, you know, like basics, there's not yet.

2557
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:04,680
And they don't have to build the theater to do it.

2558
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:08,120
If you have smells, then maybe they can put water in there.

2559
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:09,120
Water spray.

2560
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:10,440
I mean, this has bubbles.

2561
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:13,960
But it's not like totally reliant on it.

2562
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:18,120
It would be funny to look at like the list, the a la carte list of all the additions for Shrek.

2563
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:20,400
If you were buying it and like, do you want his fart smell?

2564
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:22,920
OK, that's going to be an extra two thousand dollars a month.

2565
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:24,120
Because he farts a lot.

2566
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:25,440
He farts a lot.

2567
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:29,640
Because there's drag, there are bits in this where I was like, why is this happening?

2568
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:36,960
Like the extended like, you know, in a 12 minute short, a full minute devoted to like Fiona crying in the onion carriage.

2569
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:37,840
Yeah.

2570
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:40,680
Like what? You're only supposed to be depressed after you get married.

2571
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:42,520
You know, years later, whatever.

2572
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:44,840
Like a great marriage.

2573
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:49,120
That's all the Shrek franchise just becomes like fucking Kevin can wait.

2574
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:55,400
Like that's what sucks is they just become like fucking middle aged like animators griping about how much

2575
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:57,000
they hate their home lives.

2576
01:51:57,040 --> 01:52:02,720
Well, also this the arc of this that you really follow is Gingy just experiencing trauma.

2577
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:10,000
He's locked up, manages to escape, builds a beautiful home and that Shrek and Donkey fuck it up.

2578
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:15,720
Another horrible joke, when they run, when they drive through the gingerbread home,

2579
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:19,000
it looks like Shrek has Austin Powers teeth.

2580
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:19,480
Yes.

2581
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:20,120
Oh, yeah.

2582
01:52:20,160 --> 01:52:23,600
That's what that gag is. I reround it because I was like, what are they doing?

2583
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:25,080
And then I realized that's the bit.

2584
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:31,440
It's that the filling, the cream and the gingerbread now resembles Austin Powers mouth.

2585
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:33,960
Wow. I don't know if I've ever picked up on that.

2586
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,160
I thought it because that's just like a Looney Tunes gag too with the piano.

2587
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:37,520
Right.

2588
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:38,840
But it clearly looks off.

2589
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:40,040
It's too specific.

2590
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:41,560
I was like, there's something going on here.

2591
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:47,080
I'm not getting I reround it because I was like, did it play into an effect in the theater somehow?

2592
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:49,400
And then that thing with the onion carriage was like that where I was like,

2593
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:51,520
why is this much time devoted to this?

2594
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:53,480
It doesn't really have any bearing on the rest of it.

2595
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:57,000
It's not like there's any emotional arc about like because she says like,

2596
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:58,360
no, I'm not crying about my marriage.

2597
01:52:58,400 --> 01:52:59,320
I'm crying about the onion.

2598
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:01,800
I was like, oh, right. I think there were onion smells.

2599
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:03,360
It's really stagnant too.

2600
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:04,720
And you can barely see her.

2601
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:06,480
Why are we just watching a half visible?

2602
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:07,800
I think it was a smell.

2603
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:12,360
I think it was a smell thing from my memory where they're like introducing the scent

2604
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:15,600
thing because there are a couple other moments like the farts or whatever.

2605
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:18,120
We're like, that was clearly a smell.

2606
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:18,760
Yes.

2607
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:21,000
You know, I'll say this.

2608
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:22,240
Some things I like about it.

2609
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:24,960
One great spot to cool down for 15 minutes.

2610
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,560
Great spots to cool down for 15 minutes.

2611
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:30,160
There is I'm trying to think of what the other gag I liked is,

2612
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:35,080
but I like the gag where Thelonious and Fiona are on the raft and he cuts the rope

2613
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:38,200
and Farquaad is yelling, you idiot, you're still on the raft.

2614
01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:40,760
And he's like, oh, like he's floating away.

2615
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:42,280
Oh, that's a solid gag.

2616
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:44,720
And then you get a crotch hit and then you get a crotch.

2617
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:46,000
You get a big crotch hit.

2618
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:47,760
Yeah, so much dick stuff.

2619
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:48,440
Yeah.

2620
01:53:48,480 --> 01:53:51,480
Pinocchio's nose is the boner at the end.

2621
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:51,800
Yeah.

2622
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:53,360
And that doesn't really make sense.

2623
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:54,600
That doesn't really make sense.

2624
01:53:54,640 --> 01:53:58,080
I caught that the last time we saw it before it closed.

2625
01:53:58,120 --> 01:53:59,240
Nose grows.

2626
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:01,000
But it's like, what's what?

2627
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:04,360
Because they're all talking like he's going to have sex with the dragon.

2628
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:06,200
And then Fiona and Shrek are also, I think,

2629
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:08,920
what they're saying something to each other about a honeymoon or whatever.

2630
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:11,360
The joke is like he wedges in between the two of them.

2631
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:12,560
They say, what are you doing here?

2632
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:13,480
He says nothing.

2633
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:14,520
And then his nose grows.

2634
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:15,360
Right. He's horny.

2635
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:16,520
What the fuck?

2636
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:19,640
The implication is like he's there to do something salacious.

2637
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:19,960
Yes.

2638
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,120
That is the illusion of a joke.

2639
01:54:21,160 --> 01:54:25,120
He's going to jerk off because he's thinking about either Shrek and Fiona or the dragon.

2640
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:27,520
He just drooled the people and rented the room next to theirs.

2641
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:28,280
Yes.

2642
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:29,040
It is the dirt.

2643
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:29,920
Hiding in the vents.

2644
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:33,360
It's the most nonsensical dirty joke in a theme park, I think.

2645
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:37,520
The rules of ghosts in this world, too, are that the dragon saves them at the end,

2646
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:42,520
can shoot a fireball at this ghost, and then it becomes little tiny ghosts that dissipate.

2647
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:43,560
Yeah, what the fuck?

2648
01:54:43,600 --> 01:54:45,720
That's a bit of a leap for me.

2649
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:48,920
The resolution of this movie is, oh, they kill the ghost.

2650
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,720
Shoot it with a gun.

2651
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:52,120
What are you talking about?

2652
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:55,520
That's the problem that you were saying, Mike, that if you just died and were a ghost

2653
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:57,840
and everything was the same, don't forget about second death.

2654
01:54:57,880 --> 01:54:58,160
Yeah.

2655
01:54:58,200 --> 01:54:58,560
Right.

2656
01:54:58,600 --> 01:54:59,400
Yes, that's true.

2657
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:00,160
You're right.

2658
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:02,240
So the first one hurts so much.

2659
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:02,920
No problem.

2660
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:05,680
You become Ghost Mike and you're so much more powerful.

2661
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:07,320
You have all the same relationships you had.

2662
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:08,560
Your friends are there for you.

2663
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:13,280
Second death, you become like a thousand little Mikes and they suck and they can't do shit.

2664
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:13,800
Yeah.

2665
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:15,360
You're just heads.

2666
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:16,040
They should really.

2667
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:18,080
So wait, Farquaad never came back.

2668
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:19,400
No, no.

2669
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:20,880
He's like a quick fantasy.

2670
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:24,440
No, he is not like the grand villain of the Shrek franchise.

2671
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:30,640
It's weird that they were like, oh, we're going to make the Shrek theme park

2672
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:35,560
attraction specifically be the Farquaad resolution, the Farquaad epilogue.

2673
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:39,960
That is not necessary because the first movie ends with the Farquaad being eaten alive.

2674
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:40,400
Yeah.

2675
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:44,320
So maybe the new Shrek movie is just called Farquaads,

2676
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:47,280
and it's about all the ghosts, the different ghosts.

2677
01:55:47,320 --> 01:55:48,640
We'll hear briefly.

2678
01:55:48,680 --> 01:55:48,880
Yeah.

2679
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:49,440
Isn't it?

2680
01:55:49,480 --> 01:55:49,640
Yeah.

2681
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:52,120
How much does it not land?

2682
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:58,560
The moment of he's back like they yell in the pre show that Farquaad's back and that's

2683
01:55:58,600 --> 01:56:00,920
supposed to hit you right in the chest.

2684
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:01,280
Yeah.

2685
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:02,720
This iconic villain.

2686
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:04,200
He's like, who care?

2687
01:56:04,240 --> 01:56:05,560
And why would he be?

2688
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:10,680
And so here's the funny thing that later for me is reading about this movie is they

2689
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:12,080
were all paid like 300,000.

2690
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:12,320
Great.

2691
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:13,200
I'd just rather bring this up.

2692
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:14,600
OK, yeah, go ahead.

2693
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:15,720
No, no.

2694
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:20,400
The first Shrek movie, $300,000 for the four of them, right?

2695
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:22,920
For Lithgow Myers, Diaz, Murphy.

2696
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:23,280
Right.

2697
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:26,320
300,000, which at the time was pretty good.

2698
01:56:26,360 --> 01:56:30,080
No one gets paid that much for being a voiceover in an animated film.

2699
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:32,000
They had no sequel contracts.

2700
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:35,680
So for the sequels, which they're starting production like two months later,

2701
01:56:35,720 --> 01:56:37,160
they got to strike while the iron's hot.

2702
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:43,120
Murphy, Diaz and Mike Myers each got $10 million.

2703
01:56:43,120 --> 01:56:45,760
$10 million.

2704
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:49,360
But then baked into the contract was you got to do Shrek 4D.

2705
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:50,880
Like that's pro bono.

2706
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:52,720
Like that's part of the deal.

2707
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:54,480
Whereas Lithgow, they were like, hey,

2708
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:56,720
can you do us a favor and come back and do this theme park?

2709
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:57,120
Right.

2710
01:56:57,160 --> 01:57:00,280
How much does it suck to be John Lithgow?

2711
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:03,040
Where everyone else, the theme park thing is like fine.

2712
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:04,280
That's just like icing on the cake.

2713
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:05,000
Whatever.

2714
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:07,760
I'm going to buy four new homes.

2715
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:11,520
They got to have tossed him like a few hundred thousand.

2716
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:11,800
Yeah.

2717
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:13,000
He got scale.

2718
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:13,200
Right.

2719
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:14,360
He got theme park money.

2720
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:15,160
Oh, no.

2721
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:16,440
We've heard it's not good.

2722
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:19,480
Nothing seems to indicate that it's good.

2723
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:22,680
Myers and Murphy did go to the premiere.

2724
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:24,280
They were at the universe.

2725
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:24,760
Shrek 4D?

2726
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:25,040
Yeah.

2727
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:28,280
They came to Universal Studios Hollywood and were at the premiere.

2728
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:31,000
And just really quick, other people there.

2729
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:33,400
Too notoriously anti-social, like anti-press.

2730
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:36,600
It was weird to see them hanging around with Katzenberg.

2731
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:40,920
Also at the premiere, Christine Lottie, Michael York, Austin Powers buddy.

2732
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:44,440
Then married Bradley Whitford and Jane Kaczmarek.

2733
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:49,880
Richard Schiff, Keenan Iverwey, and Donald Logue, Michael Gross,

2734
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:52,840
and Richard Dean Anderson and Childs.

2735
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:53,080
Wow.

2736
01:57:53,120 --> 01:57:53,840
Starst...

2737
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:54,520
Yeah, very strange.

2738
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:55,320
And Childs.

2739
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:56,000
Yeah.

2740
01:57:56,040 --> 01:58:02,080
Most of the Getty Images has like 400 photos of Richard Dean Anderson and his kid.

2741
01:58:02,120 --> 01:58:03,360
And Childs.

2742
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:03,760
So...

2743
01:58:03,800 --> 01:58:04,440
Ferkel.

2744
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:07,040
Ferkel Dean Anderson.

2745
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:08,360
Ferkel Dean Anderson.

2746
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:12,080
That is the very end of 90s coupled, Kaczmarek-Whitford.

2747
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:12,840
Yeah, right.

2748
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:14,720
Star of Malcolm in the Middle, Star of West Wing.

2749
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:15,040
Yeah.

2750
01:58:15,080 --> 01:58:16,040
Oh, that's right.

2751
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:16,760
Yeah.

2752
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:20,440
They were ruling like prime time at that point.

2753
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:21,280
Yeah.

2754
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:27,920
So on Blank Check, my podcast, we finished recording them, but they're still coming out.

2755
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:29,840
I guess by the time this comes out, they'll be done.

2756
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:32,440
But we were doing all the Miyazaki films.

2757
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:34,320
We went through his whole filmography.

2758
01:58:34,360 --> 01:58:39,000
And in our episode on Spirited Away, we started out talking a lot about Shrek,

2759
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:41,440
because I was like, this is a really interesting counterpoint.

2760
01:58:41,480 --> 01:58:45,200
Like, Spirited Away versus Shrek, they both technically come out the same year.

2761
01:58:45,240 --> 01:58:46,920
Oscar nominees against each other?

2762
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:50,560
Spirited Away doesn't get released in the States until the following year.

2763
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:53,960
So it then wins the second best animated.

2764
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,600
Holy weird, Shrek then Spirited Away.

2765
01:58:56,640 --> 01:58:56,920
Right.

2766
01:58:56,960 --> 01:58:59,720
So Shrek wins the first year, Spirited Away wins the second year,

2767
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:04,800
but they both are released everywhere else in the world in 2001.

2768
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:08,360
And they could not be further apart as films.

2769
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:10,760
And our guest, David Reese, has not seen any of the Shrek films.

2770
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:13,720
And I was trying to explain to him, like, there was a movie that won an Oscar

2771
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:19,960
that was like very seriously in the mix to win the Palme d'Or con that opens with

2772
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:25,520
Shrek ripping a page out of a storybook to wipe his ass,

2773
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:28,000
the sound of flushing in an outhouse.

2774
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:31,680
And then he kicks open the door to All-Star by Smash Mouth,

2775
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:35,680
which had already was two years old for Mystery Man.

2776
01:59:35,720 --> 01:59:36,960
It's already in a movie.

2777
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:37,880
It's the weirdest thing.

2778
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:41,120
And this was taken very seriously, this film.

2779
01:59:41,160 --> 01:59:44,880
So that started this whole jag about, like, how much worse Shrek has aged

2780
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:47,920
than Spirited Away, which some of that is the runoff of, like,

2781
01:59:47,960 --> 01:59:49,680
the shittier versions of Shrek.

2782
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:52,320
Because I think the original Shrek is, like, half good.

2783
01:59:52,360 --> 01:59:55,400
I think there's half respectable qualities to it.

2784
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:55,920
Yeah, sure.

2785
01:59:55,960 --> 02:00:00,400
I think it is weird in that it is so much existing in sort of like direct response

2786
02:00:00,440 --> 02:00:05,400
to Disney that it just has the least appeal in color palette of all time.

2787
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:08,720
Well, I knew you're portraying all those other things.

2788
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:13,360
They're having to show all of the Disney characters, but not Disney-ify the princesses.

2789
02:00:13,400 --> 02:00:16,200
They're just uglier versions of all those character designs.

2790
02:00:16,240 --> 02:00:17,400
Yeah, those choices.

2791
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:21,160
And it's that weird balance of, like, the humans are a little too photorealistic.

2792
02:00:21,200 --> 02:00:24,080
Like, they're not really stylized enough.

2793
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:26,080
Their facial hair is gross.

2794
02:00:26,120 --> 02:00:33,360
But it also, like, that movie has, like, a color palette that's entirely dirt and split pea soup.

2795
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:34,560
You know, like split pea soup.

2796
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:35,240
It's all, like...

2797
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:36,680
It's very pale. It's a pale film.

2798
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:39,600
It's very pale and, like, earthy in a bad way.

2799
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:42,600
But there's stuff in it that's respectable.

2800
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:45,920
There's some basic storytelling fundamentals.

2801
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:47,360
It works as a thing.

2802
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:54,640
It has, like, emotions in it, unlike the later entries, which become so, like, just gag bullshit.

2803
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:58,240
But there's the half of it that ages so badly, which is just, like,

2804
02:00:58,280 --> 02:01:00,280
hey, we all agree that Disney's, like, bullshit.

2805
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:01,440
Make fun of the theme parks.

2806
02:01:01,480 --> 02:01:03,000
Make fun of these stories.

2807
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:06,720
Have Fiona, like, sing, but her singing's so bad it kills a bird.

2808
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:08,640
Like, all this shit, right?

2809
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:11,240
And, like, the movie star personas and all of that.

2810
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:15,640
And when this comes out, I'm, like, 12 or 13, and my sister's a bunch younger.

2811
02:01:15,680 --> 02:01:18,240
So I went to see Shrek with her when she was, like, four.

2812
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:19,560
And she loved Shrek.

2813
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:24,800
And a thing that I didn't think about until we were, like, a couple Shreks in was, like,

2814
02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:30,000
oh, my sister did not grow up with the Disney classics.

2815
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:34,920
Like, Shrek came in at the point in time when she would have started watching those movies.

2816
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:36,760
She was three, maybe?

2817
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:40,760
And so for her and a bunch of people of that generation,

2818
02:01:40,840 --> 02:01:46,880
their perception of the fairy tales was the versions from Shrek

2819
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:52,720
over the versions that the Shrek versions are just riffing on.

2820
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:53,200
Wow.

2821
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:56,320
Like, it's this weird copy of a copy thing

2822
02:01:56,360 --> 02:02:00,000
where, like, you're getting the cynical version of the thing

2823
02:02:00,040 --> 02:02:02,800
rather than the earnest version of the thing.

2824
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:05,600
And they're all too young to remember September 11th.

2825
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:06,040
Right.

2826
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:07,280
So it's a really warped point of view.

2827
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:10,680
My sister thought that was just a big fire.

2828
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:12,800
It was visible out our window in New York City.

2829
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:14,440
They went, that's just a big fire.

2830
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:15,800
Did Farquaad do this?

2831
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:17,040
Yes.

2832
02:02:17,080 --> 02:02:18,120
That was her first question.

2833
02:02:18,160 --> 02:02:19,080
Was it visible out your window?

2834
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:19,960
Yeah.

2835
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,200
But this was, I said, I didn't get into that sort of detail,

2836
02:02:23,240 --> 02:02:25,320
but I was talking about how poorly Shrek has aged.

2837
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:29,600
And it became the most controversial thing I have ever said on my podcast.

2838
02:02:29,640 --> 02:02:31,040
People were irate.

2839
02:02:31,080 --> 02:02:34,920
And I was like, I just think Shrek, like, no one has fond memories of Shrek.

2840
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:39,120
And I said that confidently because there's such a fucking culture

2841
02:02:39,200 --> 02:02:44,200
of weird Shrek memes that feel like kids who grew up with Shrek,

2842
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:48,840
who are now 24, looking at Shrek and being like, Shrek is weird,

2843
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:50,400
and then meme-ifying it.

2844
02:02:50,440 --> 02:02:53,120
I assumed it was a whole generation rejecting.

2845
02:02:53,160 --> 02:02:56,920
It's like the first, we just realized that things can be bad.

2846
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:58,760
And this is the sacrificial lamb.

2847
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:01,640
That Shrek is kind of like cynical and gross.

2848
02:03:01,680 --> 02:03:05,200
And like, let's make fun of how cynical it was by, like, having Shrek

2849
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:06,920
make out with Hitler or like whatever.

2850
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:11,760
And do it like the 10-hour loops and bizarre and Shrek speeds up every time they say Shrek.

2851
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:13,240
The same thing as B-movie, where B-movie also feels like,

2852
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:15,280
oh, this is so weird that we watch this as children.

2853
02:03:15,320 --> 02:03:18,200
But is it just that they, like, our generation has meme-ified

2854
02:03:18,240 --> 02:03:21,120
The Simpsons to death and we love The Simpsons.

2855
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:25,080
Are they doing it to Shrek because they love Shrek?

2856
02:03:25,120 --> 02:03:29,080
That's what's weird is it does feel like there are people who still have...

2857
02:03:29,120 --> 02:03:31,960
And look, like, we're dudes who are super nostalgic

2858
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,280
for a bunch of things that people think are dumb.

2859
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:39,320
And all of us will stomp and like stand tall and argue for eight hours

2860
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:42,120
why the things have merit and artistic integrity.

2861
02:03:42,160 --> 02:03:44,920
So I'm never going to like shit on anyone else for liking a thing

2862
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:46,880
that I think doesn't age well.

2863
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:51,520
But my underlying thesis was like, I think it looks bad now.

2864
02:03:51,560 --> 02:03:54,560
I think it's a very product, very much a product of that time

2865
02:03:54,600 --> 02:03:56,640
in CGI animation and the capabilities.

2866
02:03:56,680 --> 02:03:59,840
Whereas, like, Pixar was more stylized.

2867
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:04,200
Shrek was going for a level of detail that now just looks kind of crappy.

2868
02:04:04,840 --> 02:04:08,160
And also that the film is so cynical, I'm like, I can't imagine

2869
02:04:08,200 --> 02:04:11,840
you would have like emotional, like, well, you know, like Shrek and Fiona

2870
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:14,160
and Donkey meant a lot to me, like, growing up.

2871
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:15,160
You know?

2872
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:18,640
Right, you'd watch it now and you'd be like, these characters suck.

2873
02:04:18,680 --> 02:04:20,440
Like, I liked them at the time too.

2874
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:22,480
Like, I saw these movies, I saw them with my sister,

2875
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:26,480
but I don't feel like my sister has any sort of like lost love for Shrek

2876
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:29,840
where she does for other, like, Daddy Daycare was like her movie

2877
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:31,880
that she watched all the fucking time.

2878
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:35,520
And she's got this weird childhood, like, nostalgia for Eddie Murphy.

2879
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:37,640
But it's like, it's that, you know?

2880
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:39,200
Like, that's her one.

2881
02:04:39,240 --> 02:04:42,320
But are you saying people were upset with you because they do

2882
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:43,520
legitimately like Shrek?

2883
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:47,720
Yes, I guess they were upset with me saying, I don't think anyone

2884
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:53,080
legitimately like Shrek, which I agree was maybe a little bit too broad of a brush.

2885
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:56,400
But I was reacting more to the the meme culture, like it.

2886
02:04:56,440 --> 02:04:59,480
But I think it is what you were talking about.

2887
02:04:59,560 --> 02:05:04,400
Some, I mean, people are, I feel like I read a couple things saying,

2888
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:08,880
like, the new Joker movie is not, it's less about the Joker,

2889
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:12,640
the comic book character, or it's about trying to process the Joker

2890
02:05:12,680 --> 02:05:15,480
as cultural icon in the last 10, 15 years.

2891
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:17,560
It's processing the Heath Ledger Joker.

2892
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:22,800
But like, Spirited Away, a movie I would call haunting, moving,

2893
02:05:22,840 --> 02:05:26,640
exhibit, archived in film archives, shown in museums.

2894
02:05:26,680 --> 02:05:27,280
Cinema.

2895
02:05:27,320 --> 02:05:28,880
Cinema, like cinema.

2896
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:30,520
You know, not in the park.

2897
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:31,400
Not paranormal.

2898
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:34,680
The same thing showing it to anyone at any age, at any time.

2899
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:36,640
Like it will always have a power.

2900
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:37,720
Subs or dubs?

2901
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:39,520
What did you guys settle on?

2902
02:05:39,560 --> 02:05:42,640
We mostly did subs.

2903
02:05:42,680 --> 02:05:45,720
The only one I watched with dubs of Howl's Moving Castle was because I was tired.

2904
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:50,440
Which they sometimes get like dubs for those Miyazaki movies are star studded

2905
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:51,720
affairs like Shrek.

2906
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:55,400
And feel like Kiki's delivery service.

2907
02:05:55,440 --> 02:05:56,320
He's the cat.

2908
02:05:56,360 --> 02:05:59,760
But they very much feel like, oh, who are the people in the Disney stable?

2909
02:05:59,800 --> 02:06:02,880
Or who are people who are big at that specific moment?

2910
02:06:02,920 --> 02:06:07,800
Where like Shia LaBeouf is like the sort of innocuous young male love interest,

2911
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:11,840
I think, in Nausicaa Valley of the Wind, where you're like a year later,

2912
02:06:11,880 --> 02:06:13,400
he was a leading man.

2913
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:13,800
Yeah.

2914
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:17,280
You know, and a year, like two years earlier, he was even Stevens.

2915
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:21,880
And that's the one transition, like the greatest game ever played zone

2916
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:24,560
where he would do that.

2917
02:06:24,640 --> 02:06:26,360
But the Shrek thing, yeah, it's very bizarre to me.

2918
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:30,800
And I also just feel like now Disney has sort of so reclaimed their territory

2919
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:36,400
where they've like even like more greatly perfected the Princess musical.

2920
02:06:36,440 --> 02:06:37,760
And I've made. Oh, yeah.

2921
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:39,840
And ones that don't need to be like they don't.

2922
02:06:39,880 --> 02:06:43,320
We don't have to make fun of the tropes of damsel in distress and that kind of

2923
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:45,400
thing. We can make fun of ourselves.

2924
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:48,440
All the princesses show up and wreck it, Ralph, too.

2925
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:51,760
And like in What's Her Name and Frozen, she burps.

2926
02:06:51,800 --> 02:06:52,800
Totally. Yeah.

2927
02:06:52,840 --> 02:06:53,520
That's the thing.

2928
02:06:53,560 --> 02:06:55,040
They took the wind out of Shrek sales.

2929
02:06:55,080 --> 02:07:00,160
They were like like Tangled is like self aware, but sincere, you know?

2930
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:00,560
Yeah.

2931
02:07:00,600 --> 02:07:06,160
So then that for me just makes Shrek feel like completely obsolete.

2932
02:07:06,200 --> 02:07:08,240
We don't need it. We grew out of Shrek.

2933
02:07:08,280 --> 02:07:08,680
Yeah.

2934
02:07:08,720 --> 02:07:12,560
But for a certain like the prequels for a certain generation,

2935
02:07:12,600 --> 02:07:14,640
that was their special thing.

2936
02:07:14,680 --> 02:07:15,800
Totally right.

2937
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:18,680
Which, you know, it's like I'm a little younger than you guys.

2938
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:22,240
I was like the upper end of middle school,

2939
02:07:22,240 --> 02:07:25,520
which was like, you know, and you're at the beginning of high school.

2940
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:26,320
No, for Shrek.

2941
02:07:26,360 --> 02:07:26,720
I'm saying.

2942
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:27,480
OK, right.

2943
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:28,160
Yes.

2944
02:07:28,200 --> 02:07:28,520
Yeah.

2945
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:31,520
And that's like the zone where you were like, oh, it's like this one's actually

2946
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:34,160
kind of edgy. Like we can like all go see this together.

2947
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:34,680
Sure.

2948
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:38,480
And then I feel like Shrek 2 I saw and it almost felt like nostalgia.

2949
02:07:38,520 --> 02:07:40,800
And by Shrek 3, everyone was like, we're not seeing this.

2950
02:07:40,840 --> 02:07:43,120
Like all my friends my age were like 16.

2951
02:07:43,160 --> 02:07:45,040
We're not going to see this, you know?

2952
02:07:45,080 --> 02:07:49,800
But your sister being younger and staggered with Shrek in a different manner.

2953
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:50,120
Yeah.

2954
02:07:50,160 --> 02:07:51,720
How does she feel about the later ones?

2955
02:07:51,720 --> 02:07:56,680
I feel like she only ever saw one and two and she was like all in on the first Shrek,

2956
02:07:56,720 --> 02:07:59,200
like had Shrek toys and everything.

2957
02:07:59,240 --> 02:08:03,960
And then I feel like just diminished returns like, you know,

2958
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,440
some other franchise came along that she liked more.

2959
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:07,240
I think, you know what?

2960
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:09,120
It wasn't a franchise. It was Devil Wears Prada.

2961
02:08:09,160 --> 02:08:12,360
She realized she could watch movies about women having careers.

2962
02:08:12,400 --> 02:08:14,760
And my sister was like, oh, no, no, this is the thing I like.

2963
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:19,200
Oh, my sister always was just from a very young age into movies where people have

2964
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:22,240
to like navigate office culture.

2965
02:08:22,280 --> 02:08:26,080
That was like we're like divorce movies, like rebounding after divorce.

2966
02:08:26,120 --> 02:08:28,720
So if Shrek was in the Devil Wears Prada.

2967
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:29,720
Love it. Oh, yeah.

2968
02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:30,960
It would be perfect.

2969
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:31,960
Now, too cheap.

2970
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,400
Yeah, the bricks.

2971
02:08:34,440 --> 02:08:39,360
But it was there was a weird thing where like Shrek 2 was at the time of its

2972
02:08:39,400 --> 02:08:44,360
release, the third highest grossing film in history.

2973
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:48,880
It was Titanic, then original Star Wars.

2974
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:50,840
Counting releases and then Shrek 2.

2975
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:53,080
And of course, now it is each.

2976
02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:55,360
It's Adam Sandler's Murder Mystery.

2977
02:08:55,400 --> 02:08:55,600
Right.

2978
02:08:55,640 --> 02:08:57,120
Is that the name of it?

2979
02:08:57,160 --> 02:08:57,760
What's it called?

2980
02:08:57,800 --> 02:08:58,960
It's just called Murder Mystery.

2981
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:00,840
They're working on a sequel, apparently.

2982
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:01,360
Yeah.

2983
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:02,800
Untitled Murder Mystery.

2984
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:04,080
Murder Mystery grossed what?

2985
02:09:04,120 --> 02:09:06,680
Like seven billion hypothetical dollars.

2986
02:09:06,720 --> 02:09:07,720
And you love to see it.

2987
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:09,720
We love to see it.

2988
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:11,000
Success in America.

2989
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:15,440
I just had a cursed memes.

2990
02:09:15,480 --> 02:09:17,520
Originally were known as viral ideas.

2991
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:19,520
And this might actually make us sick.

2992
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:23,200
Shrek comes back, but it's like Watson and Holmes.

2993
02:09:23,240 --> 02:09:27,680
And it's really topical because you can like do CGI quickly now.

2994
02:09:27,720 --> 02:09:30,040
So like Shrek is making Trump.

2995
02:09:30,080 --> 02:09:32,440
Oh, it's a self photograph.

2996
02:09:32,480 --> 02:09:34,240
Well, this is what I want to say.

2997
02:09:34,280 --> 02:09:35,920
I don't know if I'm jumping ahead here.

2998
02:09:35,960 --> 02:09:36,880
I mean, we got other stuff.

2999
02:09:36,920 --> 02:09:38,840
But if we're going to talk, plus it up.

3000
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:40,880
Let's let's do it.

3001
02:09:40,920 --> 02:09:43,680
I think we're veering into longest episode territory.

3002
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:46,880
I wouldn't mind Shrek 40 being longest episode is pretty perfect.

3003
02:09:46,880 --> 02:09:47,920
That's a good very fun.

3004
02:09:47,960 --> 02:09:48,960
Well, I don't want to declare.

3005
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:50,000
We'll see where it goes.

3006
02:09:50,040 --> 02:09:52,680
We'll save the parking garage Shrek.

3007
02:09:52,720 --> 02:09:55,320
We'll save the Shrek musical for another episode.

3008
02:09:55,360 --> 02:09:56,400
I think we have to.

3009
02:09:56,440 --> 02:09:58,360
Brian Darcy Daines is a true talent.

3010
02:09:58,400 --> 02:09:58,640
Yeah.

3011
02:09:58,680 --> 02:09:59,520
Yes.

3012
02:09:59,560 --> 02:10:00,480
There's a farting song.

3013
02:10:00,520 --> 02:10:01,440
So this obviously right.

3014
02:10:01,480 --> 02:10:05,080
They've replaced this with the Dreamworks animation theater, which feels so shitty.

3015
02:10:05,120 --> 02:10:06,080
Just in Hollywood.

3016
02:10:06,120 --> 02:10:07,600
Still running in Orlando.

3017
02:10:07,640 --> 02:10:08,120
Yeah.

3018
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:10,120
Shrek 40 is still in Orlando.

3019
02:10:10,160 --> 02:10:11,440
We can go see it.

3020
02:10:11,480 --> 02:10:13,760
We're going to go see it.

3021
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:14,840
We're going to go see it.

3022
02:10:14,840 --> 02:10:17,520
This thing they bring up in the yesterday video.

3023
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:18,120
Well, you should.

3024
02:10:18,160 --> 02:10:18,360
Yeah.

3025
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:22,880
I mean, get in for Falon's before one track for that takes priority.

3026
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:27,120
This thing they bring up in the yesterday video was that even as late as like 2007,

3027
02:10:27,160 --> 02:10:30,960
I think attendance was so high for Shrek 40 in Orlando.

3028
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,400
They built a second screen, second screen.

3029
02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:37,360
There were two theaters so they could double the amount of people seeing it every 20

3030
02:10:37,400 --> 02:10:43,640
minutes. In 2015, they upgraded the ride in Hollywood and built a brand new queue

3031
02:10:43,680 --> 02:10:46,360
like planters and stuff so it didn't look like shit.

3032
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:49,400
The you know, while when Harry Potter was going to open.

3033
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:49,720
Yeah.

3034
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:52,560
And then they closed it down in 2017 anyway.

3035
02:10:52,600 --> 02:10:53,440
What?

3036
02:10:53,480 --> 02:10:55,040
Why did why bother?

3037
02:10:55,080 --> 02:10:55,400
I don't know.

3038
02:10:55,440 --> 02:10:57,280
I wonder if it's like a J.K.

3039
02:10:57,320 --> 02:11:01,560
Rowling thing where she's like, nothing around it must look like shit either.

3040
02:11:01,600 --> 02:11:02,840
She just hates Shrek.

3041
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:03,400
Yeah.

3042
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:04,560
She just doesn't like Shrek.

3043
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:05,840
She thinks it's cynical.

3044
02:11:05,880 --> 02:11:09,200
We didn't even touch on the weird

3045
02:11:09,240 --> 02:11:13,320
meet and greet with robot donkey that was operated by someone who was almost

3046
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:14,280
always white.

3047
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:17,880
Well, yeah, you're talking about the waffle cart.

3048
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:19,120
Yes, that's the.

3049
02:11:19,160 --> 02:11:24,080
Well, no, there's this other thing where eventually the queue became that there

3050
02:11:24,120 --> 02:11:27,400
was a they stopped doing the pigs in the cages.

3051
02:11:27,440 --> 02:11:27,800
Yeah.

3052
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:30,640
And there was a donkey who could interact with.

3053
02:11:30,680 --> 02:11:32,400
Yeah, you're talking about the donkey in the park.

3054
02:11:32,440 --> 02:11:32,760
Yeah.

3055
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:36,080
But there was one that was the pre show as opposed to what you're talking about,

3056
02:11:36,080 --> 02:11:40,280
which is also there, which is the donkey outside the attraction waffle cart.

3057
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:40,760
And isn't it?

3058
02:11:40,760 --> 02:11:43,120
But that I'm saying the waffle cart is still around.

3059
02:11:43,120 --> 02:11:43,760
Am I wrong?

3060
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:44,560
Yeah, I think so.

3061
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:47,200
I believe Wal-Mart is still part of the DreamWorks.

3062
02:11:47,240 --> 02:11:49,080
Shrek is still you can find him.

3063
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:50,000
You can find him.

3064
02:11:50,040 --> 02:11:52,600
You find the farting troll, you know, all your favorites.

3065
02:11:52,640 --> 02:11:57,000
Isn't that so lame, though, that they're just like, oh, in terms of like theming

3066
02:11:57,040 --> 02:12:01,440
that now there's just an attraction that is, oh, look, it looks like the offices

3067
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:05,440
where they animated Shark Tale, you know, the actual show.

3068
02:12:05,480 --> 02:12:09,240
The office is all our friends are constantly fired from.

3069
02:12:09,280 --> 02:12:09,560
Right.

3070
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:12,880
It's like the same thing as like the Fallon thing where it's like,

3071
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:15,240
I understand like Rugfish Center at least is more iconic.

3072
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:17,280
Yeah, that's at least something you might recognize.

3073
02:12:17,320 --> 02:12:18,360
Like, oh, I saw this on TV.

3074
02:12:18,400 --> 02:12:18,680
Totally.

3075
02:12:18,720 --> 02:12:22,200
Well, for a long time, Disney,

3076
02:12:22,240 --> 02:12:26,680
Disney Studios in Florida has been like part of it is like you're at the Pixar.

3077
02:12:26,720 --> 02:12:27,080
Yeah.

3078
02:12:27,120 --> 02:12:28,200
So this is pretty common.

3079
02:12:28,240 --> 02:12:30,440
That's yeah, that is what the comparison is.

3080
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:34,720
The mythologizing of the people who make the thing that the rides based off of.

3081
02:12:34,760 --> 02:12:39,360
The Quibi offices will eventually be the home of a

3082
02:12:39,400 --> 02:12:41,040
there, but what they call minimal office.

3083
02:12:41,080 --> 02:12:42,840
We just wanted to do something a little minimal.

3084
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:47,080
And then you walk in and like, this is the nicest place I've been in 14 months.

3085
02:12:47,120 --> 02:12:51,760
The Quibi shavers, the Quibi barbershop quartet will sing to you.

3086
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:53,200
My favorite Quibi, Clarence.

3087
02:12:53,240 --> 02:12:53,960
Quibi boy.

3088
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:58,680
They are going to go back to some more traditional carnival, like fun house

3089
02:12:58,720 --> 02:13:03,200
techniques where the offices like when you enter fun house, the spinning room,

3090
02:13:03,240 --> 02:13:08,960
the offices will be long waisted and spin horizontally.

3091
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:14,840
The first room they all change aspect or is this haunted room actually changing

3092
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:16,560
formats?

3093
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:18,160
Well, this is what I was going to say.

3094
02:13:18,200 --> 02:13:21,480
So obviously, you know, Dreamworks Theater now, I think the whole idea was

3095
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:22,760
they were like modularity.

3096
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:26,840
We can replace it and add new things that are not specifically themed to one thing.

3097
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:31,960
And I guess have any of you gone on the whatever the country we all have done it

3098
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,520
together? We went to preview.

3099
02:13:33,560 --> 02:13:37,840
I live close enough by we get preview tickets sometimes to stuff.

3100
02:13:37,880 --> 02:13:38,760
How is it?

3101
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:40,240
Would you say it's better or worse than this?

3102
02:13:40,280 --> 02:13:41,080
I have not seen it.

3103
02:13:41,120 --> 02:13:45,480
It's better because it's new and it looks sharp and everything, but it's a lot of

3104
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:46,440
the same bullshit.

3105
02:13:46,480 --> 02:13:46,960
It's the sheet.

3106
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:47,720
The seats shake.

3107
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:51,800
There's a couple effects that are cool.

3108
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:53,960
At the end, there's a cool effect.

3109
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:55,480
It's better because it's brighter.

3110
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:55,720
Right.

3111
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:56,120
Sure.

3112
02:13:56,160 --> 02:13:58,840
And there's like it kind of invades the walls a little bit.

3113
02:13:58,880 --> 02:14:04,160
I feel like if Trolls World Tour does well, it will be rethemed as a Trolls

3114
02:14:04,200 --> 02:14:05,560
attraction within a year.

3115
02:14:05,600 --> 02:14:06,200
Maybe.

3116
02:14:06,200 --> 02:14:10,400
And that's a smart thing to be able to switch those out because that feels like

3117
02:14:10,440 --> 02:14:13,880
the DreamWorks thing that's on an upswing rather than like winding down.

3118
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:14,640
OK, sure.

3119
02:14:14,680 --> 02:14:19,680
But here's my like plus it up idea hypothetically, knowing that the thing is

3120
02:14:19,720 --> 02:14:21,000
already out of commission.

3121
02:14:21,040 --> 02:14:21,800
Sure.

3122
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:26,120
Talking about track, the topical references, the coarseness, right?

3123
02:14:26,160 --> 02:14:33,840
The thing to do would have been to replace Bill and Ted's Halloween Spectacular

3124
02:14:33,880 --> 02:14:39,440
with a slightly less dark, family friendly pop culture Shrek show.

3125
02:14:39,480 --> 02:14:42,160
Oh, that's great.

3126
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:42,840
That is great.

3127
02:14:42,880 --> 02:14:45,960
I didn't have that specific thought, but I also as we're doing this, this is very

3128
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:50,320
similar to the Genie from the California Adventure Live show, and it would be perfect.

3129
02:14:50,360 --> 02:14:51,240
Get the Genie.

3130
02:14:51,280 --> 02:14:52,040
He's out of work.

3131
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:52,960
Bring him in.

3132
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,280
Give him a four year contract to play Shrek.

3133
02:14:55,320 --> 02:14:58,680
He knows that I have paint on bright color paint on his face.

3134
02:14:58,720 --> 02:14:59,280
Yeah.

3135
02:14:59,320 --> 02:15:00,080
He's bald.

3136
02:15:00,120 --> 02:15:02,920
He knows he knows how to dress up like that.

3137
02:15:02,920 --> 02:15:06,160
He did the fat bastard voice at parties so he can do that voice.

3138
02:15:06,200 --> 02:15:06,880
I'm sure.

3139
02:15:06,920 --> 02:15:08,360
Yeah, there's no doubt.

3140
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:12,960
I'll even I'll say turn the theater, make a new 3D movie.

3141
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Yeah, because now that it's passed a little time, he's been around for a little

3142
02:15:18,040 --> 02:15:24,840
while the roast of Shrek, all of the characters, all the fairy tale characters

3143
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:27,720
give him what for and then he gives a right back.

3144
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:32,720
What I would love, since it is the DreamWorks theater now, is if it were the roast of Shrek,

3145
02:15:32,720 --> 02:15:38,320
featuring a dais of DreamWorks characters outside of the Shrek franchise.

3146
02:15:38,360 --> 02:15:42,480
Oh, because there are other characters do factor into the pre show of Kung Fu Panda,

3147
02:15:42,520 --> 02:15:43,520
which is a little interesting.

3148
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:44,720
They do start to emerge.

3149
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:47,440
Shrek makes a little appearance before.

3150
02:15:47,480 --> 02:15:48,000
That's right.

3151
02:15:48,040 --> 02:15:53,880
And there's a cool effect that is sort of exactly the same effect from Guardians of the Galaxy.

3152
02:15:53,920 --> 02:15:56,520
The character picks up things.

3153
02:15:56,560 --> 02:15:58,400
And Shrek asked to see your hands.

3154
02:15:58,440 --> 02:15:59,200
Yeah.

3155
02:15:59,240 --> 02:16:00,200
Yeah.

3156
02:16:00,240 --> 02:16:01,840
I can't do the voice.

3157
02:16:02,640 --> 02:16:04,040
I know I was about to try.

3158
02:16:04,080 --> 02:16:06,840
I don't think it's going to be more of the Gingerbread Man.

3159
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:07,920
My hands don't.

3160
02:16:07,960 --> 02:16:08,960
No, that's just rocket.

3161
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:10,000
That's rocket.

3162
02:16:10,040 --> 02:16:11,320
My fingers are too big.

3163
02:16:11,360 --> 02:16:12,160
Hands don't scan.

3164
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:13,360
My hands don't scan.

3165
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:15,040
My hands don't scan.

3166
02:16:15,080 --> 02:16:16,080
Fart.

3167
02:16:16,120 --> 02:16:17,840
Get in my belly.

3168
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:21,720
So the roast of Shrek.

3169
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:22,760
That's Jason's idea.

3170
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:25,560
And it's live puppeted so that we can reference.

3171
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:26,360
Oh, yeah.

3172
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:29,800
Like, you know, that you look worse than Giuliani.

3173
02:16:29,800 --> 02:16:31,840
It should be like 45 minutes long.

3174
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:35,960
Like, it should be like a full people leader kind of show.

3175
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:37,000
I think that is good.

3176
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:39,440
Everyone weeping at the end because it gets hard.

3177
02:16:39,480 --> 02:16:46,080
You know, ever since Fiona passed away, I am a single father of three.

3178
02:16:48,240 --> 02:16:49,360
I just have a plus it up.

3179
02:16:49,400 --> 02:16:53,120
I want humans playing the characters in the next movie.

3180
02:16:53,160 --> 02:16:53,760
That's what I want.

3181
02:16:53,800 --> 02:16:57,880
My plus it up to the movie franchise is do a live action, live action.

3182
02:16:57,920 --> 02:16:59,560
Cats, it's cat style.

3183
02:16:59,560 --> 02:17:04,240
But I mean, I want to cast, but I truly don't want any CGI.

3184
02:17:04,280 --> 02:17:07,080
You want a fully practical live action.

3185
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:08,440
Fully practical Shrek.

3186
02:17:08,480 --> 02:17:09,480
That's the musical.

3187
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:10,600
That's the musical.

3188
02:17:10,640 --> 02:17:14,640
So get Brian Darcy James back, which again, we'll do a Patreon on this whole musical.

3189
02:17:14,680 --> 02:17:16,720
I get Sutton Foster.

3190
02:17:16,760 --> 02:17:19,440
All of them are in there and it's just practical Shrek.

3191
02:17:19,480 --> 02:17:24,040
I have worked with people who like costume people who worked

3192
02:17:24,080 --> 02:17:26,560
in the costume department on the Shrek musical.

3193
02:17:26,560 --> 02:17:31,200
And it just sounded like the worst fucking thing in the world.

3194
02:17:31,240 --> 02:17:33,800
Like that poor man was just baked inside of this thing.

3195
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:34,840
He couldn't hear.

3196
02:17:34,880 --> 02:17:35,600
He couldn't see.

3197
02:17:35,640 --> 02:17:37,240
He was like dripping with sweat.

3198
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:42,000
The thing they told me was that they placed

3199
02:17:43,440 --> 02:17:52,440
sanitary pads all over his body, in between his flesh and the suit so they could absorb the sweat.

3200
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:55,960
Because it was impossible to take off any part of it.

3201
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:59,960
And what's so weird about it is like at that same point in time,

3202
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:03,800
like Disney has so many musicals running where their costumes are so much more

3203
02:18:03,840 --> 02:18:10,040
representational and the Shrek musical, they're like, he has to look like he stepped outside of the fucking cartoon.

3204
02:18:10,080 --> 02:18:11,360
SpongeBob musical.

3205
02:18:11,400 --> 02:18:14,400
He's just got a hairdo and shorts and shirt.

3206
02:18:14,440 --> 02:18:18,360
But you look at every other person, like if you get a photo of the Shrek musical,

3207
02:18:18,400 --> 02:18:21,920
everyone else in the cast has like a representational costume.

3208
02:18:21,960 --> 02:18:23,640
Only Shrek is stuck.

3209
02:18:23,680 --> 02:18:25,000
Me poor Brian.

3210
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:26,560
Here's the thing, though.

3211
02:18:26,600 --> 02:18:29,960
Sorry, Brian, you're going to have to do it all again.

3212
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,320
And if it's a hit more than once.

3213
02:18:32,360 --> 02:18:35,120
So Pam, I don't know.

3214
02:18:35,160 --> 02:18:35,920
I'm fine.

3215
02:18:35,960 --> 02:18:37,520
I was told it.

3216
02:18:39,720 --> 02:18:41,520
I think let's declare it.

3217
02:18:41,560 --> 02:18:45,480
Griffin Newman, you survived podcast, The Ride, the 3D film trilogy.

3218
02:18:45,520 --> 02:18:49,920
Thank you for bringing this mini franchise to us.

3219
02:18:49,960 --> 02:18:53,320
And it does feel like this is the end of an era in a certain way.

3220
02:18:53,360 --> 02:18:53,880
You know?

3221
02:18:53,920 --> 02:19:01,000
Well, I like and we do move from like what it's late 80s, early 90s to mid 90s to to 2000s.

3222
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:07,680
And this is 2003 and a couple of years later, 3D becomes a mainstream thing.

3223
02:19:07,720 --> 02:19:13,560
And also Ride start utilizing screens more with movement.

3224
02:19:13,600 --> 02:19:14,360
Sure.

3225
02:19:14,400 --> 02:19:16,720
This kind of like sit people down.

3226
02:19:16,760 --> 02:19:17,720
Oh, yeah.

3227
02:19:17,760 --> 02:19:18,920
Yeah, though they still have them.

3228
02:19:18,920 --> 02:19:20,240
They don't feel like the events.

3229
02:19:20,280 --> 02:19:22,480
And the DreamWorks theater feels so incidental.

3230
02:19:22,480 --> 02:19:23,640
Let's put something there.

3231
02:19:23,680 --> 02:19:24,120
Right.

3232
02:19:24,160 --> 02:19:24,480
Right.

3233
02:19:24,520 --> 02:19:25,360
Like sit down.

3234
02:19:25,400 --> 02:19:26,360
We're watching this.

3235
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:27,520
Yeah, maybe it is the last.

3236
02:19:27,560 --> 02:19:32,880
Because the Minions Ride and the Jimmy Fallon Ride are both like the one step

3237
02:19:32,920 --> 02:19:35,280
beyond it just being a 3D movie.

3238
02:19:35,320 --> 02:19:36,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3239
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:41,800
It does move, but like in a big just a big blunt kind of way.

3240
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:42,960
And Jimmy Fallon.

3241
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:46,320
Yeah, I think we got to do.

3242
02:19:46,360 --> 02:19:49,280
You're brave to volunteer and

3243
02:19:49,520 --> 02:19:50,760
miss Hagrid's.

3244
02:19:50,800 --> 02:19:56,000
We miss the window when there's not a thunderstorm shutting down Hagrid's.

3245
02:19:56,040 --> 02:19:59,680
We are on Fallon, an indoor ride we could do all day.

3246
02:19:59,720 --> 02:20:01,040
Yep.

3247
02:20:01,080 --> 02:20:04,080
Seven times to do for all the new ones.

3248
02:20:04,120 --> 02:20:08,960
But let's exit through the NBC gift shop.

3249
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,080
Is there anything you'd like to play?

3250
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:14,440
Yeah, Blank Shack with Griffin and David is my podcast.

3251
02:20:14,480 --> 02:20:18,360
By the time this comes out, we'll be doing the films of Jonathan Demme.

3252
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:20,280
Oh, that's cool.

3253
02:20:20,320 --> 02:20:21,280
Very weird.

3254
02:20:21,320 --> 02:20:22,840
Set up for that.

3255
02:20:22,880 --> 02:20:23,560
Boy.

3256
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:30,080
And I am on our cartoon president.

3257
02:20:30,120 --> 02:20:33,960
I play Jared Kushner on that, of course.

3258
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Typecasting.

3259
02:20:37,480 --> 02:20:44,160
It's a weird conflict of interest job because I like keep on wanting him to get removed.

3260
02:20:44,200 --> 02:20:46,320
Yes, like for the sake of the world.

3261
02:20:46,360 --> 02:20:46,720
Right.

3262
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:49,800
But then every time he does, and I'm like, no, another 10 episodes.

3263
02:20:49,840 --> 02:20:51,440
Here we go.

3264
02:20:51,480 --> 02:20:52,760
Another pick up on the contract.

3265
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:56,880
But if he goes, if he went to jail and there's plots to have him in jail.

3266
02:20:56,920 --> 02:20:57,360
Oh, please.

3267
02:20:57,400 --> 02:20:59,280
I have pitched that to the writers.

3268
02:20:59,320 --> 02:20:59,760
Oh, yeah.

3269
02:20:59,800 --> 02:21:02,120
Because I'm like, look, I want to have it both ways.

3270
02:21:02,160 --> 02:21:03,320
I want him to get arrested.

3271
02:21:03,360 --> 02:21:07,640
And I also want to keep on working on the show.

3272
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:07,920
Yeah.

3273
02:21:07,960 --> 02:21:10,440
And then people can still watch the tick on Amazon.

3274
02:21:10,480 --> 02:21:15,160
I keep on plugging it because I'm terrified at some point it's going to disappear.

3275
02:21:15,200 --> 02:21:17,720
All the all the streamers you do worry.

3276
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:20,160
But I say that to people and they're like, oh, do you know something?

3277
02:21:20,200 --> 02:21:24,840
I'm like, no, but I just feel like all of like anything that isn't outright owned by a streamer.

3278
02:21:24,880 --> 02:21:29,280
I think in five years, there's going to start being weird purges that people take things back.

3279
02:21:29,320 --> 02:21:33,240
I also think there's a weird like we were talking about it earlier with Disney and their stuff.

3280
02:21:33,280 --> 02:21:35,920
Like, you know, it feels like the company could have failed.

3281
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:38,120
I still think things are going to fail left and right.

3282
02:21:38,160 --> 02:21:40,680
Like, we don't know what things look like in five years.

3283
02:21:40,680 --> 02:21:46,680
I think three of these big streaming services are going to collapse in a spectacular fashion.

3284
02:21:46,720 --> 02:21:48,680
The book is dead out the door.

3285
02:21:48,720 --> 02:21:49,720
Not Quibi.

3286
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:50,800
Not Quibi. Never.

3287
02:21:50,840 --> 02:21:51,560
No, no, no.

3288
02:21:51,600 --> 02:21:53,040
It wasn't Quibi.

3289
02:21:53,080 --> 02:21:54,080
Quibi was 10 tall.

3290
02:21:54,120 --> 02:21:55,040
What are we talking about?

3291
02:21:55,080 --> 02:21:58,440
Since we said this real quick, I don't know if you guys know the Griffin.

3292
02:21:58,480 --> 02:21:59,680
I don't know if you know this.

3293
02:21:59,720 --> 02:22:00,520
There's a bunch.

3294
02:22:00,560 --> 02:22:04,680
You can just watch a bunch of movies free streaming on IMDB now.

3295
02:22:04,720 --> 02:22:05,240
Yes.

3296
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:10,280
Like Shutter Island, the Hey Arnold movie and a movie you're in Draft Day.

3297
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:11,560
Now available on IMDB.

3298
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:13,680
Now on IMDB.

3299
02:22:13,720 --> 02:22:19,000
So double feature Draft Day and Hey Arnold movie or Zodiac Draft Day.

3300
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:20,120
IMDB?

3301
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:22,240
It's like turning its own streaming service.

3302
02:22:22,280 --> 02:22:25,640
But then it's related to Amazon's, but it has a separate...

3303
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:27,480
I think it's very weird.

3304
02:22:27,520 --> 02:22:29,120
The interface is weird.

3305
02:22:29,160 --> 02:22:31,360
Does it make your star meter go up when you watch it there?

3306
02:22:31,400 --> 02:22:33,360
I don't know. I'm very curious to see.

3307
02:22:33,400 --> 02:22:38,200
You know, the Draft Day residuals always tell an interesting story.

3308
02:22:38,240 --> 02:22:40,520
Much like an NFL Draft Day in real life.

3309
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:41,280
Well, that's the thing.

3310
02:22:41,320 --> 02:22:45,720
I will always get one disproportionately large Draft Day check a year and go like,

3311
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:53,240
whoa, and then I'll remember that is the period of time processing after the actual NFL Draft.

3312
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:57,440
It's like that's the residual check two months after when the actual Draft happens,

3313
02:22:57,480 --> 02:23:02,000
where I think it plays on TV more and people like rent it digitally more.

3314
02:23:02,040 --> 02:23:06,280
The other big bump I saw was when it went onto airplanes

3315
02:23:06,320 --> 02:23:09,040
and I got a crazy residual check.

3316
02:23:09,080 --> 02:23:10,520
Airplanes play, really?

3317
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:11,600
It was insane.

3318
02:23:11,640 --> 02:23:13,640
I made... This is no exaggeration.

3319
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:22,200
I made more money in one check when it was only playing on airplanes than I did for doing the movie.

3320
02:23:22,240 --> 02:23:25,120
Now, that is... I got paid scale for the movie.

3321
02:23:25,160 --> 02:23:26,720
Okay, so I'm supposed to...

3322
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:28,200
So it wasn't like an insane...

3323
02:23:28,240 --> 02:23:32,840
I didn't get like $120, $1000 on an airplane, but it still was like,

3324
02:23:32,880 --> 02:23:35,960
oh, this one check, it has not come out on home video yet.

3325
02:23:35,960 --> 02:23:37,960
It is not available for digital rental.

3326
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,720
The only place it's viewable is on airplanes.

3327
02:23:40,760 --> 02:23:45,480
And I got a check that outnumbered me working five weeks for scale.

3328
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:46,360
Wow.

3329
02:23:46,400 --> 02:23:46,920
Yeah.

3330
02:23:46,960 --> 02:23:47,600
Whoa, that's nuts.

3331
02:23:47,640 --> 02:23:48,480
It was crazy.

3332
02:23:48,520 --> 02:23:49,720
So I'm hoping...

3333
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:50,680
These places can't help.

3334
02:23:50,720 --> 02:23:53,960
I need to be feels like it might be the perfect platform for Draft Day.

3335
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:54,560
Like there's certain...

3336
02:23:54,600 --> 02:23:55,840
You have luck with unorthodox...

3337
02:23:55,880 --> 02:23:57,560
It works well in certain areas.

3338
02:23:57,600 --> 02:24:01,960
A big flop wasn't even released overseas, but huge on planes.

3339
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:03,440
Watch it on a plane then.

3340
02:24:03,480 --> 02:24:05,160
Yeah, folks, watch it on a plane.

3341
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:08,160
Demand Airlines, acquire the circle.

3342
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:10,280
You ever watch the circle?

3343
02:24:10,320 --> 02:24:11,080
Are you in the circle?

3344
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:13,200
I am in the circle for like 10 seconds.

3345
02:24:13,240 --> 02:24:14,480
Gotta watch the circle now.

3346
02:24:14,520 --> 02:24:18,160
Demand it from your wherever, planes, I guess.

3347
02:24:18,200 --> 02:24:21,080
Get on a plane and yell, where is the circle?

3348
02:24:21,120 --> 02:24:22,800
Where is the circle?

3349
02:24:22,840 --> 02:24:23,600
This again?

3350
02:24:25,880 --> 02:24:27,720
Another plane full of circle heads?

3351
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:33,760
Call TSA, drag him off the plane.

3352
02:24:35,280 --> 02:24:36,800
Well, all right.

3353
02:24:36,840 --> 02:24:38,240
So yeah, watch...

3354
02:24:38,280 --> 02:24:40,840
Demand the circle to watch Draft Day on an airplane or an IMDB.

3355
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:41,800
That's my big plug.

3356
02:24:41,840 --> 02:24:43,480
I'm wiping my previous plugs.

3357
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:45,240
Just watch Draft Day and IMDB.

3358
02:24:45,280 --> 02:24:48,560
I want to test the residual structure for IMDB.

3359
02:24:48,600 --> 02:24:49,240
Sure.

3360
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:50,680
Yeah, you got to focus the play.

3361
02:24:50,720 --> 02:24:52,200
You've brought too many things.

3362
02:24:52,240 --> 02:24:55,200
That's going to be the only thing I promote for the next six months.

3363
02:24:55,240 --> 02:24:55,800
Good idea.

3364
02:24:55,840 --> 02:24:57,520
Just as an experiment.

3365
02:24:57,560 --> 02:24:58,040
Perfect.

3366
02:24:58,080 --> 02:25:02,600
Well, but we'll side promote Patreon.com slash podcast,

3367
02:25:02,640 --> 02:25:05,320
the ride, the second gate where we will eventually do.

3368
02:25:05,360 --> 02:25:07,000
I think let's just agree to it.

3369
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:09,400
Race to New York with Jimmy Fallon, with Griffin Newman.

3370
02:25:09,440 --> 02:25:12,440
The second you threw it out, I was like, I need to put in my...

3371
02:25:12,480 --> 02:25:12,960
Yes, me.

3372
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,640
You came off the back wall in the press show.

3373
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:17,080
Me, hello, hi.

3374
02:25:17,120 --> 02:25:17,560
I'm in.

3375
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:20,880
I have made so many people unwillingly watch it.

3376
02:25:20,920 --> 02:25:23,080
I have taken out my cell phone and gone,

3377
02:25:23,120 --> 02:25:26,240
you need to sit here and watch this with me, the ride through.

3378
02:25:26,280 --> 02:25:28,920
Come on down to Orlando next week, brother.

3379
02:25:28,960 --> 02:25:30,800
I attempt it.

3380
02:25:30,800 --> 02:25:35,240
I'm very fascinated with it for reasons I will save for a paywall.

3381
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:36,600
Yes, very much so.

3382
02:25:36,640 --> 02:25:38,880
Well, and there's side material.

3383
02:25:38,920 --> 02:25:40,240
There's so much to talk about.

3384
02:25:40,280 --> 02:25:42,080
There is very, very much to talk about.

3385
02:25:42,120 --> 02:25:43,160
So that'll be there eventually.

3386
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:45,760
We also, stemming from Shrek, we should have coordinated it.

3387
02:25:45,800 --> 02:25:47,600
We got to do Father of the Pride.

3388
02:25:47,640 --> 02:25:49,800
We also announced that at PTR.

3389
02:25:49,840 --> 02:25:51,800
We're the do Father of the Pride.

3390
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:55,680
And that's Katzenberg's height off of the Shrek supply.

3391
02:25:55,720 --> 02:25:59,520
And that is an example of what you said you wanted, Mike.

3392
02:25:59,560 --> 02:26:05,200
Donkey is just in an episode of Father of the Pride, playing Donkey from Shrek.

3393
02:26:05,240 --> 02:26:06,000
Yes, thank you.

3394
02:26:06,040 --> 02:26:06,640
Yes.

3395
02:26:06,680 --> 02:26:09,800
Existing in our universe.

3396
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:10,560
That's the best.

3397
02:26:10,600 --> 02:26:12,320
You know why we haven't done it yet.

3398
02:26:12,360 --> 02:26:15,720
I think we do have to do it because we said multiple times we'll do it.

3399
02:26:15,760 --> 02:26:20,720
I don't think we, anyone's had six hours to carve out to watch a full season.

3400
02:26:20,760 --> 02:26:21,880
No, we've been busy.

3401
02:26:21,920 --> 02:26:22,480
Yeah, I know.

3402
02:26:22,520 --> 02:26:24,800
And I think we do have to, unfortunately.

3403
02:26:24,840 --> 02:26:25,400
We do.

3404
02:26:25,440 --> 02:26:27,200
That does seem like the premise of the episode.

3405
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:32,040
You should just binge all six hours tonight before you watch Haunted Mansion.

3406
02:26:32,080 --> 02:26:32,840
High five, AM.

3407
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:33,440
You know what?

3408
02:26:33,480 --> 02:26:37,040
After three hours of podcasting, I'm feeling great.

3409
02:26:37,080 --> 02:26:40,480
And we'll definitely follow through with that good idea.

3410
02:26:40,520 --> 02:26:45,400
Boy, that first half hour of Haunted Mansion is going to be like more caffeine.

3411
02:26:45,440 --> 02:26:47,280
Yeah, like straight into the veins.

3412
02:26:47,320 --> 02:26:49,000
Energy. I'll be up for days.

3413
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:53,000
It takes half an hour for them to enter the house and another half an hour after

3414
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:56,640
they enter the house for anything spooky to happen.

3415
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:57,720
Yeah, it's a rough one.

3416
02:26:57,760 --> 02:26:58,120
Get ready.

3417
02:26:58,160 --> 02:26:59,560
Anyway, happy birthday to my dad.

3418
02:26:59,600 --> 02:26:59,960
Oh, yes.

3419
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,080
This is always coming out around his birthday, I guess, probably.

3420
02:27:02,120 --> 02:27:03,400
Something a little bit past.

3421
02:27:03,440 --> 02:27:04,040
Yeah.

3422
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:06,480
Happy anniversary, Shrek.

3423
02:27:06,520 --> 02:27:08,960
Happy Shrek-a-verse.

3424
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:10,400
All right.

3425
02:27:10,440 --> 02:27:12,760
Well, we've been going for, you know where our things are.

3426
02:27:12,800 --> 02:27:13,960
We'll talk to you later.

3427
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:14,400
Bye.

3428
02:27:14,440 --> 02:27:15,200
Bye.

3429
02:27:15,240 --> 02:27:16,840
Forever.

3430
02:27:16,880 --> 02:27:18,320
