1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,920
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,120
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate,

3
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,000
a podcast ostensibly about theme parks, except when it's not.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,100
I'm Scott Gardner, Mike Carlson

5
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,620
and Jason Sheridan are here, hello.

6
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,600
I'm here and I'm in the dark.

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,840
My name is Mike Carlson.

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,360
Jason Sheridan here as well with me in this dark room.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,100
I may as well be in the movie Bird Box.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,600
I've got a blindfold on, right?

11
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,480
Remember that?

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,840
Was that one year ago or three years ago?

13
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:46,500
Unclear.

14
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:46,920
Who knows?

15
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,500
It's the most popular movie ever made.

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,280
We're all watching it so often.

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,000
It's hard to remember when it came out.

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:53,480
That's right.

19
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,860
But we're not here to watch Bird Box,

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,760
not here to talk about Bird Box.

21
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,560
We're watching some stuff though.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,580
And we're gonna talk about what we watch.

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,560
There's surprises, surprises on you guys.

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,300
We'll explain.

25
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,400
There's a lot to get through so we'll dive in.

26
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,940
And first things first, let's introduce Podcast The Ride's

27
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,940
first in-person guest in 16 months, Eva Anderson.

28
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:14,900
Yay!

29
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,720
It's a hallowed spot back with the ceramics

30
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,960
back in the creaky green chair

31
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,480
which didn't break in the interim.

32
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,960
First person to be in the hallowed chair.

33
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,200
Edwin's growling at me.

34
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,020
Yes, he's unhappy that the people are here.

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,260
He hates the podcast and he humps my leg in stress

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,980
before people come, he can sense it.

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,060
I think it's nice to have that counterbalance

38
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,260
so we don't get too full of ourselves.

39
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,140
A constant presence that despises the podcast.

40
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:43,700
Yeah, yeah.

41
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,800
And maybe not you but he despises us, certainly.

42
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,240
Well, he doesn't like change.

43
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,560
He's like Jason in that way.

44
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,480
You can relate to that.

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,000
Oh yeah, it's a big trigger point.

46
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,760
Talk about it with my therapist for years.

47
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,440
Well, I hope surprise isn't too triggering.

48
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,740
Oh, surprise is delightful.

49
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,840
I love a surprise.

50
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,500
Great, yeah.

51
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,820
I would like to think this will be a delightful surprise,

52
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,980
maybe, to say it's not a horrible surprise.

53
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,740
It's not a marathon.

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,980
I'm not making you guys do a marathon viewing.

55
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,300
It's not- Father of the Pride.

56
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,420
It's not more Father of the Pride.

57
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,680
That's how it was set up to us a little.

58
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,160
Well, it's Father of the Pride style

59
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,700
in that we will watch some things

60
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,300
and then live react and talk about it.

61
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,720
But we were told to set aside like three to four hours

62
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,440
in the day, I think.

63
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,400
That's probably what it'll-

64
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,320
I feel like you said five hours.

65
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,080
Four to five, maybe?

66
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,920
I think four to five was the estimate.

67
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:32,460
We'll see.

68
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,520
I think it'll be less of that

69
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,600
but we could still figure it out.

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,560
I'm not gonna run you guys into the ground.

71
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,400
Eva has brought spicy hard waters

72
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,060
that we have chilling in the refrigerator right now.

73
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,140
Hard waters, you call them?

74
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,120
Hard seltzers.

75
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,900
Hard waters.

76
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,980
My other kind of water.

77
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,060
Water is seltzer, right?

78
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,020
Oh man.

79
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,280
I have a theory now that because of pandemic,

80
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,320
they've just been putting out

81
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,060
these really weird alcohol drinks.

82
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,760
Like there's the hard iced coffee that they have at my store

83
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,960
and a hard cold pressed juice.

84
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,320
That's not good for anything.

85
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,880
No, that kind of counteracts the idea, I think.

86
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,820
Hard kombucha, I've been seeing that pop a lot.

87
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,400
Yeah, that's been around for a little bit.

88
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,800
But the message is like, you could drink alcohol

89
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,540
all the time if you gave up.

90
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,400
It's like that movie that won the Oscar, right?

91
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,400
What's it called?

92
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,400
Leaving Los Vegas?

93
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,540
Oh, okay.

94
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,720
We were just drunk all day.

95
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,060
Not all things are meant to be hard.

96
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,900
And also just like, it's also eliminating

97
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,780
the hard step of pouring one thing into another thing

98
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,280
with that blend that actually makes sense as a blend.

99
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,600
I believe that Cut Water Spirits, the canned cocktail company

100
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,840
has introduced hard popsicles or hard otter pops.

101
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,200
Yeah, yeah.

102
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,740
I did a little of that.

103
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,720
I did a little, I put otter pops into alcohol

104
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,500
during the pandemic.

105
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,840
You infused otter pops.

106
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,640
I was infusing things during the pandemic.

107
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,020
That's fun.

108
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,180
It was just sort of like one of those drinks I have

109
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,780
at like a theme park.

110
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,480
Okay.

111
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,940
That's what you're after.

112
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,200
It wasn't crazy.

113
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,460
You kept calling your kitchen Pym Labs or Pym Labs.

114
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,060
Pym.

115
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,080
No, it's not Pym.

116
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,720
I had it, I had it.

117
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,320
I've been reading it since second grade.

118
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,240
I've just been seeing the word Pym.

119
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,760
And I didn't know how to pronounce it.

120
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,060
Kids are dying to go and eat at the restaurant theme

121
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,840
to Michael Douglas.

122
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,100
To Michael Douglas.

123
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,560
Michael Douglas.

124
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,060
Scott, I have a test lab, Scott.

125
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,600
Scott.

126
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,380
I just watched Behind the Canelabra again, it's great.

127
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,080
I would love to, yes.

128
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,960
Well, you know, that's a film with some amazing fashions.

129
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,700
Some amazing, you know, heights of 70s luxury.

130
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,340
And that might be sort of the realm

131
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,520
that we're playing in today.

132
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,760
Oh, just to really clarify,

133
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,440
this was sort of an Eva and I scheme

134
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,920
hatched late one night for no particular,

135
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,600
there's no vilification in surprising Mike and Jason.

136
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:05,840
Sure.

137
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,580
Just seemed like a fun way to do it,

138
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,120
to just spring this on you in the moment.

139
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,840
I just wanna tease too, and I said it to you,

140
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,820
that there is sort of a thing

141
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,580
I was going to surprise you guys with,

142
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,400
with Eva, what you were talking about months and months ago.

143
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,380
You may not even remember.

144
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,660
I don't know if I remember.

145
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,520
Yeah, there was a little,

146
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,840
there was an idea we had for later.

147
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,040
So there might be another surprise.

148
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,480
This is a forgotten secret surprise.

149
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,600
Yeah, I'll remind you later.

150
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,480
All right, all right.

151
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,800
So basically I've been like texting with Scott about this

152
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,580
and I was like, I wonder if this could be a second gate,

153
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,260
but I don't know if the connection is there

154
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,480
that makes it justifiable.

155
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,760
Like, you know, it's like borderline Billy Toppett.

156
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,300
Yeah.

157
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,160
Like, you know, does this count?

158
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,400
And then I found this quote

159
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,720
that I think ties this all together.

160
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,500
Yeah, like kicked it over the fence,

161
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,300
way, way over the fence.

162
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:51,620
Wow.

163
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,340
It is so tied in to,

164
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,960
inextricably, is that the correct word,

165
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,380
to what we like and what we talk about?

166
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,340
So this is a, yeah, quote from the book,

167
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,800
this book that we'll be referencing, and here it is.

168
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,160
It's from Marty Croft.

169
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,040
Oh, all right.

170
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,180
There's a link already.

171
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,980
We got the Crofts involved.

172
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,800
Michael Eisner called me and said,

173
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,800
hey, I have a new show for you.

174
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,400
Let Donnie and Marie go to Utah.

175
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,240
You'll stay here.

176
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,280
I want you to do the Brady Bunch Variety Hour.

177
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,340
So I said, yes, that was the first mistake I made.

178
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,740
That's how it all started.

179
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,080
That's Marty Croft on the Brady Bunch Variety Hour.

180
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,760
On the Brady Bunch Variety Hour.

181
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,560
That is what we will be watching and talking about.

182
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,620
Oh, wow.

183
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,920
Have you guys seen it before?

184
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,580
I have not.

185
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,100
No, I haven't seen it.

186
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,680
The bits and pieces.

187
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,740
Of the Brady Bunch Variety Hour,

188
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,500
but I've never watched a whole episode

189
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,260
or like what, 90 minutes, is it 90?

190
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,180
How long is it?

191
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,160
It's about 40 minutes an episode.

192
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,680
Okay, so we're watching the whole?

193
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,820
Not the full series.

194
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,160
I would have said more time if that was gonna be the case.

195
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,040
I have a DVD of episode one and episode four.

196
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,660
Okay, great.

197
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,780
And I would like us to watch the pilot just off air,

198
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,780
and then we'll come back and we'll talk about it.

199
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,980
We'll get some context.

200
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,660
We'll get your guys' reactions,

201
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,800
and then we'll move forward in the best way possible.

202
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,720
Sure, the potential of other odds and ends too,

203
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,560
you were saying, because there's things outside

204
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,640
of the strong moments within episodes

205
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,100
that aren't entirely essential.

206
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:17,720
Yes.

207
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,720
Though it's all clearly essential.

208
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,400
Right.

209
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:20,880
Okay.

210
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,660
I spent the last week watching all of it.

211
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,020
So you really know.

212
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,000
I really know what happens on it in every episode.

213
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,080
And I also, we each did some research,

214
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,240
read some books that have some context and some history.

215
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,400
Yeah, so we'll teach you guys,

216
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,860
we'll teach the audience,

217
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,820
I guess some major bullet points before we dive in.

218
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,400
If you've made it this far in the podcast,

219
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,420
I don't think we have to explain the Brady Bunch

220
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,660
from the ground up.

221
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,880
But beloved, relatively grounded sort of family sitcom

222
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,120
that ran from 69 to 74.

223
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,140
I say in terms, you know, there's an alien episode,

224
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,880
but what didn't have an alien episode in the 70s?

225
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,040
Was that the last season?

226
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,300
Yeah, I think so.

227
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,920
Yeah, with the Cousin Oliver season where they had aliens?

228
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,520
Yeah, well, it had, yes,

229
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,680
it's the Flintstone style unravel.

230
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,480
Cousin Oliver in general is sort of a weird latter day

231
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,960
mistake, you might say.

232
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,620
The show ended with this weird episode

233
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,660
that involved a hair tonic

234
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,780
and the youngest brother, Bobby,

235
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,240
dying the hair of Greg, the oldest brother,

236
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,040
bright red before his graduation.

237
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,880
This episode was so infuriating that Robert Reed,

238
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,240
who played the father, sent massive memos

239
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,160
to the producers of the show

240
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,680
explaining why this is not a good plot

241
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,140
and not a good direction for the series to go.

242
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,560
One of which being like,

243
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,880
how in the world would a nine-year-old child

244
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,120
in the 20th century be dealing in hair tonic?

245
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,260
Where is he getting it?

246
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,360
Who is his vendor?

247
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,120
Completely the realm of fiction.

248
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,200
He refused to appear in the final episode of the show.

249
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,480
And then it was just sort of yanked off the air

250
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,300
and this awkward cousin Oliver, it just sort of unraveled.

251
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,600
But in the intervening years,

252
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,200
not nostalgia, because it was just on,

253
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,480
but the popularity of the show only grew and grew.

254
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,320
So it gets to 1977 and Michael Eisner,

255
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,380
ever the pursuer of financial opportunities

256
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,100
of crossover tie-ins,

257
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,560
realizes maybe we need to bring this thing back in some way

258
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,000
and he's maybe gonna lose Sid and Marty Croft

259
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,680
or wants to keep them happy,

260
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,460
wants to keep them employed in the variety realm

261
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,500
that they are dominating at the time.

262
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,040
Besides their kids shows,

263
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,180
they're also doing Donnie and Marie,

264
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,800
which has to explain why they would have even thought

265
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,660
to give the Brady Bunch a singing, dancing variety hour,

266
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,860
because why does it?

267
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,360
I feel like it's some Donnie and Marie tie-in.

268
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,580
Like it's a family and that makes sense.

269
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,920
What year is the variety show?

270
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,220
77.

271
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,680
Yeah, shot in 76 and 77.

272
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,580
I don't, maybe this is not a second gate,

273
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,160
but we were just watching last night,

274
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,760
cause I'm fascinated,

275
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,520
cause both Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke

276
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,600
had their own variety shows, sketch shows.

277
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,840
Oh yeah, Mary with David Letterman.

278
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,180
With David Letterman, Michael Keaton.

279
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,720
And then Dick for the Van Dyke and company

280
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,840
and Lucille Ball is on and Andy Kaufman is on that.

281
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,480
Oh wow.

282
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,480
Oh yeah.

283
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,420
And it's weird.

284
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,000
I mean, some of it's okay,

285
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,420
but like it's just, it was interesting.

286
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,940
Everyone was like, Saturday Night Live is out,

287
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,220
but then like there's all this old school variety

288
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,020
still on TV.

289
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,500
They had broke, so the Brady's also in the kind of later

290
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,540
years, they had done a show at the Hollywood Bowl,

291
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,760
like the Brady Bunch Live.

292
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,120
They were performing occasionally at Knott's Berry Farm.

293
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,300
But the really important thing was that most of them

294
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,260
could not sing or dance.

295
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,800
Two of them could very well, Florence Henderson

296
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,900
and Barry Williams were both like at this point

297
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,020
in the intervening years become like Broadway stars.

298
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,040
Like Barry Williams was in Pippin.

299
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,020
like she was already known for that before the Brady Bunch.

300
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,960
Tons and tons of musicals.

301
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,300
But they go to Barry Williams and they say,

302
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,480
it's gonna be the Barry Williams show

303
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,060
featuring the Brady Bunch.

304
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,880
They go to the middle son, Christopher Knight,

305
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,420
and they say, he says, well, I don't wanna dance.

306
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,300
They're like, you're not gonna dance.

307
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,860
No, you won't have to sing and dance.

308
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,980
Like they'll just do comedy sketches.

309
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,880
You'll be the funny one and we won't make you sing and dance.

310
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,820
And they just lie to every single person

311
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,860
to get them on board.

312
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,280
And they basically, and the only person who was like

313
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,000
really excited besides the two of them was Robert Reed,

314
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,220
who's just liked the idea of singing and dancing.

315
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,580
One other interesting thing is Sherwood Schwartz,

316
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,000
the creator of the original Brady Bunch,

317
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,780
found out about this show when he read about it in TV Guide.

318
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,200
Oh, wow.

319
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:35,520
Really?

320
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:35,960
What?

321
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,280
That's how much he was not.

322
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,460
Wait, it was coming out and that's how he learned.

323
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,760
Yeah, he was also like by all accounts,

324
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,940
a very bad person who like didn't go to Robert Reed's funeral.

325
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,020
Oh wow, really?

326
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,180
Yeah, so really bad guy.

327
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,780
But he did read about it in TV Guide

328
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,700
and went like a what?

329
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,480
Wow, that's wild.

330
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,820
There was two things, two things theme park related.

331
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,320
Just now I was thinking, of course,

332
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,220
Robert Reed saved the Brady kids

333
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,060
on a roller coaster in real life.

334
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,180
Yes, when they went to Kings Island,

335
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,660
there was a pretty, what looks to him like a rickety rig

336
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,640
on top in front of a roller coaster

337
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,720
where they were gonna shoot a scene.

338
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,180
And he walked up and like,

339
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,920
this thing's gonna look at the clearance there.

340
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,520
It's gonna come clean off.

341
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,500
And then they did fine, we'll do a test.

342
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,520
They did it, it did come clean off.

343
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,460
It decapitated all of the Brady kids.

344
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,400
So while he hated the show a lot of the time

345
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,540
and sent these mean memos,

346
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,500
maybe he might've been correct.

347
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,740
He hated Sherwood Schwartz.

348
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,080
Okay, and that seems to add up.

349
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,100
By all accounts, he and Florence Henderson

350
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,680
were very protective of the kids.

351
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,240
Which leads to, you probably have heard

352
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,100
about this other big hank in trying

353
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,020
to get this thing together.

354
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,980
Is that Eve Plumb, who played Jan,

355
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,660
was just starting to become very popular

356
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,240
as like a movie of the week actress.

357
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,220
And so she wanted that kind of build out

358
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,560
into her contract so she could do some other stuff.

359
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,200
They were like, no.

360
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,720
So she just didn't, she said no.

361
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,280
And that is referenced, of course,

362
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,780
in the Simpsons parody, the Simpsons variety hour

363
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,180
where Lisa is replaced.

364
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,700
So you'll notice a fake Jan.

365
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,960
There's fake Jan in this.

366
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,160
Fake Jan.

367
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,620
When we were talking about all this,

368
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,160
I was recalling how,

369
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,300
when there was this 90s Brady's mania,

370
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,880
some of it just being like,

371
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,400
remembering it in this 20 year itch kind of way.

372
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,260
And now we get that there's an ironic level

373
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,560
and then the movies were made,

374
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,540
which I still am very fond of.

375
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,600
I bought all this hook, line, and sinker.

376
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,320
I loved all this so much.

377
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,140
To the point where when the Simpsons episode came out,

378
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,260
I'm like, oh, I see, of course,

379
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,020
they are referencing Jerry Reichel

380
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,920
having to come in as fake Jan.

381
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,040
I am 11 years old.

382
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,620
And I completely know what they're doing.

383
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,220
I am really close to having to start dating,

384
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,800
having to start growing up.

385
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,940
By the way, you don't have to.

386
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,300
Yes, yeah, that's what I figured out now.

387
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,120
Now I just kind of, I did a weird route.

388
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,040
Yeah, I was just,

389
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,040
I could not have been more socially screwed

390
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,620
by the fact that I understood the Jerry Reichel.

391
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,720
You would have won up to me

392
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,220
because I knew the reference,

393
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,040
I knew the history, I think, in general, vaguely,

394
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,140
but I did not know Jerry Reichel's name.

395
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,880
So you would have dropped the mic on me

396
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,760
at the playground if we were in the same school.

397
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,680
At a trivia contest,

398
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,840
between a 70s trivia contest among 11-year-olds in 1996.

399
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,320
Yeah, I would have been able to be like,

400
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,820
I can name the cast of I Dream a Genie for you,

401
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,240
but I can't name the extra Jan.

402
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,820
Yeah, I couldn't.

403
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,540
Both Aarons.

404
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,860
Yeah, I could name all the sweat hogs, probably.

405
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,080
I really liked Welcome Back Hotter

406
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,300
for a short period of time.

407
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,060
It wasn't on Nick at Night for long,

408
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,900
but I got really into it once.

409
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,600
I think we've also, I've also floated the idea

410
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,600
of reviewing one of Barry Williams' Branson shows

411
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,680
on the second case.

412
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,820
I would absolutely go to Branson.

413
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,260
Yeah.

414
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:53,980
Are we going to Branson?

415
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,580
I think we can.

416
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,500
That's probably a good idea.

417
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,320
All of the four of us go to Branson.

418
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,460
I think I'm two degrees away from Barry Williams also.

419
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,560
I think we could get him on the show.

420
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,440
Well, I also just,

421
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,360
I think I mentioned this in a previous episode,

422
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,360
but I tricked Barry Williams into signing a DVD

423
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,580
of this show.

424
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,080
Trick.

425
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,960
Oh, wait, that's right.

426
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,460
Wait, wait, wait, what was the story again?

427
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,400
I was working on the, like a Comedy Central special

428
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,360
for Dickie Roberts, former child star,

429
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,000
and it had just a bunch of former child stars in it.

430
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,640
Like, and this was also when Emmanuel Lewis tricked me

431
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,720
into driving him to the Nick at Night convention

432
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,300
by acting like he wanted to rent a car there

433
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,440
and then like just ran inside and got lost.

434
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,560
I was like 23 years old.

435
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,440
He made me call him Manny Moe.

436
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,540
And, but anyway, and Leif Garrett quit last second,

437
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,980
like called me crying.

438
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,700
Like he was like, Eva, I quit.

439
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,180
And then he, an hour later was like, I'm fine.

440
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,720
And we'd already replaced them with another guy.

441
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,760
Like Butch Patrick or something?

442
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,060
Yeah, but I turned the DVD cover inside out

443
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,520
and got him to sign it.

444
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,780
And then he asked me what it was and I showed him

445
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,680
and he kind of like glowered at me.

446
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,340
Oh no.

447
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,700
And then I lost that signed copy.

448
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,240
So this is another copy that I bought.

449
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,860
I bought this so many times.

450
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,500
You know what, this is, I was thinking,

451
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,120
I said to them, like, especially once Scott was like,

452
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,800
Mike, do you have a DVD player set up in your living room?

453
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,260
I was, I was not thinking it was gonna be Brady Bunch.

454
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,240
I thought it was gonna be,

455
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,860
cause you would, were texting us

456
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,960
from California Adventure a few weeks ago.

457
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,380
Oh yeah.

458
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,880
And you were asking us about Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.

459
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,460
Like, is there a big Oswald sensation right now?

460
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,780
And I was like, and then when Scott, you know,

461
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,280
prepped us for this episode, I was like, oh no,

462
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,140
did Eva buy the full Oswald?

463
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,140
Is Eva gonna make us watch two dozen Oswald collections

464
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,120
in this episode in one day?

465
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,560
Yeah, we just like Oswald in my house now.

466
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,060
And my husband bought this Oswald shirt

467
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,020
where he's shooting lightning from his hands.

468
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,680
It's in the font of the shirt

469
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,860
that says Oswald is a lightning font.

470
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,580
Very like 97 with attitude.

471
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,580
Oh yeah.

472
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,560
Yeah, we just bought an unlicensed Oswald shirt,

473
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,400
which is great.

474
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,500
It looks like he's about to run into a small arena

475
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,320
and just really fuck up Vince McMahon.

476
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,820
We did, we like watched one Oswald cartoon

477
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,920
and he's just kind of mean.

478
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,480
Yeah.

479
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,260
Yeah, he's kind of a dick.

480
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:14,780
Unpleasant.

481
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,660
Does the audience have an answer for us that is,

482
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,360
is the question just, is Oswald a thing?

483
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,840
Does anyone care about Oswald?

484
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,380
Is it working?

485
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,900
Is there recent featuring of him a little

486
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,640
in the parks move the needle at all?

487
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,260
I think when they redid California Adventure,

488
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,940
Disney had in the few years prior to that

489
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,180
gotten the rights back.

490
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,580
Well yeah, that was the Al Michaels deal.

491
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,580
Yeah, they traded a sportscaster

492
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,020
for the rights to Oswald the lucky rabbit.

493
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,220
So weird.

494
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,940
And so they were like, okay, well the time period works out

495
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,740
where like it would make sense for Oswald

496
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,340
to be on Buena Vista street

497
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,880
and the version of Los Angeles we're presenting.

498
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,000
We don't need to go into the like gnarly details of like,

499
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,000
oh, the distributor screwed Walton up Iwerks

500
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,600
out of ownership of this.

501
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,340
Like it's a cute kind of obscure character.

502
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,400
And I think the locals will like it.

503
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:07,760
Yeah.

504
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,480
You're right.

505
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,000
He's right behind you.

506
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,220
Oh, there's an Oswald here.

507
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,920
Oh yeah, there's a massive Oswald.

508
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,720
Lindsay got that for me like eight years ago.

509
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,420
It's great.

510
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:15,820
Yeah.

511
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,100
I mean, Oswald's a cool, the guy in the Oswald suit.

512
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,160
Well, that's why we were,

513
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,640
I was sort of like, who is that?

514
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,180
I looked it up and I texted you guys

515
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,840
cause I was like, this guy's really a good character

516
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,040
performer and walk around guy.

517
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,960
He was really doing little dances and

518
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,120
Yeah.

519
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,760
projecting a lot of life onto this guy.

520
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,260
Right.

521
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,440
Well, it would be nice if we could know who was in like,

522
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,100
they had like a little name tag, like today Oswald is Brian.

523
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,780
Oh God, we gotta get Brian, get Brian day.

524
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,920
You can like go on the app and see if Brian's Oswald.

525
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,340
Yeah.

526
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,080
Brian, is Brian working today?

527
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,980
And then it would be like a weird, like a,

528
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,080
you're going to a strip club and it's like,

529
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,000
is Denise here?

530
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,060
And they're like, yeah, you gotta get out of here, man.

531
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,140
You're a little too into,

532
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,600
although I guess it's like Amanda Lund telling us about

533
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,480
the fans at Tokyo Disney.

534
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,020
Oh yeah.

535
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,200
Like there was a, they made a scrapbook of her,

536
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,160
as the princess.

537
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,160
All right, fine.

538
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,360
We should maybe stay away from that territory.

539
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,260
Stay away from it.

540
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,580
It'd be like international creeps.

541
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,960
One other thing about, about fake Jan,

542
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,300
as she's known pop culturally.

543
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,900
So this was just,

544
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,620
cause I read another thing that Eve Plum was sort of,

545
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,380
that's what you were saying.

546
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,280
She was like, maybe she wasn't so angry about it,

547
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,760
like Lisa and the Simpsons.

548
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,020
Yeah.

549
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,080
She just refused on the grounds of what the show is.

550
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,800
I think she's like, I'll do some,

551
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,100
but can I not do all of them?

552
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,920
And they said, no, all or nothing.

553
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,020
You are out.

554
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,020
But then that left them without a Jan.

555
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,840
So they had to scramble and find somebody

556
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,920
who kind of looked like Eve Plum to,

557
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,080
and it came so down to the wire that they only had Jerry

558
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,800
Reginald the day before rehearsal started.

559
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,160
Wow.

560
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,400
So, all right, your Jan, go, go, go now.

561
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,540
And she was a, like a very accomplished

562
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,780
country Western performer.

563
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,400
She had been in a band.

564
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,240
She could sing and dance better than almost anyone,

565
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,680
but yeah, that's very weird that it happened to Eve Plum

566
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,020
because she was like, I got a 40 share in like this TV movie

567
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,960
I did, and I just, I feel like I have a career here.

568
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,920
And they called her like, started calling her like Eve,

569
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,460
I've got a 40 share Plum.

570
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,600
And they just were like, well, you're out.

571
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,180
But then also then Mike Lookinland who played Bobby was

572
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,740
like, can I have, I won't do it unless you pay me twice

573
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,280
as much.

574
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,840
And they're like, okay, I guess we're paying everyone

575
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,720
twice as much.

576
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,660
Like, so they gave him the money.

577
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,900
So only Eve Plum really got punished.

578
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,500
And even though she wasn't being that bad about it,

579
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,100
it does say in the book that like the night this aired,

580
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,300
she sat in front of the television,

581
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,080
her home sobbing hysterically.

582
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,220
Oh man.

583
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,400
Poor Eve.

584
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,420
It's her family that moved on without her.

585
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,340
Yeah, but she was, as we'll see,

586
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,360
like she made the right decision.

587
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:45,920
Yeah.

588
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,560
Did you see the thing about, I discovered this

589
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,380
in an interview with series writer, Bruce Valanche.

590
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:52,900
First TV job.

591
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,180
Let's write that in too.

592
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,380
His first TV job.

593
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,340
Yeah, or like first big one, like series job.

594
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,360
He was trying to soften his resume

595
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,900
so he could get more TV writing jobs.

596
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,520
So he like, he was like working for like Lily Tomlin,

597
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,720
writing jokes for Lily Tomlin.

598
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,060
And he was like, I guess I'll do this.

599
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,140
This is right, also right before Star Wars,

600
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,200
No one's listening to this anymore, are they?

601
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:10,780
They've turned it off.

602
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,720
Oh, there's gonna be like a lot of weird 70s old guys.

603
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,280
My mom is gonna be thrilled by this conversation,

604
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,960
but everyone else has turned it off.

605
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,940
If you're crafting the comment,

606
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,700
not about theme parks and preparing to send it,

607
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,980
just know we will text each other

608
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,960
and make fun of the comments.

609
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,980
So if that's your plan, joke's on you.

610
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,960
Anyway, let's continue.

611
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,920
Yeah, Bruce Valanche worked with like Paul Lind.

612
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,040
He also worked on the Paul Lind Halloween special.

613
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,480
Yes, yes, absolutely he did.

614
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,520
Which is a thing we need to do in episode about too.

615
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,060
The fact that he was just like in the writers

616
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,080
for a year is like very unusual

617
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,340
and a first time experience for him.

618
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:42,900
Yes.

619
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,440
So there's an interview where he talks

620
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,660
about the fake Jan syndrome.

621
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,020
And I watched this this morning.

622
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,720
I didn't realize that it came down to two women.

623
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,240
Oh yeah.

624
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,280
One of them, Jerry Reichel, who got the part.

625
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,600
The other one, Kathy Hilton,

626
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,240
eventually the mother of Paris Hilton.

627
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,000
My God.

628
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,380
Yeah, almost was Jan.

629
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,980
Connie's daughter, right?

630
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,080
Conrad Hilton?

631
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:04,580
Yeah.

632
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,880
Yeah, yeah.

633
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,900
Oh yeah, so already mega heiress.

634
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,400
Yeah.

635
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,280
So she didn't need to be Jan on top of it.

636
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,760
And one more tiny thing

637
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,180
and we should probably start the pilot

638
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,060
is that this was shot at KTLA studios

639
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,880
on Sunset Boulevard where the Netflix building is now.

640
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,320
And do you guys, have you ever noticed that Denny's

641
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,820
that was right across the street on the corner

642
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,080
kind of right when you get off the freeway,

643
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,400
there was like a floating Denny's on Sunset Boulevard.

644
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,420
Yes, with a massive parking lot.

645
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,540
Massive parking lot and a full bar.

646
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,140
That was built because KTLA didn't have a commissary

647
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,420
and Norman Lear personally asked Denny's

648
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,260
to build a Denny's there with a bar.

649
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,380
What?

650
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,520
And it closed during quarantine

651
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,460
but that's what that Denny's was there for.

652
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,100
Wow.

653
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,740
I don't think I realized there was a full bar in there

654
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,460
and also there's a Denny's two blocks away.

655
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,760
That was Norman Lear's Denny's.

656
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,320
Wow.

657
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,200
And it will figure into the story later

658
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,460
in a very negative way.

659
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,340
Oh no.

660
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,460
Oh boy.

661
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,900
All right, so should we watch this pilot?

662
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,520
We should probably pop it in

663
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,200
and just let's keep in mind,

664
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,040
I'm so excited to have the new context

665
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,260
that everything that we're gonna see,

666
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,580
everything we're gonna describe to the audience

667
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,760
is brought to you by Michael Eisner.

668
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,400
Like so much of what we love.

669
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:13,900
Right, right.

670
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,940
And you have to think about like,

671
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,940
was he, did he approve the cuts?

672
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,400
Did he look at costumes?

673
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,040
How involved was he?

674
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,940
Was he proud of it, of his creation as it was forming?

675
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,820
But Eisner plus Crofts plus Filanch

676
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,820
plus all the Brady's plus one fake Brady.

677
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,360
What a combination.

678
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,540
A guest star that is really fantastic in this pilot.

679
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,840
There's so many, I feel like mega guest stars,

680
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,580
like seven of them every time.

681
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,300
Oh yeah, this one is one very specific guest star.

682
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,420
So all right, so we'll shut it down.

683
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:47,800
We'll pop it in, audience,

684
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,000
we'll be back with you in a moment.

685
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,540
of the Brady Bunch Hour.

686
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,360
Yes.

687
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,220
Sure did.

688
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:56,720
Yes.

689
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,460
What do you think?

690
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:03,100
It's, I guess it's way worse than I thought it would be.

691
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,980
I thought it would be bad, but it's like worse.

692
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,580
Yeah, that's been my,

693
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,640
cause I've been fascinated by this show

694
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,640
and the existence of it,

695
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,460
but anytime I've tried to watch more than 10 minutes,

696
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,840
it's difficult.

697
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,160
It is a slog, it wears you down.

698
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,720
but the concept is confusing and they just,

699
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,260
the thing that really strikes me is,

700
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,380
cause I watch a lot of this era variety specials,

701
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,940
Jack Benny stuff, as I mentioned, I think,

702
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,140
Letterman, the Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tom Olmonds,

703
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,340
they really like,

704
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,100
like lean heavily on doing old 40s style,

705
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,560
boring as hell musical numbers with no gimmick to it.

706
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,800
Just like the costumes are fun.

707
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,080
They are like Sid and Marty Croft-esque,

708
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,860
but it's really just like, baby,

709
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:59,360
like a Las Vegas review from 1950

710
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,780
on television in the mid 70s,

711
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,140
like just, I don't know, they'd so much of that.

712
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,060
I would think there would be more weird comedy

713
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,380
or attempts at comedy.

714
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,760
Well, like the most modern thing,

715
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,320
this was 76 we were saying while we were watching it,

716
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,860
the most modern things in it are they sing

717
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,360
like a very stiff version of Shake Your Booty

718
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,320
and they do one singular sensation from a chorus line,

719
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,580
which was the original production of chorus line

720
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,300
was 75.

721
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,120
So that's only a year old,

722
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,560
but that is a show about people in the 70s

723
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:33,400
doing like a kind of traditional Broadway musical,

724
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,040
which is a little old.

725
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,460
Yeah, I don't want to be called by that as contemporary.

726
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,220
I hate one.

727
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,020
They sing Attitude Dancing, which is a modern disco song.

728
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:41,580
Uh-huh.

729
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,880
Yeah, right, right.

730
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,000
That's what Greg sings in the disco medley at the end

731
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,860
with Shake Your Booty.

732
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,860
It's a very funny phrase, attitude dancing.

733
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,520
That's what I love about some 70s stuff,

734
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,600
where it's like, there's a new kind of sound.

735
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,440
And then what they sing is like already

736
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,600
in the 70s, 25 years out of date.

737
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,580
So I think it's important to jump in right now

738
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,780
and let you guys know that a lot of this stuff

739
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:07,080
was replaced stuff that was deemed too bad for the air.

740
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,320
Whoa, so post filming the pilot,

741
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,800
there was another pass done

742
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,660
and what we just saw was the second pass.

743
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,040
And that to complete this, get this on the air in time,

744
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,480
that the editors and director worked for like,

745
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,300
three straight days without sleeping.

746
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,920
It's important this, they had to.

747
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,260
The underwater clown thing,

748
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,580
which seems completely unfinished.

749
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,400
That just ended up in the show,

750
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,000
the idea of people staying up all night for three days,

751
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,040
losing their minds.

752
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,920
Also, apparently while shooting this,

753
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,940
the director was screaming at people.

754
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,560
He got fired.

755
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,820
He threw something and hurt somebody.

756
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,940
He was this violent, furious guy.

757
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,940
But this is important.

758
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:47,780
So from the book,

759
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,660
the script featured a Halloween themed skit,

760
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,300
later removed entitled, The Frady Bunch.

761
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,700
Which was described as our lovable Brady's,

762
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,500
made up in light gray tint and dressed unlike,

763
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,600
not unlike the Adams family,

764
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,400
your average American family of vampires or ghouls.

765
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,920
Among other things that involved Marsha feeding McDonald's

766
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,960
cheeseburgers to a live plant named Waldo

767
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,200
and a dead corpse seated at a harp

768
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,960
as the Brady's sing the Monster Mash with the Osmonds.

769
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,620
They built an entire set for this.

770
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,900
I mean, that sounds so much better.

771
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,860
That sounds awesome.

772
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,080
That's a premise.

773
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,720
There's a game.

774
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,880
You see B stuff we learned.

775
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,060
That's what would love that game.

776
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,120
That's what would love it.

777
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,100
But the final draft of the script eliminated

778
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,700
The Frady Bunch and added a chorus line,

779
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,580
pip in an additional series of disco songs for the finale.

780
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,700
So that's what went in instead of The Frady Bunch.

781
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,340
Wow.

782
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,780
So less comedy, more jazz.

783
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,500
More Broadway.

784
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:42,440
Yeah.

785
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,040
I'll let you keep talking.

786
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,860
Cause I went wondering if there's more insight into like,

787
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,500
cause like when you watch a Jack Benny special like this,

788
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,400
Jack Benny knew what he could do.

789
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,000
Not every sketch was good.

790
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,960
Not every piece was good, but like it was clear,

791
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,000
like he knew what he could do.

792
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,720
He knew he had a guest star who could sing.

793
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,880
They're going to do the song.

794
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,160
This is like, well, the Brady's can do it all.

795
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,700
They can't do anything.

796
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,160
But they can't do anything other than be in the show

797
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,720
that is fine from the original show I'm talking about.

798
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,780
We're all collectively watching The Frady Bunch Variety Hour

799
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,880
together for an audience, which is weird in and of itself.

800
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,120
Yes.

801
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,340
Well, we were on a real kick in like 10 years ago

802
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,440
or nine years ago, Netflix got a bunch of seemingly

803
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,340
public domain stuff, like all, like the Jack Benny show.

804
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,320
And I think one of the Groucho game shows,

805
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,580
but only like 10 random episodes each.

806
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:49,360
But the Jack Benny stuff from like the 50s was pretty solid.

807
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,040
Yeah, I mean, there's always going to be like

808
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,760
problematic stuff, but I think we were,

809
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,460
cause I didn't see a lot of Jack Benny as a kid

810
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,680
on Nick at night.

811
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,600
And we were watching him and we're like,

812
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,760
Jack Benny is funny.

813
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,740
Like he's really, really funny.

814
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,420
And some of the episodes are like just as good

815
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,740
as any classic TV.

816
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,740
And then, you know, once in a while, yes,

817
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,400
I will find a Jack Benny special,

818
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,440
like the one I found recently where he gets a new look

819
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,100
and it's in the seventies and he's like 75 years old

820
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:13,560
or something.

821
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,080
And they're like dressing him like Austin Powers.

822
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,620
It's like not a great special, but you can,

823
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,120
like there's some things that are interesting.

824
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,220
The best one of those is one of my favorite clips

825
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,000
of TV ever.

826
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,860
And it's, I don't know, it's some variety show.

827
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,280
Cause most television seem to be variety shows at the time.

828
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,020
It's Tennessee Ernie Ford, who's saying 16 tons.

829
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,580
Yeah.

830
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,400
And he comes up to the host.

831
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,460
He's like, I hear there's a new kind of sound out there.

832
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,240
So I've, I'm giving it a shot.

833
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,500
And he just sings a slightly faster 16 tons

834
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,280
while there's like go-go dancers around him

835
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,880
and very light rock.

836
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,280
It's like, it's so funny.

837
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:56,980
That's great.

838
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,940
This was in 1995.

839
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,300
Well, speaking of like in context things,

840
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,860
this is also important behind the scenes stuff.

841
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,800
So obviously the guest star is Tony Randall,

842
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,600
who has a very strange arc where he comes in,

843
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,800
they try to replace the dad with him.

844
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,300
Then he comes back almost seemingly like two hours later

845
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,760
and does, I think my favorite thing in these shows.

846
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,780
I was gonna say by far,

847
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,420
that's the highlight of the show is Tony Randall

848
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,040
is dressed almost like,

849
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,460
like you would play like an old leprechaun in a sketch

850
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,620
with like big kind of puffy, like sideburns.

851
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,380
And like a mutton chop.

852
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,300
Mutton chop, thank you.

853
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,140
That's what I'm looking for.

854
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,920
And then like, yeah, like a greenish suit.

855
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,920
And then screaming a poem at you

856
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,140
that you can't really understand.

857
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,700
Yeah, like a dense.

858
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,880
I just wrote down the line,

859
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,180
like through the wheezing hurdy-gurdy.

860
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,040
You're just being pummeled with lines like that.

861
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,060
While a little person dressed as a bear

862
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,220
is doing like dancing for their life.

863
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:51,840
Yeah.

864
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,860
Seeing me dance the vogue, said Mr.

865
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,880
Wag like a bear.

866
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,100
In my top hat and my whiskers that,

867
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,760
tra la la trap the fairies.

868
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,600
Where the waves seem chiming, hey cots,

869
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,420
I dance the vogue, a fair.

870
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,500
Stand Venus' children in the gay procs.

871
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,000
Maroon and marine and snare.

872
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,900
The sea be fire my pistol.

873
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,700
Through the distance, blue is my coat.

874
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,380
Like Wellington fire on the mark,

875
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,280
with the crystal, busby creek, feeds float.

876
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,420
While the wheezing hurdy-gurdy of the marine wind blows me

877
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:22,060
to the tune of Adiruni sturdy, over the sheeps of the sea.

878
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,500
And I really, when I was watching,

879
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,260
there was a clip going around yesterday

880
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,500
of an outtake from X-Men 3 where Kelsey Grammer's Beast

881
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,160
does a speech about Crispin's day

882
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,580
to psych up the team.

883
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:33,260
Wow.

884
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,100
And I was like, wow, Tony Ranna was like,

885
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,240
before Kelsey, like Kelsey Grammer would love

886
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,740
to do this bit, I bet.

887
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,620
Oh yeah, yeah, it's a precursor to the laughing and rhythm.

888
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,220
Has everyone seen the laughing and rhythm?

889
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,340
Hmm, that sounds familiar.

890
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,320
at a Just For Laughs festival in 94 that Kelsey Grammer did

891
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,760
and it's this weird, it's him with like an upright bass

892
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,960
and a piano guy.

893
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,500
Oh, I have seen this.

894
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,440
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about?

895
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,140
Yes, yes, yes.

896
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,920
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

897
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,400
Yes, I have seen this.

898
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,220
Laughing in rhythm.

899
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,860
That's what it is.

900
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,080
Yes, yes, I've seen that.

901
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,560
Musical haws, like he's laughing weird.

902
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,500
We'll add that to the clip watching

903
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,720
and I'll show you Crispin's day speech as well,

904
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,740
which is fantastic.

905
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,460
Well, this is important.

906
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,220
So this is from the head writer, Karl Kleinschmidt.

907
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,900
Marty Croft and I went to visit Tony

908
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,040
at the Chateau Marmont on Sunset Boulevard.

909
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,160
Tony had one of those bungalows and he came out

910
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,640
to greet us in his bikini underwear

911
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,360
and he laid down on his chaise lounge

912
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,720
and he talked to us for an hour.

913
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,600
I always thought that was one of the strangest interviews

914
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,740
I've ever had with an actor with a man lying

915
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,840
in his bikini underwear.

916
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,200
He was agreeing to come on the Brady Bunch hour.

917
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,940
So that's like how they got, like how they sold,

918
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,420
like the behind the scenes of this is extremely fraught

919
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,340
and weird and yeah, it's like one guy

920
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,480
like almost breaking someone's hand

921
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,140
for like doing stuff wrong.

922
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,600
Also the pool was kind of a half-assed idea.

923
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,240
There's a giant pool on stage.

924
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,080
That was because Donnie and Mary had ice skating.

925
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,160
So they're like, okay, they have ice skating,

926
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:01,820
we'll just do a pool.

927
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,040
But no one had ever done a pool

928
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,580
like on a soundstage like that before.

929
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,080
And immediately it was a disaster.

930
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,840
Like it, you couldn't see the water was all milky.

931
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,820
So they had to fill the thing with sparklets

932
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,780
and constantly like filter and add chlorine to it.

933
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,220
And then also like it had to be held

934
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,800
at this specific temperature so that it wouldn't,

935
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,840
like it wouldn't steam because it was cold there.

936
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,380
It was like, it was something where they should have

937
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,780
just said, you know, forget the pool.

938
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,140
But then the pool became the centerpiece of the whole thing.

939
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,340
Cause they had, they had dancers who then had to learn

940
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,600
to be synchronized swimmers.

941
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,960
They weren't already.

942
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,740
Wait, I thought the point was like,

943
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,420
and then we'll have a synchronized swimmers.

944
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,060
They just drafted dancers.

945
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,880
It seems like a chintzy Busby Berkeley sort of thing.

946
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,560
But if you read about how they made those

947
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,140
Busby Berkeley movies, they had hundreds

948
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,120
of synchronized swimmers and dancers.

949
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,320
They had massive camera rigs and it would take weeks

950
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,920
to shoot a musical sequence.

951
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,200
Not in the way they would just crap out

952
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,000
70s variety specials on TV.

953
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,460
The Crofteds also talk about in the book

954
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,020
that there wasn't this, the pool didn't have any stairs

955
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,800
in or out of it.

956
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,680
Oh my God.

957
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,740
So you had to just skull for hours to like,

958
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,340
and they would shoot the swimming from like midnight

959
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,120
to 3 a.

960
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,460
m.

961
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,860
And these women were just like floating like,

962
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,040
or if you held, you could hold onto the side of the pool,

963
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,140
but it was slippery and it was very like,

964
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,580
but people were worried it was gonna explode

965
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,500
and destroy and electrocute everybody.

966
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:30,020
Cause it was just like on a crappy sound stage.

967
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,860
This is like one of Jigsaw's twisted games

968
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,420
from the Saw films.

969
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,720
But it is used for, yeah, the underwater clown sketch

970
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,340
which is a really pure piece of comedy.

971
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,120
That's a highlight.

972
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,800
Where you don't know what's happening at all.

973
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,420
And Scott, we were in the dark.

974
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,680
We didn't know about the underwater clowns.

975
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,340
I didn't either.

976
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,180
I mean, I didn't know exactly what happened in this pilot.

977
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,420
Just imagine me like, okay, so I've already watched

978
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:57,140
20 minutes of bizarre, bad Brady Bunch singing and dancing.

979
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,920
And then a screen comes up that says coming up next.

980
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,120
And it's two painted clowns and fireman hats

981
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,800
swimming at you.

982
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,720
Yeah, underwater clowns.

983
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,420
Coming up next.

984
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,060
What a threat for me specifically.

985
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,700
Yeah, so the list of podcasts to ride clowns now

986
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,480
are growing.

987
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,340
So we have Chukko, we have like.

988
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,760
Never remember that other one.

989
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,560
Sugar Smacks.

990
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,660
Sugar Crisps one.

991
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,320
I had it.

992
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,000
I tweeted a joke about them.

993
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,620
Why is Cliffy?

994
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,020
Cliffy.

995
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,080
Cliffy the Clown.

996
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:26,520
Yeah.

997
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,480
Cliffy, there's a Dorney,

998
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,360
we learned about a Dorney Park one.

999
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:29,620
Yeah.

1000
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,340
That sent us.

1001
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,800
Right, and now we have the Brady Clowns.

1002
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,320
Whatever they're called.

1003
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,120
Oh, and we have Bozo.

1004
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:34,760
The Crofted Clown.

1005
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,580
And we have Bozo and his clown babies.

1006
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,340
Oh, and the clown babies.

1007
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,020
That I added that I don't know.

1008
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,400
Bozo's babies?

1009
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,900
There was a, yeah, I was trying to figure out

1010
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,300
who owns the rights to Bozo.

1011
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:45,780
Okay.

1012
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:50,100
And there's a website for Larry Harmon Productions,

1013
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,300
which is a guy who was, he played Bozo,

1014
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,600
because there's many different Bozos,

1015
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,440
but he played Bozo.

1016
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,740
He claimed he invented him.

1017
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,400
He did not.

1018
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,860
He was in the Clown Hall of Fame

1019
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,000
and then was removed from the Clown Hall of Fame

1020
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,240
when they found out he was not the original Bozo.

1021
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:07,660
But his wife still owns Bozo and Laurel and Hardy.

1022
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,840
So if you want to license Laurel and Hardy or Bozo

1023
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,440
or the property Bozo and his clown,

1024
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,540
Bozo the Clown and the Clown Babies.

1025
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,800
These little shitheads.

1026
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,860
Oh no, I hate them.

1027
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,120
They're terrible.

1028
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,260
But they are podcasts about characters now

1029
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,860
in the clown family of clowns.

1030
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,820
And underwater fire clowns.

1031
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,040
And the Brady, underwater Brady.

1032
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,100
Fireman clowns.

1033
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:27,480
Yeah.

1034
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,340
This is, just to like.

1035
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:30,800
Roster of clowns.

1036
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,020
Just to back up a little bit and get into it,

1037
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,040
because I think we have to explain what the premise

1038
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,560
of the Brady Bunch Variety Hour is,

1039
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,340
because if you weren't clear on this,

1040
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:43,380
it is musical numbers done.

1041
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,700
But the hosts of the show are the Bradys.

1042
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,860
And I don't mean Robert Reed and Florence Henderson

1043
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,600
and the actors.

1044
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,080
It is Mike Brady and Carol Brady.

1045
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,740
So this family of which the patriarch is an architect

1046
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,420
are doing a variety show for you.

1047
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,420
And he's very apologetic.

1048
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,000
That you discover that they wrote

1049
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,720
Bobby's complaining about writing the scripts.

1050
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,960
Bobby Brady, who's a 15 year old regular kid

1051
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,280
from somewhere just the middle of the country.

1052
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,320
I don't know.

1053
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:18,540
But it gets so odd and murky because yeah,

1054
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,660
what is, we're in a universe,

1055
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,560
this isn't the universe where the Brady Bunch,

1056
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,860
the sitcom aired, right?

1057
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,780
It's a world where some random family has a show now.

1058
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,160
But then they'll say things like,

1059
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,140
the boy, the kids are a little taller

1060
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,440
than when you last saw them.

1061
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,760
When did I see them?

1062
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,200
I don't know these people, right?

1063
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,840
Because we've never seen the Bradys.

1064
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,980
You know what I mean?

1065
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,080
Honestly, I missed that.

1066
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,680
I thought that the idea was like that the show was

1067
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,040
a show that everybody liked, but they were a real family.

1068
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,280
The reality was that people-

1069
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,640
It was like a documentary.

1070
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,820
I guess, yeah.

1071
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,900
That the Brady Bunch, the show,

1072
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,420
the first five seasons you're saying was-

1073
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:56,600
Was real.

1074
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,040
That's capturing the Freedmans.

1075
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,740
But the Loud family had just been on PBS

1076
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,380
where you're following around Lance Loud and his family.

1077
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:03,960
Oh yeah.

1078
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,760
The Brady Bunch was, yeah, the Freedmans,

1079
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,840
it was like a-

1080
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,800
We do know them.

1081
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,460
That's how my brain squared that circle.

1082
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,420
But that's not how, they didn't explain that.

1083
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,380
That was not an explanation of like,

1084
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,400
you remember our show that everyone liked.

1085
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,240
They didn't say that.

1086
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:17,620
No.

1087
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,880
So then there's wraparounds where like some of it,

1088
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,580
most of it is them on stage introducing songs,

1089
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,440
but then it'll cut to them in a house,

1090
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,760
not the standard Brady house, but a new house.

1091
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,260
And there's stories where they aren't playing out to camera

1092
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:35,380
except sometimes at the end, like, boy, what's his problem?

1093
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,260
Wait, so you could look at us, the audience the whole time?

1094
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,780
Are we in your house or is this reality?

1095
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,580
of the sketch to pull a Deadpool

1096
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,640
and start talking to the audience.

1097
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,940
Or a Wayne from Wayne's World.

1098
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,020
The original Deadpool, Florence Henderson.

1099
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:57,020
And you get this sense that like,

1100
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,780
I'm feeling like behind the scenes,

1101
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:02,140
they're not talking about this as like being conceptual,

1102
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:07,000
and we're breaking the fourth wall and we're combining,

1103
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,860
it's the Brady's, but we're twisting the variety.

1104
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,280
Like when people talk, like Bo Burnham has that new special

1105
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,320
and people are like, oh yeah,

1106
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,500
and it's these specials where people are like,

1107
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,460
oh, and they're deconstructing what standup is.

1108
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,000
That is not what's happening here.

1109
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,280
This is just a straight variety show.

1110
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,560
Yes, and the way they try to fix it

1111
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,680
once the show gets picked up is that in the second episode,

1112
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,600
they re-move into that house.

1113
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,260
They move into the house you saw in the pilot.

1114
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:32,920
What?

1115
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,740
Wait, because I, yeah, in the little bit I've seen

1116
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,160
of this show, I do remember them moving in.

1117
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,280
They moved to Malibu.

1118
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,940
They're like, we just moved to California

1119
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,080
to do our variety show.

1120
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,560
So that happens in episode two.

1121
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,780
In episode two, which they've already been in that house.

1122
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,220
And so then they're like, okay, there's,

1123
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,220
and then their mover who moves them in,

1124
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,040
who becomes a major character is Rip Taylor.

1125
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,100
Who is a brand-new angel.

1126
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:55,340
Fantastic.

1127
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,700
He plays Jackie Merrill.

1128
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,240
He runs a moving company.

1129
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,540
Then later he's a real estate agent.

1130
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,260
And then also he just tells everybody he's also a comedian.

1131
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,680
Okay, that makes sense.

1132
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,200
He's in every ensuing episode of the Brady Bunch Hour.

1133
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,800
They brought him in just to smooth things over,

1134
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,840
to have somebody who had some variety experience,

1135
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,280
but also very importantly to be a love interest for Alice.

1136
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,680
Oh my God, thank God.

1137
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,500
Because in the two years or three years

1138
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,740
since the Brady Bunch had been off the hour,

1139
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,140
Ann B.

1140
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,100
Davis, oh sorry.

1141
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,000
Ann B.

1142
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,200
Davis left Hollywood.

1143
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,820
She had disappeared from the Hollywood scene,

1144
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,760
moved to Denver, Colorado.

1145
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:33,920
And she was working as a volunteer at a vicarage

1146
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,060
of the Episcopal diocese

1147
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,300
under the leadership of Bishop William C.

1148
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:39,320
Foy.

1149
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,600
Oh my gosh, because this is my question.

1150
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,340
Because the first episode, there's not a lot of Alice.

1151
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,420
And I was like, well, Alice was always the funniest one

1152
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:49,400
on the show, that I wanted any sort of like comedy chops

1153
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:49,980
or timing.

1154
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,300
And kind of a Betty White over time where you could tell

1155
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,000
she's been at this since the 50s, she's a pro.

1156
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:55,440
Yeah.

1157
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,520
So she was, she said quote,

1158
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,120
I decided to sell my house in LA

1159
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,800
and yield control to the Lord.

1160
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,920
And she was just living on this compound,

1161
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,380
giving lectures, leading worship,

1162
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,040
and performing daily chores.

1163
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,540
And so she made a deal with them

1164
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,560
that she would do the show if they would let her go back

1165
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,260
for like most of the weekend, do her chores on the property.

1166
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,220
Her religious chores.

1167
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,200
Her religious chores.

1168
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:19,660
But so two other things about this is that

1169
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,840
she wore the same shirt every day to set,

1170
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,800
embroidered with Jesus's Lord on it.

1171
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,680
Alice, in real life, Alice needed to do a lot of chores

1172
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,340
and wore the same thing every day.

1173
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:30,660
Yes.

1174
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,640
And the negotiation was like,

1175
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,420
she had to fly back to Denver midweek to do her chores.

1176
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,320
And so they were like, okay, we'll figure this out.

1177
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,840
But Jerry, who played new Jan, says that she,

1178
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,300
over the year that she worked at the show,

1179
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,580
never had a single conversation with Anne B.

1180
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:45,720
Davis.

1181
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,240
What?

1182
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,020
Oh my God.

1183
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,720
And that a lot of times she just sat by herself.

1184
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,020
That's a quote from Jerry.

1185
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,140
Wow, weird.

1186
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,080
So, yeah.

1187
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,860
And so then she gets paired up with Rip Taylor,

1188
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,420
who she despises.

1189
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,980
And everyone else was just very quiet.

1190
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,400
Rip Taylor's quotes about Anne B.

1191
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:00,680
Davis,

1192
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,880
like behind the scenes of this thing are so vicious.

1193
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,780
Oh man.

1194
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,120
Like she hated him.

1195
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,380
She wouldn't speak to him.

1196
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,320
And it sounds like Rip Taylor was just like,

1197
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,240
we'll watch a clip with him later,

1198
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,100
but like he was really just trying to make everybody happy,

1199
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,180
he was giving everyone little presents.

1200
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,140
He was like being real friendly to the kids and like,

1201
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,760
and she just like, he's like, she didn't have to,

1202
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,960
I told her at some point, why bother?

1203
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,880
Like, why bother even pretending?

1204
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,760
Like he has this like crazy invective about Anne B.

1205
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,040
Davis

1206
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,420
just being so mean to him.

1207
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:28,960
Wow.

1208
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,120
Probably just because she was extremely homophobic

1209
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,200
and he was like an out gay guy.

1210
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,520
He was not an out gay guy.

1211
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,280
He well.

1212
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,840
But he was like super like.

1213
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,620
Yeah, but Susan Olsen said his boyfriend

1214
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,140
was just like hanging out on set.

1215
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,440
Yeah, he was out there.

1216
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:45,480
But the only reason I say that is because when I went

1217
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,480
to the silent movie theater with Andrew Thurman

1218
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,780
to see a Rip Taylor documentary with Rip in attendance,

1219
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,600
they kayfabe that in the movie.

1220
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,280
Wow.

1221
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,200
They didn't bring it up.

1222
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,180
Nope, his relationship with women,

1223
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,740
that's what they talked about in the movie

1224
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,180
and they did not get into it.

1225
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:06,000
Andrew and I were both just in West Hollywood,

1226
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,960
which we have not been in for a long time

1227
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,220
and which is where he used to live.

1228
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,440
And I know this because I went and picked him up myself

1229
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,640
for a Funny or Die shoot and drove him back to Funny or Die.

1230
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,700
And I was reminding Andrew Grissom of this and he said,

1231
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,680
oh yeah, me too.

1232
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,020
Yeah.

1233
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,740
You also had a solo car ride with Rip Taylor.

1234
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,400
I know that is a fact that you both had a solo car ride

1235
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,080
with Rip Taylor and interactions with him.

1236
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,280
Two good friends who didn't put together for a while.

1237
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,060
I was just in the room with Rip Taylor five feet away

1238
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,860
and he almost sat next to me for the documentary

1239
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,960
because the director came over and said,

1240
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,680
would you mind if Rip sat next to you?

1241
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:36,980
Oh.

1242
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:40,080
And I was like, no, sir, please.

1243
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,920
Was he fun to drive around?

1244
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,540
Was he.

1245
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,320
Oh yeah, yeah.

1246
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:47,000
Well, a lot of fun and told great stories and everything

1247
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,380
and just doing completely his thing.

1248
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,700
And then for like the four person crew for this video,

1249
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,740
he did a big confetti show,

1250
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:58,060
a very gruff cameraman friend of mine.

1251
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,000
He like commanded to sit on the floor

1252
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,020
and put an orange cone on his chest.

1253
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,060
Like you go down there, do that.

1254
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,360
And this guy who like never cracked a smile

1255
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,180
at any comedy video ever just was like dying

1256
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,260
at having to do that.

1257
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,160
And then he gave us all white chocolate rip mustaches.

1258
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,080
That's great.

1259
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,160
And they rolled them all up

1260
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,400
and he made us take pictures.

1261
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,340
Now you go over there.

1262
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,000
Now here, now you, Matt Mazzani has been on the show.

1263
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,420
He was just, he wasn't even part of it.

1264
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,980
He was just walking through the, down the hallway

1265
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,720
and Rip was like, here, take these

1266
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,200
and handed him a ton of toilet paper rolls.

1267
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,440
All right, now I'm gonna put my tongue out behind you.

1268
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,840
Just like directing a madcap photo shoot.

1269
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,520
But then there was this weird thing.

1270
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:38,220
I don't think I've told this on the show and RIP,

1271
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,060
R-I-P Rip, sorry he's not with us anymore,

1272
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:45,880
but the, I was in, basically like he kept calling

1273
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:50,920
about various things and I like, and he had my number.

1274
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:51,380
Oh, weird.

1275
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,520
And there was a thing where funnier

1276
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,820
that I gave out a gift basket that year.

1277
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,640
And part, and the joke of the gift basket is that

1278
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,940
there was an invoice for the like the monetary worth

1279
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,360
of what was in the gift basket.

1280
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,780
So like, here's all this stuff,

1281
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:08,040
but also send us back $300 or whatever it is.

1282
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:08,280
That's funny.

1283
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:11,300
Yes, funny to us, we got the joke.

1284
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,980
He did not get the joke.

1285
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,380
He was given this gift basket.

1286
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,360
It was sent to his home and he decided

1287
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,940
to take his anger out on me.

1288
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:21,740
And the funny thing about this story is that

1289
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:24,980
when this happened, I was at Disney World.

1290
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,220
I was at the Animal Kingdom Lodge,

1291
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,760
that nice restaurant there.

1292
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,040
And I got a call from an unknown number

1293
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,220
and I was expecting something from my parents

1294
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,180
who the only unknown number I had and like,

1295
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,100
I like, oh, I better talk to them.

1296
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,640
It could be an emergency or a problem.

1297
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,220
Like, hello, with a lot of urgency.

1298
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,760
Scott, it's Rippy.

1299
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,940
There's invoice, what are you doing to me?

1300
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,140
Is it some kind of a joke?

1301
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,520
Yeah, it is a joke.

1302
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,160
Well, it's not very funny.

1303
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,960
And I'm out, I'm in the like the lobby,

1304
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:58,420
like the valet pickup of the Animal Kingdom Lodge

1305
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,040
with Rip Taylor yelling at me.

1306
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,160
This was an experience in my life.

1307
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,020
Another tie into the podcast.

1308
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:04,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1309
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,660
See guys, it's all, like Eisner's watching over all of it.

1310
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,600
Yeah, I, well, I'll use that as a transition.

1311
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,600
We got sent a good Eisner thing,

1312
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,600
which I think we had seen,

1313
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,860
but one of those celebrity auctions,

1314
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,960
which Eva, I think we're all checking,

1315
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:25,380
you got me at least into looking at these celebrity auctions.

1316
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,320
And now I'm sure we're all looking at it.

1317
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:31,920
But there was this framed wallet-sized Michael Eisner photo

1318
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,920
on one of them.

1319
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,460
Wallet-sized and framed?

1320
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,900
And framed, so it was a place setting.

1321
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,380
That's a very small frame.

1322
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,880
A framed wallet-sized photo of Disney CEO Michael Eisner

1323
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,320
served as table decoration for his birthday event at Club 33.

1324
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,740
And the description says,

1325
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,600
since Eisner was new at Disney,

1326
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,880
he did not know Disney executives were discouraged

1327
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,540
from appearing in mouse ears as it was deemed unprofessional.

1328
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,520
Oh no.

1329
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:04,440
So it's a very specific bit.

1330
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,040
I mean, there's lots of weird stuff

1331
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,580
about the Disney corporate culture back in the day.

1332
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,360
And I'm sure I still-

1333
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,060
How much did that go for?

1334
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,800
How much did it go for?

1335
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,180
I have to log in to see price.

1336
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:15,080
Oh yeah, well, let's look it up.

1337
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:20,140
They were estimating 100 to $200, which seems low to me.

1338
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,220
The last celebrity auction I went to

1339
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:26,740
was a very slipshod, ramshackle one.

1340
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,100
My favorite thing in it, which I did not bid on,

1341
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,160
was an empty bottle of Valium

1342
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,420
that was owned by Truman Capote

1343
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,800
that was donated from the estate of Johnny Carson's wife,

1344
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,020
who was buried alongside Truman Capote.

1345
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,380
They were buried together.

1346
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:41,560
But not Johnny.

1347
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,640
No, Capote and Johnny Carson's wife.

1348
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,460
But then I looked and the two years before,

1349
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,840
there'd been a huge lot of Truman Capote's used medicine

1350
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,280
that went for auctions with people.

1351
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,440
Somebody bought that and was piecemeal out.

1352
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,880
The Valium's the good one.

1353
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:58,980
And then, Mike, remember what you wanted to bid on,

1354
00:47:58,980 --> 00:47:59,560
but you didn't?

1355
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,760
Chase Meridian's notes from Batman Forever.

1356
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:02,740
What was that?

1357
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,860
So there was another Batman Forever thing

1358
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:06,620
that was really good.

1359
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:07,620
I was sending you life.

1360
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,240
I went to the auction, I sent you photos.

1361
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,000
What was the other one?

1362
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:10,440
Mr.

1363
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,940
Freeze's frozen TV dinner.

1364
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:12,700
Oh, from Batman and Robin.

1365
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,900
It was the frozen dinner,

1366
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:15,100
the Mr.

1367
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,360
Freeze frozen dinners

1368
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,500
when he goes into that like extra freezer part of his lair.

1369
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,420
Where his wife, where Nora is.

1370
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,620
I think they were called Gotham meals or something.

1371
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,620
They were branded after Gotham City.

1372
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,600
But there was a lot of great-

1373
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,940
The sitcom thing in that movie

1374
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:33,960
where he's got all the snowmen who he makes sing.

1375
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:34,920
I missed it, yeah.

1376
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:35,200
I missed it.

1377
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,560
That's like pretty much the right material.

1378
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,640
Oh my God, I love the movie.

1379
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,540
The Eisner photo sent to us by Ed Roberts on Twitter.

1380
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,280
Thank you, Ed.

1381
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:42,960
Thank you for sending it.

1382
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:43,720
That's awesome.

1383
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,580
So just a couple more things.

1384
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:47,820
Okay, I'll tell you what happened.

1385
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,560
So the show's gets picked up a series,

1386
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,460
major overhaul, new director,

1387
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:52,940
because that guy was bad,

1388
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,800
new, I think, choreographer potentially,

1389
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,420
definitely new costume designer, new set designer.

1390
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,940
They redo this, they make the set more attractive,

1391
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,560
but, and they also change the format

1392
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,860
where they add a musical guest,

1393
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,540
it's just flat out just singing a song.

1394
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,140
So they get their format down,

1395
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,960
they have a guest star and like one or two musical stars.

1396
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,980
So January 23, 1977, the next episode airs.

1397
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,980
And very quickly, the show kind of gets,

1398
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,080
the only thing that's weird is that

1399
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,080
the show will only be airing once a month

1400
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,120
in a shifting time slot.

1401
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,660
And they have to explain that in their opening monologue,

1402
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,220
which they call an octologue,

1403
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,700
because all eight of them get to talk.

1404
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:41,580
So the opening is basically that they move into their house.

1405
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:45,480
Rip Taylor is the moving van guy,

1406
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:49,580
but then he tries to put his furniture in their house

1407
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:53,440
and he flirts with Ann Davis, he flirts with Alice,

1408
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,800
and then Lee Majors and Farrah Fawcett show up

1409
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,100
and they wanna stay in the house

1410
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,860
because he rented the house to them for the night.

1411
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,160
So they're just like living in the house with the Brady's.

1412
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,560
Married at the time, correct?

1413
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:06,040
Yeah, very confusing, just a confusing setup.

1414
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,100
And they're not really doing sketch acting either,

1415
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:12,020
just kind of like mincing around and being quiet and stuff.

1416
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:12,940
And so it's just weird.

1417
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:16,700
The musical guest is Captain Cool and the Kongs.

1418
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,660
Of course.

1419
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,040
And just some highlights are that

1420
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:22,700
they do a really weird version of the car wash

1421
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,300
where they're all dressed up like the characters

1422
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,780
from Wizard of Oz and Ann Davis is the Wicked Witch.

1423
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:28,620
I've seen this, I've seen this, yes.

1424
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:29,320
That one's crazy.

1425
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,160
I've seen that, yes.

1426
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:31,000
Yes.

1427
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,580
And it's just, it's bad.

1428
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:36,760
There's like, they start off with like a really long

1429
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,340
Yankee Doodle Dandy, like just in Yankee Doodle.

1430
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,640
I may have seen that too, that sounds familiar too.

1431
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:42,620
Can I ask a question?

1432
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,440
Do they explain why Alice is no longer with Sam the Butcher,

1433
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,760
her longtime boyfriend on the Brady Bunch?

1434
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,800
I don't know, that's a good question.

1435
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,900
I don't know if it came up or they just were like,

1436
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:53,920
I mean, they had to move.

1437
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,540
Right, of course.

1438
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:55,480
You didn't move with them.

1439
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,560
That's a good point, okay.

1440
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,080
So yeah, she moved and she left Sam behind.

1441
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,240
I feel like they got married in one of those movies.

1442
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,460
And during the car wash number,

1443
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,660
this is an interesting detail,

1444
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:05,900
the headdress worn by one of the dancers was fastened

1445
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,860
so tightly that she was in excruciating pain

1446
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:10,340
and discovered her head was bleeding when it was removed.

1447
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,160
Oh my God.

1448
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,560
So like the amount of like human misery

1449
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,460
this show inflicts on people is really crazy.

1450
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:20,320
Did you see the fact, this was just a Wikipedia thing,

1451
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,180
maybe it's in the book too,

1452
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:24,520
but that there was a shared studio,

1453
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,440
which you know where they were doing this at KTLA

1454
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:30,160
and next door where Chevy Chase was working on something.

1455
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,680
Yeah, so this is really interesting that Jerry,

1456
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:34,800
so when I could tell Jerry and Susan,

1457
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,740
who you know, fake Jan and Cindy

1458
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:40,280
were really stoned all the time.

1459
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:43,080
And they were in high school

1460
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,540
and they just started skipping school

1461
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,160
and going and hanging out with Chevy Chase.

1462
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,260
Oh, this wasn't even where I was going.

1463
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,340
Oh yeah, they were just like,

1464
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,380
so like just going over, hanging out in his office,

1465
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,120
like sitting on his desk, winging their legs around.

1466
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,380
In high school and they're on drugs?

1467
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,560
I don't like the sound of this.

1468
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:00,320
But it sounds like also like,

1469
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,980
according to the story, like he didn't do anything.

1470
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:04,480
He just sort of liked having these like

1471
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,280
cute stone teenagers in the office

1472
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,860
and Paul Schaeffer was there too.

1473
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:09,200
So it seems like he was like.

1474
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,640
Paul was like mitigating,

1475
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:12,200
he was making sure everything was okay.

1476
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:12,760
Yeah.

1477
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:13,940
He was like a chaperone.

1478
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,880
Yeah, they're just like running away from their in school.

1479
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:17,640
They're supposed to be like,

1480
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,040
we're gonna work on our ceramics project for school.

1481
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:21,860
And then they just go and they're like, hey Chevy.

1482
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:25,580
And like, so that's going on.

1483
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,520
I was gonna say that they,

1484
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:30,060
according to Wikipedia that Chevy and I guess Schaeffer

1485
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,520
would go, they'd like call,

1486
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,820
they'd cut meetings short for their things

1487
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:36,120
so that they could go like overlook,

1488
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,160
like look through a window at this taping

1489
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,260
and ogle the Croftettes, the swimmers.

1490
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,000
Oh yeah.

1491
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:43,180
Everyone would come by and like look at that.

1492
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,440
Cause there was also a window in the pool

1493
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,260
that they would shoot through.

1494
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,380
And so you could just like watch the women swimming

1495
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:48,240
through the water.

1496
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:49,280
Oh, also.

1497
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,420
Could you watch the clowns?

1498
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:51,520
Could you watch the clowns?

1499
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,300
Yeah.

1500
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:52,920
Okay.

1501
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:55,800
Then other thing is that they repeat like a conversation

1502
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,300
really early off where like all the men on the show,

1503
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,540
except for Bob Reed, just talk about how much like

1504
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,060
they would fuck Jerry.

1505
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,900
They're like, man, like all the three brothers are like,

1506
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:06,460
oh yeah.

1507
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,000
That was on the camera?

1508
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,520
No, no, behind the stage.

1509
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,300
They're just all talking about how this like teenage girl

1510
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,800
is like, oh God, yeah.

1511
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,480
The new girl playing their new sister

1512
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,200
where they just met like a week ago.

1513
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,040
They all, oh my God.

1514
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:19,920
So they're all just like,

1515
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,500
are they doing like the fifties version of it

1516
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,500
where they're like a wolf, woo, woo.

1517
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,160
Like, are they doing like wolf?

1518
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,220
No, I think one of them,

1519
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,520
I think one of them like bit his fist or something.

1520
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:31,680
That sounds like the fifth.

1521
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:32,700
Yeah, they're just like,

1522
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,660
they're just openly talking about how this like,

1523
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,140
this teen girl like could get it.

1524
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:36,980
Sure, sure.

1525
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:39,960
Well, can we say something also about like,

1526
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,360
because you're watching a lot of,

1527
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,380
at least in the pilot, I imagine the other episodes,

1528
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,680
it's as we've said, a lot of musical numbers

1529
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,180
and a lot of, you know, songs that are usually,

1530
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:51,040
that are usually romantic and from the point of view

1531
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,620
of I'm singing to you how I love you and you're beautiful.

1532
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:58,420
And these songs are being sung to you by a husband and wife

1533
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:01,600
and then a bunch of pairs of step brothers and sisters.

1534
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,840
So there's so many moments that are like,

1535
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,220
then they break off and Greg and Marcia dance together

1536
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:08,920
and Bobby and Cindy dance together,

1537
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,660
like slow dancing and dipping.

1538
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,140
And they're always like,

1539
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,000
there was this one scene between Greg and Marcia

1540
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,820
where they're inching closer and closer to each other.

1541
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,440
I don't even remember what they're talking about,

1542
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,040
but it's like the framing you would have

1543
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,520
right before a kiss happens.

1544
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:24,860
Yeah.

1545
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:25,680
And no kiss happens.

1546
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:29,260
It's just like the weirdest, horniest show

1547
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:31,500
between all of these step siblings.

1548
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,160
Predicting a worldwide communications network

1549
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,140
decades later filled with terabytes and petabytes

1550
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:42,420
of videos labeled not sister, not brother, step siblings.

1551
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:43,980
Did you say the word petabyte?

1552
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,400
Petabyte is the one above terabyte.

1553
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:46,800
Wow.

1554
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,300
That's awesome.

1555
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:47,560
Yeah.

1556
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:48,100
I never heard that.

1557
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:49,760
And it sounds- What are you referring to though?

1558
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,000
A porn website?

1559
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,500
Oh, pornography, like pornography.

1560
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,380
Like- Did you general the concept of pornography?

1561
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:57,220
That would be funny to just upload this show

1562
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:58,720
and be like, step, step siblings.

1563
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,980
Like step siblings dance together.

1564
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:03,900
So this is interesting.

1565
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,200
So the next episode is, so we have Tony Randall

1566
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,660
and we have Favre, Foz and Lee Majors,

1567
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,200
like, okay, those are modern stars.

1568
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,420
But then the next one, the star is Milton Berle.

1569
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,500
The guest star is Milton Berle.

1570
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,720
So once again, it's like an old person

1571
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:18,920
that nobody really cares about.

1572
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:23,460
And the plot of that one is that he takes over the show.

1573
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,320
There's a lot of like people take over the show

1574
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,740
and he makes it annoying

1575
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,460
and he makes dad wear a Carmen Miranda outfit

1576
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,920
that embarrasses him.

1577
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:34,100
It's a long sketch in the pilot is this,

1578
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:37,000
the humiliation of wearing a bunny costume

1579
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,880
or a bear costume.

1580
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:43,180
And there's a story that I guess Bruce Valanchelike

1581
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:46,120
was like, I wanna see your giant penis, Milton Berle.

1582
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,860
Cause I've heard it's really big.

1583
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:51,580
And he's like, and Milton Berle's like,

1584
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,780
why would I show it to you?

1585
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:58,340
And he says, I don't care that it's yours.

1586
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,980
I care because you had sex with Marilyn Monroe

1587
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,860
and I wanna see something that she saw.

1588
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,020
And that's, so he like says that to Berle

1589
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:09,460
in front of the whole writer's room and Berle denies him.

1590
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:10,960
Sounds right.

1591
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:11,440
Am I wrong?

1592
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,380
That's unnerving.

1593
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:14,640
Am I wrong though that it's in the Tom Shales book,

1594
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:17,040
Milton Berle shows like the cast of Saturday Night Live

1595
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,220
is penis, am I wrong?

1596
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,020
They're cool, they're hip.

1597
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:21,600
He's gotta impress them.

1598
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,020
There's no Valanches.

1599
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,140
Valanches time will come later with crystal monologues

1600
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,640
and whoopee monologues.

1601
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,140
In the 90s he would have shown his penis every day.

1602
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:31,560
Right.

1603
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,200
But yeah, Milton Berle was like, no, leave me alone.

1604
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:35,600
Wow.

1605
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:39,920
And the guest, the musical guest for this episode

1606
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,080
is Tina Turner.

1607
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,600
So it's Milton Berle, Tina Turner

1608
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,480
and a puppet named Colette who sings,

1609
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,880
it's like a sexy puppet who sings a song with,

1610
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,760
with the mill songs.

1611
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,760
I think if I've seen Colette.

1612
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:53,400
You maybe have seen it.

1613
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,160
On a different show.

1614
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:55,440
Yeah, where she's like, I sing with you

1615
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,200
and she's like this weird.

1616
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:01,560
She keeps calling him like some phrase involving pussy.

1617
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:05,300
Yeah, and she was an old school Croft show

1618
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,900
from like Croft's puppet from.

1619
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:07,540
Okay, okay.

1620
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:10,660
They had an erotic follies that kind of made them famous

1621
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,020
and then got them on Dean Martin.

1622
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:13,720
So they brought that out.

1623
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,360
There's a part in that number also where she's French

1624
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,780
and alluring and like, please, I want you to sing.

1625
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:21,860
What do you mean sing?

1626
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:23,260
Sing, sing.

1627
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:24,800
Isn't that a prison?

1628
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,120
Good joke.

1629
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,060
Little sing sing.

1630
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,680
Yeah, little sing sing joke.

1631
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,160
So, okay, so then we get to episode four,

1632
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,580
which for some reason this,

1633
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,700
this tape is just the pilot in episode four

1634
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:40,360
and there's no other episodes

1635
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,280
have ever been released officially.

1636
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,680
Oh, it's all on YouTube.

1637
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,140
I watched most of them on,

1638
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:47,140
the only one I can't find is the Red Fox episode.

1639
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,200
I can find some clips, but yeah, that one,

1640
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,960
but everything else is fully on YouTube

1641
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,860
and pretty good quality.

1642
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,460
So I encourage anybody who's interested

1643
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,160
to just go on YouTube and watch this stuff,

1644
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,200
including the ones we just watched.

1645
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,880
They cannot, they cannot let that out in public.

1646
00:57:58,960 --> 00:57:59,920
That one's locked in a vault.

1647
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:02,440
They cannot let out the comedic,

1648
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,200
like an actual comedic.

1649
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,220
A funny person.

1650
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,120
Yeah, a funny person.

1651
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:08,120
Not that Tony Randall wasn't funny,

1652
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,420
but that was bizarre.

1653
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,960
His appearance in this is bizarre.

1654
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,360
The Tony Randall musical number

1655
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,400
and I think the underwater clowns

1656
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,380
are the most where you can see like,

1657
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:18,100
oh, this is a Sid and Marty Croft thing.

1658
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:21,340
Yeah, and they're losing their mind and like.

1659
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,140
Fucking gross shit.

1660
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,400
What Florence Henderson's wearing in that clown thing,

1661
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,940
like a big bulbous kind of like,

1662
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,380
Commedia dell'arte.

1663
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,960
I need anything like that,

1664
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,540
a stupid little clown hat and then like a big Y.

1665
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:36,500
It's like Cirque du Soleil too.

1666
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:37,160
You know what I mean?

1667
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,120
Where like, yeah, like, yeah,

1668
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,180
you're a regular shaped person,

1669
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:43,780
but you wear a thing that makes you five times wider

1670
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:45,200
and little dots on that.

1671
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,080
You're kind of a doll.

1672
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,060
Well, but you like the Studio 60,

1673
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:48,920
Commedia dell'arte.

1674
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:49,620
Exactly.

1675
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:50,560
That's smart.

1676
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:52,860
That's like something you saw Sandy Duncan do

1677
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:53,880
30 years ago.

1678
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,480
Oh, it's shields and Yarnell kind of stuff.

1679
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:57,480
Awful, awful.

1680
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,880
There's that one Disney World special they're in,

1681
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,880
which I like because it's an old Disney World thing,

1682
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,520
but oh, and it's a Pinocchio thing.

1683
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,320
Shields and Yarnell plus Pinocchio.

1684
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:10,520
The worst.

1685
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,600
Raggedy Ann, raggedy Annies.

1686
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:12,920
Awful.

1687
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:16,040
Adults should never dress like Raggedy Ann,

1688
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,220
Raggedy Annie ever.

1689
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,480
So upsetting to me.

1690
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,100
So I want to show you guys just the middle

1691
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,580
of this episode four.

1692
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,720
And so maybe we could stop down briefly

1693
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:27,640
and we'll watch it and we'll talk about it.

1694
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,260
And this is like, just like extended,

1695
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:32,660
this is what the house sketches evolved into

1696
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:34,320
once Rip Taylor was on the scene

1697
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,100
and they had made it more clear that they had moved.

1698
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:38,720
Sure.

1699
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,620
All right, we'll be right back.

1700
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:40,880
Okay.

1701
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:41,980
Okay, we're back.

1702
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,280
We just watched a one act play.

1703
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:46,840
Yeah, there really had a lot of moves.

1704
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,560
There were a lot of moves in it and unexpected moves.

1705
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,500
Yeah, lots of surprises.

1706
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:55,620
Like I gotta say that you didn't see where it was going.

1707
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,240
Well, because so this sort of,

1708
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,520
let's just synopsize it before we have our observations

1709
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,000
really that there's a, well,

1710
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,900
in a very traditional sitcom way,

1711
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:09,520
Greg is annoyed because he's trying to play guitar

1712
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,840
and Marsha's reading a magazine.

1713
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,260
You can't, those things can't coexist.

1714
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,600
He's getting upset.

1715
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,360
And then this pushes him over the edge

1716
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,120
to announce his intention to move out of the house.

1717
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,360
He doesn't want to live with the Brady's anymore.

1718
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:27,420
So one thing to note for the listeners

1719
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:28,920
not looking at this,

1720
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,800
Greg Brady is 32 years old.

1721
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:33,880
He looks very old.

1722
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,760
In all of the scenes that we're watching,

1723
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:40,180
he has the, it's the most 70s on 70s on 70s,

1724
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:41,120
butterfly collar.

1725
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:41,740
It's huge.

1726
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,280
This is like why people started hating the 70s

1727
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:47,400
and making fun of the 70s is this was like maybe the,

1728
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:52,420
the most like height of insane, too much 70s at once.

1729
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,600
But anyway, all that to say he is like,

1730
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,520
it is the most open chest.

1731
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,040
Yeah.

1732
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:57,280
Yeah.

1733
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:57,960
The shirt goes, it's like,

1734
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:01,060
it's down to one button almost and so hairy.

1735
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:05,140
So why is it even a crisis that he's moving out of the house?

1736
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,900
Cause he's old, very old.

1737
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:07,680
He's very old.

1738
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:08,400
Very old.

1739
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:08,960
Yeah.

1740
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:09,340
Yeah.

1741
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,460
It's too much chest hair for a mother to be upset.

1742
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:13,220
You know what I'll say that I'll say about this.

1743
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:14,040
Cause we were talking about like,

1744
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:16,900
what do you like the, the first episode was confusing.

1745
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,520
Cause it's like, there's still the Brady's

1746
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,680
and they live in a house together,

1747
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,660
but it's mostly just about the variety show

1748
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:22,480
and them planning it.

1749
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,900
I do think probably people putting the show together,

1750
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:28,080
we're just like, well, what are these fuckers good at?

1751
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,160
What do people like about them?

1752
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,640
Well, they like it when they get into some sort of drama

1753
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,840
interpersonal drama.

1754
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,920
And they obviously were like, all right, great.

1755
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,520
Let's give them a juicy piece of plot

1756
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,800
that we're going to put into play here.

1757
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,480
So they're like, yeah, Greg's going to move.

1758
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:45,420
Instead of another medley about the general idea of dancing.

1759
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:46,180
Yeah.

1760
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,120
Let's get back, let's tell a story.

1761
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:48,860
Exactly.

1762
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,200
So I was like, okay, I could see where they're like,

1763
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,020
let's just do the thing that people like, you know?

1764
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:57,020
So this is where we're introduced to Rip Taylor.

1765
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:57,460
Mr.

1766
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:57,860
Merrill.

1767
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:02,240
Who is a renter of things in general, items and places,

1768
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:03,600
anything that can be rented.

1769
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:04,040
Yes.

1770
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:05,480
And just in the next episode, it's supposed to be like,

1771
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,260
also a comedian.

1772
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:08,640
He just says that he's like, I'm a comedian also.

1773
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,480
And then he just sort of ripped that on as a comedian.

1774
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,920
He's probably just on the variety show part two.

1775
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:13,220
Oh yeah.

1776
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:13,740
Okay.

1777
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:13,900
Yeah.

1778
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,520
Makes sense.

1779
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:17,860
So he comes in with the discovery that,

1780
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:21,000
with the information that there's already been an apartment

1781
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,680
set up for Greg.

1782
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:25,880
And then you watch them tour the apartment together.

1783
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,440
And this is very like,

1784
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,000
well, I think step-by-step did this five times.

1785
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:30,440
Yeah.

1786
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,400
Where a sibling,

1787
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,560
like a kid wants to move out and be on their own.

1788
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:35,240
And then they do for one night,

1789
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:37,760
but the apartment is weird and bad and run down.

1790
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,500
And I'm like, I'm way ahead of this.

1791
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:40,780
I've seen this a zillion times,

1792
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:44,300
but there was certainly a move that I did not see coming.

1793
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,920
Mike, do you, you were, because you lit up at the move.

1794
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,000
Can you, do you want to?

1795
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,300
I got excited because I heard there was a voice,

1796
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,640
very famous voice.

1797
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:55,060
I still can't really explain to you what he was doing there.

1798
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,780
But all of a sudden you hear a voice that I, I'm like,

1799
01:02:57,780 --> 01:03:01,360
Oh, it's Vincent Price is about to make his presence known.

1800
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,200
And that was correct.

1801
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:02,460
Yeah.

1802
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:06,200
And he comes in and he's very, he's just, you know,

1803
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,440
he's speaking like Vincent Price and doing his normal,

1804
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,140
like he's saying things like I can't track any of them.

1805
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:15,160
It's like, it sounds good, but I'm-

1806
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:15,800
Such dense language.

1807
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:19,580
The only one I wrote down is that he's assessing the

1808
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:23,900
apartment on behalf of half of the, the AGEA,

1809
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:26,580
the American Ghost Encounters Association.

1810
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:27,100
You're right.

1811
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:27,560
That was great.

1812
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,580
That was the best probably exchange.

1813
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:31,840
And he's talking about how it's beyond that.

1814
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:34,300
It's just a junky, bad apartment with a dirty window.

1815
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:35,640
The apartment is haunted.

1816
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,080
And who better to describe all that than Vincent Price.

1817
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:41,180
Which, which Greg realizes, like realizes,

1818
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:44,680
or just even says it about five minutes into the interaction.

1819
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,180
Hey, you're Vincent Price.

1820
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:46,880
Yeah.

1821
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,040
So he's not a character.

1822
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,820
Unlike Rip Taylor is a character and Barry Williams is

1823
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:53,060
Greg Brady, but this is real Vincent Price.

1824
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:53,580
Right.

1825
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,660
Does he wait, does he live there also?

1826
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:57,760
Or is he just checking it out?

1827
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:59,440
Cause he knows that a bunch of ghosts have been there.

1828
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,220
He's just an investigator.

1829
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:01,900
Yeah.

1830
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:03,040
He's just heard about some ghosts.

1831
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,180
He's like that.

1832
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:08,260
He's like, he's a creepy guy in real life, I guess,

1833
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:09,220
who loves ghosts.

1834
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:09,500
Yeah.

1835
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:11,360
But like a four minutes into the sketch,

1836
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,020
Greg goes, you're Vincent Price.

1837
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:13,460
Yeah.

1838
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:13,860
Yes.

1839
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:16,760
And is it helpful to clarify?

1840
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:17,360
Casey didn't know.

1841
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,200
We recognize him.

1842
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:20,480
But it is, cause you think maybe he's just some weird

1843
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,300
neighbor, but no, it's the actor.

1844
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,800
Rip Taylor leaves to rent another,

1845
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,980
cause he's got to rent another place to a 98 year old man.

1846
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:31,380
And he's shrinking by the second.

1847
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,420
So he gets out of there and then you're left with just

1848
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:36,680
Vincent and Greg.

1849
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:39,340
He mentions a lot of different ghost names.

1850
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,420
So many ghosts.

1851
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:41,560
So many things.

1852
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:44,440
And so many like turn of phrases that don't land.

1853
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:45,320
Oh yeah.

1854
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,560
He keeps naming someone named Binky

1855
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,340
and it's just getting no response.

1856
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:50,060
No response.

1857
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:52,720
This is what the Imagineers saw when they're like,

1858
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:55,660
we got to get him to do the voice of a Phantom Man

1859
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:56,960
or Disneyland Paris.

1860
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:57,400
Oh well he's fantastic.

1861
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:57,940
I mean look.

1862
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,040
And then get rid of it right away.

1863
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,640
And then get rid of it and then bring it back.

1864
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:01,240
He's back now.

1865
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:01,740
Yeah.

1866
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,540
He's no, he look, he's Vincent Price is great.

1867
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:08,100
It's just, this was a very, it's a long watch in this scene.

1868
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,760
It feels, every scene that we've seen so far,

1869
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:12,860
every element of this show feels like it could be shrunk

1870
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:14,120
by a third easily.

1871
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,940
Maybe more than just that's the first pass.

1872
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:17,300
Yeah.

1873
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:21,120
It's a different type of bad variety show sketch.

1874
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:24,320
Cause usually with all the old stuff I've been watching,

1875
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:27,800
like if Bing Crosby is doing a variety show

1876
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,200
and he's doing a bad sketch,

1877
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,520
it's full of lines that don't mean anything,

1878
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,280
but they at least usually move fast.

1879
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:34,740
Like it'll be like, oh, you're Bing Crosby.

1880
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,060
He goes, well, that's what the papers say or whatever.

1881
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,480
Like, what does that mean?

1882
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,860
That's not really a joke.

1883
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:41,780
Like it's not referencing anything.

1884
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:44,220
It's just to try to move, like fill up time.

1885
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,440
This is, yeah.

1886
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:49,400
Fill up, filled up with like just so much, so many words.

1887
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:50,600
And what is it all?

1888
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:54,260
It's still that we're struggling to even synopsize this.

1889
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,800
And then- The best part.

1890
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:57,140
Then we thought it was over.

1891
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,700
I was even said, okay, so is that,

1892
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,100
cause there's a long applause.

1893
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:03,620
And then it goes to Marsha in the studio talking to camera.

1894
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,860
Boy, things have been crazy at home lately.

1895
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:07,580
Anyway, check this out.

1896
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:09,040
And then we go back to the house.

1897
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,980
So why, when does the show happen?

1898
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,720
Is, are we missing a bunch of the variety show

1899
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:17,640
or is the, are the scenes in the house

1900
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,860
the variety show or not?

1901
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,460
I'm so hung up on reality here.

1902
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:21,120
I don't know.

1903
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:25,560
Way more so than the, the could the markedly stone writers

1904
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,640
were like the, the Lanch says as much

1905
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,460
that he was just high the whole time.

1906
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:30,820
Everyone involved in it, apparently.

1907
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:31,440
Yeah.

1908
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,420
And probably the director and musical director

1909
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:38,260
because the next thing is real hazy that, okay.

1910
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,520
So the next scene is-

1911
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,300
Great calls to give them his phone number

1912
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:42,860
and lies about liking the apartment.

1913
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:43,480
Right.

1914
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:44,000
Yeah.

1915
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:47,720
And everyone's so sad, especially Florence Henderson.

1916
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:50,640
There's a little like quiver in her voice.

1917
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:51,940
Mom, are you sick?

1918
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:54,080
No, just something in my throat.

1919
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:57,840
And then she stares at a very awkward photo

1920
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:01,500
of like a 15 year old, kind of not something you'd save.

1921
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,040
Yeah.

1922
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:03,180
A bad photo of her son.

1923
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,920
A bad black and white photo of her son.

1924
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:05,520
And it's big.

1925
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:06,560
It's a big photo too.

1926
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:08,360
And she's just holding staring at it.

1927
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:10,000
She doesn't doing it in front of everybody.

1928
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:12,360
That's usually a move you would do alone

1929
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,400
where you would stare at a photo,

1930
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,540
which I don't think I've ever done that.

1931
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:16,620
She just walked away from in the room with everybody,

1932
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,360
picked up a photo and stared at it.

1933
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,560
Two steps away.

1934
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,780
And then we were in her mind palace

1935
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:25,160
and she sings a song called Traces

1936
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:27,400
by the band called Classics Four.

1937
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:28,760
I did not know.

1938
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:29,900
I did not know that.

1939
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,540
Sometimes it's a famous hit of the time.

1940
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,220
And sometimes it's Classics Four.

1941
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:38,780
I just, I pulled it up on my phone too.

1942
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:42,840
Just so the listener can get a taste of this.

1943
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:45,160
So here's the song.

1944
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:48,540
This is, somebody saved this on YouTube

1945
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:52,540
with the video title Carol Brady Reveals True Feelings.

1946
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:57,060
So on the flip side, she's staring at a photo of her son.

1947
01:07:57,580 --> 01:07:59,480
He's staring at a photo of the whole family.

1948
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,500
They're thinking the same thing.

1949
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:01,860
They need to be back together.

1950
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,800
It's been three hours apart.

1951
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,720
He can easily move back in.

1952
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,740
They're gonna see each other at work.

1953
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:11,180
They all make a television show together.

1954
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:12,680
Long hours, presumably.

1955
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:14,020
They'll all see a dance rehearsal.

1956
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,480
But no, the idea that he moved out for a few hours

1957
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,540
is so sad that all this happens.

1958
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:22,300
This is all done with like a really hazy blue vignette.

1959
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,980
And we can describe things as we see him.

1960
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:25,600
He's on us.

1961
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,620
Let me skip back slightly.

1962
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:31,140
Traces of love

1963
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,360
Long ago

1964
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:38,760
All that didn't work out

1965
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,240
Grind

1966
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:45,860
Traces of love

1967
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:49,440
The real history.

1968
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:52,380
And then now there's a spiral staircase behind her with

1969
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:54,480
I'll burn myself

1970
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:58,100
I don't wanna be

1971
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,960
I'll burn myself anymore

1972
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,580
I'll burn myself

1973
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:15,040
The other stuff we've watched today has an OK voice.

1974
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,940
Obviously he's very cheesy and old school and whatever.

1975
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:19,920
That is not the song for him.

1976
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,480
It's a real Simon Cowell here.

1977
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:24,280
Yeah, yeah.

1978
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:28,820
So here's something that's really, really weird about this episode is that

1979
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:32,580
Vincent Price was not supposed to be that part.

1980
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:34,360
It was supposed to be Ted Knight.

1981
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:39,580
Wait, but Ghost Inspector was Ted Knight.

1982
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:40,780
I can't tell.

1983
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:44,260
But the last second, Ted Knight canceled and Vincent Price,

1984
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:46,360
I guess, did that part.

1985
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,200
They maybe they maybe what's supposed to be a ghost inspector.

1986
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,420
I don't know what they they got these guys.

1987
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,880
They got Vincent Price and Tony Randall by just leaving a door open.

1988
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,440
And they were just what's going on in the air.

1989
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,100
It's like, great, great.

1990
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:58,480
Come on.

1991
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:00,380
You got to fill out this start work real quick.

1992
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:02,120
I mean, he's in front of the camera now.

1993
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:06,620
Keep your stiff three piece polyester suit on.

1994
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:08,540
We'll just use it.

1995
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:09,700
Cameo inside.

1996
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:10,100
What?

1997
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,520
Yeah, maybe maybe the reason that that was such an odd scene

1998
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,040
was because they quickly rewrote it to be ghosts.

1999
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:18,600
Maybe like Ted Knight came in and he was going to be just like an uptight

2000
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:19,760
landlord or something.

2001
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:20,700
I don't know.

2002
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:21,620
But then we wrote it.

2003
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:25,820
The other thing is like this became so the ratings are just like plummeting.

2004
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:30,060
At this point, it did well when it was just one special,

2005
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:32,160
which is maybe what Eisner wanted to begin with.

2006
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:33,780
It did surprisingly OK.

2007
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:34,600
Hey, the Brady's are back.

2008
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:38,500
But I think nobody was ready for this to be on again and again.

2009
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:42,040
Once a month, once a month, and the time changes every time.

2010
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:42,720
Yeah.

2011
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,860
So this like you just are kind of turning on the TV a month later.

2012
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:46,720
This happens.

2013
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:51,000
And so because of that, also, the musical guests just kept canceling on them.

2014
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,700
So for this episode, the musical guest is Asia Puff and stuff.

2015
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:55,700
Wow.

2016
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:56,360
Wow.

2017
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:57,240
What?

2018
01:10:57,380 --> 01:11:01,120
Just flopping his big head and playing piano and like it's no it's not good.

2019
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,520
Did he regularly perform music on the show?

2020
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:04,300
I don't know.

2021
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:05,540
I don't even know that to be.

2022
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:07,240
I don't know the show very well.

2023
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:08,040
This is I don't either.

2024
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:10,680
I'm fascinated by the Crofts and so much of what they've done,

2025
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:14,340
but I find the Croft veneer so scary.

2026
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:14,800
Oh, yeah.

2027
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:15,740
Unpleasant.

2028
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:17,200
Well, I brought some of it to this.

2029
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:21,400
It's not it's not too full of scary puppets, but sometimes it is.

2030
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:24,440
But it is like the sets are horrifying.

2031
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,560
They're that first number of the entire series, baby face.

2032
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:34,540
That is the blend of like dark orange and the kind of olive yellow

2033
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:37,960
and dark reddish brown.

2034
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:44,280
It is such a like nausea inducing color palette and then just sparkles everywhere.

2035
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:48,660
And the sets are like falling apart and shaking as people dance on them.

2036
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:53,180
Like they were they were good at putting together a spectacle, but like a truly

2037
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:55,460
it makes things make me sick to my stomach.

2038
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:56,480
All of the Croft things.

2039
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,040
And I bet that ride, that pinball ride.

2040
01:11:59,360 --> 01:11:59,600
Oh, yeah.

2041
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,000
That may be like I would have thrown up on the pinball ride.

2042
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:04,740
Too much Croft ism at once.

2043
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:05,940
Yeah, I am realizing

2044
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:10,880
I have a collection, a DVD collection of Croft stuff

2045
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,980
that was lent to me before the pandemic.

2046
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:16,240
So now I've had it for a year and a half, but I still haven't cracked it open.

2047
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:19,740
And it's just random, random collections,

2048
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,500
random episodes of different, different series.

2049
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:26,960
And you were never tempted in the most like you needed escapism.

2050
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:28,180
The worst year ever.

2051
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,600
It was never going to go that far.

2052
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:34,840
It is it is underneath the best of the Jack Benny show DVDs.

2053
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:35,880
I'm not kidding.

2054
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:36,780
That's correct.

2055
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:37,280
Yeah.

2056
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:41,300
So one other important thing is that this episode ends with Frig

2057
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,460
moving back in, obviously, after like an hour.

2058
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:47,800
And then the family does a medley of songs about happiness.

2059
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,960
Happiness is a warm gun.

2060
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:53,860
Thank you.

2061
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:59,240
So the next episode is with Charo.

2062
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:01,740
I was going to ask earlier when is Charo show?

2063
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:02,440
Yeah, next one.

2064
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:05,860
It's the plot of this one was just another like this keeps coming back.

2065
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:07,720
Everyone tells Mike he's a bad singer.

2066
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,520
So he teams up with Charo and then Carol gets jealous.

2067
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:13,720
And this is the famous thing that happened in this was there's like a sketch

2068
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:17,860
where she's a cowboy and she and Peter Brady ends up kind of underneath

2069
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:20,640
her on the floor with her like having her leg up on him.

2070
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:25,940
And she's wearing like a denim, extremely short pair of shorts with no underwear.

2071
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:30,980
And he like looked up and saw her, her vulva and talks about it in the book

2072
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:35,840
that it was one of the most like jarring, like she's on camera staring.

2073
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,460
You can see his face, see her vulva.

2074
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:39,680
And it's crazy.

2075
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,860
He's like his eyes just like just his face.

2076
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:43,040
You can watch this.

2077
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,080
That frame exists.

2078
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:44,640
Yeah.

2079
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,340
Oh, I have it in the book.

2080
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:48,660
They actually single it out.

2081
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,300
This book is like pretty crazy.

2082
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:53,180
Like people are very open to just being.

2083
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:57,140
Susan Olsen involved in the book tells all that just comes clean about everything.

2084
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:00,180
And it is all this is pure variety show.

2085
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:00,920
The book.

2086
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:01,600
Yeah.

2087
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:04,980
Um, a lot of there's a lot of Brady books out there.

2088
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:08,240
I that's when I loved the Brady Bunch growing up and how I caught up

2089
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:12,740
so hard on Braves and when I was 10, 11, I read growing up Brady.

2090
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:13,720
Oh, yeah.

2091
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:14,020
Yeah.

2092
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:14,460
Williams.

2093
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,320
Oddly horny book.

2094
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:20,960
The book that is like entirely about I then I really had a crush on Florence

2095
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:25,780
and I took her on a date and I kissed her and then I really like we after every

2096
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:28,840
scene with Marsha, then we'd go hide and make out.

2097
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:35,080
And then there's this hideous TV movie based on it where they visualize all this.

2098
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:39,640
And it's too it's the Cali Cuoco far too young

2099
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:45,120
as like like seducing him in the pool with this little Barry Williams kid

2100
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:49,440
watching her descend into a pool and just like staring and licking his lips.

2101
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:50,640
It is the most upsetting.

2102
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:51,920
This is on NBC.

2103
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:54,600
They film this like time TV movie.

2104
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:55,160
Yes.

2105
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:55,640
Yeah.

2106
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:55,960
Yeah.

2107
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:59,320
I don't know why all the people talking about Hollywood,

2108
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,540
Pedo, all the queue, all that stuff.

2109
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:04,340
They never point to the TV movie growing up, Brady.

2110
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,240
Well, now you're getting right there.

2111
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:06,960
Fuel.

2112
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:07,360
Yeah.

2113
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:07,540
Yeah.

2114
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:08,180
Go find it.

2115
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:09,680
All your answers are there.

2116
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:12,260
I will find you guys this frame, please.

2117
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:15,080
We're done of him looking up and up her butt.

2118
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,760
It's really she's Louise.

2119
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,720
So but importantly, OK, so the next episode.

2120
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:27,260
So back behind the scenes, things are really going to crap.

2121
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:28,500
And I'll explain how.

2122
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:32,040
But the Charo episode ends with them just singing

2123
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,980
a America, the beautiful.

2124
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:40,600
The next episode is Edgar Bergen, Charlie McCarthy and Rich Little.

2125
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:43,300
And Melanie, yes, I've got a brand new pair of English.

2126
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:47,280
Every person's name, you say I've watched 10 YouTube videos about them

2127
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,920
in the last week.

2128
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:52,200
The plot of this one is Rich Little develops amnesia

2129
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:53,880
and believes he's one of the Brady children.

2130
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,680
Like, just to be clear, you know, the pandemic ended, right?

2131
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:00,680
You don't have to do it.

2132
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:01,960
Antemic.

2133
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:05,160
What?

2134
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:07,860
And then.

2135
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:11,620
OK, hold on.

2136
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:13,780
The next episode is the one I can't find.

2137
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:15,360
It's with Rich Red Fox.

2138
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:15,800
Right.

2139
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:18,140
But the plot of that one is

2140
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:23,220
Marcia announced her engagement to a to a carefree hippie named Winston Beaumont.

2141
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,940
Meanwhile, Red Fox lurks around the set.

2142
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,840
OK, what would a hippie be named Winston Beaumont?

2143
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,220
It's a stuffy name.

2144
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:32,060
I don't know.

2145
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,380
So then we're we're in the OK.

2146
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:35,760
So this one's really weird.

2147
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:42,620
Episode eight is Rick Dees and and the kids from What's Happening.

2148
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:46,140
And the plot of that one is that the Brady kids meet the kids

2149
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:49,080
from What's Happening and they're like, you should be on the show.

2150
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:51,100
You should be guests on the show, which is like, OK.

2151
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,460
And then everyone's like, no, they can't.

2152
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:54,740
They can't be on the show.

2153
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:56,000
Oh, what?

2154
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:59,240
Which is why I don't I don't know.

2155
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,400
It's like racism.

2156
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,160
It's just very uncomfortable.

2157
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:07,520
And and Rick Dees sings a disco, no, just gorilla.

2158
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:08,200
Damn it.

2159
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,400
Which is the later.

2160
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:12,640
But he's he's debuting his new song Dis Gorilla.

2161
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:15,480
And it's a real thing where I've never heard of this.

2162
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:16,440
It's on this episode.

2163
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:17,160
You can watch it.

2164
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:21,440
I love the Bee Gees documentary where Rick Dees personally is pinned

2165
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:25,980
for the death of disco and for making it not cool to like stuff like the Bee Gees

2166
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:26,700
for a long time.

2167
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:29,980
It's all put on Rick Dees shoulders, rightfully so.

2168
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,140
What a bunch of crap.

2169
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,800
You don't like disco duck at all.

2170
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:34,060
I don't know.

2171
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:35,160
Stupid, bad.

2172
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,980
And I guess it's supposed to be a novelty.

2173
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,980
But I also listen to Rick Dees growing up because he was like the he was the DJ

2174
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:42,400
on the cool station.

2175
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:42,820
Yeah.

2176
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:45,520
Where I'm trying to I'm like, OK, at this time, I'm like,

2177
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:47,880
I know too much about the Brady's and Jerry Reichel.

2178
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,820
I have to catch up on what music is.

2179
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,100
What's cool right now?

2180
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,720
Quad City DJ is OK.

2181
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:53,940
Oh, God.

2182
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:54,460
Oh, yeah.

2183
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:54,620
All right.

2184
01:17:54,620 --> 01:18:00,280
Now we're at the book around Peter staring up at Charles vulva.

2185
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:05,400
And yeah, he's in awe of his legs in the foreground.

2186
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,560
Pass this around.

2187
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:08,320
You guys can be in awe of this too.

2188
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:11,180
Just about Rick Dees, I was going to say, like, so I'm trying to like

2189
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:14,200
I have to suffer through like, well, I guess Rick Dees is my ticket

2190
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,860
to what's cool in 1997.

2191
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:16,660
I better listen.

2192
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:21,080
You know, he would just do Karnak just Karnak in 1997

2193
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,260
on the radio post Carson retirement.

2194
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:24,680
And there was no twist.

2195
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:25,700
It wasn't like Karnak.

2196
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:27,680
But this just stole it.

2197
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,600
On the low, the weird list.

2198
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:30,820
It's same thing.

2199
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:31,960
We're back.

2200
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:36,660
He'll disco like the stink of him ended up on the Bee Gees.

2201
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,700
And he stole from Carson.

2202
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:39,540
Wow.

2203
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:41,300
So this is OK.

2204
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:44,400
So this is where we're getting up to the end of this.

2205
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:44,940
This.

2206
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,980
So this is how things start to fall apart on set.

2207
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:53,560
So Francis, for the first time ever, turns on everyone.

2208
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,900
She's been nice to them their entire life.

2209
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:59,260
She starts screaming at everyone for not learning their choreography

2210
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:03,500
because they're according to the words of the Susan Olsen

2211
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:06,560
quote, shitting in her church, which is musical theater.

2212
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,080
Florence, Florence.

2213
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:08,560
OK.

2214
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:08,940
Yeah.

2215
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,440
Florence is yelling at everybody.

2216
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:10,740
OK.

2217
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,720
And being like, you don't learn the choreography like

2218
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:13,900
and start screaming at everybody.

2219
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,820
So Bob, even though he's good friends with her, starts screaming at her

2220
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:19,120
for yelling at them.

2221
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,620
This was way before Arrested Development.

2222
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,680
It's predated the whole thing.

2223
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,360
There's all just like there's all screaming at each other.

2224
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:29,260
He starts like going to this bar.

2225
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,280
That's not the Denny's.

2226
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,680
It's like a bar on the other across from the studio.

2227
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:36,520
And the crew guys keep finding Bob like just drinking after work.

2228
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:41,040
A horse steps on Susan Olsen's foot and breaks her toe.

2229
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:43,880
So she has a hard time like just doing choreography.

2230
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,380
This is outside of shooting.

2231
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:49,480
Mike Lookinland's mom just abandons him on set

2232
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:52,400
and stops coming to tapings because she's getting divorced

2233
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,300
and she's worried about getting excommunicated from the Mormon church.

2234
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:56,500
Oh, my God.

2235
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:00,380
Marty Croft calls Susan's mother into a meeting and says like,

2236
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:01,260
she has to lose weight.

2237
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:02,480
She's 15 years old.

2238
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:03,960
She's like 105 pounds.

2239
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:05,260
You have to lose 20 pounds.

2240
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,760
You have to look more like Marsha.

2241
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:11,180
And so so Susan has started sneaking to the Denny's to eat salads

2242
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:13,020
instead of eating with everybody else.

2243
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:15,160
So she's going by herself to the Denny's.

2244
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,160
Cast across the street.

2245
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:20,580
Denny's got a freeway.

2246
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:23,260
But the real problem behind everything is Maureen,

2247
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:25,680
because this is the point at which she's been open about this.

2248
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:30,800
She is for the entire episode of all the whole year, coked out of her mind.

2249
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:34,980
And so she starts she's locking herself in her dressing room,

2250
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,400
doing lines of coke, not coming out to do.

2251
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:40,360
And every scene has all six of them in it or all eight of them.

2252
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:42,520
So they can't do anything without her.

2253
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:44,540
And we're pointing at her.

2254
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:46,160
Like she's skinny, be like her.

2255
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:48,540
Is there an anorexia part of it as well?

2256
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:53,460
Both bulimia and she's also like like she has covered in like they have to put

2257
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:56,780
makeup on her because she's covered in bruises because she's like injecting cocaine.

2258
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:57,780
Oh, my God.

2259
01:20:58,740 --> 01:20:58,740
Jesus.

2260
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:05,100
So this is the darkest making of I maybe have ever heard.

2261
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:07,620
Darker than the Vincent Price cameo.

2262
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:11,480
She shows up having not slept for three days one day.

2263
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:14,440
Then she then the next day they're shooting with Rich Little.

2264
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:16,480
She just doesn't show up.

2265
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:19,680
And so she so they and then they call she calls.

2266
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:20,560
She's like, I've got the flu.

2267
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,000
So Sid and Marty Croft, this is an interesting thing.

2268
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,560
They were actually there was no studio behind it.

2269
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,640
They were financing the whole show themselves.

2270
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:29,500
And if they have to shut down production, it's on them.

2271
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:32,340
So they are like, OK, I guess we do have to do insurance

2272
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:35,660
and like shut down the show until she comes back.

2273
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:38,180
So they call insurance like we have to shut down the show.

2274
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,040
We're we're missing an actor.

2275
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:39,820
She has the flu.

2276
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,920
And the insurance is like, well, you have to send her to a doctor right now

2277
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:44,800
to get a physical to prove that she has the flu.

2278
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:47,280
But we absolutely can't do that.

2279
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:51,200
So they teach fake Jan all of Maureen's numbers.

2280
01:21:51,460 --> 01:21:53,600
She stays up all night and learns them.

2281
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:54,960
They're about to shoot.

2282
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:58,340
Maureen just walks back in like, hey, what's everybody doing?

2283
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:05,780
So Marty Croft in front of the entire cast shrieks at her

2284
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:08,760
and yells at her and like makes her start crying.

2285
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:14,520
And then then the Rick Day's episode, they film it.

2286
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:17,400
And that's the one that aired opposite the Oscars telecast.

2287
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:19,760
My God.

2288
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,700
Why put anything on?

2289
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:22,880
I just don't.

2290
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:23,380
Wow.

2291
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:27,420
So then we get to the finale, which is like the darkest.

2292
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:30,220
And I don't want to I just tell you what it's about.

2293
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:33,600
But it's like because I encourage you guys to watch it separately.

2294
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:36,140
But it's on.

2295
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:39,720
Are we going to be like too depressed after it's disturbed?

2296
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:40,940
Yeah, it's really weird.

2297
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:45,840
So the musical and guest star of the final episode is Paul Williams.

2298
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:49,060
And I didn't know anything about Paul Williams.

2299
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:51,920
I think I barely even knew he existed before this.

2300
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:53,880
I'm not a huge person.

2301
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:55,600
Like, I don't know, Emmett, whatever.

2302
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,800
I just had missed Paul Williams.

2303
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,220
Yeah.

2304
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:02,020
So the only plot for him is that he just walked into the house

2305
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:04,020
and said, Carol Brady, he's in love with her.

2306
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:06,800
And as soon as he gets in.

2307
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,240
Yeah, he just says like, I'm in love with you.

2308
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:09,340
I'm in love with Carol Brady.

2309
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:12,380
And then like the dad's like, hey, you look here, mister.

2310
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:14,120
Like, there's a lot of that happening back and forth.

2311
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:16,360
Like people going like, look here, like Charo.

2312
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:19,380
If you if you also if you don't know Paul Williams, yeah,

2313
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,120
probably most famous for writing Green Book Connection.

2314
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:24,020
If you if you don't know who we're talking about, just Google image.

2315
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:25,000
You'll go, oh, yeah, right.

2316
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:28,400
Yes, this guy like 70s oddball.

2317
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:29,760
Phantom of the Paradise.

2318
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:34,480
Yeah, yeah, like cameo machine, like odd, odd light hair.

2319
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:38,140
Still a rat like wrote a lot of stuff I like seems cool.

2320
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,240
Yeah, like big sobriety advocate.

2321
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:45,060
But he on the 70s, like so I discovered him in the same way.

2322
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:46,580
You just see him on things and like what?

2323
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:46,960
Why?

2324
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:47,760
Who are you?

2325
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,960
Yeah, he's got such a strange presence.

2326
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:53,800
It's usually missing the context of he's a songwriter or musician.

2327
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,560
You just don't know why he's there.

2328
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:57,460
Often not singing, like acting.

2329
01:23:57,460 --> 01:24:01,800
Yeah, he's never he's not very well justified in this era.

2330
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:02,600
His newer stuff.

2331
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:04,640
He's in Baby Driver.

2332
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:06,380
He has one scene in Baby Driver.

2333
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:06,940
Yeah.

2334
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:09,720
And then he's on that Last Daff Punk album a lot.

2335
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:10,960
He wrote Evergreen.

2336
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:13,520
He won an Oscar for the Barbra Streisand song.

2337
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:13,960
Yeah.

2338
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:14,380
Evergreen.

2339
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:16,600
The Ishtar songs I just discovered.

2340
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:19,300
And I was wow, is a Ishtar mixed bag for me.

2341
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,260
But the songs are pretty awesome.

2342
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:24,500
Bugsy Malone, which I always in the back of my head always thought Harry

2343
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:27,520
Nielsen wrote, Paul Williams wrote and recorded all the songs for Bugsy Malone.

2344
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:31,240
Similar figures, similar, like sort of like the same, like clever

2345
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:35,700
songwriters, like insane heedness in their personal lives.

2346
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:40,060
But also and Randy Newman, maybe kind of like around the same.

2347
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:45,720
But so basically what comes out is that like he's super drunk on set.

2348
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:50,940
And so because I was like, I was just like really sensing a lot of like anger

2349
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:51,820
from him.

2350
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,860
And that's why you watch this, like you can sense the anger.

2351
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:58,820
Because also, like at this point, the writers have gotten just so vicious.

2352
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:02,800
So the only joke they make over and over again is that Paul Williams is short

2353
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,900
and they make everybody do it in these like really cruel, like

2354
01:25:07,620 --> 01:25:08,060
ways.

2355
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:10,060
And it's he's always the butt of every joke.

2356
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:11,300
And he's like, I'm in love with Carol Brady.

2357
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:14,940
And everyone's like, yeah, you're well, I shan't be watching this

2358
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:18,580
triggering a crazy musical.

2359
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:22,520
The lead into the pool, the and every episode, like

2360
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:27,880
Greg shoves Peter in the pool and this one like Peter's already shoved himself

2361
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:31,580
in the pool and then Paul Williams, like so he's like, you can't shove me in the

2362
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:31,660
pool.

2363
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:32,680
I'm already in the pool.

2364
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:36,980
And then Greg's there and Paul Williams comes out and they make some like

2365
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:38,880
more jokes about his height.

2366
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:43,560
And then Paul Williams gets up close and he says under his breath, don't ever

2367
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:46,820
touch my body and shoves Greg into the pool.

2368
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:52,140
And it seems it's the most like raw line I was ever delivered on this show is

2369
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:55,680
just don't ever touch my body, like barely audible.

2370
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,700
So I encourage you guys all to watch that in the finale.

2371
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:01,620
How many are there?

2372
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:02,400
Nine episodes.

2373
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:03,600
There's nine episodes.

2374
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:08,680
And it aired over the course of one year, like basically once a month for nine

2375
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:09,060
months.

2376
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:13,460
OK, but they're producing it nonstop because it's all such complicated

2377
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:13,920
production.

2378
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:14,360
Yeah.

2379
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:15,900
And this is crazy.

2380
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:20,480
So they this is this is where I'm like, how is this possible?

2381
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:24,200
The end of the book implies that nine episodes are aired.

2382
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:27,380
The show gets canceled after the wrap party at the old spaghetti factory.

2383
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:32,300
The only person only person who sat is Jan because she has to go back to school.

2384
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:33,880
Everyone else is just like, oh, thank God.

2385
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:38,940
But they implied that they shot like like a full season.

2386
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,660
They shot dozens and dozens.

2387
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:46,620
There's tons of episodes in the can somewhere of this show that were never aired.

2388
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:47,580
Wow.

2389
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:49,080
And they just exist somewhere.

2390
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:51,820
Like twenty five episodes.

2391
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:52,540
Whoa.

2392
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,160
So this wasn't supposed to be the finale.

2393
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:57,600
It's just like this is how it goes out with this weird Paul Williams episode.

2394
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:58,040
Whoa.

2395
01:26:58,300 --> 01:26:59,640
And that's it.

2396
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:01,410
That's the end of it.

2397
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:06,980
And this is well before Eisner has the hits at Disney and stuff.

2398
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:07,320
Yeah.

2399
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:09,320
He's at Paramount or ABC.

2400
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:10,660
He's at ABC before Paramount.

2401
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:11,840
He got ABC out of last place.

2402
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:12,520
That was what he did.

2403
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:12,740
Right.

2404
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:13,980
He's a programming executive.

2405
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:15,920
Part of the success of Happy Days, I think.

2406
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,800
I'm trying to think what I associate with Eisner.

2407
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,120
Some big, big hits.

2408
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:20,740
Donnie and Marie too was his thing.

2409
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:21,900
He put that together.

2410
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:22,240
OK.

2411
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:23,520
So, yeah.

2412
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:26,640
But yeah, he's he's a young enterprise executive.

2413
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:30,160
So this but this was like a huge, huge disaster on all fronts.

2414
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:33,540
And people, I mean, literally splintered the family unit,

2415
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:35,500
made them all mad at each other.

2416
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:35,920
Right.

2417
01:27:37,180 --> 01:27:40,540
And yet they kept like there were so many more.

2418
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:41,720
Yeah, they would come back.

2419
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:45,860
There's the Brady's Get Married, which turned into this pretty awful

2420
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:49,280
brief threes company kind of show called The Brady Brides.

2421
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:50,200
And then there was the.

2422
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:52,100
Marsha's still on drugs through that.

2423
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:52,800
Wow.

2424
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:53,460
Really?

2425
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:56,520
And they're all like, should we ask if she's off them?

2426
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:57,880
Should there be an adjustment?

2427
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:58,680
It's fine.

2428
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,400
Just get her in.

2429
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,560
She's willing to be here.

2430
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:01,140
So.

2431
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:01,540
Yeah.

2432
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:03,740
There's always one missing in all of them.

2433
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,300
Like there's a fake Marsha in the movie.

2434
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:09,860
There's a fake or wait or Marsha.

2435
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:11,400
There's a fake Marsha on the show.

2436
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:15,640
The one hour drama, The Brady's, which has a big

2437
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:20,460
story about Bobby being like almost paralyzed.

2438
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:21,840
Ray and a race car driver.

2439
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:24,760
They set up that he's a race car driver earlier and then in one

2440
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:26,960
and one movie he gets like almost paralyzed.

2441
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,340
That's the one I've seen the most.

2442
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:29,220
Yeah.

2443
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:29,840
Yeah.

2444
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:30,240
Yeah.

2445
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:33,120
Is that the one where Robert Reed saves somebody from saves

2446
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:36,160
like a bunch of construction workers from a site

2447
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:38,260
because there's a collapse of some kind?

2448
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:39,620
It's a Christmas movie.

2449
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:40,140
That's OK.

2450
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:41,440
Am I being gaslit?

2451
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:42,560
Is this weird?

2452
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:44,400
Like, I didn't know any of this happened.

2453
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:47,960
I thought it went to the sitcom, the variety show.

2454
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:51,500
And then they did the get like 90s, the funny 90s movies

2455
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:52,160
that acknowledge.

2456
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:54,480
Oh, my God.

2457
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:59,140
Not three, two entire other series, which involved a lot of mini movies.

2458
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:02,140
One in the late 70s and one in the early 90s.

2459
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:05,180
From somebody who's even more of a Brady Fane here, like we do with Lucy.

2460
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:08,720
I think that they set up Bobby as race car driver in Christmas

2461
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:11,580
special where Robert Reed saves people and then they parallel

2462
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:13,020
almost paralyze him later.

2463
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:15,300
Yeah, they made a separate event.

2464
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:19,380
And then with the love of his girlfriend, MTV, VJ Martha Quinn,

2465
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:21,920
right, was able to slowly learn how to walk again.

2466
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,640
I remember this like seeing that on TV.

2467
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:27,480
I was vaguely aware of the Brady Bunch already at like three or four.

2468
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:31,380
And then this comes on at five and like groan Bobby Brady

2469
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:34,980
is in a car accident and can't walk like I think I had to get

2470
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:36,860
like talked down to sleep that night.

2471
01:29:36,860 --> 01:29:40,220
Like my parents, it was way too upsetting for me.

2472
01:29:40,220 --> 01:29:41,060
Five.

2473
01:29:41,740 --> 01:29:42,120
Wow.

2474
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:43,960
So much content.

2475
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:45,080
Yeah, so much content.

2476
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,500
They that's what I love about that.

2477
01:29:47,660 --> 01:29:51,200
I think like, I mean, they encapsulate a lot that I love a lot

2478
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:55,600
where it's just like boatloads of stuff and some of it's good legitimately.

2479
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:58,660
And some of it is the worst junk ever made.

2480
01:29:58,980 --> 01:30:02,500
Like a lot of bands, I like sort of follow that format.

2481
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:07,820
I feel like I learned it's like the entry point to Kitsch is the Brady's.

2482
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:12,420
Like how much how far can this go?

2483
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:17,060
It was already like a little wild with the froze and open chest.

2484
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:18,420
And the fashion was crazy.

2485
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:21,080
And Florence Henderson's hair with the weird bob.

2486
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:25,980
And then it like the the variety show is just like all of it on cocaine.

2487
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:29,080
Just like these times, Brady's times Brady's.

2488
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:29,480
Yeah, yeah.

2489
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:33,020
Like literally give them all drugs and like the one girl.

2490
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:36,980
Like you can see the light in her eyes, just sparkling with cocaine

2491
01:30:36,980 --> 01:30:40,520
and those shots went out with it, you know, and you know,

2492
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:43,120
she looks a little crazed, I guess crazed with drugs.

2493
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:43,580
Yeah.

2494
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:44,160
Yeah.

2495
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:46,320
She's wild, which he hasn't slept for three days.

2496
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:47,440
She's out of her mind.

2497
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:51,540
We make jokes about, you know, like the Disney announcing the 10 different

2498
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:54,240
Star Wars shows, but that's what this shit is.

2499
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:57,220
It's all just like it's also more spaced out and less planned.

2500
01:30:57,380 --> 01:31:00,860
It's like, all right, now they're a variety show and let's throw some shit

2501
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:03,820
at the wall and it's all now they're not slanting, not slanting.

2502
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:05,740
Yeah, just dump whatever you do it.

2503
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:06,520
They're not busy.

2504
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:07,600
They aren't dead yet.

2505
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:08,200
Great.

2506
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:13,160
Milton Burl's bullying them and whatever.

2507
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:14,220
Rick Deez is here.

2508
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:15,060
OK, go for it.

2509
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:15,500
You're good.

2510
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:16,000
Whatever.

2511
01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:19,880
Let's just make eight episodes about them fighting.

2512
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:20,860
Here's the idea.

2513
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:23,320
The Brady Bunch has a song and dance show together.

2514
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:26,640
And every time all of them are mad at one person

2515
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:29,580
and want them to not be on the song and dance show.

2516
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:30,500
Oh, well, change it up.

2517
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:32,440
Let's have the cast of What's Happening show up.

2518
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:35,360
And now they're mad at them and they can't be on the song and dance show.

2519
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:38,560
It's so much more snippy than the show.

2520
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,080
Yeah, they love each other.

2521
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:44,240
And this whole thing, it's just busting balls and you jerk and Jan saying,

2522
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:47,160
I wish I was dead and Marsha then replying.

2523
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:49,160
Yeah, I wish Jan was dead.

2524
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:51,020
So abrasive.

2525
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,360
Is this the most just

2526
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:57,480
exploited property from this era?

2527
01:31:57,780 --> 01:32:00,080
Because like there were so many monster shows.

2528
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:01,220
Oh, yeah.

2529
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:02,460
Movies, shows.

2530
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:05,080
And then one with Jason Mars.

2531
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:06,240
There's a couple of get smart.

2532
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:11,100
Brady Bunch was a great series that had legs.

2533
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:12,860
Get smart.

2534
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:14,000
There's a couple of get smarts.

2535
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:16,560
And there's get smart again with Andy Dick in the 90s.

2536
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:18,360
I I sat.

2537
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,960
It was a point in the television for me to watch.

2538
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:21,980
I've watched it.

2539
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:22,480
Smart.

2540
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:24,740
I watched their pilot of Get Smart.

2541
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:25,400
Whatever.

2542
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:27,100
I don't know what's called Get Smart again.

2543
01:32:27,140 --> 01:32:28,020
I think it was just get smart.

2544
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:30,620
I watched that pilot in the last two months, I think.

2545
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:31,940
I was thinking about it.

2546
01:32:31,940 --> 01:32:34,060
I was remembering and thinking I should look it up.

2547
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:35,920
Yeah, it's it's bad.

2548
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:36,940
Her brains are broken.

2549
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:41,540
This Brady industrial complex, this this kind of makes me understand

2550
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:45,940
why like when I was growing up, you'd see comedians or commentators

2551
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:48,940
or every now and then like academics or something like, oh,

2552
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:50,460
and then there's television.

2553
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:51,140
Yuck.

2554
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:55,640
And I was like, oh, maybe that is about the Brady.

2555
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:57,920
OK, maybe that's what this is.

2556
01:32:58,180 --> 01:32:58,180
Yeah.

2557
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,780
And like cynical variety show crossover.

2558
01:33:01,580 --> 01:33:01,580
Yeah.

2559
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:02,120
Yeah.

2560
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:03,100
Hard to defend.

2561
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:04,040
That's for sure.

2562
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:05,540
I mean, it's it's wretched.

2563
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:08,580
It kind of makes the era of like, I guess,

2564
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:13,440
Presti were in like Prestige TV version two or three at this point.

2565
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:17,900
But it kind of makes it like a miracle that like from the advent of television.

2566
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:21,880
So in so few decades, it got to Prestige TV.

2567
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:26,700
But through its infancy, it had to go through the Brady Punch variety hour.

2568
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:27,400
Yeah.

2569
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,680
It's funny also that like, you know, the weird

2570
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:34,880
the twists and turns of Eisner's career where now he's one of the people

2571
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:38,720
responsible for Bojack Horseman, which is like a pretty prestige.

2572
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:43,100
It's always on critics lists and well regarded and like a deeper show for anime.

2573
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:44,500
So he's part of that.

2574
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:48,080
But then also greenlit this like right.

2575
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:51,160
70s meets the 1920s,

2576
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:58,800
like razzle dazzle, lots of celebrations of pseudo incest.

2577
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:02,100
He like set up this this den of iniquity

2578
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:06,440
where they're just like he set up like a place on the KTL lot,

2579
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:12,240
a KTLA lot for sort of beloved sitcom actors to lose their minds

2580
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:17,580
and completely unravel, go to their darkest points like the worst trash.

2581
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:22,120
Like what happened to Bojack Horseman is he did that to them.

2582
01:34:22,820 --> 01:34:25,740
And he made Bojack Horseman about what he did to them.

2583
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:26,760
Basically.

2584
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:30,160
And he was he was feeding the secret stories.

2585
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:31,880
Yeah, that was only he knows.

2586
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:34,100
I'll tell you about what happened to Marcia.

2587
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:38,680
And then and then Eisner at the end, like towards the end of his heights

2588
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:44,700
at Disney is replaced by Bob Iger, who worked his way up

2589
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:50,040
and became the head of ABC, did a similar turn and saved ABC

2590
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:54,060
by putting on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire eight days a week.

2591
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:59,300
And then just through sheer luck, through like clawing and fighting

2592
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:04,560
on the creative's end, they begrudgingly greenlit two big hits,

2593
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,320
Lost and Desperate Housewives.

2594
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:09,620
And everyone at Disney was like, what are these fucking things?

2595
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,420
Fine, just do it.

2596
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:16,180
And then like just kind of like within the first seasons of both those shows,

2597
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:18,720
I feel like we're we're we're pretty big.

2598
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:22,700
So then Iger, it's it's but yeah, who wants to be a millionaire?

2599
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:28,440
They were like people similarly were like kind of sick of it pretty quickly.

2600
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:29,020
Yeah.

2601
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:29,440
Yeah.

2602
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:32,000
And then and then it was topped by Survivor.

2603
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,200
Survivor immediately eclipsed.

2604
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:35,140
No, yeah.

2605
01:35:35,380 --> 01:35:35,700
Reality.

2606
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:36,240
Yeah.

2607
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:38,160
You guys know who invented the game?

2608
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:39,060
Who wants to be a millionaire?

2609
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:39,660
No.

2610
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:44,540
Steven Knight, the director, who also he made Peaky Blinders.

2611
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:45,820
He made the movie Serenity.

2612
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:46,300
Really?

2613
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:47,000
He made a lot.

2614
01:35:47,380 --> 01:35:50,520
He he was one of the two people that came up with what was called

2615
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:52,640
Cash Mountain when they pitched it.

2616
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:53,180
Better name.

2617
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:54,000
Yeah.

2618
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:54,800
Who wants to be a millionaire?

2619
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:55,640
Yeah.

2620
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:56,040
Parky.

2621
01:35:56,180 --> 01:35:56,500
Yeah.

2622
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:56,920
Cash Mountain.

2623
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:57,620
It was fun.

2624
01:35:57,780 --> 01:35:58,220
Yeah.

2625
01:35:58,220 --> 01:35:58,360
Wow.

2626
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:00,440
He like owns that game.

2627
01:36:00,820 --> 01:36:02,680
So he's the richest person alive.

2628
01:36:02,860 --> 01:36:05,120
And then he went and made all these weird Tom Hardy movies.

2629
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:06,920
And then he made Serenity.

2630
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:07,560
Wow.

2631
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:08,840
I didn't know.

2632
01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:10,400
Oh, the McConaughey Serenity.

2633
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:10,720
Yeah.

2634
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:11,100
OK.

2635
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:12,380
Oh, geez.

2636
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:16,240
He made that and he made the one people like more.

2637
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:16,960
No, no, no.

2638
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:17,840
Insane Serenity.

2639
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,420
The Fishing Noir Serenity.

2640
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:20,760
From the same mind.

2641
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:21,340
Wow.

2642
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:21,800
Wow.

2643
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:22,240
Yeah.

2644
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:25,260
This guy is kind of a this guy is kind of a nice nerd.

2645
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:26,000
Weird dude.

2646
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,940
Oscar nominated for Dirty Pretty Things screenplay.

2647
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:29,460
Wow.

2648
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:30,120
Wow.

2649
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:31,660
And yeah, weird guy.

2650
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:34,780
I don't know what else to say.

2651
01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:35,220
Yeah.

2652
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:36,200
What an odyssey.

2653
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,440
I appreciate you guys taking this journey.

2654
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:41,120
I know we appreciate you bringing the journey to us.

2655
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:42,800
Always do.

2656
01:36:43,180 --> 01:36:45,180
Like just dictate topics.

2657
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:46,120
You tell us.

2658
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:47,560
That's I think how this works.

2659
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:51,940
Well, how many episodes like I'm looking for an excuse to talk about Rip Taylor.

2660
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:56,020
I'm looking for an excuse to tangent on all of the things I'm

2661
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:58,560
consuming more than popular culture.

2662
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:03,600
As long as I know you consuming to like this isn't like a recent thing.

2663
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,180
This shit on this is the real shit.

2664
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:07,800
You'll be you'll be watching some of these, I think later.

2665
01:37:08,180 --> 01:37:11,260
But I think I think you got to watch the finale.

2666
01:37:11,380 --> 01:37:12,220
It's wild.

2667
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:12,620
Yeah.

2668
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:15,780
Well, how far are we from like, you know, I kept watching a very bunch of

2669
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:16,720
it's good.

2670
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:19,060
Maybe Brady Bunch is good.

2671
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:23,020
Rip Taylor is cute.

2672
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:26,920
He's very the hair is very natural.

2673
01:37:27,220 --> 01:37:27,480
Taylor, cute.

2674
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:27,780
Yes.

2675
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:31,500
He definitely immediately walked on screen and added a hundred percent

2676
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:33,100
more life to the Saints.

2677
01:37:33,260 --> 01:37:36,720
Yeah, I forgot the one detail that that everybody liked him on set.

2678
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:39,120
But some of the crew didn't like him because he would throw confetti

2679
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:40,640
and it would get in the pool.

2680
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:45,660
Well, God forbid, the pool has got to be kept in tip top shape.

2681
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:48,320
You know, it's just a massive death hazard.

2682
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,280
That gets in the filter.

2683
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:50,600
Yeah.

2684
01:37:50,660 --> 01:37:51,840
And they can't clean it for weeks.

2685
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:54,720
Rip Taylor just keeps saying in the book that he was scared the pool was going

2686
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:55,640
to explode.

2687
01:37:57,900 --> 01:38:00,180
I mean, I don't think he's wrong.

2688
01:38:00,460 --> 01:38:03,080
Every everything that could have happened on the show happened.

2689
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:08,860
Every type of problem, injuries and sexual tris and drugs like,

2690
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:09,600
boy, oh, boy.

2691
01:38:09,860 --> 01:38:12,300
But, you know, I did not mean to turn it on like that.

2692
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:12,580
Sorry.

2693
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,500
I was going to end the show with Kelsey Grammers,

2694
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:17,080
Crispin's Day speech.

2695
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:17,900
Oh, OK.

2696
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:18,120
OK.

2697
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:20,160
Well, we can point our microphones to this.

2698
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:25,280
I guess in the in the interim, Eve Anderson, you survived an in-person

2699
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:26,200
podcast, the ride.

2700
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:26,680
Array.

2701
01:38:26,780 --> 01:38:28,480
I'm so happy to be here.

2702
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:30,040
Thank you guys for having me.

2703
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:30,760
This was great.

2704
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:35,000
Because this was mixed with us watching the clips and the clips felt like

2705
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,840
it was that four minutes or 40.

2706
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:39,900
I don't know how long we've been going.

2707
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:42,400
I don't know if this is a short episode or the longest episode.

2708
01:38:42,860 --> 01:38:45,140
It's long, but it's not the long we've done longer.

2709
01:38:45,140 --> 01:38:46,040
OK, OK, sure.

2710
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:49,720
But it's the sort of madness that can only come from in person.

2711
01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:51,220
And I'm glad we're back.

2712
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:55,600
Madness befitting, I guess, the most maddening production of a television

2713
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:56,840
series ever.

2714
01:38:58,120 --> 01:38:58,980
It was a blast.

2715
01:38:59,620 --> 01:39:01,740
Exited the gift shop and plug.

2716
01:39:01,940 --> 01:39:03,400
No, I just check in.

2717
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:04,660
I was doing the courtesy.

2718
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:09,160
Mike, is Kelsey Grammer have anything to plug?

2719
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:11,480
Well, I think he just just.

2720
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:15,080
Money plane is one of the one of those movies that you can find on

2721
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:16,220
any streaming service.

2722
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:20,000
Money plane starring WWE wrestler Edge and Kelsey Grammer.

2723
01:39:20,780 --> 01:39:23,820
But this, of course, is this deleted scene from X-Men 3.

2724
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:25,580
Bret Ratner's X-Men 3.

2725
01:39:25,580 --> 01:39:26,380
Oh, man.

2726
01:39:26,660 --> 01:39:26,860
OK.

2727
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:27,780
The greats.

2728
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:28,920
And I don't know why it was.

2729
01:39:28,940 --> 01:39:30,460
Nobody says I'm the whatever bitch.

2730
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:31,800
That's the movie.

2731
01:39:31,820 --> 01:39:32,740
Yeah, that's the same movie.

2732
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:33,420
OK, OK.

2733
01:39:33,580 --> 01:39:34,800
Should we point our microphones?

2734
01:39:35,140 --> 01:39:36,320
I'll put it in there.

2735
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:37,160
OK, OK.

2736
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:38,700
All of us.

2737
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:40,320
We few.

2738
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:42,940
We happy few.

2739
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:44,940
We band of brothers.

2740
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:49,080
For he who sheds his blood with me this day shall be my brother.

2741
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:53,960
Be he ne'er so vile, this day shall gentle his condition.

2742
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:57,160
And men in England now are bared.

2743
01:39:57,500 --> 01:39:59,380
We'll count their manhoods cheap.

2744
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:03,600
They were not here with us to fight on Christmas Day.

2745
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:08,240
We're in.
