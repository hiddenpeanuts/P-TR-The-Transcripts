00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
["The Cemetery Gate Theme"]

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Welcome, foolish mortals, to hauntcast the fright, The Cemetery Gate, where today a creature has escaped from Crypt 3.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It climbed over one paywall into another.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm Scottle Juice, who of course loves haunts now in the wake of Shacktoberfest, and joined by Frightful Narlson, who has long loved haunts.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Err, I love haunts.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That was actually supposed to be a monster, but it sounded like one of our topics.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh yes!

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I meant to be like, oh I'm gonna be like a monster, but it just sounded like the guy we're about to talk about.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Get ready, practice that tone.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah, yeah.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
As should jagged slash and drain.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Jagged slash and drain checking in.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Very excited for this one.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is a trick of the trick or treat season, you know?

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is a little trick.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Sure, yes.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Where we got to pull our little...

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's a trick, a little trick for the listeners, but a little treat for us.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's absolutely a treat for us.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Here's what happened if you were not on Crypt 3.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
There was a poll per usual, a number of topics that came from you, the listeners.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
There was one that we were especially excited about and rooting for, and that is not what went in the poll.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So we immediately moved it over.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And let's just say it, a little bit more business to go over, but the topic is Harrison Ford and Calista Flockhart's Halloween costumes.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This is catnip for us.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I don't know if this is hyperbole, but I texted you guys right away,

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hey, you know, we're still digging into the suggestions and everything, but I think we got one of the best Club 3 suggestions ever.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh, yeah.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And then we throw it out into the wild and it comes in fourth.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It just dies on the vine.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So we had to take matters into our own hands.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Another thing that happened is that via the comments, I saw people going, I sense a little Mike mischief.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I feel like Mike is, and because we've kind of established that if you're doing, if you're on the next tier of our Patreon,

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
we encourage you to do it.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We have some fun over there, but we'll throw out the poll.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Here's the topics for the month.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And often there will be kind of a long chaotic title, which usually involves several celebrities being mentioned.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
There's there's it's kind of a mealy.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
There's a whole like premise.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You got to get your head around.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So I think people thought it was you for that reason.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Right.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's usually like, oh, it's the clip from the 1975 when Andy Griffith rode on a Tilt-A-Whirl at the special that was on ABC.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And the special was called like Tilt-A-Whirls.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It was a 1974 made for TV movie about the Flash.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And the Flash was played by Mickey Rooney.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And that's that.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And that whole sentence, I said that will be in the poll.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah. We have to post it like that.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Right. Right.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Which will be next to just like, you know, a ladder like the teacups.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Right. Right.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
For. But but in this case, in correct, this was, I think, mass agreement on all of our parts.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah. It doesn't matter who wants to say it.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We all want to say it. Right.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We're all excited.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And then there was a second stage of the texting when we were each choosing our individual because it's it's the most votes.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's the incumbent. And then whatever gets the most hearts within reason.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah. And then we all pick one.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And then we each pick one from the runners up.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And I ironically was standing in the Grand Californian Hotel lobby and remembered texting like, are you picking this?

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Well, not necessarily. Are you are you going to pick?

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Well, I want to see. Somebody had to put their neck out.

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You did it. Ultimately, you grabbed the breast ring.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah. And and Mike picked one that that didn't win the rare the Disney haunts they did at Hong Kong Disneyland would seem fascinating.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'd like to get to that one.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah. It looks great. I know I wanted to pick a winner this time.

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I wanted to feel the victory, but it didn't happen.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So now I'm going to go far the other way. I'm not going to do that ever again.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm not going to try to pick a winner like that. I'm going to pick what my heart says.

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Be yourself. One of them is going to resonate. Absolutely.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Now, it's funny. You say ironically, I was in the Grand Californian as if to say, like, ironically, we were dealing with theme park business.

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And here I was in a theme park environment.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But of course, in a way, there's nothing ironic about it because this has nothing to do with theme parks.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Oh, yeah. That's what it does have to do with the season.

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It has to do with theming.

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So apologies to the seven militant listeners who haven't realized that we don't always do episodes about theme parks.

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm sorry. If this is what it takes for you to figure it out, I've got news for you for the last four years.

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Harrison. Harrison. We frequently.

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's not even about theme parks.

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The Harrison voice is definitely. It's called Podcast the Ride, not Podcast the Costume.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
They're not doing theme parks again.

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We're not. Well, how about this photo before we get into the meat of it?

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Of Cindy Crawford and her husband, Randy Gerber, dressed as Sharon Gregg Allman in 2014.

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's a good. That's like a good duo costume.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah, Jane found this one and sent it to me immediately.

87
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
They were famously married to Gregg Allman. Of course, we all know.

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
We all remember. But and that's supposed to help the cause that there's more Randy Gerber.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I will say this. George and Randy were at the Sphere the other day as well together.

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah. Seeing you to Randy's favorite band.

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Not when you were there. Not when I was there. No.

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But Randy Gerber's favorite band is you two. Tell me more.

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This guy's so interesting. Believe it or not.

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You never hear that. His favorite songs probably with or without you.

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Can you believe that? Whoa, whoa. God, this guy's deep.

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah. Do they do they share a one hundred dollar parking space if they can stack their two motorcycles?

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Depends on how much cargo they got out of those cycles.

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
They drove their motorcycles from the agave fields. Right to the Sphere.

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh, yeah. They were they were picking the they drove the points out of the tire.

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
They drove their motorcycle on the Sphere. They parked it at the top of the Sphere.

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah, they drove it up.

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Only only JD's JD's VIP's get to park at the tippy top.

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's right. OK. Credit to the suggestor of this.

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Matthew Comiggy's sorry if I butchered your last name.

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Club 3 suggestion for October.

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You go over all of the Harrison Ford Calista Flockhart Halloween pair costumes over the years, perhaps rate them very well.

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
At first, I thought it might be too slim a topic, but a quick Google search was a deluge of images.

108
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yeah. First of all, you say too slim a topic.

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That is that is the PTR bad signal. Yeah.

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Suddenly we are sprinting to the top. Yeah.

111
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So thank you, Matthew. Absolutely.

112
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Much praise from us. And now let's let's fully dive in.

113
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yes, we've known about these for a while. Surely we've referenced them over the years.

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I feel like this is like it's not the most current because as we I'm sure you all looked into it,

115
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
there is not like too recent of an iteration of this.

116
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Perhaps the covid era slowed down their Halloween socializing as it did for many people.

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So we're dying for a new one of these.

118
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But I feel like this was an Internet fascination a number of years ago because there was a there was a run there.

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
They had a run early 2010s where that was this couple.

120
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This great Hollywood couple is killing the Halloween costume game.

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah, for sure. I feel like I'm trying to other famous couples like a lot of couples do it.

122
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But it's so something so funny, I guess, about Harrison himself doing the costume.

123
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So I feel like that's why it's extra extra notable.

124
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes, because there's something extra funny about grumpy old Harrison Ford dressing silly.

125
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I think yes, I knew that some of this would be the psychology of why this is funny and why it is so joyful.

126
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And I think, yeah, absolutely. He's just he's such a curmudgeon.

127
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
His I love his talk show appearances very much.

128
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And frankly, I wish more people just fully put themselves in the way that they are out there.

129
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah, the way that he does.

130
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
They're just willing to be such an over it grump because he's so funny.

131
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
But he is silly on the talk show appearances, too. He is like a mix of grumpy and silly.

132
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah. Yeah.

133
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:24,000
There is a costumed appearance where he's on Jimmy Kimmel Live right before Force Awakens comes out.

134
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And Jimmy Kimmel is dressed as Princess Leia and Harrison Ford is dressed as a hot dog.

135
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
A hot dog costume with a dog snout.

136
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
With a little snout. Yeah.

137
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And it's great. It's great to see him in the spirit.

138
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And it's there's just there's a there's a mismatch going on.

139
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I feel like where it's it's like exclusively the silliest costumes.

140
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
None of these are cool. There's a there's a cool isn't it?

141
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And maybe no Halloween costume is truly cool. Right.

142
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But these aren't even in the ballpark. These are completely like look how silly grandpa looks.

143
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

144
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It is like it's basically like oh look at the dog is wearing a Halloween costume.

145
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He doesn't like it. Now I think he does like it.

146
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But that's the perception at least. Yes. Yeah.

147
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I sense a little smile in some of these.

148
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
We're gathering all our information from paparazzi photos except for when he when he did it on television.

149
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But I think another thing I mean there's there's the grandpa nature and how we'd all love to see our grandpa.

150
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I have a very like lovably curmudgeon father-in-law and who his persona reminds me sometimes of of Harrison Ford.

151
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Like that's the other grout. But that's how he is.

152
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And he's happy to you know that's that's the role he plays.

153
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Right. I don't think he'd be caught dead in a costume.

154
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I think curmudgeon makes you think maybe the costumes are not in the picture.

155
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So it's such a delight to see him going for it.

156
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Being so silly. And then another thing besides just the type when you remove his celebrity

157
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:10,000
and his history then when you put that that in who he is and what we know him for when is Harrison Ford ever looked silly in anything in one of his movies.

158
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
This doesn't happen. Good question. He only looks dashing and cool.

159
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Can you think of any of the origin of a of looking goofy. That's a good point.

160
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
He's in Anchorman 2 for one scene but he doesn't look silly.

161
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
No he's an old news man. Yeah. But he doesn't look silly.

162
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
He doesn't look silly. He transforms into a werewolf or something but that's not really he that it's just a different face by that.

163
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Right. He's got a cool cowboy hat and American graffiti. He's kind of a jerk in that but that's not uncool.

164
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
He's got a he's wearing a cool hat and what's the Indiana Jones.

165
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Oh yeah. A number of those movies. Oh yeah. He wore this cool hat.

166
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:01,000
He he's playing it pretty straight. I've only ever seen bits and pieces of this movie.

167
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's like the Today Show kind of it's like oh yeah.

168
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
This is like a hallucination this movie at this point. What is this movie called.

169
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Is it called Morning Glory or is that a different movie.

170
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
That might be right. It's him and Rachel McAdams.

171
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But he doesn't look silly. He's a news man right. He's not wearing anything silly.

172
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
No I don't think so. Unless there's one part.

173
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Is the movie called Morning Glory. That's what I want to know.

174
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh there's a very weird part in it where the Ty Burrell character like activates a button on his desk that closes the door.

175
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And this is a few years before that came out. Oh wow really. Is the way really. About Lauer. Yeah.

176
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
There's a button. Is it for that purpose or does it. Whoa whoa. I thought you were making a joke.

177
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Whoa really. That's true. I. So this is just like an inside secret about the button.

178
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I feel like it is. Now this is probably the movie I've fallen asleep watching.

179
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Morning Glory is the name of the movie by the way. I was correct.

180
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I have never seen it all the way through because I kept dozing it off.

181
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Because it's not particularly compelling. You don't say.

182
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But he doesn't look silly in that movie. He looks handsome and smart I assume.

183
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Maybe he's a bit of a blowhard but that's. But yeah. Unless he at some point wore a silly costume as Matt Lauer did.

184
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Matt Lauer is one of the only other celebrities I associate with silly costumes.

185
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And I'm right. He's not the only one now because I don't want to think about those.

186
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Right. He's as disgraced as Paul McVee. Ty Burrell's character that I've just learned about.

187
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But there is a button. Jesus. That's one of the inside.

188
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
There's a thing where his door closes really slowly and he's like leering.

189
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
When it was inside like people knew about it for years. It was a little. Yeah.

190
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
That happens with everything. Anytime you hear something bad you go a bunch of people knew about this for 25 years.

191
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And it makes its way into things. And then the thing can go public and everybody can pretend they didn't know.

192
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Or say I do actually. It doesn't seem right to say. Yeah. I didn't want to say.

193
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:12,000
They said I should have known. I should have known. I should have. Everybody like the classy thing to do is to write a song about it.

194
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yes. I've had Joel in his ignoring a lot of his other pals. He's like get ready to song about all of them.

195
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Yeah. Not enough notes on the scale. I had this idea for a theme album.

196
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's entirely songs about my disgraced friends. I did that because I got 20. I could do a double album.

197
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Anyways. No I don't know. Well that's a question listener. Go into the movies or television. I don't know what's going on on Shrinking.

198
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't know if this man is looking silly anywhere that I'm forgetting. But even like does he know he'll wear a disguise in the Indiana Jones movies.

199
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
That's true. Like what does he does he like dresses a Nazi at some point and maybe last crusade.

200
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yeah. He steals a uniform. Yeah. But he doesn't look. It's not silly.

201
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You know what never happens is that there's never a part where Indiana Jones has to like who's Kate Capshaw's character.

202
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:14,000
He doesn't have to like. Well I got to pretend to be like a showgirl with. I got to be in the show.

203
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Or try to dance or something. Yeah. Silly. He never ends up looking like Carmen Miranda or anything. Right. Right.

204
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Which could have been. And again I also I never saw a Dial of Destiny so I don't know.

205
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I hope and pray that there's an extended Carmen Miranda. I hope so too. That would be great.

206
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
He is funny and he would be funny dressing silly in movies. Sure. But he's got. A lot of funny snake bits.

207
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
When he gets. When he gets scared of snakes. Oh. Like those are often played for laughs. Yeah that's true.

208
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Well but being funny is different than looking. I'm talking pure. Oh foolish.

209
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:53,000
He never. You know what doesn't happen is him dressing like a big snake to make the snakes think that he is their queen.

210
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yeah. Like and to leave him alone. Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm your queen. Brass brass.

211
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And then like one of the snakes falls. One of the snakes falls in love with him. No no I can't.

212
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:15,000
OK just one little kiss. OK. And the kid bites him. That feels good. And then like the snake priest comes up.

213
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm in love. The snake bit me with its love venom. Snake priest comes up with a little collar.

214
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm going to stay here. Snake priest. That's just the pattern on the scales. It just looks like a collar.

215
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Man and wife. I do. I do. I do. I rattle rattle.

216
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
That would have made Dial of Destiny a much better movie. I haven't seen it either.

217
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's his translation. You may kiss the bride. Then they do and then like ahhh. He clamps onto his tongue. Get it off short round.

218
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Now that's a punch up. That's a punch up session. Oh yes. I love it. If they could add that in post. In post. Yeah yeah.

219
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
In post two years after the movie is done. How mad were they you think?

220
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:14,000
As the incredible rise of short round and the Oscar season and that they're like shit why didn't we put them in there?

221
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yeah. As it comes out and kind of disappoints. Yes.

222
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Because everybody was saying that online and I feel like they didn't anticipate that as being maybe a fun thing.

223
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:34,000
In a movie industry that's entirely like fan service and cameo they missed the one that would have been like just molten lava.

224
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Just sitting there. Is that a good thing molten lava? I don't know. It would have made the movie as hot as lava.

225
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Well there's always another one maybe. Yeah I know. Maybe they have to to redeem it. They said last but they didn't know this was going to go bad.

226
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:59,000
So there's that. He doesn't like seeing him dress silly is great. I mean I can talk a little. I think we can bring Calista into it a little bit.

227
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Sure. But should we also just like you want to just like pick one and start. Yeah. Just so we don't go too far without talking about it. I agree.

228
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Throw a dart. Pick whatever one. I don't think we have to go in order. I think I know roughly what years a lot of these were. Okay good yeah.

229
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But I don't know if that matters for the context. Like now you remember Obama was in office. So this maybe put them in this kind of thing.

230
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Well Jason will say how many years from 9-11 the photo was. Yeah yeah yeah. You reverse. You do the math from 9-11.

231
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Like maybe they had just shaken it off. Spirits were high. It had been eight years by this point.

232
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Married by New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson. That is fascinating. That is yeah. I saw that.

233
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:54,000
He was a candidate against Obama and Hillary in 2008. Yeah right. Didn't work out. But he did get to in New Mexico while he was filming Cowboys and Aliens.

234
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:04,000
He got to perform this crucial wedding ceremony of a great couple. They've been together for so long. They have.

235
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And I think some of the fun of the costumes also is like oh that's right they're together. Yes. You kind of forget.

236
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I forgot for sure until a couple years ago. I was like oh probably they're not together anymore. No they are.

237
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And they usually seem happy in photos together. They do. They seem like they're having a nice time.

238
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I think it's going great. I think they're in love. I think as grumpy as he is. It's because maybe the grumpiness is because he has to go do press tours and be with a lot of people that aren't his wife.

239
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,000
That's true yeah. He's a wife guy. He's a wife. Wait hang on. Let's not throw that out. What? What?

240
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:49,000
That's maybe a somewhat of a tainted phrase. Okay fine. Host Try Guy. He ruined being a wife guy for everybody.

241
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:59,000
No no. You just edited yourself from a Try Guy gate. I'm not going to say it. People are waiting. How long ago was that? Has that been a year?

242
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
God I think it has yeah. Wow. Oh boy time flies. We're at the one year anniversary of Try Gate. Yeah.

243
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:15,000
So anyways. But here as I said we can pick off more about them but somebody just name a costume. What's one that you... The P. The big P's. The big P's.

244
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Calista was like a hippie in this and then Harrison was... Harrison had a big like a green like a pea costume. What do you call it? A pea pod. He's a big pod.

245
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:38,000
He's a big pod. This one is a solid candidate for favorite. Yeah this is because he's got a painted green face. A big big like cumbersome ish costume of like peas around him.

246
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And yeah he's got sunglasses on and a baseball hat on. He looks like he's maybe unhappy with all of this on. And this is one of the perfect examples of dog wearing a costume that the dog is not enjoying wearing.

247
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And I don't know that he's not. Your feet could shake his way out of it. It looks like that. That's what it seems from an outside observer.

248
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I would... I like anything. I like if he's happy. I like if he's unhappy. I like any range here. I love that he has painted his face green to match. Yes. And put on a hat and I feel like green sunglasses.

249
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:30,000
We had a lot of shades of green going. Kind of a good 70 something guy sweater and then just like rubber gloves. Just like kitchen gloves. This one epitomizes it I think because it's so homemade, homespun.

250
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:48,000
They are not... I think this is another aspect that I love is that they don't feel curated. It doesn't feel like... And then we got our stylist to make us some fantastic elevated cut. This feels like he went to Target and grabbed whatever and put it on.

251
00:21:48,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Heidi Klum very famously goes and has some elaborate... She dresses like... I don't know if this is right but like Mystique. The Jennifer Lawrence Mystique where she's sort of nude. But obviously this is a major undertaking to body paint and do all this thing.

252
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:17,000
She fully with makeup and contouring turned into Ned Fulmer the wife guide try guy. People thought it was him. People thought it was Ned. You're in public but you're disgraced. Oh wait it's Heidi Klum.

253
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:31,000
A lot of people have been going though as sexy Ned for Halloween from the try guys. That's true. It's a controversial costume given what he got into. Maybe it's kids getting embraced. It's creative though.

254
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:46,000
So yeah this is... And then I like that... I think I would like if the costumes were a pair. I like if they go together. But in this case a peep pod and a hippie. Love it. Love that they don't have anything to do with each other.

255
00:22:46,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Yeah I like when they do contrasting costumes. They each get to shine. Yeah they each get to shine. The peep pod... I got a couple pictures of it. It is missing one of my favorite features which is often he's got a bottle of wine or two or bottle in a solo cup.

256
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And that is not present in this one. Yes. Well this is a daytime. That might be why. There's some children present. I don't know the timeline. I don't know if this is their... I think they have an adopted son together. Maybe it's a friend. I don't know.

257
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:39,000
But that might explain the... Although of course I would love if he was just fully swigging from a full bottle of wine on the street at 5pm. Well I think when he's got a couple they're going to a party. Yes I would imagine. Like they're going somewhere.

258
00:23:39,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But this is just pure trick or treat. And he's in the spirit. And I mean do these... I guess in a way these fit together because maybe a hippie would be into healthy living. I mean I think eating well. Sure. Yeah. You would hope that's the case. But maybe I mean... Abstractly they fit together. I think maybe that's already more thought than they put into it. I could be wrong. But it's possible.

259
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It's cute. They're having a lot of fun. And then... Oh yes. Can we just say hippie is funny because I feel like that's like I've seen that costume growing up a lot. Even though like what is our generation have anything to do with hippies?

260
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Yeah I don't know. I remember thinking hippie. I may have dressed as a hippie on some like... I'm sure. Every history day or something. Beads or something. But hippies were so around. Well there was a big revival in the 90s. I guess that's what it was. Of like the smiley faces and the bottoms and tie dye. Woodstock was back. I guess that is part of it. Woodstock was back.

261
00:24:42,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So it was sort of like the reinvention of the hippie. And then kids were dressing like hippies. I bet most of our listeners know of a kid who dressed like a hippie or they themselves dressed as a hippie. But why? Why? I don't know. I don't mind it becoming like a cartoon of what it was. Especially because so much genuine hippie stuff is like extremely trying. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Full on like yeah man. We're not... We're cool.

262
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Well like the movies. You know some of the movies of that. Like there's a lot of movies that don't escape the hippie era that aren't like actually interesting to watch. You had to be there I think. And Reese I think I... Was this on the best show? It was occurring to me that like the Woodstock lineup. There's a lot of crap in the Woodstock lineup. I'm not throwing the whole thing. There's incredible music there and great music in that movie. But so then you're looking at like the ones that aren't in the movie. And like what's this one though?

263
00:25:38,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Well it was a few days right? I guess they had to pad out the schedule. But there were people when I was looking at the lineup there were people who weren't even supposed to be on the... They were just there attending. And it was maybe like John Sebastian and then like shit the bands are late get up there. So some of the better acts were just like fuck stall. Like they didn't even plan on having some of the better bands there. So I was like can you give them points? I guess you gotta give them points for like improvising like that.

264
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Yeah. I have a guitar John. But anyway great. And then I just like to imagine the struggle like as this night went on. Out of these bobbing peas.

265
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Calista. There's a... I can't... There is no fly in this thing. There's just a bobbing pea.

266
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I gotta go to the bathroom. I need assistance though. Do I need to take the whole thing off? Do we rip the pea off? What's the protocol? Give me a jug. Give me an empty jug. No Harrison you can't do that. This isn't like your old carpentry days. You just go in the car and you would pee in the middle of a construction site. That's not how this works.

267
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:10,000
We're at a famous producer, Brian Grazer's house. You can't piss in a jug at Brian Grazer. Where does Grazer keep his jugs? Brian I need a jug. You gotta jug a juice. You gotta jug room.

268
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Don't drink out of this jug later. Remove it from the jug room. He's got an authenticity because he was a blue collar guy working with his hands. He didn't make it till later in life. We've all heard the lore. He was a carpenter for people. He sold weed to people. That was what he was doing. So yeah he would piss in a jug.

269
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:46,000
He worked with yes. That's what I'm saying. I'm just justifying the joke. He doesn't need it. Not like us sus elites with our fancy porcelain that we recall. This is a guy. This was a dude who was out there. He didn't have anything delivered to him on a silver platter.

270
00:27:46,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I'm not a dealer you gotta hang out with for a while. I'm in and out. I don't even want to use the bathroom. I got the jug. I got the jug. I got the jug. That's all I need is a jug. I don't need chit chat. I just need jugs.

271
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Yeah so there was a hole to do with a big costume like that. It was probably a discussion. Logistics surely became an issue. They're bouncing back and forth as I walk. I'm going to be bruised on my chest. Throwing my balance off. There's no gravity to these things Kalista. Can we tape them down? What if I cut them off? I'll just cut the peas off.

272
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Nobody will be able to tell what you are. You need the peas. I don't know how to be her. You'll look like an unripe banana Harrison if you cut the peas off. That's a viable costume. That's fine. That's pretty good. A rotten banana. We've improvised. Costume change in the middle of the night. That's okay. People will be impressed. More than one. Brian Grazer will be knocked on his ass when he sees my new costume.

273
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And then later Brian Grazer. Wait what are you supposed to be? I'm an unripe banana. Obviously motherfucker. He punches him. Get off my plane. Get off your house. Get off your porch. Leave the bottles and let's go. Great. Fun.

274
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Now the relationship, the two, that's also a nice thing. It's a Hollywood relationship that's gone for a long time. They seem to have met at the 2002 Golden Globes and this is the magic of the Golden Globes in action.

275
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Where movie and TV people get to meet and mix it up and merge and maybe form a forever bond. Unlike those Oscars that callously silo the performing arts. Only the Golden Globes and People's Choice allow movie and TV people to meet and mingle.

276
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Yeah. Ali McBeal gets together with Han Solo. I don't know why he was there. Star of Witness. Jack Ryan you could also say. He was a Jack Ryan. That's right. And Jack Ryan also. He didn't have to dress up like a statue. He pretended to be a gargoyle to sneak off a building or something. No silly costumes.

277
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Jack Ryan. He goes over to Ben Affleck, the then current Jack Ryan. I was like can you give me some advice? Do you know what Ali McBeal is? Oh you would ask Ben Affleck because she's a younger Jack Ryan?

278
00:30:38,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Do you know about? They say it's on something called VDDs. How do I get my hands on one of those? DVDs? Sure. Probably. Do you think there will be a Spider-Verse Jack Ryan movie with Chris Inskey, Ben Affleck and Harrison? With the pointing? They're all pointing at each other?

279
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:20,000
It's like Attorneys General. Not Jack Ryan's. No. Jack Ryan. Don't mispluralize it all the time. I'm always correcting people. It's Jack Ryan. Enter the Jack Ryan verse so they all get together. The sum of all Ryan's. The sum of all Ryan's.

280
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:37,000
What do we do Jack 3? Well I think that's my impression of Chris Inskey post 2019. I'm not sure. There's lots of way here. That's good. Yeah. That's a debut on the show of Chris Inskey.

281
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Didn't know what. This is how I've always talked. I just wanted to shine a light on some good news. Hell of a Reed Richards voice. Watch the Office. I sounded like this then. What does that actually sound like? What am I actually doing? When I do Roy Zinski, what does that sound like?

282
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Yeah. I don't know. It did sound like something. Will Ferrell's Janet Reno? Yeah. Welcome to John Krasinski's dance party. I really like dancing to that song. To dance to it again. Play it again. I'd love to do an Office reunion. I just did Office Ladies the other day. I had a blast.

283
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Okay so here's another fun fact. Their first date apparently, James Marsden was a third wheel. Really? Came along with them on their first date. That's interesting. Maybe also some attempts to. No I think that came through her. Maybe he was on Ally McBeal or something. That's a good question. Where is that connection? Which one of them? I don't know. I'm not sure. Who knows. Who knows where these people meet? Probably at Brian Grazer's house. Probably all at Brian Grazer's house. How many times do you think that this couple will be together?

284
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I think that this couple was in the presence of Jimmy Buffett. They must have been at the same party. God all the time. Many many. Yeah constantly. Constantly. They probably didn't even talk to each other because they had just like, well you need to socialize with people you don't always see. Yeah for sure. Jimmy thank God you're here. It's always good to see. I hate these things. Nice to see a friendly face. A real man. Somebody I can actually talk to. Yeah. Especially because Jimmy and Frank were best friends. And there was that whole, there was that video.

285
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:38,840
That's right from the Indiana Jones. Was that a, was that shown on tour? Where Indiana Jones actually played by Harrison Ford interacts with Jimmy Buffett. Harrison Ford shot footage for Jimmy Buffett's tour from around the time. Which is.

286
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:44,840
Yeah he's like outside of the five movies. He shot something for Young Indiana Jones Adventure.

287
00:33:45,680 --> 00:34:12,680
And he shot something for the Jimmy Buffett tour. I'm sure there's a few things we're missing but that's pretty limited. Think about what they had to do to get him to come back as Han Solo. Like what was that? How easy did they have to make it? Here's the amount of money. We will kill you. This will not be a whole movie for you. That's a good transition for what I have to say next. So much had to be offered to him to get him to come. And then like hey could you come do Jimmy Buffett. Yes. Yes. For Jimmy anything.

288
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,520
No that's not even work. You know he loves Jimmy Buffett. I wouldn't be shocked. We said because Biden tweeted about Jimmy Buffett dying and I was like it's not hard to believe that like that would be Biden's favorite musician of all time. And it's not hard to believe it would be Harrison's either. Yeah. I'm not saying it is. I'm just saying would you go yeah that makes sense. The main mode that I picture Biden in is sorrow you know because he's had his personal difficulties and he's overseeing a very tough time. Yeah.

289
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:57,760
President various. So I feel like my main image of Biden and he's also and he's old and tired. So I mean image of Biden is like solemnly closing his eyes and just kind of like just feeling just feeling. And I imagine him doing that. Like on that day do you think he listened to

290
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:11,940
Cheeseburger in Paradise. Just close. He could have picked a sadder Jimmy Buffett song but I'd like to think that he was trying to. I don't think he knows them though. I genuinely think a lot of people who are very mournful of his death do not know any songs past the three.

291
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:19,920
Do you think they don't know a pirate looks authority or son of a son of a sailor. Possibly sailor. Maybe. Well I guess that one. Those are sort of famous ish for the crowd.

292
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:33,880
Seems like a song from carrying me from that seems like a song from the time before he was like a cartoon character. Yeah those are like more legitimately kind of a singer song writer. He was like he wasn't wearing lays and flip flops all the time.

293
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:42,240
That was before like the 90s sort of cemented him as the restaurateur and like exactly what his brand was. Yes for sure.

294
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:50,160
Like a Gordon Lightfoot. Gordon Lightfoot then did not go on to open a chain of casual restaurants. Lightfoots. Lightfoots.

295
00:35:53,720 --> 00:36:00,160
You know it's real light food. Sundown cafes. Is that a song. Yeah that's right.

296
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:11,000
I apologize if I'm wrong. Yes it is. No that's it. Yeah. It's yeah. So all that stuff pre sort of more cartoonish Jimmy Buffett.

297
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,800
But this happened you know this happens to a lot of people where like you hear a new Rolling Stones song and you go yeah that's that's them.

298
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:26,480
Something's off though like it doesn't in the context of 2023. Yeah. It also sounds weird because like some of his old songs have a bunch of food in them.

299
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:35,520
But like it sounds better. Sure. It sounds more. The production is more. It sounds more yeah. We talked about it when I talked about Olivia Rodrigo's Guts.

300
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:44,160
We talked about how. Have you finished the album now? My. My. Oh you've had this for so many weeks. I know I forgot. I forgot I'm sorry.

301
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:50,720
Oh the list is piling up. Yellowstone. Oh shit. Rodrigo Guts. Made it to the new vocal album though.

302
00:36:51,520 --> 00:37:01,520
So that jumps. I thought you were cool. My shit. You're telling me you finished the vocal album. Oh I'm old. No I just revealed it. I'm too old. I'm an old man.

303
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:08,800
If vocal takes priority that's the sign. Although I'm listening to this K-pop group 50 50. There's a song I really like by 50 50.

304
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:18,960
Oh I don't know 50 50. Look them up. 50 50. I think everyone here would enjoy 50 50. OK. OK. This song specifically. To be clear because they're cool and you're cool.

305
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:25,280
Oh well yeah for sure I'm cool and they're cool but yeah it's just a good pop song that I really like from them.

306
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:36,080
Let's do a different. Unless you had somewhere. Oh yeah. Transition wise you say Force Awakens. So my question was Harrison Ford had his leg crushed on the set of Force Awakens.

307
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:44,880
That's what happened. It wasn't just like he didn't just hurt him so his leg was crushed. His leg was. By the door. The door of the Millennium Falcon fell on Harrison Ford's leg breaking it.

308
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:56,880
I didn't know this was a crush. Crushed. My God. JJ Abrams rushed over. This is the story he tells to try to help and pull it up. It was too heavy. JJ broke his back doing it.

309
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:05,760
What. Yes. Wait. He revealed this later years later that he because he didn't want to like he said he didn't want to like steal focus or something. Sure.

310
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:15,360
He needed to wear a back brace the rest of Force Awakens because he had broke like a vertebrae trying to lift the impossibly heavy Millennium Falcon like I think it was the I don't know for sure.

311
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:26,720
I think it was the door like the thing that comes down and you walk up the ramp on it. Let me say this. There's a lot of people and all this theme park stuff is about living your Star Wars story.

312
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:35,200
Yeah. But only JJ Abrams got to rescue Han Solo. Well try to rescue. For real. Yeah. Or try his attempt. That's true.

313
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,040
It's just dawning on me now that it's like OK. One of your stars gets her leg broken.

314
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:50,320
There the director breaks some part of their back a vertebrae or something that feels like oh this production is cursed.

315
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:58,640
Yeah. Well like remember he got hurt on Dial of Destiny 2. He had to delay it. Yeah. Yeah. Like delay it months as well.

316
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:07,840
I shouldn't say I don't know if it was. Now that I'm saying that I don't know if it was the door or the ramp that comes down or if it was just a door on the actual ship. I'm not sure.

317
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:21,680
I always picture it as the ramp. But I think it was during Chewie were home like they were about to and everybody's like people's hearts are well like people are tearing up because this is the moment and it's them and they're gonna and then all right.

318
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,120
Take one action.

319
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,160
Chewie.

320
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,760
My leg my seventy five year old leg is snapped in half.

321
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,080
I mean there's footage of it somewhere that is not character.

322
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:43,040
Mayhew still alive still in the suit at that point. Peter maybe trying to help. Peter is not in good shape at that point.

323
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,840
I can't imagine. And then and it's just limited visibility. Yeah. It could only be JJ.

324
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:57,440
I think for sure Millennium Falcons I don't think it was on that like he remembers on the ship he's hauling Raptors or whatever they call it. Remember Rathars. Rath Tars I think.

325
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:05,520
You know what I'm talking about Force Awakens. There's like the big things on the ship and like some of the parts of it maybe have disappeared from my brain.

326
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,000
Yeah.

327
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:13,200
So I was wondering OK what costume was he wearing when he was recovering from this injury in 2014.

328
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,720
You're putting the timeline next to.

329
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,240
Because it took months.

330
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:16,800
Very good.

331
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:23,600
So here is the costume in 2014. He and Kalista are dressed as like 80s rockers.

332
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,320
Hair metal.

333
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,120
Hair metal.

334
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,160
Rockers.

335
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:32,160
See this is a good this might be up there with best matching couples costume.

336
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:41,360
It's a good one. Yeah this is now this is one where they are together they are both in the same mode even their pants match. It's zebra stripe leather for both of them.

337
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:48,720
He's in a big red trench coat and like let all the half glove the fingerless gloves and she's got a lot of jewelry on.

338
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,200
Yes I think.

339
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,280
She's got a big smile he's got a little smirk. They seem like they're having a good time.

340
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,680
They are both definitely having fun here.

341
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:01,920
Yes I think he's on the end of the recovery he might have even been back to work at this point because in July he was still like this.

342
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,360
Oh.

343
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,360
Oh wow he's got a big mechanism there.

344
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:05,760
Yeah.

345
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,360
You actually put this on the real time so in July he's having a tough time down some stairs.

346
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:11,840
Yeah.

347
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:18,880
But by Halloween it's like to the doctors like this needs to get fixed.

348
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,600
I know you've got to get back to Star Wars.

349
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,600
I don't give a shit about Star Wars.

350
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:23,760
Yeah.

351
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,600
I'm not missing Halloween.

352
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,200
Halloween time is coming.

353
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,520
It looks like.

354
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,040
We picked up the glam costume. We're going to be motley crew.

355
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,400
It's called crew. You can't be crew alone.

356
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,520
So one person is in a crew.

357
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,720
He gives like a big like president speech like in Air Force One or something.

358
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:43,920
He's not.

359
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,640
Smashes his hand against the x-rays.

360
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,920
I don't accept this.

361
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,040
Fix me.

362
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,320
In August he is castless.

363
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,040
So it says he's still recovering at that point so maybe he was feeling pretty good by.

364
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:02,080
You're just Googling you're you on Getty images like Harrison Ford 2014.

365
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,760
He is very well documented from the paparazzi and the like tabloid press.

366
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,320
So you can get a kind of timeline of his recovery.

367
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,640
So that does help here.

368
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,880
I guess I really should have done it with Dial of Destiny 2 because he got hurt as well.

369
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,240
Well but then it doesn't result in a Halloween costume.

370
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:20,960
So who cares.

371
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,760
That's true. You're right.

372
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,480
It doesn't matter.

373
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,360
Real I think so.

374
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:27,520
I think the true best work of his career in the last two decades.

375
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,080
Yeah it's true.

376
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,440
Similarly I was looking at a timeline that was on People Magazine and that was helpful

377
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,320
for finding out things like James Marsden and Bill Richardson and yet the timeline included

378
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,160
no Halloween costumes.

379
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,920
What kind of rag is this People Magazine where they leave out the most important part of the

380
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,560
relationship.

381
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,320
I know that is very important.

382
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,760
Yearly Halloween costumes.

383
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,080
This is where this is who they actually are.

384
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,840
This is where their spirit lives.

385
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,160
Look how happy they are as glam rockers.

386
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,880
Let's name another one.

387
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,920
Okay let's stick with where they are in the same mode and I will bring up this one where

388
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,920
they are both nerds.

389
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,280
Yes the nerd costume.

390
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,880
I really like the nerds.

391
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:18,880
So yeah both just you know real classic giant glasses.

392
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,240
Horn rim.

393
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,760
I think this is one of her best.

394
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,280
She's you know it's taped up in the middle.

395
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,800
This is like the nerds that we knew from cartoons in the early 90s.

396
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,120
Yes and her glasses are like really big.

397
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,760
His is actually closer to normal.

398
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,880
I feel like those are just his glasses.

399
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,000
He's like I gotta wear my own glasses I can't fucking see.

400
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,640
You're doing a costume with glasses this time.

401
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,680
Who has glasses?

402
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,440
You watch movies?

403
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,040
Who's a glasses character?

404
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,720
He's not wearing any there's no tape on his glasses either.

405
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,200
No.

406
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,080
And she has tape.

407
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,560
I dare they were expensive.

408
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,000
These rims are important.

409
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,680
I'm not putting tape on them.

410
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,040
He's a nerd or no nerd.

411
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,880
These are a gift from Brian Grazer.

412
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,400
These frames.

413
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,520
He this one it has the things I like.

414
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,280
He's got a bottle of wine.

415
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,040
He's got an orange solo cup.

416
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,920
Couple of them he has an orange solo cup.

417
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,920
I wonder if it's the same pack.

418
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,800
Great we're partying.

419
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,800
I only just get it for Halloween.

420
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,000
Red solo cup.

421
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,640
Red solo cup.

422
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,240
Do you think he knows the song red solo cup by Toby Keith?

423
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:27,520
Maybe.

424
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,240
I think he does.

425
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,160
Because it's like a country fried song.

426
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,680
Yeah I think he likes it.

427
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,120
It's chill.

428
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,880
I like it too.

429
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,400
I like the red solo cup a lot.

430
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,280
I think you're saying he likes it because you like it.

431
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,200
I'd like to think he likes things I like.

432
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,560
Yeah I like him and I would like him to like things I like.

433
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,600
You know what holds up?

434
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,440
Third eye blind.

435
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,680
I jammed out to them every day on Air Force One.

436
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,520
Do you like his name tag that appears to say Timmy?

437
00:44:59,040 --> 00:44:59,760
Yeah I do.

438
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,480
I do like that.

439
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,520
We got a name here.

440
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:06,720
I actually I forgot I was going through like screenshots on my desktop.

441
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,840
I forgot that I pulled this from an article that just very very stiffly.

442
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,960
So one of these British tabloids is like who's Timmy?

443
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,960
The actor seemed in great spirits as he attended the party dressed up as an old man.

444
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,240
Apparently named Timmy.

445
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,880
I saw that too.

446
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,120
I saw a couple say they were old people.

447
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,640
But the wigs are very clearly brunette wigs.

448
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,960
They're not really white or anything.

449
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,120
You're right if anything this ages him down.

450
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:33,440
Yes.

451
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,640
Yeah he looks youthful.

452
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,400
He looks less gray than...

453
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,440
He looks like a youthful nerd.

454
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,440
He looks like a nerd of 53.

455
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,720
Every costume should be its own movie starring the two of them.

456
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,200
A thousand percent.

457
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:48,480
Every movie just no budget script doesn't even have to be very good but just use the same

458
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,040
costume and like they're two nerds and they're getting in the hijinks.

459
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,680
They have a May December romance going on but it works they seem happy.

460
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,640
Sure yeah.

461
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,840
He's a nerd.

462
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,680
Hello I'm here for the...

463
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,800
I'm here for the computer job.

464
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,400
My name is Timmy.

465
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,680
I've got my model planes in the car that I've constructed.

466
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,000
Here's my resume.

467
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,240
This just says E equals MC squared on it.

468
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,680
You Timmy are a nerd.

469
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,680
Oh this has dogged me my whole life.

470
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:22,720
Geez.

471
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,400
Oh jellikers.

472
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,600
But will Timmy ever find love?

473
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,920
Yes I'm here for the job as well.

474
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,840
Oh wow.

475
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,160
Slow mo dream weaver.

476
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,880
Yeah they like they they both drop their calculators at the same time.

477
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,320
They're trying oh is this yours?

478
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,360
No this is mine.

479
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:47,120
Oh excuse me uh my calculations were oh I lost what I had been computing.

480
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,640
Oh I forgot all the numbers what are you doing?

481
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,400
He works at the computer job she works at the book factory.

482
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,320
You like books?

483
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,760
Yes I guess you could say.

484
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,880
Yeah all of these.

485
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,880
Calculators like they both that all the numbers come loose and then they both have threes and

486
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,800
they put the they're like bumbling they lost their glasses too and then they bump and put

487
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,800
their threes together and oh yeah.

488
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,600
Oh wow this is a beautiful love story.

489
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:24,880
And then the finale they both dance with the dancing baby screen.

490
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,640
Oh the dancing baby is in this too.

491
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,760
Oh sure you expect to see from Ali McBeal.

492
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,480
From Ali McBeal.

493
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,920
To come along with with that.

494
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,960
Yes yeah sure.

495
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,680
That's they just put glasses on it and that's their baby.

496
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,440
Yeah sure same same cgi.

497
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,760
Two nerds and a little nerd.

498
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,760
This Thanksgiving.

499
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,920
Has Calista worked a lot lately?

500
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,280
She had a show on CBS it was a drama.

501
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,440
That's a while ago.

502
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,240
Is it a while ago?

503
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,160
That's when Rob Lowe I want to say.

504
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,040
There's an Ali McBeal reunion talks or new Ali McBeal talks.

505
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,920
Oh yes because we need to know more about what's going on at the firm.

506
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,240
Of course.

507
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,280
We've been wondering what's up at the firm and it really doesn't matter if they get all the

508
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,920
actors back I want to know the firm story.

509
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,560
That's right.

510
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:15,040
I think I was finishing middle school when like Ali McBeal was at its height

511
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:22,080
and I really I didn't watch it but I saw all the commercials and like I feel like a couple

512
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:26,640
people I thought were cool in school were they were like oh I know they're really in the Ali

513
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,560
McBeal must be a cool show.

514
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,320
I didn't know it's where this was.

515
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,200
It's a cool show for adults.

516
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,000
I thought maybe you were going to say I've watched every Ali McBeal.

517
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,560
No I've watched maybe one.

518
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,720
I could see you have been being an Ali McBeal kid.

519
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:43,600
I remember who's in it from Ghostbusters 2.

520
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,400
Peter McNigle.

521
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,440
Peter McNigle.

522
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,080
Yeah.

523
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:46,960
Jan Krakowski.

524
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,120
And then Donnie Jr. eventually.

525
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,240
And seemingly constant musicians.

526
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,280
Non-stop.

527
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,200
A lot of musicians performing on Ali McBeal.

528
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,880
And he sang on Ali McBeal as well.

529
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,240
Our DJ did.

530
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,200
I believe so.

531
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,480
I wonder what did he sing.

532
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,160
I don't know was it from the Futurist?

533
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,040
Was it from his album?

534
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:03,360
I'm not sure.

535
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,560
He was doing standards right like in the early 2000s.

536
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,240
That's why the lady is up.

537
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,440
Was he doing an album or you mean on the show?

538
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Well I think he had an album.

539
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
No the Futurist is an album but it is original songs that I've talked about before where it

540
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,720
says not an album I like but I appreciate that there's a lot of effort going on.

541
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,640
You may have noticed I didn't engage you on the Futurist.

542
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,600
I know you tried.

543
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,200
I know you tried to get me to go away.

544
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,240
Jason what do we got?

545
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,920
But Jason said stuff that felt like he didn't know what he was talking about.

546
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,080
I don't know.

547
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,760
So I had to guide him lay in.

548
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,880
I had to let him know.

549
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,600
I kind of remember him doing like Seth MacFarlane swing albums or something.

550
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,720
I don't think there's an album of that.

551
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,680
No no he doesn't have.

552
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,320
He just has the Futurist.

553
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,600
Is it just some appearances?

554
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:51,120
Maybe he sang a big band song somewhere but I don't that's not what he put out.

555
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,160
That's not what he released.

556
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:57,360
You should play the Futurist back to back with that Sinatra album.

557
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,000
He sang.

558
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,400
The concept album where he talks about the future.

559
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,880
He sang with Sting a couple years ago at I believe Sting's birthday party I think.

560
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,360
But he sang a police song.

561
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:11,600
And it caused a wave of sleepiness that echoed across the globe.

562
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,040
Every people who weren't even there had incredible night's sleep.

563
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,640
I want to like the police more than I do.

564
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,560
I like the police fine.

565
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,520
Solo Sting gets points.

566
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,520
Well no that's rough.

567
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,080
Yeah.

568
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:28,640
So Timmy gets points I feel due to being named.

569
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,840
There's a full character there.

570
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,640
An entire universe you can imagine.

571
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,880
But what else we got?

572
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,280
Here let's why don't we stay in.

573
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,440
Well no that might be the last one where they match.

574
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:46,320
What I'm looking at now is kind of a sequel to Nerd.

575
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:54,480
For her Calista is a seemingly a mad scientist with crazy teeth.

576
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:54,880
Oh yeah.

577
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:59,360
Who has perhaps been in some kind of accident in the lab.

578
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,960
That's how I read this costume.

579
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,680
Is that fair?

580
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,180
Yeah.

581
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,520
The potion blew up and her hair is messy.

582
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,000
Sure sure.

583
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,160
It's like that kind of nutty professor kind of thing.

584
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:10,720
Yeah.

585
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:17,120
Thought she had the cure for cancer but all but all she had was a tag on her face.

586
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,480
And as for him this is what what is he like.

587
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,520
He put on a Lakers jersey and sunglasses.

588
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,480
And like a chain.

589
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:27,360
Yeah.

590
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:30,320
So he's like he's a Lakers fan.

591
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,480
Who's the number what number is on the jersey actually?

592
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,320
24 I think it's Kobe.

593
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:38,960
Okay all right so he's either a fan hopefully he's not being Kobe.

594
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,040
I don't think so.

595
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,320
Well he has not done anything problematic to indicate this.

596
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,040
That's good.

597
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,160
So I don't know.

598
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,800
This one seems a little lazier on his part.

599
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,240
It definitely does yeah yeah yeah.

600
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,120
You know also he's wearing a hat and sunglasses so I don't think that's being Kobe.

601
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,240
Because Kobe couldn't wear those things to play.

602
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,760
He's just a basketball player.

603
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:00,880
Maybe.

604
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,960
So you know all right let's let's just say I don't think anybody's as excited about this one.

605
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,400
But it's fine it's fine.

606
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,720
There's no lasers in the bunch.

607
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,280
It's fine.

608
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:16,000
But you know I like to see her I like to see more range.

609
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,280
See what else she can do.

610
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:17,520
Yeah.

611
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,280
Because I think the other nerd was superior Mrs. Timmy.

612
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,640
Absolutely yeah.

613
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,480
So then let's let's see how we like.

614
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,920
Here's a good like nothing to do with each other.

615
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:33,120
We got none and I guess Miss Piggy.

616
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,520
I think this is not just a pig this is Miss Piggy.

617
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:44,800
I think because due to the the feather boa and a tutu and there's I think kind of a glam nature.

618
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,480
I'm going to say that's that's Miss Piggy.

619
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,800
And then none's up there for him.

620
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:57,760
And it also feels like the closest that when you look at him looking very serious in a nun habit.

621
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:02,160
Here's where you can imagine that there's some mood that like in the fugitive he

622
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,920
passed through a church.

623
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,560
Oh yeah.

624
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,920
What can I throw on.

625
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,120
I don't I don't believe so.

626
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,720
He's dressed as a priest in a movie maybe.

627
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:09,840
Am I wrong.

628
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,600
Maybe I'm right maybe making that up.

629
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,240
I think he.

630
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,720
God again I can't remember.

631
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,200
Witness.

632
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,680
Does he put the Amish outfit on.

633
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,800
We've been dancing around that the whole time.

634
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,720
That's the silliest costume.

635
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,200
Even still here wait I'm looking at it.

636
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,200
It's not you could go a lot more.

637
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:38,160
This is not the Halloween store costume of I think he's they're still trying to make him look

638
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,160
hot as an Amish detective and he's protecting a witness.

639
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:43,920
Yeah right.

640
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,760
That is called witness.

641
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,400
I should know that sounds right.

642
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,080
You seem more confident than me.

643
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,080
But he doesn't put like a beard on.

644
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,200
He's not like chewing a big stalk.

645
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:55,840
Right.

646
00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:00,640
So you know and there's a few where I think he's he's looking at it is one where he's like

647
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,280
barrel chested is you know the shirts way open.

648
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,200
I think he's a hot Amish guy.

649
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,960
So there's no like Lincoln beard.

650
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:14,000
So I can't I don't know if even by default and due to the it's certainly his silliest hat.

651
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,200
Yes.

652
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:20,880
And so maybe by default it's the silliest he's looked in a movie but still not that silly.

653
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,360
Not that silly.

654
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:25,360
He almost he looks like Indy honestly in a couple of his films.

655
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,360
Yep he's a cool Amish guy.

656
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,240
Back to none.

657
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,040
Yeah.

658
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:36,800
A thing I like about it is he's wearing like joke shop the glasses that look like aviators

659
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,480
but they had the big fake like really made up eyes.

660
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,400
Oh my god I was looking at a couple's photo where that's gone where he's not wearing that.

661
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,400
Thank you for reminding of this.

662
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,800
Yeah you're right he must have lost those at some point in the night.

663
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,960
It's the like I'm not asleep glasses.

664
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:56,240
Yeah and this is one where of course he's got the two bottles of wine as a good party guest.

665
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,760
Yep yep yep yep.

666
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,960
Okay I know to bring a nice bottle of wine now.

667
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,000
And it fits with the religious theme.

668
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,840
Yes oh that's true.

669
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:10,160
This wine could be used to be turned into Christ's blood.

670
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,480
Yeah maybe she's just stocking up at the religious supply store.

671
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,880
This is also if we're talking about a movie this is the one where Harrison is definitely the

672
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,880
like the most well cast.

673
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,800
This makes the most sense is him playing a nun in a movie because he'd be sort of stern no nonsense.

674
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:31,840
He's obviously an older guy like he is perfectly cast as a nun in my mind if you're putting

675
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,200
together a movie like this.

676
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:33,680
Sure.

677
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,080
Sure.

678
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:39,200
There's kind of a gender erasure that comes from the hat because all you've got is the face.

679
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,920
So he keeps his head down.

680
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46,400
If he's in a big line of nuns all walking somewhere is there still anywhere where there's

681
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,000
like a lot of nuns together?

682
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,280
I'm sure there are.

683
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:49,760
There has to be.

684
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,480
In my head like the kind of you know like where my parents go there's like one nun per church.

685
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:54,960
Okay.

686
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:59,760
I don't know when I've never maybe in my life seen 30 nuns all walking somewhere.

687
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,880
Where was the sound of music?

688
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,040
Well it's in a fake but yes.

689
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,640
Yeah but maybe in I guess in the real sound of music.

690
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,360
I don't know.

691
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,360
Yeah there's got to be like 30 nuns hanging out.

692
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,600
Where I grew up there was a retirement home for nuns.

693
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,720
Okay sure.

694
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,280
Next to Newman College.

695
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,240
The nun house.

696
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,360
Or a VH1 reality show.

697
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:23,760
Yeah.

698
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,040
What am I gonna do?

699
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,480
They think I killed my wife.

700
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,680
You're gonna have to witness protection program in the nun house.

701
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,880
This is kind of now we're getting very derivative of his other.

702
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,960
It's a derivative of both fugitive and witness but he's good at what he's good at.

703
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,400
Can be a sequel to any one of those.

704
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,920
Sequel witnesses.

705
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,720
Witnesses.

706
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,040
Parentheses nun house.

707
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,920
Witnesses nun house.

708
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,720
Turns into a party movie though halfway through.

709
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:51,200
Yeah yeah.

710
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:51,840
Oh yeah yeah.

711
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,640
This nun house is more of a nut house.

712
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,160
The case is resolved so then they party to celebrate.

713
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,000
He gets Frank to license Margaritaville officially.

714
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:02,320
Yeah.

715
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,520
Frank's producing the movie.

716
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,800
You think we could get.

717
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,320
We have an idea where all the nuns are partying to Margaritaville.

718
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,560
I think I can handle that.

719
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,760
Sister Mary barfs on me.

720
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,040
A thing I want to give Calista some credit.

721
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:21,120
Please.

722
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:26,080
Because she does a thing that I like a lot about Halloween costumes.

723
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,760
I think I like both extremes.

724
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:34,560
I like the picture perfect costumes but I also like the homemade like

725
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:40,800
it's not 100% exact but it's all the signifiers you know.

726
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,960
What you can find to represent kind of a difficult concept to represent.

727
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:50,160
And I think that's part of the fun of Halloween is like you piece it together.

728
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:57,040
And it's maybe not like 100% like camera ready but it communicates the idea and it

729
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,040
looks fun and funny you know.

730
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,000
So she's got the pig nose and ears.

731
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,440
She's got the feather boa.

732
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:09,840
She's got a pink like sweatsuit on and it's like yeah that's pretty all pretty simple

733
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,880
but it communicates what you're trying to do you know.

734
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,080
It's not too sweaty.

735
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,960
There's a certain point if you put too much money into these things.

736
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:21,200
I don't think any of these costumes cost either of them more than $100.

737
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:21,760
Absolutely.

738
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,880
I have never seen them do anything.

739
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,560
They could afford better.

740
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,520
I like think so.

741
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,080
That money should be going into the planes.

742
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,920
That money is for plane fuel.

743
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,560
That's right.

744
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,400
Another thing he has injured himself doing.

745
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:44,000
He crashed an old World War II plane I think onto the golf course in Santa Monica.

746
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,040
Any landing you can walk away from right?

747
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,160
Yes that is true.

748
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,520
There was a period where he got hurt a lot.

749
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,560
I think he hasn't been hurt luckily in a few years two years.

750
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,800
This nun's habit is too long.

751
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,360
I slipped.

752
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:00,960
I crushed my leg.

753
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,840
Thankfully JJ Abrams was at the party.

754
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:05,920
Pulled it up.

755
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,440
He broke his back again for me.

756
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:08,560
Twice.

757
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,560
This man loves me.

758
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:16,720
His first JJ Abrams movie that he wrote regarding Henry stars Harrison Ford.

759
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,880
Does he have a silly costume regarding Henry?

760
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,240
Let's look it up.

761
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,120
Oh my god look.

762
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,080
Oh it's right there.

763
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,520
He's dressed as a big grapefruit.

764
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,480
Oh wow.

765
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,600
It's in the poster too.

766
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:31,520
I think there is going to be one that the listeners are like guys duh.

767
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,560
There's something famous.

768
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,280
Yeah we're missing.

769
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,000
Yeah.

770
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,760
Where it's not coming to me.

771
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,280
He is going to be.

772
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:42,400
First of all I think it's fascinating that he signed onto a Marvel like multiple Marvel

773
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,040
movies recently to replace William Hurt.

774
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,160
Oh he's the president now?

775
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,280
Maybe something like that.

776
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,800
But he's all going to be a Hulk.

777
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,360
Harrison Ford is going to be a red Hulk.

778
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,040
Yes and he didn't know this.

779
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:55,680
He doesn't know anything.

780
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,560
There was an interview.

781
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,200
And I love it.

782
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,600
Maybe you're going to maybe turn into the red Hulk.

783
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,720
And he's just like what are you?

784
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,640
Maybe he doesn't even say anything.

785
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,960
Just stares at the interviewer and he's just like I don't know.

786
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,160
They told me I can shoot it all in my backyard over three days.

787
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:13,280
It's five million dollars for three days of work in my backyard at a green screen.

788
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,840
His lack of interest in Marvel is the one thing that gives me hope that we could be friends.

789
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,160
Well he doesn't care about Star Wars either.

790
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:26,160
I think he and I do probably have similar levels of caring about Star Wars.

791
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:26,640
Yeah yeah.

792
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,560
It is great casting for Thunderbolt Ross.

793
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,160
That's who he is right?

794
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,200
If he's the red Hulk.

795
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,080
That's who he's playing yeah.

796
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:37,200
Because Liam Hurt died who was Thunderbolt Ross before.

797
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,160
So he is replacing.

798
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:43,200
But yes that's going to be I guess what I'm saying is unless we're missing something big

799
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:52,240
it will be funny to see a big gloopy CGI red Hulk with Harrison Ford's 83 year old face on it.

800
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,440
That is funny.

801
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,160
I'm worried.

802
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,120
I'm worried it's going to be bad or I might like it.

803
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,320
Well I think I'm going to like it.

804
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,600
I think I like that he has a straight.

805
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:04,880
I like that you only have to know about these pictures to see him silly.

806
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:05,280
Yeah.

807
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,720
I think we like $80 silly Harrison Ford.

808
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,480
Are we going to like $80 million silly Harrison Ford?

809
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:18,240
But you have to remember it's going to be a rushed production no fault of the CGI artist.

810
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:23,600
But Marvel will change it like two weeks before it comes out and make it look weirder for some reason.

811
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,320
Oh sure.

812
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:27,200
Oh yes so there's going to be those frames that look horrible.

813
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:31,680
Yeah so it will look goofy and I'm sure in some shots.

814
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,280
Okay well I like that.

815
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:37,760
So that will be maybe his silliest on screen appearance.

816
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,600
So we have a project where it's confirmed that he's in.

817
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,520
Yeah he's in the Captain America 4.

818
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,560
He's in the new.

819
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:45,520
Is that next year?

820
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,600
I don't I used to know this the answer to these questions I do not.

821
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,720
There's too many.

822
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:54,320
It's used to get like an evenly paced kind of like.

823
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,040
Yeah I knew.

824
01:01:55,040 --> 01:02:00,160
A softball from the batting cage every 10 seconds and now it's just firing a mega.

825
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:00,640
I'm behind.

826
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,360
I fell ow stop pummeling me.

827
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:08,560
We go to every one opening night and I'm behind I haven't seen Guardians yet.

828
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,480
I haven't seen Quantumania yet.

829
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:11,920
I haven't started yet.

830
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,000
Loki season two has started.

831
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:14,560
I know that.

832
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:15,520
A couple episodes in.

833
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:20,240
I think Secret Wars has been delayed to 2028 I believe.

834
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:20,880
Oh man.

835
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,120
Which is the finale of this saga.

836
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,760
I don't know but I think it's probably next year.

837
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:27,920
He's in it for sure.

838
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:28,800
Okay.

839
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:30,720
But he's going to be in more too.

840
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,720
They're you know they're they're struggling a little right now.

841
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,720
Maybe a little oversaturated.

842
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:37,280
A little.

843
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:41,680
Shot in the arm they need maybe is Harrison Ford Red Oak.

844
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,000
It's a blast of gamma radiation.

845
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,280
Everyone says you know what I'm a little tired of superheroes but you know what.

846
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:52,400
This guy sleepwalking through this performance is what I needed.

847
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,280
A body scan machine never saying a single line is the Red Hulk.

848
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:03,120
They bring it up all gingerly like there are these tools that we have.

849
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,840
It's gotten a bad reputation but AI and what it allows us to do is to capture.

850
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:08,560
Yes do it.

851
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:08,800
Sounds good.

852
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:09,440
Whatever you want.

853
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:09,680
Yep.

854
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:09,920
All right.

855
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:10,160
Yeah.

856
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:10,640
Whatever.

857
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:11,040
I'm just saying.

858
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,400
What are all the syllables I need to say?

859
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,040
What do you need for me?

860
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:13,680
I'm just saying.

861
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:14,240
We have them.

862
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,600
Actually we fully built the model already.

863
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:16,640
We were worried you were going to say no.

864
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:17,520
No.

865
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:17,920
Sign off.

866
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:18,320
Go for it.

867
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,120
I'm getting on my plane.

868
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,720
We borrowed it from Lucasfilm.

869
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,880
You've got all of your stuff on file.

870
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,200
You are putting dots on my face.

871
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,320
And that's what he won't stand for.

872
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,600
Like the gumdrops.

873
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,000
Too silly.

874
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,440
Too silly to have dots.

875
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,560
I've seen those photos from Dial of Destiny because they de-aged him.

876
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:37,360
He has the dots.

877
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,000
Oh he has the dots.

878
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:38,640
That's silly.

879
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,200
That's the silliest he's ever looked on camera.

880
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:41,360
Yeah.

881
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:41,920
Yeah.

882
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:42,960
Oh what a fool.

883
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,800
I'm just saying you know.

884
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,080
You're going back to this point.

885
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:49,840
I'm saying Levin and Mathau had a whole other stage of their career

886
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:50,320
in the night.

887
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,120
Grumpy old man.

888
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:51,840
Grumpy old man.

889
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:52,320
Sure.

890
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,280
Shot in the arm.

891
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,760
Okay and you're saying that Red Hulk is grumpy old Hulk.

892
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,040
Sometimes you can teach an old dog new tricks.

893
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,520
Red Hulk is looking for love in his 80s.

894
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:04,020
Maybe.

895
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,920
Okay the only way this works is if there's another.

896
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,840
Just follow the same formula you just said.

897
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,360
There's also a Purple Hulk.

898
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:12,320
They are both old.

899
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,840
They are too old to fight.

900
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:17,280
They are maybe they're strong and they're certainly big but they don't really.

901
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:23,600
It's more about them like sitting around and checking out another an old Hulk lady who

902
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,320
pezzes by.

903
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,880
Galista wants to do it.

904
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,600
She can.

905
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,960
Well I was going to say.

906
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,000
Look at that orange.

907
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,360
Art imitating life.

908
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,480
Another new entrant to the Marvel Universe.

909
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:35,520
Newish.

910
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,280
Julia Louis Dreyfus.

911
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:37,840
That's right.

912
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:38,560
She is in there.

913
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:39,060
On camera.

914
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:40,720
You know.

915
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,200
You think she's going to fall in love with.

916
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,960
General Thunderbolt Ross.

917
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,920
But I want him to be the Hulk when he falls in love.

918
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,120
Not General Ross.

919
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:50,320
He can be the Red Hulk.

920
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,360
She can fall in love.

921
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,960
She actually hates General Ross.

922
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,960
Completely butts heads.

923
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:55,440
Right.

924
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,800
I don't ever want to see this guy again.

925
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:57,680
But the Hulk.

926
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,720
That's different.

927
01:04:58,720 --> 01:04:59,600
That's a different story.

928
01:04:59,600 --> 01:04:59,840
Yeah.

929
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:04,720
But a May December romance with a 90s hot television star.

930
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:05,520
Red Hot.

931
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,720
You know very funny.

932
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,120
Red Hot.

933
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,000
Hot Sizzle.

934
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:10,720
Hot Sizzle.

935
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,240
The cover of Entertainment Weekly.

936
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,120
Multiple times.

937
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,520
Jason's standing up and waving his arms around.

938
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,320
He's so excited about this.

939
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:22,560
You're just referring to the fact that she's ever been on the cover of Entertainment Weekly in her life.

940
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,520
Well what I'm saying.

941
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,480
She's hot.

942
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,760
Art imitating life.

943
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:26,880
Calista.

944
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:27,680
Julia.

945
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:28,240
You know.

946
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:32,720
I think you have a severe crush on Julia Louis Dreyfus that's coming out here.

947
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,120
Hot.

948
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:33,840
Hot hot hot.

949
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,800
I mean who doesn't I suppose to some degree.

950
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:37,280
She's beautiful.

951
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:37,760
Yeah.

952
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:38,480
Yeah.

953
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,720
But I like this idea that Julia Louis Dreyfus.

954
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:45,600
Who's been on Entertainment Weekly.

955
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,320
She's been.

956
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:50,640
Do you want to answer if this actress is hot right now or not.

957
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,120
She was on the cover of Entertainment Weekly.

958
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:54,080
Okay.

959
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:55,280
When?

960
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,720
1996.

961
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:57,440
Fronted.

962
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:57,840
She's.

963
01:05:59,200 --> 01:05:59,920
Okay.

964
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:00,720
Seinfeld.

965
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:01,200
I know.

966
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,560
You don't have to say her.

967
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:05,680
I'm aware that Julia Louis Dreyfus is a popular actress.

968
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:06,880
He's going to list the credits.

969
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:07,200
What?

970
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,320
The NBC show.

971
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,000
I think the list is done after Seinfeld.

972
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,840
The NBC show in real time.

973
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,560
New Adventures of Old Christine.

974
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:15,440
I remember that.

975
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,240
Veep.

976
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,240
Oh I forgot about Veep.

977
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:18,880
You're right.

978
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,560
She does have a career.

979
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,000
What about the Tony Soprano?

980
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,920
What Gannolfini movie she was in.

981
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,040
Remember they fall in love.

982
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:27,360
Yeah.

983
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,080
I still.

984
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:28,400
You don't remember.

985
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,920
What are we arguing now.

986
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,320
So you see she can be in love in a movie.

987
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:33,840
This dream is.

988
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,040
I don't know what the argument is.

989
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:37,280
I think a mismatch romance.

990
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:41,760
A romantic comedy is just what the Marvel Universe needs to get back on track.

991
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:42,720
I agree with this.

992
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,280
I agree with this.

993
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:43,600
All right.

994
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,800
I agree with that too.

995
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:45,040
Yeah.

996
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:45,680
I can't dispute that.

997
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:46,720
Break genres.

998
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:50,800
They always say that they are like this is a little more of a this and then they don't.

999
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:51,120
Yes.

1000
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,240
Full rom-com.

1001
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,200
No action.

1002
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,320
The action is boring.

1003
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,040
I agree.

1004
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,880
I can't follow the action.

1005
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,720
Now I sound like a grumpy old man.

1006
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,240
The action puts me to sleep.

1007
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,360
I don't know what I'm looking at.

1008
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:02,080
That's what my mom says too.

1009
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:02,640
But a nice bit of.

1010
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:04,400
I do.

1011
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,600
Genuinely though.

1012
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,560
This isn't even recent.

1013
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:09,360
I said this in 2012.

1014
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:09,680
Yeah.

1015
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,680
I thought the action was boring.

1016
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:14,960
I think some of the action is good and some of the action is boring.

1017
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:15,280
Yes.

1018
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,360
There's a certain point where you just can't make heads or tails.

1019
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:24,800
Well, some of the VFX staff has unionized so maybe it'll be a little smoother.

1020
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,600
Maybe there'll be less last minute change.

1021
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,800
I think it's 20% of the VFX staff.

1022
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:31,040
Yeah.

1023
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:34,800
But we'll see what it does to the silliness of the look of the Red Hulk.

1024
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:35,200
I don't know.

1025
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,480
I miss the silliness though.

1026
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,680
Silliness is something.

1027
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,560
The bland aesthetic they go for is nothing.

1028
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:41,840
Now, oh, I hate to.

1029
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:42,400
We have so much.

1030
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:48,080
What if they decide there's just no time and they got to make them like old school

1031
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,400
Lou Ferrigno style and we got to paint Harrison.

1032
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,280
Could you imagine?

1033
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,720
Then we have the best.

1034
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,000
I'm now I'm back.

1035
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:54,960
I'm back in the Marvel universe.

1036
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,480
Now I think I solved the issue.

1037
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,040
Yes.

1038
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:57,520
Paint him.

1039
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,720
Practical effects are back.

1040
01:07:58,720 --> 01:07:59,840
Oh, please.

1041
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:04,320
And then just like a big like make him wear whatever Violet Beauregard wore.

1042
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,840
He's just in a big puffy.

1043
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,600
Well, that's even more than I thought.

1044
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:11,040
I was just picturing Ferrigno with the pants ripped pants and naked.

1045
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:12,160
Otherwise, that's Ferrigno.

1046
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,120
Ferrigno is big.

1047
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:13,440
That's true.

1048
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:16,160
Harrison Ford's kind of the slider at this point.

1049
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:16,400
Okay.

1050
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,280
You got to puff them up.

1051
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:20,400
So put them in a paint a suit red.

1052
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:20,640
Great.

1053
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,040
Harrison knows where to find the costumes.

1054
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,560
He knows where the deals are.

1055
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,440
I'm the Red Hulk.

1056
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:26,640
Watch out.

1057
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:27,360
Go to the sun.

1058
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,320
The sun Valley, Idaho target.

1059
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,000
Great.

1060
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,360
Great coupons.

1061
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:34,560
Harrison times are tough.

1062
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,520
Use the app.

1063
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,560
Harrison times are tough.

1064
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:41,760
We know your ability to make a costume, so we're going to trust you to make your own

1065
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,720
Red Hulk costume.

1066
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:44,000
We're pay.

1067
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:44,480
We are.

1068
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:46,800
Now we have already agreed to pay you $25 million.

1069
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,680
Can some of that money go to the costume?

1070
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,960
Use as much or as little.

1071
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,360
I'm sorry, but that's going to have to include your costume fees.

1072
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:54,000
All right.

1073
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,880
I'm going during circle week in the app and I am pocketing the difference.

1074
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,480
I'm buying granola bars, too.

1075
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:05,200
Those are for me.

1076
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,280
I'm not sharing them with the crew.

1077
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:09,200
Oh, this is my birthday month, too.

1078
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,480
So I get one purchase.

1079
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,760
That's 5% off.

1080
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,680
I'm pocketing that.

1081
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,200
You're not getting that one.

1082
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,880
Well, that'll bring the people back.

1083
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,240
I would absolutely bring me back.

1084
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:20,400
Okay.

1085
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,040
So let's here.

1086
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:21,920
Let's make good.

1087
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:22,560
We said them all.

1088
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:23,680
And then there's the hot dog.

1089
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:30,720
I mean, the hot dog was on Kimmel and I really like in the clip when Kimmel is fishing for

1090
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:34,400
force awakens spoilers and his response is woof, woof.

1091
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:35,920
Woof, woof.

1092
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:37,520
That's great.

1093
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,480
That's very good.

1094
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,000
And then he's pretty sincere.

1095
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,680
He's like, I just want them to see the movie.

1096
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,680
I don't want to give anything away.

1097
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:46,960
Just go to the theater.

1098
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,040
This is the way it used to be.

1099
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,680
There wasn't the whole weird spoiler market and that's great.

1100
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,800
But so now we have all our competitors.

1101
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:59,920
They're probably all on all of our desktops in some form and we were asked by Matthew

1102
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,000
to rate them somehow.

1103
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,200
It might take too long to do a full ranking, but is there some way to determine the best or

1104
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,440
to say, I mean, we already said the nerd, but is there one that we want to fully see as a movie

1105
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,680
that we haven't gotten to?

1106
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,280
I mean, I say follow your heart.

1107
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,760
Do you guys just want to name a favorite?

1108
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,120
Yeah, I think so.

1109
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:24,560
I mean, we can do a little more of this ranking on Twitter as well or on X.

1110
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,400
I really, I think my favorite actually is the hair metal.

1111
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:29,920
Oh.

1112
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:30,560
Actually.

1113
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,920
I love the P that's silly, but I like that they're all there together.

1114
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,440
They have a unified theme.

1115
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,320
It lets you imagine what it would have been like if he was in the film Rock of Ages.

1116
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,200
That's exactly what I was thinking.

1117
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,560
If Tom Cruise said no.

1118
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,280
Yes.

1119
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:48,960
And that's a movie I would want an 80 year old Harrison Ford doing like poison.

1120
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,680
Here I go again on my own.

1121
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:53,120
Is that what he said?

1122
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,160
What is Tom Cruise singing?

1123
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,680
Yeah, I think he does sing that.

1124
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,280
Made up my mind.

1125
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:58,960
Yeah, I think.

1126
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,320
Yeah, it's a couple though.

1127
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,160
He sings a couple of the old.

1128
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,560
She's my cherry pie.

1129
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,520
Sweet cherry pie.

1130
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,640
I was promised real cherry pie if I sing it.

1131
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:13,120
Yeah.

1132
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,400
Where's my pie?

1133
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,240
Stacy Jacks' agent.

1134
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:18,400
That's right.

1135
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,040
That's the character.

1136
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,960
In case people don't know,

1137
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,320
Stacy Jacks is the character from Rock of Ages that is played by Tom Cruise.

1138
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:24,800
Yeah.

1139
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:25,760
In case they don't know.

1140
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,560
Isn't Alec Baldwin his agent or something?

1141
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,680
Or is the manager of the club?

1142
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:30,880
He's the manager of the club.

1143
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:31,360
I forget.

1144
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:31,760
Yeah.

1145
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,320
I didn't know Baldwin does a number.

1146
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,040
Not sure.

1147
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:35,760
I don't know.

1148
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,560
Hope so.

1149
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,840
But yeah, that's for me.

1150
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,800
I would like to see Harrison Ford sing in a movie.

1151
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,560
And I would like to see him like in the debaucherous 80s.

1152
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:49,440
I don't know that I want to see him having sex a lot.

1153
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:52,080
It's in his age now trashing a hotel room.

1154
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:52,640
But that yeah.

1155
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:53,600
Like it's party.

1156
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,160
I like that.

1157
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:56,560
And then a really slow pickup of a chair.

1158
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,060
Yeah.

1159
01:11:57,860 --> 01:11:59,380
Knocking over the ice pocket.

1160
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:00,820
He will get.

1161
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:01,380
Damn it.

1162
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:05,780
You got to watch out because he will kick an amp over on stage and it'll crush his leg.

1163
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:07,220
Break it.

1164
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:07,700
Ah.

1165
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:08,200
JJ.

1166
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:10,420
Where is JJ?

1167
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:12,340
Do you got a favorite, Jason?

1168
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:15,460
I think it's the nun and Miss Piggy.

1169
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:15,940
Yeah.

1170
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:17,460
I like the contrast.

1171
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:24,660
I like that these costumes look like an assistant went to a Hollywood toy and costume,

1172
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:33,060
which is like a 20 year round prop and like Halloween kind of junkie shop on Hollywood

1173
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:33,940
Boulevard.

1174
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:43,460
But if you just need like X, Y, Z for like, oh, I need a fake arm or I need a big fake tree branch.

1175
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:45,140
They have it.

1176
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:48,500
You know, it's a little grungy, but they're really nice there.

1177
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:50,500
You need a big fake tree branch lately.

1178
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:51,540
I don't know.

1179
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:53,140
It's just trying to think of what you could need.

1180
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:55,220
I don't know.

1181
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:57,060
I was thinking of Halloween decorations.

1182
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:58,340
People have scary trees.

1183
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:02,100
I know you want the scary tree in your, but you want the, we established that you want

1184
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:06,420
the like 5,000 pound Chinese scary tree.

1185
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:07,940
Into an apartment building.

1186
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:09,540
So I don't have a backyard.

1187
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:15,380
If it had been a house, you definitely would have purchased the custom, the $20,000.

1188
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:22,260
Where the shipping was likely three times the cost of the tree because it needs to get to

1189
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:26,500
Southern California from like Shenzhen province.

1190
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:28,020
Yes.

1191
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:32,020
And the, and when it arrived, like, like if you're like, oh, I actually, maybe it'd be

1192
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:34,500
better if we rotated it a little to the right.

1193
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:34,900
All right.

1194
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:36,660
Let's hire 25 men.

1195
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:37,460
Oh yeah.

1196
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:43,700
The installation, the installer costs more than the item.

1197
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:44,580
We can do your job.

1198
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:48,660
I know good men, strong men, but it's going to take six months at minimum.

1199
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:52,580
Yeah, I'm with you.

1200
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:54,420
I'm well, I'm glad nobody said it.

1201
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:55,380
I'm going P pod.

1202
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:56,580
It's definitely P pod.

1203
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:56,980
Yeah.

1204
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:57,380
Yeah.

1205
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:58,500
Love P pod.

1206
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:04,340
And then I'm imagining the movie where like, it's a, it's like a sixties flashback movie

1207
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:11,060
and Calista is a, is a hippie and takes some psychedelics and imagines and is maybe having

1208
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:17,940
an awakening as being a health food nut and liking being a vegetarian and maybe what

1209
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:24,020
solidifies this is a, is a big handsome P pod coming to life and showing her the way.

1210
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:25,780
Come, I will show you.

1211
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:28,020
And there has, then this is it.

1212
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:30,980
And then he's, this is the stupidest shit I've ever said.

1213
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:31,860
He sings this thing.

1214
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:36,820
You see, he's performs a song that's about vegetarian awakening and this song is,

1215
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:41,220
is called the says the dawning of the age of asparagus.

1216
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,020
Some real food rocks.

1217
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:44,980
Asparagus.

1218
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:45,380
That's good.

1219
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:47,140
They missed out on that one.

1220
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:51,540
I just produced a perfect food rocks with no foresight.

1221
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:53,140
Or kitchen cabaret.

1222
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:53,460
Yeah.

1223
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:55,460
And fifth dimension wouldn't go forward.

1224
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:56,500
They wouldn't sign up on it.

1225
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:57,700
There's a lot of members.

1226
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:03,140
And then there's a disgusting sex scene between the P and the.

1227
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:08,100
Ah, rub my P. Not that P lower, the lower, the fifth from the top.

1228
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:09,780
That's where that's the erogenous P.

1229
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:10,580
Yeah.

1230
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:14,020
No, it's the anatomy is different on a P than it is on a human.

1231
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:15,540
So don't you know how to fuck a P?

1232
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,260
We're here at Access Hollywood.

1233
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:20,420
So Harrison, tell us about your newest project.

1234
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:25,780
You're wearing a peep pod, but there's nine songs level nudity and sex scenes.

1235
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:29,540
I get fucked as a P. Don't you want, I've answered you already.

1236
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:30,580
Okay.

1237
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:36,420
Well, hey, fire up your AMCA list to see Harrison Ward get fucked as a P.

1238
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:39,220
I don't like spoilers, but in this case, I'll tell you.

1239
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:42,420
Six ways to Sunday as a P.

1240
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:44,820
All right.

1241
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:45,620
Where else do we go?

1242
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:45,940
I don't know.

1243
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:46,340
I don't know.

1244
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:46,740
I don't know.

1245
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:47,540
Get the hell out of this.

1246
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:51,300
Thank you, Matthew.

1247
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:53,140
Imagine everything that you just heard.

1248
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:56,580
Now just picture a quote around all of it for the last hour or so.

1249
01:15:56,580 --> 01:16:00,340
And then just attribute it to Matthew Kamegis.

1250
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:01,220
Thank you.

1251
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:03,940
You caused it and you all survived.

1252
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:08,420
Haunt cast the freight, the cemetery gate, hunt cast the freight.

1253
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:10,500
Merch is available in our T public store.

1254
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:15,380
We'll get one more booness episode on our RIP tier Crypt 3.

1255
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:20,100
There you will hear the rightful actual poll winner Tower of Terror, the movie

1256
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:22,100
with Steve Gutenberg.

1257
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:28,100
But here we took the reins, grabbed the whip ourselves.

1258
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:30,900
That was the other.

1259
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:31,300
Wait here.

1260
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,900
Here's a little thought exercise on the way out.

1261
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:36,100
Combining Harrison Ford and Halloween costumes.

1262
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:38,020
Imagine his real cost.

1263
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:44,180
If you wanted to be Indiana Jones, if you wanted to be Han Solo,

1264
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:50,420
the off-brand Halloween costume names of Harrison Ford's iconic characters.

1265
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:51,860
Can we do this?

1266
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:52,660
Oh, interesting.

1267
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:53,140
Yeah.

1268
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:53,300
Oh.

1269
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:55,460
Like, you know, it's not Han Solo.

1270
01:16:55,460 --> 01:17:00,980
It's like Astral Vest-Wearer.

1271
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:02,980
Interstellar vest enthusiast.

1272
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:07,460
Instead of Indiana Jones, it's just Professor Adventure.

1273
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:09,140
That's good.

1274
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:10,580
I like Professor Adventure.

1275
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:13,700
I think a lot of the movies could just be serious guy.

1276
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:15,140
Mean man.

1277
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:17,620
All business.

1278
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:28,100
This is my other idea for Indiana Jones is being non BDSM whip enthusiast.

1279
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:30,020
That's great.

1280
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:30,340
Yeah.

1281
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:34,660
So if you're selling bootleg costumes out there, there's some free ideas for you.

1282
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:35,300
Yeah.

1283
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:36,420
Airplane president.

1284
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:41,140
Plane demander.
