00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Warning, the following podcast may contain eye-eating parasites, a husky cat's waking nightmare, Scott's indulgent soliloquy about Mike Love, and a rollicking discussion of Pittsburgh institution Kennywood with guest John Daly.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Strap in, it's Podcast the Ride.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, a show starring three guys so pale when we go on the haunted mansion we're mistaken for ghosts. Joined as always by Mike Carlson, howdy ho, and Jason Sheridan.

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hello there.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We're gonna run out of like little quick, there's only so many options you can do of like the check-in.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hit me with two more real fast. Mike Carlson.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hey there.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And Jason Sheridan.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Good day, mate.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Oh yeah, your classic Australian.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
My classic Australian.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I love when people-

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Sheridan Australian.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
When people unprovoked just talking cockney or Australian accents like the funny guy in your office.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's not at all a hell.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I find the modern equivalent of that is more like Family Guy voice guy who will do like Stewie voice more than Australian accent.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
More than just a general-

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Victory is mine or something.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's pretty bad.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I do think it's funny if someone describes Family Guy, like Family Guy, hey Lois, like someone just sounds like an early impression.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Or somebody just sings the entire theme song.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It seems today.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yeah, well there's a lot of annoying ways to start podcasts or be annoying in an office.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
A lot of ways to be annoying, but you know what, I don't want to talk about any of that.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm in a great mood, I'm in a great glowing mood.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm excited about our guest John Daly and I've just come off of a wonderful couple of days, a wonderful weekend.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I wanted to share it with everybody how special it's been.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
First of all, on Sunday I got to stop by a place called the Van Eeden Galleries.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If you're in Los Angeles, go to the Van Eeden Galleries in Sherman Oaks, which is a place where you can actually bid on and purchase Disneyland memorabilia.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But the other cool thing is they leave it out for you to look at.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's just like a museum until the auction happens and you can look at all these neat Disneyland props.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
For example, you can look at the shell of an Autopia car.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's not working, the vehicle mechanics are not in it, but you can look at just that green shell.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You can look at molding from the Country Bear Jimberi.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Now that one got me interested.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
There we are. What else do they got right now?

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
There's a Tower of Terror check-in desk.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Holy shit.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yeah, it actually is. You could recreate the entire California Adventure Tower of Terror lobby with items.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
They have big lamps that are covered in cobwebs.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
They have the shelves where you put letters for guests at the Hollywood Hotel.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, wow.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah, if you had hundreds of thousands of dollars to burn, you could make your own Hollywood Tower of Terror.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I went because I wanted to see an old dear friend. Probably the big ticket item at this year's auction is Fuzzball.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
If you don't know, get with the program. Look up Fuzzball.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Fuzzball is a little orange sort of flying tiger creature who is part of Captain EO's team, part of Captain EO's gang,

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
in the beloved 3D film with Michael Jackson. He's a little flying guy in optical effect who kind of talks in a little squeak.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
He says, like, bye-bye at the end. That wasn't a good Fuzzball.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But look, he's a delight. He plays the bass at some point in the movie and sings along to the Michael Jackson song,

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We're Here to Change the World.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Anyway, getting to see a Fuzzball in person was such a delight, and I encourage you guys to stop by there, too.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Is it an official Fuzzball from the shooting? Does it specify if it was a recreated Fuzzball or is it actually the Fuzzball in the movie?

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Do we know?

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It certainly seems like it. I didn't see any statements qualifying which Fuzzball it was or wasn't, but it was a full body.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Whatever it is, it's immaculately made. I can only assume it was in at least one shot.

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I hope it's the one that was playing the bass, but there's no way to affirm that necessarily.

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But through the magic of trick photography, I got to make it seem like Fuzzball was on my shoulders, just like Captain EO himself.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's nice to feel like the captain for a second.

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Sure, yeah. We all want to feel like a captain once in a while.

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah, for sure. I saw some of the online catalog for this auction, and I was excited by the number of new hire packets from throughout the decades for sale.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So you could cosplay like, I just got hired to work at Disneyland in 1976.

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I saw one of them, and it specifies no beards on men and no opinions on women.

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
No communists, period.

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What is the suggested or the starting price for the auctions for both for Fuzzball and for these documents?

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I think some of the document stuff was pretty affordable.

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You could also get a run of the cast member magazine, I don't know if we're talking complete runs, but under $100 probably for that sort of stuff.

69
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Really?

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This is starting bid though.

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Right, because in August Nick and...

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Fuzzball, I feel like I saw something on the live where it was at least $10,000.

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Fuzzball is starting at $50,000.

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Starting at $50,000.

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Wow.

76
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's going to extremely grow, so if you are an extremely wealthy, Captain EO aficionado, something that I'd like to be one day.

77
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I got half of that equation figured out, but if I had $500,000 that I could easily burn, then perhaps I'd go get me a Fuzzball.

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I went to this auction, I'm sure I've talked about it, but I went to the auction and I bid on and won two signs that were outside the Magic Eye Theater in Epcot

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
that say, Caution, Doors Open Automatically.

80
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's in the Epcot font that I love so much.

81
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You can put a light in it, it lights up.

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I do it every night, it relaxes me.

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's my night light.

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It really is.

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
When the light goes on, that means relax.

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's like putting on a sign that says, it's five o'clock somewhere.

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's a neon bar sign.

88
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
To win an auction was also terribly exciting.

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I was with a lot of people who were doing it very humorlessly, just raising their sign and adding to their pile.

90
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I sat in this auction for four hours and I was the only person who, when I won, went, yes!

91
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I did a touchdown dance, got up on the chair, found the person I was bidding against, shoved him out of the store, said, eat my signs, bitch.

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
There you have it.

93
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I should also mention my friend David Love, we were talking about the Van Eeden Art Gallery,

94
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
he told me he actually won one of the employment forms that you're talking about.

95
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's one from the 60s where you have to check a box saying that you're not a communist.

96
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Oh, I made that joke unprovoked.

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Wow.

98
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's real.

99
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That came up recently because that is still a law on the California books for, I believe, state employees.

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You are not allowed to be a member of the Communist Party and a local politician won a smaller seat on the ticket of the Communist Party of America or something like that.

101
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Wow.

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Couldn't have gotten in at Disneyland, though.

103
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yeah.

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Anyway, and speaking of 1960s culture, this is only tangentially related, but if I didn't use my podcast as a platform to talk about this, I'd be remiss.

105
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:14,000
In addition to meeting the fuzzball, I also, last night, got to meet the legend, the one, the only, Mike Love, singer of the Beach Boys.

106
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And I'm sure I've mentioned the Beach Boys and my affection for the Beach Boys at some point on this podcast, but I'm still glowing from this.

107
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm within 24 hours of having met Mike Love.

108
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You might have to ascribe the quality of being the villain of the Beach Boys story.

109
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And your brain is racing.

110
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Think, what would I say to Mike Love if I ever ran into Mike Love?

111
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Do I say something weird?

112
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Do I make some dig?

113
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And instead, I said, you know, my dad and I listen to you guys all the time.

114
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
We love your music.

115
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
My friend Danny Jelenik who I was with said, hey, Good Vibrations is a great song.

116
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
He said thanks, shook his hand.

117
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
He told me, oh, I guess the music transcends generations.

118
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I said, it sure does, Mike.

119
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
A very normal thing for someone to say about their own work.

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
About, it's a very broad thing to say about the work of the Beach Boys.

121
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He's kind of that way in general, like his comments were sort of, it was like, you know, we go to France and people are singing along in France.

122
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
They don't get, they don't, they don't know about T-Birds there.

123
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's still your comment.

124
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And at this point in time is, yeah, anyways, just a landmark weekend for myself.

125
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What was the, how did you get to meet him?

126
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
This was a, this was at the Grammy Museum at LA Live.

127
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
There was a Q&A supporting his new album Unleash the Love.

128
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
He played selections from the album and brought up many of his sons and daughters to come sing with him.

129
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
He has a lot of sons and daughters.

130
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He's been spreading the love for years.

131
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He's been spreading the love.

132
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
He's been unleashing the love for years.

133
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
He's been unleashing the love on so many women since 1961.

134
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
He buys a new hat every time he has a new child.

135
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
He had a book out too recently, right?

136
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Did you read that book?

137
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Oh yeah, he plugged that too.

138
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Good Vibrations, My Life as a Beach Boy.

139
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah, all right.

140
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
He gets real, he gets real creative with these titles.

141
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But yeah, we got to watch an acoustic set.

142
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
He sang with, with Bruce Johnston, one of the other Beach Boys.

143
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And yeah, and then performed the holiday classic Little Saint Nick.

144
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And then we all got to meet him.

145
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
A very bizarre thing is we were in this line with a family who were all mega, not Mike Lowe,

146
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
they were mega Bruce Johnston fans.

147
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Wow.

148
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Who was kind of a late addition to the Beach Boys, came on in 1965.

149
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And these girls, much younger than I, these like 15 year old girls who were all dressed the same.

150
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It was sort of a little culty, I'm not going to lie.

151
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But they were all like shaking because they had just met Bruce Johnston.

152
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Whoa.

153
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
70 year old.

154
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's weird.

155
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah, I don't know.

156
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And the mom was just like, what can I say?

157
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
They're big Johnston heads.

158
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Kidding.

159
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
These, what happened to this family?

160
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What lightning were they struck by?

161
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I mean, no offense to Bruce Johnston, Bruce Johnston writer of the song Disney Girls to tie it back to the theme park world.

162
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Hey, they also used to perform at Disneyland a lot back in the early days, them and them and the Osmonds.

163
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Dottie and Marie.

164
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Uh huh, uh huh.

165
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
There's a video of somebody's playing like down on the corner on Disneyland.

166
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Is it them or is it just Dottie and Marie?

167
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The Greetings Clearwater song, Down on the Corner.

168
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That seems like a thing Dottie and Marie would do.

169
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It might be a Dottie and Marie I'm thinking of.

170
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

171
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Beach Boys didn't do a lot of covers.

172
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That's true.

173
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You're right.

174
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
When you got your own stack of tracks to play, when you got your own big hits, why deviate from the formula?

175
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And they were the backing band for Annette on Monkeys Uncle.

176
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The Monkeys Uncle, yes.

177
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Which is a Disney movie.

178
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So we're tying it.

179
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
That was the Beach Boys or the Monkeys?

180
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The Beach Boys.

181
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The Monkeys.

182
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It would have been a little too perfect.

183
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It was the Monkeys singing Monkeys Uncle.

184
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
A little on the nose.

185
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That may have been pre the invention of the Monkeys though.

186
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yeah.

187
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This actually does all tie back together because I believe there's some history between Monkey Mickey Dolan's and the park that we're talking about today, Kennywood.

188
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But hey, we'll leave you with that cliffhanger. Mickey Dolan's, how does he connect to Pittsburgh's Kennywood?

189
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's a cliffhanger you'll have to find out after the break when we return with our guest, John Daly.

190
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
All right, we are back and we are joined today by our amazing guest.

191
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So excited to have him.

192
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
An incredible actor, writer, very funny man.

193
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And of course, you know him from 13th Child, Legend of the Jersey Devil.

194
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Here he is, John Daly, ladies and gentlemen.

195
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
How's it going, guys?

196
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Oh boy, thank you so much for being here.

197
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Sight to beer and thanks for holding the torch for amusement parks.

198
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
For American amusement.

199
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Thanks for.

200
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Somebody's got to, you know, these complicated times we live in.

201
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You know, remember you can escape all your troubles with a trip to your local amusement fun fair.

202
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah.

203
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Which which which we're to talk to you about one that place that you probably escaped a lot of troubles at your whole life, your whole childhood and upbringing.

204
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
A magical place called Kennywood.

205
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Kennywood Park.

206
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Kennywood Park.

207
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
All right.

208
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Well, America's favorite picnic park is something I saw said about it.

209
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,000
An old black and white footage I watched somewhere that might not be an accurate statement or anything they still say today or a slogan they use.

210
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yeah, that was as fun as it got at a certain point.

211
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Having a nice picnic.

212
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yeah.

213
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yeah.

214
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
1908 it was like we had a picnic.

215
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It was insane.

216
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It was as much fun as you could have.

217
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The invention of radio or television outside was very fun.

218
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
We had three baskets.

219
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The weather was great.

220
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Very fine.

221
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I was going to say based on your intro, the amusement parks are essentially fairs that don't move.

222
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yeah, never.

223
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah.

224
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Moveable.

225
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm sure you've covered this.

226
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
No, not necessarily.

227
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Well, that's a good observation.

228
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That's elemental.

229
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That's true.

230
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
We really want to one and we missed it.

231
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You're right.

232
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Fairs that don't move.

233
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:32,000
This was a thing that Walt Disney talked about when he opened Disneyland is that it is a permanent fair and that there was only one entrance to.

234
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
He did not like people like when a county fair or something happens, people just coming at it from all angles.

235
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Right.

236
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's confusing.

237
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I just went to the LA County Fair.

238
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I couldn't remember where I came in.

239
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Was it the red gate?

240
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Was it the yellow gate?

241
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You don't have that problem at Disneyland.

242
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Only one way to get in.

243
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yeah.

244
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Pretty cool.

245
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Unless there's a fire.

246
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yeah, yeah.

247
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Then every way.

248
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Like the bricks are on fire.

249
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's really, really hot.

250
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Which is very grim to say because the city is on fire as we record this.

251
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
There's a 400,000 acre fire burning right now and it took me an extra like 40 minutes to get here.

252
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Guys, some advice to all of you, everyone listening, take service streets, baby.

253
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Don't F.

254
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Los Angeles is a zoo.

255
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yep.

256
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Gotta be careful out there.

257
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Another fun fact about Disneyland though is built right along the five because that was the main thoroughfare through Southern California at the time.

258
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Probably wasn't as crowded as it is today.

259
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah.

260
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Oh wow.

261
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yeah.

262
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I mean, there's not always a big old fire.

263
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,000
What I heard about the 110 is that Buster Keaton started the original 110 for his train movie.

264
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I forget.

265
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It looks like the great locomotive or whatever.

266
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I think that he built the 110 or maybe it was a movie called like Automobile or something like that.

267
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I think that Buster Keaton built the 110 and then they expanded it of course, but that's why it's so thin and terrible because.

268
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You mean like through Pasadena.

269
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's really like one lane.

270
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's really hard to merge onto.

271
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yeah.

272
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yeah.

273
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And it goes through downtown up to Pasadena.

274
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah.

275
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It was just a prop set freeway.

276
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yeah.

277
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
We're all driving on a fricking set from a maniac from 1910s or whatever.

278
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
That makes sense.

279
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:23,000
There's that one part of the 110 where you have to like merge to get on another freeway and you essentially have to make a 90 degree turn.

280
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I believe that's also when you go into a tunnel that is Roger Rabbit.

281
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
The exits are for full on crank cars like with those engines that you go.

282
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
They're like just like cars where you can just like reach out and high five people.

283
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Shake hands as you go by.

284
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
A very fast runner could outrun the fastest car back then.

285
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yeah. All of Los Angeles is a universal backlot tour basically where you're writing the movies when you're on the 110 literally.

286
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
There's history everywhere.

287
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Here's a fact about the 105 freeway when they built that freeway they had to take down the home of the of the Beach Boys in Hawthorne California.

288
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,000
That was something that was talked about last night at the Mike Love Q&A that I went to which we covered before you got here.

289
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
There was there was some I know all about this.

290
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yeah. Well I would love to hear.

291
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Well look I already I already did my time on it.

292
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
So we can't spend more time on it.

293
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I guess I'm the guest.

294
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You know John's only right.

295
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
We should he should dictate what we do.

296
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
We should do 20 more minutes on Mike Love.

297
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Tell me one love fact.

298
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Just wet my love a tie.

299
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:45,000
All right. He said how Mike when he was with the Maharishi and the Beatles the Paul McCartney took him aside and said you got to get that album art under control.

300
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
He thought the Beach Boys album covers weren't good.

301
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And this was right in the wake of Sergeant Pepper as class instant classic of an album cover as that was.

302
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And Mike stood firm.

303
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
He was like well you know what we think what's inside the cover is more important.

304
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Whoa.

305
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You exist.

306
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
They're both right.

307
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah.

308
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And McCartney did the best album cover and the best album indisputably at the same time.

309
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So what is that McCartney did.

310
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Why was Sergeant Pepper.

311
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Yeah.

312
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
One of the best.

313
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Yeah.

314
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's not a music.

315
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Sure.

316
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You got to get you.

317
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You got to get your covers.

318
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You got to get your covers.

319
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Mike Love.

320
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
That was just a nag.

321
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That was just to get under.

322
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
He was just like.

323
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Oh fuck this guy.

324
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You got to get your covers.

325
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
He's got a smile.

326
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Come over here.

327
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Come over here baby blue.

328
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You got to get your covers under control.

329
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
He was like no I don't think we do.

330
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I like the beach lineup.

331
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
With the big surfboard.

332
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
That's what we're doing.

333
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I like showing a picture of the beach on our covers.

334
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Anyway guys Kennywood Park.

335
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I mean I grew up in Pittsburgh.

336
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
In the North Hills.

337
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Kennywood is in West Mifflin and I remember it as being a kid.

338
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Being like this is a long drive.

339
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It was like one hour from my place.

340
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And yeah I have great memory.

341
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I mean going there since I was probably three years old.

342
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It was a big middle school horny time.

343
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I can't imagine.

344
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
We've covered these local parks.

345
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Everyone's horny.

346
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It was all about.

347
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Once I hit seventh grade we'd walk around and just be like.

348
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Oh boy.

349
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Those Kennywood babes.

350
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Those girls.

351
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So weird.

352
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Did things work out for you?

353
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
No but I have so many moments.

354
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Just memories of like tents.

355
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Like rides on the jackrabbit.

356
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And like who are you going to sit next to on the logjammer.

357
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Which the logjammer just closed.

358
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
We rest in peace.

359
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Wow.

360
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's a log.

361
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The Kennywood log flume called the logjammer.

362
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It was a ride that was good when it came out in like 1940.

363
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And yeah.

364
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Like Kennywood is a mixture of classic coasters.

365
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Wooden coasters from the like 20s and 30s.

366
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Like this a la the cyclone in Coney Island.

367
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And they're rattly and one's called the jackrabbit.

368
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And it like basically like makes you slip a disc.

369
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's like a terrible.

370
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Not a good roller coaster.

371
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Even when I was a kid I was like my back hurts.

372
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Those old ones will get to you.

373
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Even the best kept up old wooden roller coasters are kind of nightmares for your body at this point.

374
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Like even coasters that are 20 years old are still bad.

375
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Like there was one at Knott's that I went on that's a very mild one.

376
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But it did feel like all my vertebrae were very compressed.

377
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Because it just like went up a half and then down again.

378
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And it crushed my neck.

379
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It was really horrible.

380
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Are you guys coaster guys who are like I like that clackity clack.

381
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
We're not like you just I like the smooth crazy ones.

382
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's not a real coaster unless you're fucked up afterward.

383
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Yeah that's the way we feel.

384
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I feel like I'm going to die.

385
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yeah yeah.

386
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
We're mainly about like you know theming and like nice landscaping and that kind of thing.

387
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's not about like thrills and jeez.

388
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
We're about to be like nice sets and stuff.

389
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I like the coasters but as I get older like I feel worse and worse every time I ride them.

390
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Like the Kenny I have never been to Kennywood but it does seem.

391
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It is an interesting mix of these rides that have been there forever.

392
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Rides that are newer but homages to rides that were there before a great fire or something.

393
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And then some licensing mixed like a Lego movie simulator theater.

394
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I feel like Kennywood I haven't been there so I can't I have no idea.

395
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
But they they were never I mean at least when I was growing up like they were never spot.

396
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But I guess that started in like probably the late 90s or something.

397
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah.

398
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
That everything was like universal.

399
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Yeah.

400
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
What was your last trip?

401
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
What was your last Kennywood trip?

402
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It was probably in high school and there was also a the last trip that I made to Kennywood Park was for my freaking physics class.

403
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Where we had accelerometers that we made and we had to ride all the freaking it was science day.

404
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Science day at Kennywood.

405
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So we ride all the coasters.

406
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I was like all right take your accelerometer on the Thunderbolt and like see like the average way it swings or whatever.

407
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
We made these like accelerometers out of like a little weight and straw or whatever.

408
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And it was just that that was it.

409
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So it was like but we got to go there in the morning and wait in no lines and sit in the front and like all that stuff.

410
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And like then you sit in the back and see the difference.

411
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So did you learn anything?

412
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Did it actually shine a light on?

413
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I don't remember Dick.

414
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Drop out of school everybody.

415
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
At the seventh grade exactly.

416
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:53,000
One interesting thing I just read I'm on the Wikipedia page on my phone here and it says well Kennywood now uses the slogan America's Finest Amusement Park as well as the slogan.

417
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And this is very Philip K Dick slogan.

418
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Make a new memory.

419
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Oh wow.

420
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Make a new memory.

421
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
That's kind of an odd existential.

422
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Right out of valis.

423
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah it really is.

424
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Satellite firing a laser into your brain.

425
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Create a conglomerate memory.

426
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Live your life in five seconds.

427
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
We're watching this video of it.

428
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
There's a video where I got a lot of my info from called Kennywood memories.

429
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Check that out on YouTube.

430
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's in many parts.

431
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But there's a part where like a ride operator guy is sort of oddly creepily harshly saying like Kennywood is just one of those places.

432
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Just always just always going to be there.

433
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It's always going to exist.

434
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
That's right.

435
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yeah.

436
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You have to go.

437
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yeah this guy is the harsh like a Pittsburgh accent that sounds like it's from like 1890.

438
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It's like there's a Pittsburgh accent is a very you know very distinct kind of region regional accent.

439
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And this guy is like Kennywood is always going to be here.

440
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
It's always just going to exist.

441
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Angry about it.

442
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Defiantly as if the interviewer maybe the interviewer was like goading him and challenging him right before they started recording.

443
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
This thing's going to shut down soon right.

444
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah.

445
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You're out of a job old man.

446
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Yeah.

447
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
As soon as this documentary is recorded.

448
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
The Johnny Rockets in the center of the park will outlive us all.

449
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Well I also like Kennywood was seen as as slightly humiliating to me and my friends I would say and like if you were really an adult you would go to Cedar Point.

450
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You know where they have the Magnum and the insane like real deal new roller coasters because Kennywood until they got the steel Phantom was their first new school roller coaster.

451
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:47,000
So when I was like probably in seventh grade or something like that they got that and that was like I was still like in the zone to go to Kennywood definitely.

452
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,000
OK.

453
00:24:47,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And get all get all horny and like wearing a big I would like you know a Nike shirt that went down on my knees.

454
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
How was that.

455
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
How was the hair because we're watching all this documentary Kennywood memories.

456
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
There's a lot of weird old like ratty mullets and buzz cut.

457
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Oh yeah.

458
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And Pittsburgh was a hair just like it was like a you know a cornucopia of a cornucopia of like just I mean the big look that I saw that I recognized from like early 90s late 80s was spiked up with gel and then a little bit of a mullet like spiked up.

459
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And then you see and I remember seeing like adults back then and being like whoa that guy thinks he's cool like that.

460
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:53,000
But yeah the hair was was amazing and the girls had fluffy kind of like and like a big hair sprayed bang like comb right in the front there with kind of like some odd caked in swoop or shape.

461
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yeah.

462
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Put a lot of time into.

463
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Yeah.

464
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
That same documentary there I was flipping through it today and there was a quote that I have to read.

465
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:11,000
We're looking you're looking at a bunch of sort of buzz cut mulleted kids and the narrator very plainly says this this phrase imagine that looking at this copy in the video booth.

466
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:19,000
These young men are here for the same the Saint of fancy as altar boy picnic and they can tell you how to get wet on the log jammer.

467
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Oh.

468
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Well that is really a man I mean that's great.

469
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Because you're looking at like like seven boys all like tussling and wrestling around the extras from heavy metal parking lot like the people in the background.

470
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And they're going to boy.

471
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Yeah.

472
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Background.

473
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Oh yeah.

474
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Oh yeah.

475
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Yeah.

476
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Everyone looked like that.

477
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
The altar boy picnic.

478
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
What a time those altar boys have cool hair.

479
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:54,000
The only way they can express themselves because otherwise they're wearing those big drapey man dresses basically how do you describe an altar boy uniform.

480
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Just did you were you an altar boy.

481
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
No I was not anybody here.

482
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,000
No no my cousins were my cousins were but I I avoided that I went to CCD though.

483
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Oh yeah.

484
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I had a lot of friends who did CCD.

485
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I grew up on the other side.

486
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I grew up outside of Philadelphia.

487
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Oh OK.

488
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
That's another accent.

489
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Yeah my Philly accent is just an impression of John Worcester doing Philly boy.

490
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Oh yeah.

491
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Yeah.

492
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
The Eagles.

493
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You're going to get a cheesesteak at the Eagles game.

494
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Yeah.

495
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Yeah.

496
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
It's good as sheets.

497
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Yeah.

498
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It also is an impression of my aunt Linda.

499
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Sounds exactly like that.

500
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
That's awesome.

501
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
A living stereotype.

502
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Yeah.

503
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
A living stereotype.

504
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Yeah.

505
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I remember kids going to it's like hey do you want to do something after school and they're like no I've got CCD and I'm like what is that.

506
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And they're like well it's kind of like religious school and I'm like you have to leave school and go to a different school.

507
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
There was a certain point before I started CCD that I thought CCD was cool.

508
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Yeah.

509
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Yeah.

510
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
When my friends are going.

511
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You go somewhere after.

512
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Wow.

513
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And like it seems like cool people go to that CCD.

514
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And I went to it.

515
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Learn about this cool guy Jesus.

516
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah.

517
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Totally chill guy.

518
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
A lot of guys.

519
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And it's like not necessarily a nun.

520
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Like you could have a lay teacher man.

521
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And you might not get hit by a ruler the whole time.

522
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:23,000
No but I remember distinctly in CCD not to get too off topic but when did this guy Matt Frederick that went to my I guess elementary or middle school at that point.

523
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:36,000
He was like always wearing like like what are those fucking horrible metal bit like at least Megadeth but like more like janky.

524
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Like there's one called like what's the Hannibal corpse or something.

525
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:51,000
No but like pre that kind of like it was like Megadeth was probably the most but it was never striker never anthrax or anything like that.

526
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
It was like a lower rung.

527
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
It was like Hades man.

528
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
It was just like weird.

529
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And he one day he wore but anyway one day he wore a Guns N' Roses shirt and it was has skulls on it right.

530
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And he made sure to wear these death shirts to like CCD.

531
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
He was clearly a rebel.

532
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And the teacher was like we had this teacher this lay teacher that was like excuse me Matt.

533
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
OK.

534
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Who was OK.

535
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Who is on your shirt.

536
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You wore shirt again.

537
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Who is on your shirt.

538
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
The guys rose.

539
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
She's like OK.

540
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Who are the people in that band.

541
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
He goes well it's Axel and it's that in depth.

542
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
His dream question.

543
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Literally his dream question then she goes OK.

544
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
We are going to all OK.

545
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Say a prayer.

546
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
OK.

547
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So everyone bow your head.

548
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
We're going to pray for the members of that band.

549
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
They have imagery that tells me that they're bad people.

550
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So we all said a prayer for literally like by name every member.

551
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Which is a pretty cool thing like blessed stuff.

552
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
McCagan.

553
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Yeah.

554
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Wow.

555
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
As if he wasn't blessed enough.

556
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Of course.

557
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Wow.

558
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,000
May he play secular bass lines instead of evil demonic bass lines.

559
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Only major keys.

560
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
God.

561
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Not minor.

562
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Hey I'm going to throw out a couple I'll just throw out a couple names of rides and you

563
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
tell me if you've got strong memories associated with them.

564
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
The laser loop.

565
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Laser loop was another thing that you know when you grow up going to Kennywood you've

566
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
got to be this tall type.

567
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
You know there was like a little just disturbing thing from like a disturbing carrot like Kenny

568
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
was the mascot of Kennywood and it was like a kangaroo.

569
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And then the other ones were like Mr. Jeepers.

570
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I think it was literally I think it was actually Mr. Jeepers was just like weird.

571
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Like it was like kind of like seeing blackface but it wasn't blackface just like a little

572
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
disconcerting dark kind of like things like that people thought was cute things that people

573
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
thought were cute in like the 1910s.

574
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
You know boardwalk empire like the dolls back then.

575
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Now you see them and you're like like scare weird like cute big guy.

576
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Yeah.

577
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Yeah.

578
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It would be like you have to be this tall to be on.

579
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Anyway that's my memory of them.

580
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I may be wrong but maybe twisted but I was you know the laser loop was of a laser was

581
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,000
like it was a test of you know you had to be a certain height.

582
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I think you had to be maybe a certain age but I think I'm wrong about that.

583
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
But like an American citizen.

584
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Two older brothers.

585
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
You had to sign your life away.

586
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I had two older brothers who were just like yeah man I'm sick of Kennywood.

587
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I just hit the laser loop.

588
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And that though the laser loop actually sorry my bad was the first it was like an 80s roller

589
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
coaster but it was like the newest thing I think we had.

590
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It wasn't yet that kind of like smooth roll.

591
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
But it just shot out.

592
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
You shot out and they were like put your neck back put your head back like because it makes

593
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
you have whiplash basically when you take off you're like spring loaded.

594
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So you go and you go super fast like this takeoff.

595
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Then you have one loop and then you go straight up this hill and then backwards through and

596
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
then backwards again through the same loop up another hill and then it stops you.

597
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:23,000
And it would be perpetually broken because like that is just a hydraulic nightmare.

598
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Like there's no there's no it's like force it up the thing and then force it back and

599
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
then force it to stop instead of like regular roller coasters which are like have one thing

600
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
and then you let it go and it kind of just does its thing you know.

601
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
So it was constantly it was constantly worked on and like but it was pretty exciting.

602
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
It was pretty exciting to go on.

603
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
The Thunderbolt was another like you know I'm old enough to go on the Thunderbolt.

604
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm old enough to go on the laser loop now.

605
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Now I'm a man and I've lived my life and now I die.

606
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Now the laser loop gives me a headache and yeah that's the that was that that was my story.

607
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Sorry were you ever like afraid of the ride before.

608
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Were you scared.

609
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
The three of us are scared boys.

610
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Yeah.

611
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I mean like sure but were you like just raring to go or I was afraid of it.

612
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Once I went on like one roller coaster I think I was ready for the Thunderbolt.

613
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I was like I rode it was like fully ready for that and I think I went to Disney World

614
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:29,000
before that and rode Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and was not old enough for Space Mountain

615
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
perhaps or no maybe I rode Space Mountain.

616
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I rode Space Mountain and then I was like I can do the laser loop.

617
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
The laser loops more insane than Space Mountain.

618
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Yeah for sure.

619
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
The laser loop feels like you're going to die.

620
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Space Mountain is pretty chill.

621
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
The fun you get with these local parks is like the possibility that you might die because

622
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
of operator error.

623
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Yeah.

624
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Because the thing just collapses under you.

625
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Yeah.

626
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
The thing you don't fear as at Disney as much although there have been a lot of Disney deaths

627
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
over the years.

628
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Yeah right.

629
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Stuff's gotten a lot safer and I know you guys from Jersey Action Park.

630
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Oh Traction Park.

631
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Traction Park.

632
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Traction Park.

633
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I've seen pictures and I think I watched like a little mini documentary about it and it

634
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
was like insane.

635
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Yeah people were constantly being injured or dying at this park and it closed for a while.

636
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It was like water slides.

637
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
It was like weirdly hybrid.

638
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
It wasn't coasters right?

639
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I don't know if there were coasters.

640
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
There was water slides and every now and then they'd be like we have a brand new kind of

641
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
slide and it clearly hadn't been tested enough.

642
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
It was like we put a jump on a hill.

643
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And it's like we've got go karts.

644
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
The fastest go karts and no helmets.

645
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It's just like stuff set up for disaster.

646
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
We figured out how to make water slipperier.

647
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
We waxed up this jump.

648
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
It's just a gap between parts of the slide tracks.

649
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You have to like skip part of the, just shoot over a missing piece.

650
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Even a great adventure in New Jersey like the Six Flags Park has had like tons of incidents

651
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
over the years.

652
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And I also, I think we brought it up on another episode talking about like great adventure.

653
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Like yeah they had a lot of crazy coasters where yeah maybe it goes backwards or maybe

654
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
it just goes really fast or really high and every time you add an extra element like that

655
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
there's tons more maintenance you have to do.

656
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I forgot to mention Six Flags Great Adventure right next door to the main park has a safari

657
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
park where you would drive your car through and wild animals roam around.

658
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And often time orangutans or monkeys of some sort will just beat up your car.

659
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
They'll just snap off the etc.

660
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Break the glass.

661
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I think eventually they put up more gates between the people and animals.

662
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,000
But yeah so on top of like the accident prone roller coasters there was also wild animals

663
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
in a very cold part of the country for much of the year.

664
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,000
So much of frost, if you flew off a ride and then landed in a pen with a bunch of frost

665
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
bitten orangutans and rhinoceroses to stomp your face.

666
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I would imagine that the pitch for the park would just like hey it's like a zoo but you

667
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
can drive your car through it.

668
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
You can just.

669
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I mean I think there were a lot of those across the country for a while.

670
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
There was one in Irvine for a long time.

671
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Really?

672
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I think that's where the most famous concert venue is now.

673
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
You can just drive your car through a bunch of monkeys?

674
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yeah.

675
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Wow.

676
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
You can run over them if you want.

677
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
You can kill two animals not three.

678
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
That's where it crosses the line.

679
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
We can breed new ones.

680
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I remember in this country when you could kill three animals.

681
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
What's happening to the America that I know?

682
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
It's very hard to kill even one.

683
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
All I can kill is like crickets and shit.

684
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Those ain't animals.

685
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
They're too small to be animals.

686
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Basically worms.

687
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I feel like if it was 60 years ago and you went to Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge which

688
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
is their animal themed like hotel where you see giraffes out the window.

689
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Walk up to your window.

690
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
60 years ago you could shoot them probably.

691
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
60 years ago they would have let you brought a gun in and killed the animals.

692
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Yeah.

693
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Because it was lola.

694
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Everything was lola.

695
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
They give you $5.

696
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
We're like hey they're helping us out.

697
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Because they shot.

698
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Take one of those snowman machines and wrap a wire around a giraffe's neck.

699
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Oh man the snowman machine.

700
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Got a snowman reference in.

701
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Gave you all the clues.

702
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Gave you Mr. Police.

703
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Mr. Police.

704
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Gave you all clues.

705
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Where's the ride about the snowman?

706
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Where's the snowman haunted house?

707
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Yeah I want a Universal Studios ride like the snowman.

708
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You just get garrotted like 40 times.

709
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Come on kids.

710
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Next year Halloween Horror Nights.

711
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
What's the term?

712
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Garrotted?

713
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,000
We're going to wait in line to get our picture with Detective Inspector Harry Holley.

714
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Is it Harry?

715
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Is it Holley?

716
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It is Holley.

717
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
It might just be Holley.

718
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I think they don't even do an accent.

719
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I've read one of those books and I feel like that is a gag in all of the books.

720
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Where he meets an American or an Australian and they go like your last name's Holley.

721
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
And he's like well it's Holley.

722
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
But then they go like alright whatever.

723
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I think they dropped it in the film.

724
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Maybe they dropped it.

725
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Maybe it's just Harry Holley.

726
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Was that one of the clues they gave?

727
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Yeah.

728
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Keep going down the rabbit hole of clues.

729
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Let's talk about an attraction that is not a death defying attraction that's appropriate

730
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
for all ages.

731
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
The Noah's Ark.

732
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Right.

733
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Do you guys come across this in any Hollywood findings?

734
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,000
This is basically like a fun house that is teetering back and forth at all times.

735
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
There's one part that's teetering.

736
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
That's the ark.

737
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
To get onto the ark you walk into a whale's mouth.

738
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
So it starts with Jonah.

739
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
As all fun experiences do.

740
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Yes.

741
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
We begin with Jonah.

742
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Your favorite CCD characters.

743
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And then the tongue is bouncy.

744
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And then you walk into the thing and then you're in a little I think a mountain kind of thing.

745
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And then you make the transfer to being on Noah's Ark which sways back and forth and

746
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:22,000
has shaking floors and chicken wire enclosed dioramas of just kind of animals that look

747
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
kind of dumb.

748
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
It's trying to scare you a little bit.

749
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
But it's more like it's a challenging floor to walk across or whatever.

750
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
It's vibrating.

751
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
It's child's play is what it is.

752
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
It's a dark walk.

753
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
And then they have one of those things where I think you walk on a bridge and everything

754
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
around you is turning.

755
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
So you're walking straight on a bridge but everything is through a big cylinder.

756
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
So that's turning and you just kind of like you feel weird.

757
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And then on the outside it's very adorable.

758
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I think it was like from the 1930s or something like that.

759
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
They were like Noah's Ark something we all can enjoy.

760
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Something from the Old Testament.

761
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
What do you got over there Mike?

762
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I think this is where I looked up Noah's Ark and it was like is this Noah?

763
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
That's Noah.

764
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
His head pops out of the window.

765
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
His head pops out of the window and it's just a headless toothless man.

766
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I think that's unless that's an accident.

767
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
He looks like a funny crazy man.

768
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
He's like raaa.

769
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Noah was insane.

770
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Yeah Noah that's not my Noah.

771
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Who knows that Noah wasn't terrifying.

772
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
That's a good point.

773
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
He had to build that thing 40 cubits long.

774
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
20 cubits wide as far as I know.

775
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
That's a lot of work.

776
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
That'll be crazy.

777
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
A lot of stress and what a boss riding him.

778
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
The big man up the stairs with himself.

779
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Yeah that's his boss so maybe he's not so happy go lucky.

780
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
My job ain't exactly chill.

781
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I'm not a work at home computer technician or nothing.

782
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
It's hard okay.

783
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
They just redid Noah's Ark.

784
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
They just cleaned it up.

785
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
They just redid it and refurbished it like a few years ago I was reading.

786
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
They did indeed.

787
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And it was a big The Mayor came.

788
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Well that movie Noah came out so they made it Noah.

789
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Oh yeah.

790
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I mean America loved that movie Noah.

791
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
That was a huge movie.

792
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
So much water effects.

793
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Oh man Crowe Connolly you kidding me.

794
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
The beautiful mind pairing back together.

795
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Oh really oh it is that's right.

796
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I didn't realize that.

797
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It was a reunion.

798
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
It was cool that they got that.

799
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Just thinking of them on set.

800
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
There was so much gossip about that set.

801
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I know.

802
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Have they have they have they remit yet.

803
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Are the old sparks flying like they used to be in ABM days.

804
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Aronofsky you're crazy for this one.

805
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I like to watch Noah and then watch Passion of the Christ.

806
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Caviezel.

807
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Oh yeah.

808
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Just get Catholic.

809
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

810
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
But I like that you watch them in biblical order.

811
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Yeah that's what I'm talking about.

812
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

813
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Somebody let's get an Abraham movie going.

814
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Let's get a Cain and Abel.

815
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
There's so many franchise.

816
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
When are we going to get to all the great.

817
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Cain and Abel is more of a sketch.

818
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Probably couldn't sustain.

819
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
It's a three-pillar comic.

820
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Or maybe a limited run like a little three episode FX miniseries.

821
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Or you have them solve mysteries in the Bible times.

822
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
The Cardi boys it's Cain and Abel.

823
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Gender flop them as well.

824
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Why aren't they women?

825
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

826
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Cain's a cool name for a lady and so is Abel.

827
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Yeah.

828
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
God damn it.

829
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Why not flip the scripture.

830
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Jesus Christ.

831
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
That's the tagline of Cain and Abel.

832
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
The new adventures of Cain and Abel.

833
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Flip the scripture.

834
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
You know flip the scripture.

835
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Directed by Mel Gibson still.

836
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,000
You know John I know you just went back to Pittsburgh.

837
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
You were part of this opening of an improv theater.

838
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And you were hobnobbing with the big local stars of Pittsburgh.

839
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,000
And I was on the Kennywood YouTube channel watching the rededication of Noah's Ark.

840
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And who should be there.

841
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
But two people I remember you mentioning to me.

842
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Local broadcaster Rick Seback.

843
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Rick Seback.

844
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And Pittsburgh legend.

845
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
And Pittsburgh dad.

846
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Pittsburgh dad yes.

847
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Local character Pittsburgh dad.

848
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Oh it's Pittsburgh dad.

849
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I met Rick Seback.

850
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Well Rick Seback is a Pittsburgh legend kind of like he's the spiritual heir to like Mr. Roger.

851
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Fred Rogers.

852
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
And was friends with him.

853
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
And is kind of like does a show called Things That Aren't There Anymore.

854
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And it's like on PBS.

855
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I think that's National.

856
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Oh he does.

857
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I know.

858
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Show.

859
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
And he does like he's like basically a Pittsburgh.

860
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
He's among along the lines of Hewlhouser.

861
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,000
And he did kind of we did an Ascat style show.

862
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Which is a show where somebody did his monologues and we do improv.

863
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And so he did the monologues and he was so great.

864
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
No kidding.

865
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
That's cool.

866
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
That's really cool.

867
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
And then Pittsburgh dad is the best.

868
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
And he invited me to be in one of his Pittsburgh dad videos which are huge.

869
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And he said like all the Steelers and whatever like he's hilarious.

870
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Kurt Wooten.

871
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And those like he does like a response video to every Steelers game you know.

872
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Win or loss.

873
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And he's kind of like what was that daughter.

874
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Just talking smack on like he just talked smack in his video.

875
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
So it was funny when I got to do like a Pittsburgh accent.

876
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
That's so fun.

877
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
If you watch at the opening ceremony he plays Noah.

878
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
He like tells stories.

879
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
He's Pittsburgh dad as Noah.

880
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Oh that's great.

881
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Yeah.

882
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
So I was glad I knew about these Pittsburgh things so I could recognize all the Pittsburgh

883
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
stars.

884
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
What I'm thinking though is that you're now you're getting down with the with the local

885
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
with the Pittsburgh celebrities.

886
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I want to if there's any way to use this podcast to get the red carpet rolled out for you John

887
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Daly the next time you go to Kenny would I don't know is there is there like a oh right

888
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
is there anything you would want to do if you want to read it as a king.

889
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I want to roll up to Kenny would in a Uber X.

890
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Not even black.

891
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
You're doing very reasonable.

892
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Yeah.

893
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
With the with the red carpet rolled out with Kenny on the carpet the mayor of Pittsburgh

894
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
declaring it John Daly Day.

895
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Give me the key to the city which I toss in my fanny pack.

896
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:23,000
And I'm fully dressed like a cartoon tourist and I kind of breeze by everyone who's trying

897
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
to shake my hand.

898
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Don't got time.

899
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I'm fixing my hair while I'm doing it and like a see ya.

900
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,000
And then you're ignoring Pittsburgh Steelers and pirates who have come this occasion.

901
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Kent DeColby weeps one tear also at this Noah's Ark.

902
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I have him in my notes Colby and to Colby.

903
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Yeah.

904
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
He shot the through sidearm through those curveballs.

905
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
He won.

906
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:57,000
He was part of the We Are Family Willie Stargell type of see pirates win the World Series one

907
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
of the rare World Series wins.

908
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Sure.

909
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
He didn't he didn't get in that arm on you.

910
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
You deny him.

911
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
No I was like yeah.

912
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Peace.

913
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Well I would.

914
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
This is my fantasy.

915
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Peace.

916
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I just stroll right up.

917
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I'm skipping Noah's Ark.

918
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
You know I got to memorize probably.

919
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
So I'm going straight for I'll start with the classic.

920
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Let's do the Thunderbolt.

921
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Let's get right in there.

922
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
My first you know that's the first coaster of the day.

923
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Do the Thunderbolt.

924
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I get to ride in the front next to your accelerometer next to trying the whole life to.

925
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,000
And you know what tricks physics I breeze by everybody there.

926
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I breeze by Albie Ochsenrider.

927
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I breeze by John Fedko.

928
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I breeze by Cindy Crosby.

929
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And then if it's Italian day do you breeze by Mr. S the Sinatra impersonator.

930
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Sure.

931
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Italian day.

932
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Yep.

933
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
And then I find for Mr. S.

934
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I greet and do an air kiss with Sally Wiggin local broadcaster Sally Wiggin.

935
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And we breeze and she is my seat partner and we start talking about.

936
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Everything Pittsburgh we just talk about Pittsburgh all day.

937
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:08,000
And so me and Sally Wiggin just ride and then of course we when we ride the racer which is a side by side coaster.

938
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
We are both in the front.

939
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
She can be in the red and I can be in the blue.

940
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:18,000
But other than that we're riding the cars you know and so and then after so we do that then we do the double racer.

941
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Then we would do there's a then we would look at but not do decide not to do the thing that brings you up.

942
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Your feet are hanging.

943
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
It brings you up like three hundred feet into the air and just you hang there.

944
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
You know I'm talking about it brings you up into the air and you're like in the sitting position.

945
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:44,000
But you're you're like open and it just it's a big pole basically like three hundred feet in the air and it lets you hang there and it drops you.

946
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
And you feel weightless and it is.

947
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Yeah.

948
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:54,000
The amount of time that they have designed the amount of time at the top to be maximum human fear.

949
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:03,000
You're like just like when you get it and then exactly what it should happen you're like.

950
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
So I hate that.

951
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
And so bypass that.

952
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I think there's there was a steel fan and which got like I think like there were like seven deaths or something like that.

953
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I kind of made that up but now there's the phantoms revenge which is a terrible name for this family.

954
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
It's like and then we'll go on that which I've heard is great.

955
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I haven't been on that's brand new.

956
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
And then you know we'll just hit we'll funnel cake it up.

957
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Oh boy.

958
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Get a get a nice funnel cake get some pierogies.

959
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:41,000
It's very Pittsburgh still and I want to think that Kenny would is still hasn't been kind of like bought by Disney and commodified in some way.

960
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:47,000
And it's still just because it did feel up to high school like oh man this is so local in the best way.

961
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,000
You know it was all like local businesses and stuff kind of like had shops there at the most.

962
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,000
And then there was also like the old mill which is a watch.

963
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I check out the old mill and that's like a dark boat ride.

964
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Yeah that is like out of the like it could be in someone's house.

965
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I don't want to I don't want to trip you up here but you know it was a horny ride.

966
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Become of though really kind of a tunnel of love situation. Oh yeah. Is that the one we were taught is that did that be this is saying what is become.

967
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Great Garfield's nightmare.

968
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,000
That's what this is now with this this classic old mill ride is now Garfield's nightmare.

969
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Day glow.

970
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Black light.

971
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
You want to expect I'm just there's no sound.

972
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I just want to play this video while we talk about it so we can all picture Garfield's nightmare.

973
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
All right.

974
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I have the official website description here Garfield America's favorite fat cat definitely lives here and he's having a nightmare created in bright fluorescent colors all seen under black light.

975
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:56,000
This 3D experience provides a fun and colorful trip through Garfield's world turned completely upside down.

976
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Oh what everyone wants. Yeah.

977
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:04,000
So this is a video of a very great footage.

978
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Oh my gosh.

979
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
So just just so we can picture it.

980
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Don't get too upset.

981
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Home.

982
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Oh yeah.

983
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Well it's a nightmare.

984
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
So you're driving Pepsi advertisement.

985
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Pepsi and Ruffles logos in it and you're just driving by screens with Garfield.

986
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:27,000
You're driving by full three panel Garfield cartoons painted day glow and then monsters start.

987
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
It must have taken me minutes to choose this trip.

988
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
There's Garfield's home a lot of like it looks like knockoff.

989
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
It looks like third party like knockoff knockoff pictures of Garfield.

990
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Yeah.

991
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Like Jim Davis could be bothered to draw them.

992
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
They'd be airbrushed on a t-shirt.

993
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Jim Davis is raking in cash from this.

994
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
This looks like they've just like subverted doing the rights to it.

995
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
They were just like all right let's just figure it out if they complain.

996
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,000
The voice which we are not listening to does not sound like on brand Lorenzo music.

997
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
It sounds like they got close ish.

998
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Yeah it's not it's not that far off.

999
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Yeah.

1000
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
But you're just passing by like regulars.

1001
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
They're kind of on the scarier end of Garfield comics but not really.

1002
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Look at this though.

1003
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
That's a menacing dog.

1004
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Right.

1005
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
But that's not like a Garfield thing.

1006
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Not particularly.

1007
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
What's funny is like Garfield's nightmare.

1008
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Garfield's nightmare is just like regular Garfield comic strips.

1009
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Like that's the horror.

1010
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Yeah.

1011
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
There's a big spider though.

1012
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Well no that's a big spider.

1013
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Garfield's afraid of big spiders like any of us would be.

1014
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Yeah I mean of course because a big theme in Garfield is like terror.

1015
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Like.

1016
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Yeah famously.

1017
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
It's trying to scare you.

1018
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Garfield.

1019
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It's all about John's fear of.

1020
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Dying alone.

1021
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Loneliness.

1022
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Yeah yeah dating anxiety.

1023
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
That's really what the ultimate nightmare of Garfield is.

1024
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Yeah John the blank man's non-person.

1025
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Am I going to be alone just because I'm so boring.

1026
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
It's a fish eating Garfield.

1027
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Getting eaten by a fish that's the best thing so far and the most 3D thing as well.

1028
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
And now there's.

1029
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Oh and then you get a little break so it's a strip.

1030
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
That's funny it makes you giggle and then it's a scare where Garfield's getting eaten by a fish.

1031
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
You don't know if you're laughing or screaming at any moment in this ride.

1032
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
And you don't know whether you're seeing a beaker in a test tube or a bag of Fritos.

1033
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Uh oh.

1034
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Pull up this ride at home if you guys are listening.

1035
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Yeah nurse with a giant needle.

1036
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Oh and Odie's butt fucking him.

1037
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Sorry.

1038
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
And then more like.

1039
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
He's getting butt fucked by Odie.

1040
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Odie's still dumb.

1041
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Stuck his tongue up his butt.

1042
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
That would be Garfield's nightmare though.

1043
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
No.

1044
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Odie is dominant over me.

1045
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Giant Lichtenstein-esque panels that you're just constantly floating by.

1046
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Wait that's a pizza.

1047
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
They missed an opportunity to have a lasagna.

1048
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Are you joking?

1049
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
There's like no lasagna in this ride.

1050
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I'm not a fan.

1051
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
One of these rooms should just be empty lasagna platters.

1052
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Like oh no there's no more lasagna.

1053
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
But it's not.

1054
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I don't like Jim Davis.

1055
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Is he still alive cranking out this crap?

1056
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I'm not sure if there's still new ones but he's alive.

1057
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I think there are new ones but who knows if he's really.

1058
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
It's like a generator.

1059
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Yeah right.

1060
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
He has his nephew just go like.

1061
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Bust out some scripts.

1062
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
His brain's been uploaded to a computer like Stephen Hawking.

1063
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
And he sort of like waves his fingers.

1064
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
He doesn't have the issues that Stephen Hawking has.

1065
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
He's just lazy.

1066
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Like Garfield.

1067
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
He weighs 500 pounds.

1068
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Connected to machines.

1069
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
More breakfast lasagna please.

1070
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Two minutes more of this.

1071
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Good god.

1072
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
What a fun ride.

1073
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Cat Stew.

1074
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
That's Garfield's nightmare.

1075
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
This other Garfield's nightmare is they're making him a cat stew.

1076
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
A bunch of mice with salt and pepper.

1077
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Oh my god it's John's on again off again girlfriend at the end of the ride.

1078
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Arlene is her name.

1079
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
No that's Arlene is Garfield's girlfriend.

1080
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Oh you're right the sexy cat.

1081
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Yeah the sexy cat.

1082
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
That made me horny when I was a kid.

1083
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Arlene cat looks good.

1084
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
There's no Nermal though.

1085
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
No Nermal.

1086
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
No Nermal.

1087
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
No Nermal's dumb right.

1088
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Nermal was nice I think.

1089
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Insufferably cute.

1090
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Yeah and Garfield wanted to get rid of Nermal.

1091
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Yeah I get Garfield's frustration.

1092
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Yeah we can all relate.

1093
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I think that's why Garfield's Nightmare is so why we can all relate to it.

1094
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Let me ask you is that better than the original ride?

1095
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
The old mill.

1096
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Is that what the old mill and Kennywood is now?

1097
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Yes the old mill is that.

1098
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Oh I didn't realize that that was the old mill.

1099
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
They just ripped the old mill.

1100
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
They just sent you to the old mill.

1101
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Well I would go on that I mean the old mill was like again chicken wire and then like out in this yard of the ride there would be like a pirate you know like a treasure thing and.

1102
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Pirate treasure with like skeletons all over it and so it was not good.

1103
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Sounds like that's better.

1104
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Yeah no that I think it's better.

1105
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Yeah it would it would be it's a little trippier I guess there's more attention to detail.

1106
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Yeah it's kind of a psychedelic ride actually.

1107
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:06,000
It's in the small genre of psychedelic rides like the we were just talking the other day about the what's that whiter shade of pale.

1108
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
No what is that?

1109
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Knights and Whites.

1110
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Not whiter yeah Knights and Whites sat in the ride.

1111
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Knights and Whites sat in the ride.

1112
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
There's a ride of Knights and Whites sat in the ride.

1113
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Are you joking?

1114
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
No but there was.

1115
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
There was.

1116
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
There used to be.

1117
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
My god.

1118
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Hard Rock theme park in South Carolina.

1119
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Freedom Rock Park.

1120
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
In Myrtle Beach.

1121
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,000
There was if you can believe that there was a Hard Rock themed park in Myrtle Beach.

1122
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
There was a Zeppelin coaster right.

1123
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
There was a ride called Led Zeppelin the ride.

1124
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Wow that's when rock was king.

1125
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Yeah.

1126
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
That's cool now it's superheroes.

1127
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Uh huh.

1128
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
That's so much cooler that it was like sleazebags.

1129
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Captain America is our new.

1130
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Robert Plant.

1131
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Yeah yeah.

1132
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Jimmy Page.

1133
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Yeah.

1134
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Well so yeah maybe this ride's an improvement.

1135
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Congrats everyone involved in Garfield's Nightmare.

1136
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Yeah.

1137
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
You made something terrifying and.

1138
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
You fucked it up.

1139
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
But it's probably better.

1140
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Can I also say there's a part in the voiceover you can hear Garfield say towards the beginning of the ride when they're letting you.

1141
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:13,000
They're getting you into it in the expository that he ate Garfield ate too much he says I never met an ice cream truck I didn't like or lick.

1142
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
That's really dumb.

1143
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Very.

1144
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
But he knows what ice cream trucks are.

1145
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
That's infuriating.

1146
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Jim Davis had a butt plug in when he wrote that.

1147
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
It was vibrating.

1148
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
He was like oh I gotta finish this for Sunday.

1149
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
His life is just pure debauchery.

1150
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
He's got like a dungeon.

1151
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
People are feeding him grapes.

1152
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
He has a sex plane.

1153
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Yeah.

1154
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
The presidents go on.

1155
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
He's got an island.

1156
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Yeah.

1157
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Jim Davis island.

1158
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Well what else what have we not covered in Kennywood World.

1159
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:54,000
It seems like there's stuff I was reading and I think you haven't been back so like did they have a thing where you could buy like a Vegas cabana in the park.

1160
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Yeah.

1161
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
That might have been like an early 20th century thing.

1162
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,000
It says make a great day Kennywood even better and they call them cabanas and they're with a K instead of a C.

1163
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
With a Kenny.

1164
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
So that's a new thing my bad.

1165
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
What is it exactly you get a cabana.

1166
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,000
It's basically you just get a picnic bench with shade and it's seventy five dollars.

1167
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
But they didn't do this.

1168
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
This isn't a newer thing.

1169
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
That's like a VIP table you're playing.

1170
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Yeah right.

1171
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Bottle service.

1172
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Exactly.

1173
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
But Kennywood a candy service.

1174
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
You get a beautiful cake goo.

1175
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
And you get a beautiful view of Pedro's taco stand here.

1176
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Yeah.

1177
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Website.

1178
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
They're trying to make it sexy to adults.

1179
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Yeah.

1180
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
That's what well actually you know what that is.

1181
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
That's just like so you can let your kids run around and you pay seventy five dollars to be in the shade all day.

1182
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Yeah.

1183
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
So that makes sense.

1184
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
OK.

1185
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
But that's newer.

1186
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
You didn't have that back in the old days.

1187
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
That is newer.

1188
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Yeah.

1189
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
As far as I know.

1190
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Another new attraction that says new in 2008.

1191
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Ghostwood Estate this eight room haunted house in Pennsylvania replaces the Gold Rush.

1192
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Guests are armed with blasters which provide guests the opportunity to compete with each other in vehicles by targeting haunted characters throughout the estate.

1193
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Now I like the idea they built like a ghost busting a public domain style ghost busting ride.

1194
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:17,000
But to me the like Ghostwood Estate sounds like you're fighting like you know the ghost woods the reviled family of Pennsylvania robber barons.

1195
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Oh my God.

1196
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
The ghost woods.

1197
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
It's a good name.

1198
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Yeah.

1199
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:28,000
So Ghostwood Estate and I guess it's modeled after like the big old you know so railroad barons or the Melons or stuff.

1200
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
That's funny.

1201
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
The big old mansion.

1202
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
I love it.

1203
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
That's what I would get.

1204
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
It's like it made it sound like a haunted house.

1205
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
It's like the Fricks or the Carnegie's.

1206
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Yeah.

1207
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Yeah.

1208
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Well that's cool.

1209
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
That's lovely.

1210
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:45,000
And the Gold Rush I remember now that you mentioned that that so that was like I think you got into cars for that but it was a dark ride that you.

1211
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Yeah.

1212
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
There was it was like a dark ride that was like two floors but there was one thrill.

1213
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I think you like go like you take a big dip and it's like there was one thrill.

1214
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
There was one like drop or something and it was like oh man the drop.

1215
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:04,000
But then yeah it was one of those rides where you were like this was fun in 1945.

1216
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Was it about the Gold Rush.

1217
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Was it like we got to get to this mine.

1218
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
It was a mine.

1219
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
OK.

1220
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Yeah it was a mine.

1221
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:19,000
So you're in a little car and you walked around and then they were all just like hey I'm a 49er.

1222
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:25,000
There's one one new arrival in the recent past to Kennywood.

1223
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:33,000
And by that I mean I eating parasites very recently on the ride Raging Rapids.

1224
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
You're going raging rap.

1225
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Oh sure.

1226
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
That was a big deal when that happened.

1227
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
OK.

1228
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

1229
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I love those rapids rides but apparently somebody got splashed in the eye and he went back and is suing them claiming that he got an eye eating parasite.

1230
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Oh man.

1231
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I don't know if his eyes were entirely eaten or only partially eaten or only the important parts the corneas and the lids.

1232
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I don't know which part of his eyes.

1233
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,000
What is fascinating about this is that like Disneyland just had an outbreak of Legionnaires disease.

1234
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Right.

1235
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,000
We're like why are theme parks these these ancient diseases are like these.

1236
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
You don't hear about it anywhere else except like they're festering in theme parks.

1237
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
And Chipotle.

1238
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Anywhere with standing water.

1239
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Why is Chipotle compulsively like.

1240
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Getting different.

1241
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
It's crazy.

1242
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Like with thought extinct diseases.

1243
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Yeah.

1244
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
80 year old disease.

1245
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
They're bringing stuff back.

1246
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
From the days of Salk.

1247
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
You can get polio from their boy.

1248
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Oh.

1249
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
These lines I'm saying today.

1250
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I'm weighing it on thick.

1251
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
This is good.

1252
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Awful.

1253
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I mean anyway watch.

1254
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Oh thanks.

1255
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I can think of two words that sound similar.

1256
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,000
So yeah the eye eating parasites.

1257
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Watch out for those.

1258
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
What are the two words.

1259
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
What's that.

1260
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
That sounds similar.

1261
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Polio and poyo is what I was saying.

1262
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Oh so that's what you did.

1263
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I thought of two words that sounded similar.

1264
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I thought you were saying sounded similar to killing it.

1265
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
And I was like thrilling shit.

1266
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Oh no that too.

1267
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Yeah man.

1268
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
I'm killing it.

1269
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
I'm thrilling shit.

1270
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Thrilling shit is the new extreme Kenny Woods slogan.

1271
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Thrilling shit my man.

1272
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
The other amusement park too in Pittsburgh.

1273
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Is Sandcastle.

1274
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Which is water slides.

1275
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Oh right right.

1276
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Owned by Kenny Wood as well I believe.

1277
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Is that right.

1278
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
They're related.

1279
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

1280
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Last time I did the kind of water slides where you have to sit on your back like you're in

1281
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
a coffin and go down and it feels very hardcore.

1282
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
And you're like damn that hurt my body.

1283
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
First water slides that truly hurt.

1284
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
There were a drop slide I guess I'm guessing.

1285
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Because those hurt.

1286
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Like where they pull the floor out.

1287
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
The super vertical.

1288
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Oh okay.

1289
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Did they pull the floor out.

1290
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
That wasn't a drop slide then.

1291
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I think it's just like a huge deep drop slide.

1292
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Do you know what I mean where like you sit there and there's like a floor and then they

1293
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
pull it out.

1294
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
That's what I thought I was saying.

1295
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I was saying yeah.

1296
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Oh.

1297
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
There's like drop slides where there's literally the slide just ends and you just get dumped

1298
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
in the water.

1299
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Though those I don't think those hurt as bad as the ones that slide you.

1300
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I think you're talking about ones that you literally end up.

1301
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:16,000
This is like a 1200 foot freaking gigantic thing and you just like go down and you eventually

1302
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
are just like your feet are hitting the water and it just kind of hurts.

1303
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
And you have to cross your legs or else it'll go up into your crotch and stuff.

1304
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
It's like that Blizzard Beach thing.

1305
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Yeah yeah.

1306
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
That big slide.

1307
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I know what you mean.

1308
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I mean they always were like dude I'm going to jump off.

1309
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:36,000
And then there was like always a legend like no some dude jumped off and he broke his finger

1310
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:41,000
and he lost all of his teeth and he had to go to the hospital but he was OK or someone

1311
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
of those little kids.

1312
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Like the very specific thing that kids remember happened.

1313
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
And there's yeah.

1314
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
So that was the other one.

1315
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,000
And did you ever go to any of these other eight opens the can of worms I guess.

1316
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Yeah.

1317
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Yeah.

1318
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
A ton of theme parks in Pennsylvania.

1319
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
You ever go to do Hershey Park.

1320
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Did Hershey Park.

1321
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Yes.

1322
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Oh yeah.

1323
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Hershey Park.

1324
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Yeah.

1325
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
And that is two hours away maybe.

1326
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Yeah something like that.

1327
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,000
And the main memory there was there was it was like a rainy day.

1328
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Yeah.

1329
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,000
So it's like I think I as a kid I was like Hershey Park is sad.

1330
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
But just because it was a rainy day.

1331
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
It always rained there.

1332
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:29,000
But we went on some I remember going on a janky oh man and I f***ing hate these rides.

1333
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
What are they.

1334
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
The things where you're leaning up against the wall and they spin and the floor drops

1335
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
out.

1336
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Oh more like a Gravitron.

1337
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
This was called a ROTOR.

1338
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
It was the ROTOR.

1339
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
And so you go and the floor would drop out on you.

1340
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Like it wasn't a Gravitron it was more hardcore.

1341
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
It was more like organized or something.

1342
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I'm like floor drops out and it was just like no.

1343
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:54,000
And it made me feel and to this day like if it's a spinning like G-Force ride it just

1344
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
makes me I'm just like I won't do it anymore.

1345
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Like it's it's there's no fun.

1346
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Yeah.

1347
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:07,000
But then we went on some like like even the Coney Island even you know that roller coaster

1348
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,000
that's not the cyclone that's just like it's called like the rat trap or the mouse trap.

1349
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:17,000
And it's like got two thin ass like rails and it just like seems so dangerous.

1350
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Does it feel like you're going to go off the track?

1351
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Yeah.

1352
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,000
And the roller coaster kind of goes and like actually kind of like goes off the track a

1353
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
couple of times.

1354
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
That's a style of coaster.

1355
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Yeah.

1356
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
It's really weird.

1357
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Right.

1358
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
It's like really dangerous style.

1359
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Yeah.

1360
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I I rode one in South Jersey and then the next the day after I rode it someone died on one

1361
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,000
like right with less than 24 hour and it was like because whatever brake mechanism failed

1362
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
or whatever.

1363
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,500
And they're already very unnerving because like yeah you get to a turn and it turns last

1364
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,840
minute or yeah tilt you over a little.

1365
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,000
They were designed by carnies.

1366
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Yeah.

1367
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,500
They were designed by mad and operated and maintained by them.

1368
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,500
Yeah.

1369
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:02,400
And then in Hershey Park that is next to a ride where you learn about how chocolate is

1370
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,400
made.

1371
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,400
Right.

1372
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,400
And then the chocolate world.

1373
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,800
And then when on the chocolate world I was going to say that was the main memory with

1374
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:15,400
the chocolate world and seeing the chocolate be dumped from one like robotic ladle arm

1375
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:21,200
and like into another big vat of chocolate and being like oh my god.

1376
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,200
It blew my freaking mind.

1377
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,200
Yeah.

1378
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,200
Look at all that fucking chocolate.

1379
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:30,400
And then at the end of the ride you are given or maybe my parents bought a Hershey bar that

1380
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:35,960
is shaped like the little mini Hershey bars which is in the good bar crackle combo shaped

1381
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:36,960
like that.

1382
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,580
But it is gigantic.

1383
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:44,320
And me and my brothers gnawed on that thing like a cuddle bone for like six years.

1384
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:50,320
I swear to God it was like in the bag of Legos that we had and we would just like get it

1385
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:54,840
out and be like after a while it's not a dessert anymore.

1386
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:57,080
But we were it was like all white and stuff.

1387
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:00,680
Were you worried it would that by the time when you finished it you'd end up kissing

1388
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:03,680
your brother.

1389
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:04,680
Lady and the tramp in it.

1390
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:05,680
Yeah.

1391
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:06,680
Yeah.

1392
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:07,680
We'd get both ends of it.

1393
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,480
Let's not get that down to the bone.

1394
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,720
We made that all the time anyway.

1395
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:11,720
It wasn't a problem.

1396
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:12,720
OK.

1397
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:16,640
When I went as a very young boy I have a distinct memory of like because they give you a free

1398
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:20,240
little candy bar at the end of the ride and stuff and they were giving out I don't remember

1399
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,880
the kind I bet I could look it up online.

1400
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:28,200
It was it was like camouflage on the logo and this was right at the start of Desert

1401
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:36,320
Storm and they're like this is a special chocolate Hershey is made for the soldiers in Iraq to

1402
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:39,160
not and it doesn't melt in the desert heat.

1403
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,160
That's so cool.

1404
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,160
Yeah.

1405
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,160
It was cool.

1406
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,480
And there was also like no line that day.

1407
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:49,720
So we kept going on and just kept eating this desert storm themed chocolate.

1408
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:52,720
Who's that Willy Wonka?

1409
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,720
Norman Schwartz call.

1410
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,320
Oh my God.

1411
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,000
Storm and Norman.

1412
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,480
Let's wind it back to Kenny with two quick things to hit I think before we left everybody

1413
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,080
hanging with whatever this Mickey.

1414
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,080
Oh yeah.

1415
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,080
I don't know what the cliffhanger was.

1416
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:08,640
I'm sure everybody's been thinking about it.

1417
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,640
OK.

1418
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,640
So I have it here.

1419
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:11,640
Let me let me pull it up.

1420
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:12,640
What's the Mickey Dolan's cliffhanger?

1421
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,640
We said something before you came in.

1422
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:15,640
Oh OK.

1423
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:16,640
This is a classic.

1424
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:23,240
So like under the like interesting facts part of the Wikipedia page is a fact singer actor

1425
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:28,760
Mickey Dolan's former drummer for the Monkeys often fondly tells audiences at his live shows

1426
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:32,720
that Kenny would was the location of his first ever public appearance.

1427
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:39,680
He appeared at Kenny would with his elephant in the 1950s when he was known as Circus Boy.

1428
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:40,680
The television.

1429
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:46,040
It was the star of a television show called Circus Boy which featured Mickey as Corky a

1430
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:49,900
boy who grows up on the road in a circus.

1431
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:54,800
And so here is a longer synopsis set in the 1890s.

1432
01:07:54,800 --> 01:08:00,400
The title of the series refers to a boy named Corky after his parents the flying falcons

1433
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,680
were killed in a trapeze accident.

1434
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:08,520
It's the Robin or is there out which is the origin of Dick Grayson.

1435
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:13,520
Corky was adopted by Joey the clown and the whole Burke and Walsh circus family.

1436
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:19,360
The young boy quickly found a role with the circus as water boy to bimbo a baby elephant

1437
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:22,280
whom Corky would come to consider his pet.

1438
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,000
Well first of all I've heard of this.

1439
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,600
This is a boy for two years on NBC and ABC and then in syndication.

1440
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,240
I think we already mentioned this but just in case someone's just tuning in in the middle

1441
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,240
of the podcast.

1442
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:38,640
Mickey Dolan is one of the monkeys which was a band a hundred years ago.

1443
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,560
Which is not the Beach Boys a different band.

1444
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:42,560
Not the Beatles.

1445
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,680
Not Mike Love and Chris Johnson's the Beach Boys.

1446
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:49,400
They made a TV show that was influenced by movies like Help.

1447
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:52,000
Yeah the wacky nonsense.

1448
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
It was wacky nonsense.

1449
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,600
There are a lot of fancy editing tricks.

1450
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:00,800
They sped up and disappeared behind trees and came out the other side of a different

1451
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:01,800
tree.

1452
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,080
If you know what Benny Hill looks like that was every other scene.

1453
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,080
They were running fast.

1454
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:07,080
We're explaining elemental to monkeys.

1455
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,080
And they have great songs.

1456
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,720
Honestly I'm not trying to disparage the monkeys.

1457
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:13,320
And a very good tone is a band and very good.

1458
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:15,960
More credit and should be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

1459
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:20,560
And Circus Boy should be in the circus hall of fame.

1460
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,680
The animal related television show hall of fame.

1461
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:25,760
And should be in the cool dude hall of fame.

1462
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:32,080
I saw him at a Beach Boys there you go again tribute show where he wore one of the coolest

1463
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,280
hats I've ever seen.

1464
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:35,280
What a tale.

1465
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:38,440
That's why I need this podcast to tell great stories like that.

1466
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,680
Well he thought love was only true in fairy tales for a really long time.

1467
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,720
He was under a common misconception.

1468
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,280
Was he ever corrected in that?

1469
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,280
Did anything ever change his feelings on it?

1470
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:49,320
Well he just kind of thought it was for someone else but not for him.

1471
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:51,360
He thought love was out to get him.

1472
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:56,720
People are now confused because they think you're quoting the lyrics from the movie

1473
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:57,720
Shrek.

1474
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:58,720
Oh yeah that's right.

1475
01:09:58,720 --> 01:09:59,720
Oh today.

1476
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,360
Because Smash Mouth has a cover of that.

1477
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:08,080
So most kids now think that's Smash Mouth.

1478
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:13,480
Steve Harwell was not the first guy to become a believer after seeing a face.

1479
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:15,880
I want to say one more thing about Kenny before we wrap it up.

1480
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:21,320
Which is that you taught me the origin that it's a thing in Pittsburgh.

1481
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,680
Kenny Woods open.

1482
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:23,840
Kenny Woods open.

1483
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,720
Hey dude Kenny Woods open.

1484
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:29,760
Which means your fly is open.

1485
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:35,760
So if you and everyone in Pittsburgh knows this who went to elementary school like if

1486
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:36,760
your fly was open.

1487
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:38,960
Kenny was open dude.

1488
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:43,880
And so that was like yeah that was the ritual.

1489
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:48,440
Did you ever have a particularly embarrassing scarring scenario in which your Kenny Woods

1490
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,680
was open?

1491
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:54,680
My yeah.

1492
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:57,000
But it was scarring for everyone else.

1493
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
No that's.

1494
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
No I signed an NDA.

1495
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:08,240
You can't talk about it for legal purposes.

1496
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,440
Well I'm all velcro.

1497
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:11,680
Velcro flies.

1498
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:14,040
Oh that sounds pleasant.

1499
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:18,600
More likely your Kenny Wood would be open with Velcro.

1500
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:23,040
Take some Velcro on the laser loop and see how the physics affect the.

1501
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,040
I know.

1502
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:25,040
The physics.

1503
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,040
Yeah that was my big.

1504
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:27,320
That was my last time.

1505
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,680
That was your science thesis.

1506
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:32,920
How does Velcro keep your Kenny Wood from coming open.

1507
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:37,200
And I had a great I had a great I got to give a shout out.

1508
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,280
Adam Gerson.

1509
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:44,760
My he was my chemistry.

1510
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:47,200
Physics partner I think that he was my physics partner.

1511
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:50,080
Correct me if I'm wrong but correct me if I'm wrong.

1512
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,080
You're wrong John.

1513
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:53,280
Facts of life.

1514
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:59,080
But he did every experiment like and just was actually interested in science and did

1515
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,320
it and just let me copy every single thing.

1516
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,720
He saved me so much grief.

1517
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:05,840
So thank you so much because I was just like hey man can I just.

1518
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,400
He was like oh yeah yeah just copy it all.

1519
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,400
Wow.

1520
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:10,400
Thank you.

1521
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,400
I love this shit.

1522
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:12,400
We're all good boys and rule followers.

1523
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:16,960
We don't like a guy coming in here telling us your academic career is built on lies.

1524
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:25,040
Yeah I mean a whole year of you might have to sneak that I'm not smart in that way.

1525
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:31,280
Well I'm still I'm a proponent of you getting the key to to Pittsburgh or to Kenny Wood.

1526
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:36,080
I want I want I want this Kenny Wood ideal scenario laid out for you and I hope that

1527
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:39,680
your academic malfeasance doesn't prevent that from happening.

1528
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:44,080
Of course I would be of course that was a joke and I would be gracious upon entering

1529
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:48,580
and say thank look into the eye and thank everyone for coming.

1530
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:53,000
If they redo Noah's Ark though I feel like you should be in that opening ceremony maybe.

1531
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,480
I would start it by saying there is no God.

1532
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:01,920
The Bible was written by powerful men to subdue the poor.

1533
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:10,640
Jesus was perhaps a real man but was inflated into something to suppress.

1534
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,140
Start lecturing people.

1535
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:15,800
That being said enjoy the bouncy floor of the whale's dung.

1536
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:16,800
Enjoy the fun.

1537
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:21,320
Now that that's out there everyone have a great time.

1538
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:24,320
We're going to be doing some improv.

1539
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:27,320
Take your picture with the Russell Crowe standee at the end.

1540
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:31,200
And have a dove shaped funnel gig.

1541
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:34,400
You know real quick let me just say also in Kenny Wood memories there's a very bizarre

1542
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:38,720
part where you can watch footage from like the 1930s of people going into Noah's Ark

1543
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:39,720
with the narration.

1544
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:44,480
The entrance walkway was equipped with hidden hoses that would blow air up the women's skirts.

1545
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,480
Oh boy.

1546
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:49,360
Back when Noah's Ark was like a harassment ride.

1547
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:52,920
Yeah man we got to get these women's skirts up man.

1548
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:54,920
What a sleaze ball.

1549
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:55,920
Oh boy.

1550
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:59,840
And then of course the logical part where we blow up women's skirts on the Bible ride.

1551
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,440
No like Noah would want.

1552
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,160
Give a view to those hippos.

1553
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,800
Noah was in an 80's sex comedy.

1554
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:09,560
You know what who knows what Noah was into.

1555
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:15,080
He's into some pre-medieval dark ages coming out of the copper age.

1556
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:21,720
He was probably into some nasty sex with members of his freaking family.

1557
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:28,000
And by the way he got four of some of those so he could have some mistress that was like

1558
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
hippopotamus.

1559
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:35,800
Noah married a tiger when he was 700 and then he's fully passed.

1560
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:38,400
John Daly you have survived podcast the ride.

1564
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,400
Oh wow.

1565
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:43,400
A strong declaration.

1566
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:46,240
I hope you don't say that on all of them.

1567
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:47,240
I'm going to go check.

1568
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,240
I don't.

1569
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:49,480
Hey alright we got it.

1570
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:50,480
That was easy.

1571
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:51,480

Watch my short film Men.

1574
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:02,440
Myself and Gil Ozari made a short film on Super Deluxe.

1575
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:03,440

1576
