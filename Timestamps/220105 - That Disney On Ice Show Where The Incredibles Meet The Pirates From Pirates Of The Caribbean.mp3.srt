1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,980
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

3
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,200
We are new for 2022.

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,720
We're back and what better way to kick it off than with some bullshit I found the other

5
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,720
day.

6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,200
I'm Scott Gardner and happy to be reunited with Jason Sheridan.

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,200
Hi Jason.

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,200
Hi Scott.

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,520
Happy New Year and Happy New Year listeners.

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,640
Omicron Winter, let's go.

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:52,080
Let's get this shit started with what can only be described as an icy fever dream.

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,400
Oh, it was a blast of a Christmas.

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,600
It was so nostalgic.

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,120
We're always so nostalgic for the 90s or maybe even the 2000s like today, but we're never

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,040
nostalgic for March 2020 and it was just great to be back indoors and scared and watching

16
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,000
depressing TV again.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,880
It's such a retro flashback.

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,600
What'd you think Mike Carlson?

19
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,600
I'm here.

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,560
Before we started recording today, I was like, you know what?

21
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,320
You probably shouldn't mention what's going on in the world.

22
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,340
So this is an evergreen episode, but you know what?

23
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,300
Now it's out the window and guess what a time to be alive.

24
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,980
Part three or four, whatever, however you want to count what's happening.

25
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,980
We're going through it.

26
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,980
So yeah, it's fun.

27
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:41,940
Yeah, Scott was saying it's a fun retro vibe we've got going today.

28
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,500
You know, the show, a lot of retro stuff on the show in general, but why does it have

29
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,140
to be 10 years, 20 years?

30
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,220
Why can't it be just maybe a year and a half or two?

31
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,220
It's you know, that's retro.

32
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,780
Remember Jack Box game?

33
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,060
We're playing Jack Box games again.

34
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,940
Do you remember quip lash?

35
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:04,300
You would say funny things and you would write diarrhea in the prompt and then everyone would

36
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,300
laugh.

37
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,300
Watch along.

38
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,300
So watch along.

39
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,300
Watch a movie.

40
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,380
Seconds behind your friends watching the movie, which you think won't be a noticeable difference

41
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,940
until it is very noticeable.

42
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,420
We tried doing this.

43
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,660
We watched, of course, Jay and Silent Bob return.

44
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,660
What was it called?

45
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,660
Rebooted.

46
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,660
Reboot.

47
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,660
The Rej and Silent Bob reboot.

48
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,020
We watched it all together a year and a half ago.

49
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,620
And of course, one of the stars of that movie is featured today in the thing we're going

50
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,180
to be talking about.

51
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,180
I don't think I know.

52
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,180
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

53
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,180
Yeah.

54
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,180
OK, now I got it.

55
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,300
I think cameo in the movie.

56
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,180
I mean, he's not one of the main characters.

57
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,600
I think I showed up at the very end and I don't remember if it was on purpose or not,

58
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,100
but I do remember clicking into the room.

59
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,700
It was essentially credits and being a little like few.

60
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,180
Yeah, you seemed upset at the idea.

61
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,540
And then I think you like, yeah, begrudgingly showed up a little later and then you did

62
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,940
not see any of the film.

63
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,100
But we tried to we tried to tell you what had happened and what was going on.

64
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,540
What happened when you got to the first?

65
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,540
What happened?

66
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,060
Stopped the roadie.

67
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,260
What happened to Holden?

68
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,900
What happened to all the characters that you remember?

69
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:22,380
You know, the waves of covid are kind of like the view of skewniverse coming back.

70
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,260
Like you think it's done.

71
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,020
We all pray that it's done.

72
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:32,060
And then there's a new wave of getting back whatever the main clerk is.

73
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,300
And it's like it never like it never left.

74
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,500
There'll be yes, there'll be some drama between Brian O'Halleran and Kevin and then only come

75
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,700
back for three and he is coming back for three.

76
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,980
Yeah, so I think that is that's coming out right.

77
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,980
The clerks three.

78
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,140
That is real.

79
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,060
So, yeah, so there is another wave of there's another wave of covid.

80
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,100
There's another wave of clerks that's happening right now.

81
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:03,620
So we took we took for a moment classic rock talk off the table and then we're happily

82
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,300
bringing it back. I think that I honestly I think the audience should complain about

83
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,580
view of skewniverse talk.

84
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,980
We haven't seen enough complaints about it.

85
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,860
That's an interesting quote.

86
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,980
Yeah, does the audience.

87
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,180
I'll pose that to the audience.

88
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,100
Is this enough skewniverse talk?

89
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,580
Are you happy with the amount?

90
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,180
Do you want more?

91
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,380
Do you want less?

92
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,300
I'm scared of the answer now.

93
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,100
I don't. Yeah, I'm not sure.

94
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,260
But I look Jason and I were very steeped in the skewniverse for many years when we were

95
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,300
children. I don't know about you, Scott, but we were we were hardcore in the skewniverse.

96
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,580
So I'm wondering if the audience is like us because I do feel like if the audience is

97
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,220
listening to us, they maybe can feel some of the things we like and know.

98
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:49,740
I think I think the audience definitely is like us, as most films are now operating under

99
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,660
view skewniverse shared universe rules.

100
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,980
Well, that's a good point.

101
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,540
That's true. He was he was ahead of the curve.

102
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,340
Yeah, sure. On many things.

103
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:05,940
One thing that I hope that the audience enjoys is talking about weird micro things that

104
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:12,100
happened on Twitter and that were kind of jokes of episodes that are in the process of

105
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,660
becoming real episodes, because that's what this is today.

106
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,540
Here's what happened if you missed the buildup to this.

107
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,500
Basically, well, just really very elemental.

108
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,300
And I'll break I'll break down where I found it and everything.

109
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:32,660
But I ran into a clip from an ice show from what I've now determined is two thousand five,

110
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,020
two thousand six. I'm not sure the exact year, but around then there was apparently

111
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,940
some kind of Disney ice show that culminates in or at least includes Mr.

112
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:48,100
Incredible ripping the bars off of the Pirates of the Caribbean prison and unleashing the

113
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,820
prisoners. And I just came across this image and it was so striking.

114
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
And I felt like I had to do a gif of it.

115
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:59,500
And I just as a joke on Twitter said, hey, guys, would you sign off on doing an episode

116
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,500
about this? And though though there were some sets are related

117
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,140
diversions, there were some bombs.

118
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:14,980
I admit. Yeah, we bought a bit of drop sets or bombs into the into the equation.

119
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,300
Ultimately, we did agree to do this.

120
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:23,420
And I part of why I thought, well, maybe we should actually do this is because the

121
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,420
tweet was responded to well.

122
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,540
And I saw listeners responding, oh, my God, I went to that.

123
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,260
It was so bizarre and confusing.

124
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,340
And when I hear bizarre and confusing, I'm like, check, check.

125
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,220
Seems like something we should do an episode about.

126
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,940
Absolutely. Yeah.

127
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:49,620
I mean, this is well past my regular Disney on Ice attendance.

128
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,220
My family, my dad reminded me like, oh, yeah, we went to a number of Disney on Ice

129
00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:00,060
shows because they were always in Philadelphia the week between Christmas

130
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,500
and New Year's. So, you know, when you look when the kids are out of school and

131
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,020
you're looking for something to occupy them with, that was a good like, oh, here's

132
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,100
a good family outing.

133
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:17,180
I'm assuming they travel with multiple companies so they can pull that gimmick

134
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,700
in multiple cities.

135
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,460
I was going to. Yeah, because all the dates that I'm seeing of when this was in L.A.

136
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,340
or exactly in that run.

137
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:30,660
Yeah, maybe they try to cover that time as best as they can and as many places they

138
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,020
can. So you don't you because there's a broader thing to talk about here, I guess,

139
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,500
which is Disney on Ice shows, which we have not really discussed.

140
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:42,820
So you are a seasoned attendee of Disney on Ice shows, or at least you were.

141
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,980
Yeah, I mean, yeah, we would hit up the, you know, any of the Power Rangers live, of

142
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,020
course, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles coming out of their shells.

143
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,540
There was a Rugrats tour.

144
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,060
Sesame Street live.

145
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,620
I'm sure we would have seen Sesame Street live.

146
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,060
Yeah, we so we loved it.

147
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:07,620
And I think a lot of those, too, they they book shows around like how long weekends

148
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,700
or or the holiday season.

149
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,740
But yeah, Disney on Ice is something we haven't really touched upon.

150
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,940
It's certainly not well documented compared to some of the other things we cover.

151
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,420
Yeah, this would this one was tricky to find footage of.

152
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,860
And I'd imagine a 90s one would be a lot more difficult because this this show was

153
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,860
running kind of at the exact advent of YouTube.

154
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,740
So there's some sporadic weird clips, but still some holes I found.

155
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,420
But yeah, do you remember anything specific from 90s shows or like what were they

156
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,620
pushing? Is this a Lion King one?

157
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,580
Is this a Beauty and the Beast?

158
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,820
I don't know what the hell is going on with Disney on Ice.

159
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:49,140
Yeah, I I think when I would have seen it, it likely would have been, you know,

160
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,540
the gang, the big six, because that what they're called the big six.

161
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,340
I call them that.

162
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,940
Mickey Mickey, Mickey, Mickey, Mickey.

163
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,580
There there is an intra company term of like the main one of like Mickey

164
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,020
Minnie, Donald Daisy, Goofy, Pluto.

165
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:12,740
Like Kevin Smith's, who are Brody, James, Bob and Ben.

166
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:19,980
See, Dante, Dante, Randall, Mooby, Mooby.

167
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,580
Yeah, so I them and probably Little Mermaid and Aladdin,

168
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,860
maybe tail end of if they had rescuers skating around, you know.

169
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,820
Oh, maybe.

170
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,580
Hmm. Mike, any experience with these?

171
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,660
I think we went to one Disney on Ice and I don't remember.

172
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,220
I remember going to Sesame Street Live and that being like the big thing that I

173
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,900
got excited, very excited for.

174
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:48,700
And I remember even leaving baseball practice early to go to a Sesame Street

175
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,500
live once and being a little embarrassed that that was the reason.

176
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,820
So I think we lied to the coach and didn't tell him that's why we were leaving

177
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,580
early. I think we said we had a family party or something, because I was already

178
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,860
self-conscious because I was maybe like first or second grade.

179
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,740
And I was like, I know I'm a little too old for this, but we went to that's an

180
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,140
interesting addition to the story.

181
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,140
Yeah. Still into Sesame Street.

182
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,020
Yeah. And my sister was three years younger.

183
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,420
So obviously, like right in her wheelhouse.

184
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,060
But I still wanted to see it.

185
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,460
I still want to see what was happening there.

186
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,540
Yeah. But I think we went to Disney on Ice around that time or maybe a little later.

187
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,420
I do remember and maybe this is a false memory, but I do remember like friend like

188
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,340
me and the show.

189
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,140
So probably around that time.

190
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,460
I don't remember being.

191
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:38,700
Like so blown away by the show as a kid, I don't remember going, oh, wow, is that

192
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,300
amazing? We got to go every year.

193
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,860
But I think I like to find these kind of things often end up like fine, like good

194
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:51,060
enough to justify the money, which I will say it seems like this stuff is never

195
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,380
that super expensive.

196
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,860
They're like, I think they continue to price these things right.

197
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,820
Well, and especially if you wait till the last minute, as we found out with Batman

198
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,340
Live, which we didn't go together, but we all I think probably bought like

199
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,500
discount tickets.

200
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,700
Yes. Yeah. We had the exact same experience, despite not going together,

201
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,420
where we got like the biggest plus up.

202
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:17,420
We got moved like many, many rows down just because nobody was there, which seems

203
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,660
like the case with like every once in a while footage that I found of this

204
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,260
incredible show, it pans to the audience and there's no one, nobody there.

205
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,900
So it might not be a failure of the show.

206
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,460
I think they might just do a ton of them accounting for like, yeah, I don't know.

207
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:36,420
It's going to be 25 to 30 percent full, but we'll stay there and do a bunch of

208
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,260
them. And it's easy.

209
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,620
Yeah, I think Batman Live was running two shows a day.

210
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,180
And we've talked about this, but Batman Live was like a live stunt show that they

211
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,220
did a couple of years ago.

212
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:52,420
But I think also, if you're a big ice skating fan, that like I was not a big ice

213
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,220
skating fan. My sister did some ice skating when she was little and I'd have

214
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,300
to go to like those long like recital things where they would, they would

215
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,820
literally be like four hours and they had about 45 acts and you would have like,

216
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,060
I think you would have like a brochure that said how many acts there were.

217
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,940
And I remember just like my sister was in one of them sitting watching like eight

218
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,860
year olds skate in a circle to music for like four hours.

219
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,300
And I was a kid just feeling like, oh my God, how, what?

220
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,180
So I was not a big skating fan in general, but I was obviously a big Disney fan.

221
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:30,340
But it did not leave a huge impression on me in the way a Sesame Street live did.

222
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:31,500
Sure.

223
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,340
Yeah.

224
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,180
One thing I kind of remember and was confirmed in this show is that the

225
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:43,460
characters are constantly waving at the audience.

226
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:48,820
And even to the point I bring this up, like, yeah, these characters, Mickey

227
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,780
always waves to kids, always waves to the crowd.

228
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,260
But to the point where it's like, aren't you are supposed to be in a theatrical

229
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,100
scene right now and you were still waving to the crowd.

230
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:08,540
Like, I think the kids, I think the kids are good if you, if you take the 90

231
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,500
seconds to do this dialogue, this pre-recorded dialogue exchange, I think

232
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,820
you can take a break and also little ice skating, like little ice skating

233
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,580
flourishes too, where it's like, there's no one here.

234
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,660
There's no one here in the line for the ride.

235
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,380
Like, you know, but they're still kind of doing a little waggle or a

236
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,140
little toe tap or something.

237
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,220
A little spin.

238
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,500
Yeah.

239
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,420
A little spin.

240
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,180
Doesn't help the drama.

241
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,420
Though, as you're saying this, like you're absolutely right from a

242
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:42,940
storytelling perspective, but having a kid who waving is one of his favorite

243
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,980
activities, I feel like if I took him to this, he might be, he might see the

244
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:52,500
video you watched and his note would be not enough waving, right on with their

245
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,020
audience.

246
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:57,020
And you are probably, you and Aaron are probably like, yeah, up the waving, up

247
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,620
the waving, we want him falling asleep when you're doing your bowels.

248
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,540
We want him asleep for the car ride.

249
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,100
Oh, oh yeah, absolutely.

250
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,500
Yes.

251
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,780
This should, he should just get to shout characters whose name he can kind of say

252
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,020
one syllable of, and this should knock him out.

253
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:14,700
Yeah.

254
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,020
That's the other thing I think about these shows.

255
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,780
I'm sure I could find the current schedule of them.

256
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,780
I feel like, yeah, it's two shows a day.

257
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,220
I feel like an early matinee and a late matinee.

258
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:31,580
I don't think they're going on, they're doing an eight o'clock or nine o'clock set.

259
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,060
You know, especially if there's a hockey game, if they're booking hockey

260
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,580
games in these same arenas.

261
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,180
Oh yeah, or a concert later.

262
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:39,460
Yeah.

263
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:45,820
Designs to not like, uh, conflict with any other events that might want to use the

264
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,540
space that might be in the late show is 4 30 PM.

265
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,300
And 4 30 PM.

266
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:59,780
So they can get a time like a camcorder stamp on one of these who knew, like who

267
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,860
knows if that time is wrong or just missed program, but for sure I saw an 11

268
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,460
AM pop up, which might be that correct.

269
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,060
You know, I think it's a great thing about it.

270
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,540
Kind of the only other place you're going to find it is theme parks.

271
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,180
Where else in the world can you be like sitting in a venue and watching a show

272
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:22,460
before and potentially having a alcoholic beverage all before 11 AM?

273
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,140
It's hard to do anywhere else.

274
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:24,780
Yeah.

275
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:29,660
I mean, I love, I love going to the movies and I, I really love going to either the

276
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:35,100
very first show of the day or the very last show of the day, uh, when you, when

277
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,500
you might have the, the place to yourself.

278
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,220
That was a fun holiday outing.

279
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,060
It's like, oh, there's a new Spider-Man movie.

280
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:45,060
And the thrill in this one is that if you go to this one, you might get sick.

281
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,300
That's what happened with the previous ones.

282
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,660
The thrill of Spider-Man this time is he kicked off this wave.

283
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,140
The movie was so popular.

284
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,060
That spell.

285
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:06,460
Thank God there weren't good enough movies for all of these months to cause of a

286
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,100
spike.

287
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:07,500
Yes.

288
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,420
We can see you, Spider-Man for being watchable and fun.

289
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:11,580
Yeah.

290
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,700
We went to, I real quick, Lindsay and I went to a drive through to see Spider-Man.

291
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,580
Oh, and I drive through driving.

292
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,540
No, no, there was a screen on the McDonald's drive through and we watched it.

293
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,660
Uh, no, you're right.

294
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,420
A drive in, we went out, there's a couple of drives and we're like, you know, what

295
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,620
would be fun going to the drive and see Spider-Man?

296
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,060
Like, yeah, that does sound fun because of all, oh, let's go see the drive in or

297
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,460
whatever.

298
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,220
And, uh, we went to the drive in and it sucked ass.

299
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:39,940
It was awful.

300
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,540
You couldn't see shit.

301
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,340
You couldn't see shit.

302
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,060
Where'd you go?

303
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,220
Uh, where did we go?

304
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,260
We went to the Mish.

305
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,660
Was it the Mission Tiki one?

306
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:48,980
Oh, I've heard of that.

307
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,220
Okay.

308
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:49,580
Okay.

309
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:49,900
Yeah.

310
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,220
Yeah.

311
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,500
Um, I haven't done that in all this time.

312
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,900
We couldn't see anything on the screen except for the very bright scenes.

313
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,940
We could hear characters would be like, I think that's Alfred Molina talking.

314
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,580
And then you would look and then this is not the fault of the, I mean, the drive

315
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,980
in needs to upgrade their, uh, equipment, but then you would look right.

316
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,060
And I would watch some of, uh, soundless Ghostbusters afterlife.

317
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,260
Just get a general impression.

318
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,140
So I, yeah, I got some, what happens visually in it.

319
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:23,940
Um, I saw, um, not this Tom Holland film, but another Tom Holland film, cherry

320
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:24,620
Oh, wow.

321
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:30,260
Drive in when things were still really grim and boy that if I was trying to

322
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:35,700
escape grimness, I don't know why I went to a city of industry drive in of cherry.

323
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,380
Oh my God.

324
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,140
It was all, it was like so post-apocalyptic.

325
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,140
It had to be witnessed.

326
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,540
And also one of those where you could like, you, I, you know, obviously I

327
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,220
can't see through the windows and see what's happening in the other cars, but

328
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:54,300
you really feel like people are doing anything but watching the movie.

329
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:54,940
Oh yeah.

330
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,940
The guy in front of us kept getting out of the car and going into his trunk for

331
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:03,300
some reason he was blasting us with a light because his trunk, his trunk.

332
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,980
I just got to get some cords, just got to get some bungee cords.

333
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,340
Maybe he had food back there.

334
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,180
I was like, then he left 20 minutes before the movie was over.

335
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,940
Oh yeah.

336
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,340
And it was, Oh, and then our car died.

337
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:20,420
Oh, because you have to keep it in accessory mode to do the radio.

338
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:20,660
Yeah.

339
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:24,580
But apparently that's, I, I had went and charged cause it's a hybrid car.

340
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,260
I went and charged it with the bed.

341
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,340
I was like, Oh, this'll be fine.

342
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,180
We'll go straight to just a battery, but I'm an idiot who knows nothing about cars.

343
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:35,060
So when we were looking online later, it's like, just turn the car on.

344
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,100
Don't leave it in accessory mode.

345
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,340
If you turn the car on, it's fine.

346
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,460
But I left in an accessory mode for a very long Spiderman movie.

347
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,260
Wow.

348
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,580
And I was like, there's an employee and I'm like, Hey, I'm so sorry.

349
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,140
I think we need to jump.

350
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,060
Look, he goes, Oh yeah.

351
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,300
Okay.

352
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:50,940
Hold on a second.

353
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,820
He gets the guy over.

354
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,820
There's just a guy walking around with a battery.

355
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,180
Oh, it must happen all the time.

356
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:57,460
Yeah.

357
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,420
I go, Oh, I'm so sorry.

358
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,580
He goes, that's okay.

359
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,380
I go, how many is that?

360
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,020
How many have happened?

361
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,060
He's like, guys, like the fourth or fifth tonight.

362
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,100
It's like, Oh, yeah, I know.

363
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:07,260
Yeah.

364
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,140
Well, yeah, cars aren't really like meant to have that mid mode anymore.

365
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,540
Or like, I didn't know how my, like, like my car, I've never done this with my car

366
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,060
before.

367
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,020
It was very, yeah, I was so worried about it.

368
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,660
Well, because the old, my memory also, the last time I went to a drive-in was to see

369
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,780
the mask, which is obviously a long time ago.

370
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,060
And I thought it was fun.

371
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,900
And my memory was, it was really fun.

372
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,420
And that was the old school way.

373
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,460
I think where you would, they had the, like the box.

374
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,940
So you didn't have to have your car on.

375
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:37,020
You would have the box that attached to your window with the, with the audio.

376
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,180
Mm hmm.

377
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,460
So that's the radio station in your car.

378
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,620
I think the little radio station aspect is fun, but yeah.

379
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:47,660
Yeah.

380
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:53,980
You think that these things are going to be a little like from the, from the bummer,

381
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,980
but I only reflects the bummer more.

382
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:57,820
Yes.

383
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,380
They really, really depressed me because I was going to go opening night and there's,

384
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,580
it's a movie with a lot of pops is I like this, you know, I like to call them pops.

385
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,940
A lot of pops and you can hear, so instead of like a whole audience erupting,

386
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:15,180
when somebody would come on the screen, I would hear like one person in the car over

387
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,580
going, Oh yeah, like, yeah.

388
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,100
Like one person, you'd be like, Oh, this is actually sad.

389
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,340
I liked hearing that, but I was actually sadder.

390
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,500
It's making me sadder.

391
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,900
And then the screen you can't even see, which I do think they could upgrade the

392
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,820
projector and that might take care of that issue and it would have made it a

393
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,860
little less depressing, but the whole night was horribly depressing.

394
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,500
And we, I just drove home, we just drove home, sad.

395
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,500
Yeah.

396
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:41,820
Yeah.

397
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,540
That was going to be fun.

398
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,820
We were almost there.

399
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,140
We were almost, cause you, there was a, there was that dinner planned that was at

400
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,900
Bucatabepo at city walk and you were like, I can't go cause I got to go see

401
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:56,220
Spider-Man exactly had conflicting city walk plans, which made me say more than

402
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,780
anything we're back, we're back.

403
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,380
It happened.

404
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,140
It's over and this thing snuck back.

405
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,300
It ruined all the city walk plans.

406
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,540
All the city walk plans.

407
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:04,980
I know.

408
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,820
So yes, that got altered.

409
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,620
I, that was going to be the glorious return to city walks movie, which I would

410
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,620
have a city walk movie opening night, which the Marvel movie doesn't even have

411
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,380
to be good as long as a character is on screen that people recognize.

412
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,180
So they all cheer and that is experiences fun.

413
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,780
It doesn't matter if the movie's good or not.

414
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,020
It's just a fun experience to be in that city walk theater, you know, with like

415
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:33,540
one Margarita in you from the Margaritaville bar and cheering at a familiar name.

416
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,820
It doesn't even have to be the actual actor or an actor just as a name and it

417
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,540
will go, will hoot and holler.

418
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,300
Yeah.

419
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:39,820
Yeah.

420
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,100
Well, you know, if I could dovetail it back into this, I mean, the show is a,

421
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,820
really any ice show, it seems like is a great opportunity to yell for

422
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,380
someone you recognize.

423
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:50,860
Oh yeah.

424
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,900
I think they, I can't, I almost can't hate on these.

425
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:59,780
If I'm judging them from a, from a storytelling angle, then maybe, but, uh,

426
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:05,660
you know, they do successfully, like to the, I was noticing in videos that I was

427
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:10,620
watching, uh, here's like, all right, here's a little story beat and this seems

428
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,020
to be going over, okay.

429
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,420
And then at the end, uh, I think Mr.

430
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,300
Incredible says, okay, everybody let's party.

431
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,300
And then all the characters come out.

432
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,020
It's like Cinderella and Stitch and everybody from mismatching worlds.

433
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,500
And they all dance to dancing in the streets and people go ape shit.

434
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,060
It's so exciting.

435
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,740
That's good.

436
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,620
I mean, it's look, it's a parade of characters that are traveling at like a

437
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,980
higher speed than normal.

438
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,620
That's really what it is.

439
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,380
Cause they're on skates.

440
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,820
So it's a little bit faster, a lot of, but not fast enough that you can't see them.

441
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,260
They aren't just no worries.

442
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,500
No, there's a funny, funny.

443
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,940
You said traveling a little faster.

444
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:57,060
Cause the first video I found, uh, uh, watching this was, uh, from 2019 and it

445
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:03,340
is not the storyline that we are so, uh, obsessed with the Incredibles are in it,

446
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:09,820
but involves goofy driving an out of control car, uh, on the ice with a hitch

447
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,540
wagon and all the characters in the car.

448
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:17,340
And there's of course there's now there's giant led screens that are, it's moving

449
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,460
very fast, but the wagon is going five miles an hour and for a long time, all

450
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,020
the characters are just going goofy.

451
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,180
Slow down.

452
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,980
You got to slow down, man.

453
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,380
What are you doing?

454
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,460
We need to help.

455
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:34,460
And then the Incredibles all come out one at a time and do their

456
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,180
powers to help slow down this car.

457
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,900
And it's very, I feel like even as a child, I would have been like, they're

458
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,780
not going fit the TV's going fit.

459
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,380
Like they're fine.

460
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,020
Well, what is happening?

461
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,380
And if you have a side view, then maybe you're not even seeing that screen.

462
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,940
You don't know what the problem is whatsoever.

463
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,100
So it's like, it's like speed or something.

464
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,700
Like, what is it?

465
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,620
The goofy is a car.

466
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,620
He's just driving poorly.

467
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,940
Is a car out of control?

468
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:05,740
I, it seems like a, like, like half six, a one, half a dozen of the other, like I

469
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,580
don't, it's unclear movie death proof.

470
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,940
Goofy's like the stuntman Mike and death proof.

471
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,780
And he's, he's trying to crash his car.

472
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,500
He's, he's, he's like lost control of the car and Mr.

473
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,980
Incredible is trying to stop it.

474
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,860
And then the last, the girl comes out and they, there was a gag.

475
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,820
I found a clip of a gag where she's like stretching, but not in this, in this, she's

476
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,860
just like doing normal stretching while skating, which is very impressive to

477
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,860
skate when you say normal stretching.

478
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,940
She's just like normal.

479
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,380
She's got like, she's touching her toes.

480
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:42,100
Like she's kind of holding her one leg up while the other leg is skating.

481
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,060
So like that probably takes a significant amount of balance.

482
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,700
And then violet comes out in the inflatable ball that like Wayne coin

483
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,260
uses a flaming lip shows and she doesn't really help.

484
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,700
She's just kind of moves around.

485
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,500
Yeah.

486
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,220
Oh, that's how they do the, the little sphere.

487
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,100
That's pretty good.

488
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,220
Yeah, that's why they did it.

489
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,300
And flaming lips did that, those concerts and during the pandemic with the ball,

490
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,940
everybody was in balls in the audience.

491
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:06,620
Mm hmm.

492
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,460
So maybe that's how we, some of this would be safe to do today.

493
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,580
The drive-in should have had the balls.

494
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:12,700
Oh yeah.

495
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,700
It should be a roll up.

496
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,700
It shouldn't be a drive-in.

497
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,620
It should be a roll up with your big inflatable ball.

498
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,460
And then, yeah, because imagine watch it, you know, you know, each, each cameo that

499
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,540
occurs in the movie, then like watching a field of bubbles all jiggle around.

500
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:25,900
Yeah.

501
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,580
If you're looking at a big bubble bath.

502
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,700
And if you want to, yeah.

503
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,340
And like upfront, like the mosh pit that you can like bump around with people.

504
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,300
Oh my God, Thomas Hayden Church bumping into each other.

505
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,740
Oh yeah.

506
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,780
My nose bled from Thomas Hayden Church bumping.

507
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,940
Oh, spoiler alert, I guess.

508
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,580
I guess I technically didn't know that one, but I don't, you know, I'm not the guy to.

509
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,460
Well, again, spoiler alert, it's really mostly his voice.

510
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,700
And then I think it's a re like a reused shot of his actual human form from

511
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,140
Spider-Man three from 20 years ago, maybe.

512
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:06,620
Oh, I don't even know that he's actually, I think he did his lines over Zoom because

513
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,860
he's mostly in his Sandman, like giant sand creature the whole time.

514
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,140
So you don't get a lot of Mr. Hayden Church, whatever.

515
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,020
We don't want to push out Mr. Hayden Church.

516
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,340
You don't get a lot of Hayden Church, which is really why I think I said it, because

517
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,380
I there's bigger things that are more exciting.

518
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,420
Sure, sure. Yeah.

519
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:24,820
Yeah.

520
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:31,700
Let me let me say a little bit about how I ran into this thing, which is seemingly,

521
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,860
let's say the proper name of it, which I think at least at one point, I think the

522
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:40,020
name of this particular story changed a lot, but I found it initially as being

523
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:44,980
Disney presents Pixar's The Incredibles in a Magic Kingdom adventure.

524
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,860
I think other iterations, it was a Disneyland adventure.

525
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:53,500
I think then this was also was done right before the deal, the merger.

526
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,540
So they had to like pull out Pixar in that weird way.

527
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:01,260
Kind of it comes from an interesting time in general, I would say.

528
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:05,780
I ran into I was became aware of this in this weird little clip from watching the

529
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:11,020
2005 Disney Christmas parade, the very Merry Christmas parade, which I haven't gone

530
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,900
into the 2000s ones very much because I assume that they were kind of sanitized and

531
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,300
boring. But this one, there was kind of a lot going on.

532
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:23,300
It's the first parade ever to be introduced by Eiger, not by Eisner, who's

533
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,700
after that changeover.

534
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,540
So he's getting his intro skills together.

535
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,780
Obviously, he was great.

536
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,620
I mean, if looking because he's we're kind of done with Eiger now.

537
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:36,660
And if we're looking at his body of work in terms of welcoming people to holiday

538
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,660
specials, he was no Eisner.

539
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,860
But I don't think he, you know, he didn't drop the ball either.

540
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:41,940
That's true.

541
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:42,540
Yeah.

542
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,500
I mean, we I mean, there's definitely we can definitely get into these.

543
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:51,420
It's hard to like celebrate anyone but Eisner as far as the intros are concerned

544
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:55,700
now. But look, we have a podcast and we need content.

545
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,700
So there's plenty of Eiger stuff that we should take a look at and say, oh, maybe

546
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,780
we were just not of the right age at the time.

547
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,460
Yeah, that's true.

548
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:10,220
Viewing Eiger's work, not as a CEO, but as an on camera presence, I think is

549
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,860
probably something that that this podcast.

550
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:16,940
Right. We can take a critical eye and say maybe we were maybe, you know, he we can

551
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,500
find things I think that we may have overlooked.

552
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,220
I think he never evolved.

553
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,780
He didn't like grow into the performer's shoes in the way that Eisner did.

554
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,980
But I think he started OK and ended up good.

555
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,580
I think he got more handsome as the years went on.

556
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,460
I'll say this. I definitely think he is style improved.

557
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,940
I think whatever he was doing, just I don't know, facially, I don't know if he's

558
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:40,180
got some sort of skin care regime or anything like regimen.

559
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:45,020
Excuse me. I don't know what he's doing, but he looks good.

560
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,740
He like retired hotter.

561
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,060
Yeah, I think so. Really, like a president.

562
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,900
The president is everyone.

563
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,100
But the reverse of the American presidency.

564
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,660
That's right. Yeah. Yeah.

565
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,220
So that's all any of us can hope to do.

566
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,540
Yeah. Retire hotter.

567
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,020
So you start those.

568
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,300
Oh, yes, Jason. Oh, I was just going to say, yeah, I agree.

569
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:09,460
An interesting time for kind of everything in the company with the Pixar

570
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,340
fluctuation, the parks are in a weird state.

571
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:18,260
That weird last minute Hail Mary Muppets purchase, right, is around here.

572
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,060
Oh, I guess so. Yeah, yeah.

573
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:25,820
You know, the special takes you on tours of DCA 1.0, which is improving.

574
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,060
You know, we got Tower of Terror now.

575
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,580
Tiger Woods takes a bunch of kids on Soren.

576
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,100
That's fun.

577
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,780
All right, guys, he's ready to soar.

578
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,780
Yeah.

579
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,660
You get George W.

580
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,060
Bush and a long section for the troops.

581
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,060
That's an interesting time capsule.

582
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,700
50th anniversary of Disneyland, which I'm assuming plays a factor

583
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,620
into some of the choices in this.

584
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,220
Yeah, yeah, that's that's basically what's going on.

585
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,580
And that's so half of this, you know, it's still Regis, but we got Kelly Rippa

586
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:03,060
as the co-host now and half of the special is hosted by Ryan Seacrest.

587
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,500
From Disneyland, who's talking about the 50th anniversary a lot.

588
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,700
And he does this brief plug of this ice show.

589
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,580
There's only a 65 city ice tour.

590
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,700
And the Incredibles are going to take you on it.

591
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,820
They're going to go on a trip to Disneyland.

592
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,700
It's going to tribute the 50th anniversary.

593
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,860
And just all this imagery is going by really quick.

594
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,940
And it was so brief, but it just really struck me this this

595
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,460
powerful image of Mr.

596
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,740
Incredible freeing the pirates.

597
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:35,380
The pirates, I think, are iconic, the pirates with the with the dog

598
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:39,020
and the key next to them, you know, we've all passed the many a time,

599
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,740
but you don't get to know their fate.

600
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,380
You don't know how they got out.

601
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:47,300
So seeing a different iconic character set them free,

602
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,820
it just really pulled me in.

603
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,900
And there was a real like violence to the footage.

604
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,260
I really felt the force of Mr.

605
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,380
Incredible. I just I just wanted to know more.

606
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,180
I don't know if it struck you guys as powerful as it did me,

607
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,220
but it was it was an arresting image, I felt.

608
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,420
Well, it turned some conventional thing on its head on it on its ear.

609
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:12,620
The turn to your expectations were circum circumvented.

610
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,940
You know, it was one of those things where you were like,

611
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,060
I didn't know that was possible.

612
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,500
Yeah. Like like Spider-Man movie.

613
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,340
You didn't know it was possible for Mr.

614
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,380
Incredible to be in this world.

615
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:28,820
And it was funny to see him in this world now freeing

616
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:33,100
a bunch of maniac pirates like because like this is now

617
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,740
I'm actually getting into another topic here.

618
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,260
And we have not done we've only done one episode really on

619
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,700
Pirates of the Caribbean.

620
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,420
So really, yeah, this is going to be this race going to be the last

621
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,900
entire year of the podcast. Right.

622
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,540
So that'll be a full full calendar year all on pirates.

623
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,300
But it's unclear like why are these pirates in prison

624
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,700
and the other pirates are Roman where they did where these pirates

625
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,700
too crazy for the other pirates.

626
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,060
How did this all go down is my question.

627
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,140
So it is on it is unclear to me.

628
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,700
It actually seemed this picture was asking more questions.

629
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,180
It left me with more questions than I had before,

630
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,100
because I'm like, why does he think this is a good idea? Really?

631
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,900
Aaron proposed the opposite of what you're saying,

632
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:21,540
that there that it is a topsy turvy world.

633
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:25,980
If the pirates have taken control of the town, perhaps

634
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:30,340
when where the regular city might imprison people who are bad,

635
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:35,580
maybe the pirates have put some of their own in jail who are not bad enough.

636
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,620
They were goody two shoes.

637
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,060
And so we don't want these people.

638
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:43,300
We're going to punish them for not doing enough pillaging and setting things on fire.

639
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,700
Right. So they that's interesting.

640
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,940
So they they wouldn't like participate in any of the games.

641
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,700
They wouldn't chase the women around.

642
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,860
They wouldn't set fires.

643
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:59,420
They wouldn't drink excess amounts of like moonshine or whatever they're drinking.

644
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,620
Made no bids in the auction.

645
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,660
Didn't participate. Right.

646
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:08,620
So it's just best to have these people put away and not interrupting our fun.

647
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,980
Gotcha. So, yeah, no, I it suggests a world.

648
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,020
It suggests a world where everybody can meet, which is fun.

649
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,220
I think really that's what it comes down to.

650
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,900
The idea that that that any pick any picks our character

651
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:26,460
and then put them on one of the rides and with the characters on the rides.

652
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,540
And it is fun. Mm hmm.

653
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:32,220
You know, I mean, we can just ratatouille Remy is

654
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:37,860
he's like he's on the ball and the Madame Leota ball and the Haunted Mansion

655
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,260
or something like you know that was possible, but it is

656
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,780
one of the small world dolls eating Nemo.

657
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,980
Yes. Like just the Finn's hanging around image as well.

658
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,940
Right. Just a little flipper.

659
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,100
Mm hmm. Right.

660
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,300
The Kevin Spacey bugs life character

661
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,940
is just walking down Main Street saying hello to people.

662
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,540
He's sitting on the bench.

663
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,500
He's sitting on the bench.

664
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,900
You know, just rubbing his wings up against the right.

665
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,460
Rubbing his thorax. Right.

666
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,420
So that is that's the fun.

667
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,660
Not more class.

668
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,380
I'm fun, but yeah, maybe not. Yeah.

669
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:20,780
But everything else is fun ones we should do and everybody should have fun together.

670
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:24,900
Here's what then I determined about the show and we can go into the plot

671
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,220
and why this happened.

672
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:31,060
But, you know, the broad strokes, there's a power family trip

673
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:35,260
to Disneyland where then some stuff goes wrong and they have to be the Incredibles

674
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,300
and fix some stuff.

675
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,180
And once I after a lot of digging for camcorder footage

676
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,660
and trying to find this powerful moment in context,

677
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:51,260
I determined that it was maybe not the the climax of the show

678
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,060
and maybe didn't have the dramatic heft that I thought.

679
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:58,500
And in fact, the buildup is seemingly the Incredibles are kind of around

680
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,220
Pirates of the Caribbean.

681
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:04,620
And Mr. Incredible says, hey, it looks like these guys probably want to come out.

682
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,540
You want to come out and he takes the bars off and they come out.

683
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,740
Which is discovering that, I feel a little embarrassed

684
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:15,380
to propose an episode about it because I thought this surely

685
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,580
this is the the climax of the show and that it has some like,

686
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,020
can you hear the people singing?

687
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,980
There's like something like this.

688
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,820
This is about glory and justice.

689
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:32,660
We must. I cannot see my brethren held captive any longer.

690
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,220
I assume like that's what the show built to, but apparently not.

691
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,340
It just kind of happens. And then they dance.

692
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:42,500
Yeah, it's not even like the first ride they mess around in.

693
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,660
Yeah. The justification is that, yeah, they're at Disneyland.

694
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:51,700
And there's a scene before this where they literally say,

695
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,500
I think I wrote the line down.

696
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:59,940
Maybe we should see how Mickey and his team are doing over in New Orleans Square.

697
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,660
This is our kind of show is great.

698
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,980
Yeah. So there there.

699
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,660
Those aren't pirate pirates.

700
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,580
Those are literally the animatronic pirates.

701
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:17,140
So you watch people on ice skates doing repetitive animatronic like motions

702
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:21,460
and then sort of when the characters leave, they come to life and do,

703
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,580
of course, a big dance ice dancing number.

704
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,740
That's pretty good.

705
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,060
I love that they're supposed to be the robots and that this ice show is

706
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:33,180
recreating rides and simulated stuff.

707
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,260
It's a simulation of a simulation. Yes.

708
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:41,660
So I I I was delighted by that justification.

709
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:45,180
And I I my podcast to bring was like,

710
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:50,180
well, don't what are more people have been to Disney World than Disneyland?

711
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,340
And then when I started thinking about the anniversary, I was like, OK,

712
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,980
I kind of see that.

713
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,340
That's why. Yeah.

714
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:01,260
Yeah. The Disneyland Adventure show also features the same

715
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:05,820
like just tossed off beat of Goofy opening the gate.

716
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,220
Basically, opening the prison.

717
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,740
Yeah. Goofy just like opens a thing.

718
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,180
It's like not a big it's not like spotlight.

719
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,940
They're finally free.

720
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:18,540
It's just a casual thing of like, oh, gosh, we should let them out.

721
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:22,740
Why do these like good characters want to let out the pirates?

722
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,620
It's kind of weird. It's a good question.

723
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:28,100
I mean, I guess in the in the Disney, the Disney verse in this version,

724
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,420
everyone's just like a goofy character, like a nice character.

725
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,620
You know,

726
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,740
because he is an anti carceral activist.

727
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,860
The prison system needs to be reformed.

728
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,220
There's a lower class.

729
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:49,220
I am in it. And when there is a criminal class, I am of it.

730
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,100
I know. Yeah, they could have had.

731
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,660
I mean, that was the subtext, I think, as far as Goofy opening those prison

732
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,620
doors, but I don't know that they actually said so out loud.

733
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,500
Product of their upbringing.

734
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:06,900
You look. Yeah, it's reform, not impersonate.

735
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:12,660
Yeah. So I don't I don't I think literally they're like somebody

736
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,220
who's writing the show, if you want to call it that, which I guess you have to write.

737
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,500
I shouldn't put it down.

738
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,180
No, yeah. Somebody went, oh, it would be fun.

739
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,900
We're goofy to open the door and the pirates skate to them.

740
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,700
Because, yeah, it seems good.

741
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,900
I think, though, that the the the pirates do become a problem

742
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,780
or that they do.

743
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:34,620
They do end up being villains and capture Mickey and Minnie.

744
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,100
I like from what I can tell.

745
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,540
And again, piecing this together from really sporadic

746
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,660
videos from all over different times.

747
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,580
But I go ahead.

748
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:46,340
I was just saying it's a nightmare to try to figure out exactly the narrative

749
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,820
because there's so many different like little snippets of stuff.

750
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,340
And then I think I found another snippet from the same show,

751
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,260
but then it's a total it's like the same beat.

752
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,740
Like what happened in that in that Regis special syndrome comes

753
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,180
Jason Lee, of course, Jason Lee's syndrome comes in.

754
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,740
He like he he doesn't capture Mickey and Minnie, but he has dialogue

755
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:07,180
that's exactly the same as other versions of Disney on Ice,

756
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:11,940
where syndrome captures Mickey and Minnie and takes them away.

757
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,020
Yeah, he wants to take over the park or use his powers on the park.

758
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:22,300
Right. And he's going to he's destroying Disney World to create syndrome land.

759
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,620
Right. That is said at some point.

760
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:28,140
So it's still an amusement park, but like an evil one and devoted

761
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,780
to him syndrome land. Yes.

762
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:32,580
But I'm just saying it's like hard to tell because they again, is it the goofy thing?

763
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:37,100
Like they took pieces of things and it's hard to like know exactly

764
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,260
what is what from year to year.

765
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,220
Yeah. Yeah. There's like two videos.

766
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,940
I saw a lot of videos tagged 2009.

767
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,220
So even in 2009, they're keeping this going.

768
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,900
But I saw two videos that had the same like set up.

769
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,220
Scott, did you I'm assuming you saw the small world sequence?

770
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,100
You think so? Yeah.

771
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:03,100
Where it's like they Jack Jack is on the like a windmill and small world

772
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,940
and they need to get him down and they slow the ride down.

773
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,900
The music goes real slow.

774
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,300
And the footage was too shitty for me to see that Jack Jack was on it.

775
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,460
I didn't know why they were messing with the windmill.

776
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,620
Yeah. Thank you for clarifying.

777
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:19,140
There there is there's another angle, I think, in another city

778
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,580
where you can see him pick up.

779
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,980
Jack Jack is just a baby doll.

780
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,500
But they're just like, come on, Jack.

781
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,140
That's really funny throughout that they have to deal with the baby

782
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,460
and take care of him like he's a baby.

783
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,380
But also it's just a prop that gets in the way of things.

784
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,980
So they got to throw him around.

785
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:38,140
And at some point, even in the Ryan Seacrest narration, I noticed

786
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,940
Mr. Incredible skating in a way where Jack Jack's under his arm.

787
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,460
And it kind of looks like he's choking him.

788
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,540
And at the end of the show, he throws him up in the air really high.

789
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,500
They drop the baby. It gets run over by a skate.

790
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:55,260
Yeah, they do have to keep their balance like, yeah, they keep that vibe.

791
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:59,060
But so he restarts the ride with his incredible strength.

792
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,420
And then the music goes real fast.

793
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:07,500
And that is a great justification for them to do that real fast ice skating spin.

794
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

795
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,740
Yeah, that was that was pretty fun.

796
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:15,060
The windmill controls all of the music on Small World.

797
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,260
That's pretty good.

798
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:20,020
Yeah, you know, I do enjoy this thing in general.

799
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:24,620
And I like the idea of like the idea of the ice show is a family trip

800
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:29,820
to Disneyland, and then that justifies that it's not just going to be ice

801
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,300
skaters, but also big props that are like what you get to see at Disneyland.

802
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,540
But you get to see them in your town if you can't go.

803
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,780
So you get teacups out on the ice.

804
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,260
You get a jungle cruise boat.

805
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:44,620
At the end, a lot of stuff's repurposed, but with electrical parade type lights,

806
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,100
like this kind of a mini electrical parade at the end.

807
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:52,460
I would love going to this being so Disneyland starved at all time,

808
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:56,660
like any any way that I could see Disneyland stuff without even getting to go.

809
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,820
I would have loved. Yeah, this is I mean, I know they've had what was it?

810
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:04,540
The 60th where they had like the the show that everyone thought was going to be

811
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:07,460
celebrating the parks and it ended up just being the music from the movies.

812
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:11,940
Remember, like there was a firework castle show and I forget the name of it.

813
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,300
People are yelling at the podcast right now.

814
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:18,380
But there was they have had shows where they like do all the music

815
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:21,420
from the parks and stuff at like at the nighttime celebration stuff.

816
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,460
But they had just for some reason was like playing songs from the movies

817
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,660
to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Disneyland.

818
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:31,780
And I was watching this going like this is this is like what I really wanted from that.

819
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,580
Obviously, yeah. Yeah.

820
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:37,260
Like you get like Tiki room at the end, like like the finale.

821
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,540
They play Tiki room and you get a lot of Haunted Mansion stuff.

822
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,780
Like there's a whole big sequence that recreates Haunted Mansion

823
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:47,100
and the stretching portrait like they have a prop that actually

824
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,460
and then kind of the ballroom sequence happens.

825
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,820
I mean, so this is a structure of a show.

826
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:57,180
I glommed onto it because of this funny, silly pirate thing.

827
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:01,180
But then I'm watching it like, well, this is a very good idea for a touring Disney show.

828
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,020
Yeah. And I wonder.

829
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:04,700
Yeah, I wonder.

830
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:08,780
Like it feels like they don't they wouldn't do this anymore is what I'm saying.

831
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,180
Maybe I'm wrong, but it feels like

832
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:17,140
they're much more like probably synergy focused now and it'll all just be movie stuff.

833
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,540
And yeah, I don't know.

834
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:23,580
Everything feels like it's watched like a hawk nowadays.

835
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:28,820
This feels like the tail end of like, yeah, and we're just, you know, doing this show.

836
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:32,220
And we, you know, we don't have that many people have to OK it.

837
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:37,140
But now it's like they've reorganized every company, you know, reorganizes

838
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,660
so many times, you know, the structure.

839
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,180
But yeah, it would be.

840
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,380
Yeah, that's I think the stuff that I love out of any.

841
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,300
It's it's at the root, especially of that coming out of their shells type thing,

842
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,380
where they get so much stuff wrong.

843
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,980
And did it confuse me as a kid when like those turtles aren't like the turtles I know.

844
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,260
But I also loved it.

845
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:59,820
And I still love it when they like screw up big things.

846
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,980
This happened with Mario a lot, I feel like.

847
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:06,020
Obviously, the Mario Brothers movie is this really ludicrous Mario

848
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,580
on ice thing with Mr.

849
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,220
Belvedere as as Koopa.

850
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,660
There was an early viral video that was so great.

851
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:17,700
But I like I might be in the minority on this, but I love when they

852
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:23,380
they like completely fuck up IP and the rules and the characters.

853
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,980
And it's all off.

854
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,540
Oh, yeah. I mean, I as a kid, it's so I would.

855
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,820
That's one of the things I would love to have it like a video of somebody

856
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,060
interviewing me about that, because I'm so fascinated to hear

857
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:36,940
what I would have said back then, because obviously we all knew that

858
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,980
when stuff didn't add up because there were multiple versions of everything.

859
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,820
Mario, then the movie like interview, like all of us being interviewed

860
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:49,140
after just seeing the Mario movie would have been fascinating and hilarious,

861
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,620
like hilarious. Yeah.

862
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,580
Because I'm sure we were like, like on the way home,

863
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,740
we were probably like just befuddled.

864
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,940
I remember being before like so confused by it.

865
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,100
But we weren't articulating it in any way.

866
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:05,820
But it would have been funny to try to get kids to explain like that wasn't it.

867
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:09,780
Was that Mario? Like that wasn't why was that?

868
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,460
Why was Mario not Mario?

869
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:17,420
That was a different one than the one that was my one.

870
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:21,500
You learn like a lesson, though, I think, as a kid, like that, it's like, oh, yeah,

871
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,940
I guess this is different.

872
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:27,220
I get like your brain just goes, I guess this is different.

873
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:30,020
And then you accept it. And it's not that big of a deal.

874
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:34,420
It's a complaint sometimes I have with the Marvel stuff is it's so focused on making

875
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:39,420
sure it's exactly like the same thread from every movie and every show and it's all the same.

876
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,860
And like it's like they're like just like doing that.

877
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:47,500
Like they're they're so like like sticklers for that.

878
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:52,020
Yeah. And a part of me as a kid reading comics and there were four different

879
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:56,020
Ninja Turtles, I kind of miss the days when it's like you'd be your mom

880
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:59,140
found a weird like European Ninja Turtles comic.

881
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:05,740
And it was like or that there were like the knockoff toys where like it was a dollar store.

882
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:10,900
And it was like you've seen all that, like the things on like websites and BuzzFeed,

883
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:14,660
where it's like the mutant hero, not frogs, that's whatever.

884
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,100
But like fake turtle stuff.

885
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,380
And there's something fun about that.

886
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,780
And even stuff I think I liked as a kid that there were like multiple versions of things.

887
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,260
Yeah, yeah, I know.

888
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:31,700
I think we all appreciate the like that they didn't have the stranglehold on these things.

889
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,060
They couldn't control them.

890
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:40,100
Yeah. Which, you know, leads to fun and sanity and clashes and weird moments as happen

891
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,100
in in this a little bit.

892
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:51,580
Let me let me play a clip or two, because Mike, you mentioned the the Regis performance.

893
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:55,580
We've said we've we've we've been trying to piece together this incredible ice show.

894
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:58,100
And it's tough to do for a bunch of camcorder footage.

895
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:05,460
But they did make a stop on Regis and Kelly and perform a little mini version of it on a mini ice rink

896
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,860
on the Regis set, which is very small to begin with.

897
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,540
I don't know how they crammed it all in.

898
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:15,460
But just, you know, this is where you maybe get the cleanest taste of syndrome.

899
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,340
And what sounds like Jason Lee, right?

900
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:22,700
I think. Yeah, I think it's I think it's the same dialogue from the show itself.

901
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:26,060
Yeah, yeah. I'm cut down. Right.

902
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:29,500
So here's a little piece of that.

903
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:34,860
And this is only seemingly available on YouTube because it's on the YouTube channel

904
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:41,340
for something called Easy Glide 350, which might be like the kind of ice skates that they used or rink.

905
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:47,780
I was trying to I think it it's either ice skates or it's ice panels

906
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:50,500
that you can set up ice rinks in very small spaces.

907
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,340
That's got to be it.

908
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:53,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

909
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,900
That's that's a thing they would have to advertise.

910
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,260
That's a pretty specialty function.

911
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:02,700
So, well, it worked out great on Regis and Kelly's.

912
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:08,540
What's misspelled in the YouTube label and thus Regis and Kelly's Christ Man special.

913
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:14,180
Pretty good misspell. I'd like to see Christ Man.

914
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:18,940
I'd like to see Mickey and Minnie not square off against Christ Man.

915
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:21,620
No, team up with Christ Man. Yeah, team up with Christ Man.

916
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,780
Is Christ Man on Bible Man as well?

917
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:27,140
It's not Jesus doesn't show up.

918
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:29,420
It's his alter ego. Christ Man.

919
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,660
I am Christ Man.

920
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:35,300
It's just regular him in a robe there in the beard.

921
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:38,820
But with a mask. Yeah, the little Burt Ward mask.

922
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,980
Well, he shows up at the end and he's like, what happened?

923
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,900
Anything interesting? Sorry, I'm running late.

924
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,100
And they're like, you missed it. Christ Man was here.

925
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,740
Oh, he was. Oh.

926
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,660
With his alter ego as a mild mannered

927
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,300
savior of man.

928
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,740
OK, here's here's a little clip of the show.

929
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:03,620
Hiya hoops. Hello.

930
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,820
Oh gosh, it's swell to see ya.

931
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:07,700
It sure is, Mickey.

932
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,580
Oh no.

933
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:17,540
Mickey Minnie's holiday phone has been ruined by an army of marching ice guys.

934
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,740
Like soiling Korean troopers.

935
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:29,020
Manhandling the mice.

936
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,420
Good morning, people.

937
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,100
My name is syndrome.

938
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:38,940
First out of a pile of presents, a technically perfect robot

939
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:41,100
copy of my former self.

940
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,460
Oh, that's right. So they stick with Incredibles

941
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:48,140
mythology where syndrome is dead because he gets sucked into the plane.

942
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,540
Because of his cape.

943
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,180
So this actually isn't syndrome.

944
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:54,940
It is a robot that perfectly recreates syndrome, that syndrome

945
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:57,660
like thought to make before he died. Yeah.

946
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,100
So I like that they're consistent.

947
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,340
Also, this the whole thing is doing the great stunt

948
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:06,500
show type thing of the lip sync performance.

949
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:09,100
And syndrome is really strange.

950
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:12,260
Like some characters are just face characters, but he has a big fake

951
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:15,580
Jay Leno type chin like strapped to his regular face.

952
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:20,140
So you see his real mouth doing the lip sync, but also like a big cartoon jaw

953
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,900
is bouncing up and down.

954
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,980
It's yeah, it's scary.

955
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,660
Sorry. Yeah, yeah, yes. Yeah.

956
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:30,860
Yeah, I think the mix and that some of the pirates are like rubber guys,

957
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:33,340
I think is very funny.

958
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,140
But not everyone on on the ice is anywhere.

959
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,500
Sorry, mice.

960
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,780
But there's only room for one beloved character in the world.

961
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:44,220
And that's going to be me.

962
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:47,740
You see, these cast members are about to be cast offs.

963
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,260
Oh, gosh.

964
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:54,580
So that's funny that they are so deep in Park's lore that they

965
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:59,620
use the term cast members and that they put that on this TV

966
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,940
iteration where we have.

967
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:05,300
I don't think the theme park element of it has come up at all.

968
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:07,980
That's not cast members also not something.

969
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:10,940
That's not a casual term, is it?

970
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,380
I don't think so.

971
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:16,260
I think it's weird to hear like a cartoon villain say.

972
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:20,980
And I don't think a child besides us knew the term cast member.

973
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,980
Yeah. In a regular fashion.

974
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:26,220
Also, the way he said sorry, Mike sounded full of hate.

975
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,660
He is racist.

976
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,420
Yeah. Yeah.

977
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:32,780
He's an angry guy.

978
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:34,820
He's a robot. He's angry robot guy.

979
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:38,540
Well, he gets his comeuppance because the Incredibles come out.

980
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:42,100
But I'm going to skip that, actually, because what I'm more interested in is

981
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,500
Frozone's appearance.

982
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,780
And I think you'll hear why.

983
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:50,700
What? Oh, man.

984
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:54,060
Looks like this is definitely a time to cheer.

985
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,260
Blast some of the nice ray or something.

986
00:51:58,820 --> 00:51:59,980
To his cold.

987
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,100
His heart.

988
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:01,940
We.

989
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:11,900
I mean, that's mainly so that's another thing about this show is that there's

990
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:16,340
sporadic, but not constant use of pop songs.

991
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:20,740
Yeah. Like a pretty quick little blast of it, kind of to a confusing degree,

992
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,660
I would say. Yeah, that seems to be a reoccurring thing in all the

993
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,580
the Disney ones. Yeah.

994
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:30,580
Which and so that's that's some of what I wanted to bring up.

995
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,340
About this show.

996
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:34,420
And I have some other clips to show you guys.

997
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,980
Cold as ice. Great.

998
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,580
There's some other sequence where some explosive kind of stuff happens

999
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:42,140
and they use burning down the house. Great.

1000
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:45,420
But because it's 2005,

1001
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,180
things get a little 2005 V.

1002
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:52,380
And I was just really delighted by the use of this one song

1003
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:55,460
that you will hear now.

1004
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:59,860
So listen to the this is for

1005
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:05,060
Violet and it highlights a particular power of hers.

1006
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,540
I mean, that's that's it. Pretty much the.

1007
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:32,980
I did you guys even remember what this song was?

1008
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,940
I guess I texted you about it, but I had to place it at first.

1009
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:38,340
At first I was like, is this a latter day?

1010
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,700
Backstreet Boys song. What is this song?

1011
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,020
And then remembered it was it was Clay Aiken.

1012
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,900
This was right. Aiken's right.

1013
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:48,260
I would not know. I did not know that.

1014
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:49,780
It's familiar now.

1015
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:53,060
But yeah, that was the big that was Clay's biggest hit, right?

1016
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,500
Yeah, yeah.

1017
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,340
Yeah, maybe the only like like big clay song, right?

1018
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:02,620
Which has to be kind of oddly

1019
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:08,060
changed and recontextualized for this moment to just creating the bizarre lyrics

1020
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,660
about a teenage girl.

1021
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:15,140
If she was invisible, then she could just watch you in the room.

1022
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,660
Just kind of. Yeah.

1023
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,940
I mean, teenagers are weird.

1024
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:23,060
I would believe they would do something like that.

1025
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:25,340
The song is accurate. That's true.

1026
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,340
But it is an odd.

1027
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,940
Was Clay on Disney records?

1028
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,380
Hollywood records, do you think?

1029
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,700
I don't. I don't think so.

1030
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,660
Unless, like, didn't everybody have to sign to like the same thing?

1031
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:38,780
Maybe not, though.

1032
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,340
I don't know. I have some questions in general.

1033
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:45,180
I mean, I don't think all of the music comes from Disney in this.

1034
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:50,340
And I'm sure it doesn't, because what what I'm driving to is a particular discovery

1035
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:55,340
that I found a very odd rabbit hole that I went down because past

1036
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,260
now we're starting to get weird with the songs.

1037
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,460
Maybe you remember this clay and song.

1038
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,740
I was kind of delighted to hear it.

1039
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,620
But then the other songs are sort of strange.

1040
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:09,100
The song Dash gets is a Billy Joel song running on ice.

1041
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,300
Kind of an odd choice.

1042
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:15,620
I think Mr. Incredible gets a little moment with I'm too sexy

1043
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:17,820
because he's a big hunk. That's great.

1044
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,100
Crowd pleaser.

1045
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:23,780
But then the song for Elastigirl, for Mrs.

1046
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:26,380
Incredible, is a little strange.

1047
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,540
And let me pull that up.

1048
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,620
Just see if you guys can place it.

1049
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:35,620
Think back to 2005 and if you have any memory of the song.

1050
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:39,380
Let me time it up to there's a fun little gag where she goes behind a door

1051
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:42,380
and then they pull her arms out and they stretch really far.

1052
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,060
So that's fun.

1053
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,940
And this is this is a gag.

1054
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:48,220
Yeah, this is what I was referencing earlier.

1055
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:51,500
I got to say, though, they missed an opportunity with Violet

1056
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:55,060
where she could have skated behind the set piece and not come out

1057
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:58,700
the other side and then just had the spotlight go around the ice

1058
00:55:58,700 --> 00:55:59,980
as if she was invisible.

1059
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:02,540
I feel like, oh, yeah, that would have been great.

1060
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:05,460
Kids would have loved that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1061
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:09,100
And then like perfectly time it hopefully where the invisible one comes in

1062
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,140
and then the then the visible one appears.

1063
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:12,700
Yeah, really?

1064
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,260
Well, they didn't do that, but they did this.

1065
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,140
And this is the highlight of the show for me.

1066
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:19,620
So let's just see if you remember this little ditty.

1067
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:24,980
In your heart, you'll be so visible.

1068
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:28,300
And I heard you was incredible.

1069
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,340
So come on, show them what you got.

1070
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:38,060
You're too flexible to be human.

1071
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:41,740
It's just too early.

1072
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:43,820
And you can't do that.

1073
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:52,020
It's just not going to be.

1074
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:54,780
You don't understand, baby.

1075
00:56:55,180 --> 00:57:02,700
This chicken's got to be too flexible to be human.

1076
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:08,340
Any memories of of that song of you're too flexible to be human?

1077
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:14,900
I that that and the Aiken song, I'm like, I've heard this tune before,

1078
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,260
but I don't I can't place it.

1079
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,300
That's not late period Michael Jackson, is it?

1080
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:24,180
Kind of has that feel sort of like a little electro.

1081
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,340
Not very good, not very catchy.

1082
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,260
What is that?

1083
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:32,420
Well, I think the answer is this is not a popular song at all.

1084
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:36,780
I'm pretty sure because upon Googling some of the lyrics,

1085
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:43,260
I discovered the original version and it is from an artist named Jay Bigga.

1086
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,420
Here's Jay Bigga.

1087
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:47,580
Oh, my God.

1088
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:51,540
From his Al is 2004 album Laced Me Up.

1089
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:54,900
Did you make this parody cover?

1090
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,340
Like this looks fake.

1091
00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:01,420
I'd like to think my Photoshop skills are superior to what we're looking at.

1092
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:02,540
That's true.

1093
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:03,740
Yeah, this guy.

1094
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,220
I mean, any thoughts about this guy?

1095
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:07,660
I was trying to think of a way to describe him to the listener.

1096
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:12,100
I think he looks like if Robert Pattinson had a wiener little brother.

1097
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:15,820
Just this looks like a toy.

1098
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:19,940
He looks like he looks like a little doll that's on one of my shelves.

1099
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,060
Little little dolly.

1100
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:23,580
Human Woody a little bit.

1101
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:26,220
Yeah, it's like portions are strange.

1102
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:28,940
Weird sideburns and pompadour.

1103
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:32,580
Yeah, I also thought I thought he looks a little like

1104
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:35,420
if like the cartoon Doug was a person.

1105
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:38,180
I think he might look like this guy.

1106
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:40,260
I think Doug wouldn't have been this handsome.

1107
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:41,380
No offense to Doug.

1108
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:43,380
Yeah, this guy's got too much of an edge.

1109
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:47,060
So Jay Bigga is a looker to you.

1110
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:48,860
I mean, important fact is that he is white.

1111
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:51,780
This is a white guy and like a white rapper.

1112
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:56,900
And now having heard the the Disney Fide Incredibles version,

1113
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:59,980
here now is Jay Bigga's original.

1114
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:04,180
You're too flexible to be human, which, by the way, on Spotify

1115
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:07,660
on YouTube is spelled while you are.

1116
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:11,660
It is I think in the official release, they did not make it.

1117
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:14,660
You're with an apostrophe.

1118
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,060
So here is the original.

1119
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:18,460
You're too flexible to be human.

1120
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:22,700
You're too flexible to be human.

1121
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:28,660
It's difficult to believe that you can touch it like that.

1122
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,260
It's just not natural.

1123
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:34,300
What you can do with your tongue.

1124
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,220
Incredible.

1125
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:39,580
Your abilities are interstellar, baby.

1126
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:42,940
This chick is out of control.

1127
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:47,020
You're too flexible to be human.

1128
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:50,180
So, yeah, because when I heard

1129
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:53,460
when I heard him say chick in the original

1130
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:56,980
lyric or the way when the Disney singers say chick, I'm like, all right,

1131
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,500
well, something's up with this song.

1132
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,820
And already it being a song about flexibility like this kid,

1133
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:03,660
this is not a song made for this.

1134
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:06,860
This has to be like a sex oriented song,

1135
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:10,580
which immediately was the discovery with Jay Bigga's version.

1136
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,980
I can't say I like it.

1137
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:15,180
No, no.

1138
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:18,580
I kind of like that beat,

1139
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:20,860
that video game kind of beat that comes in.

1140
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:23,780
But I really, really do not care for those vocals.

1141
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,620
It's a poor man's Becks.

1142
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:27,620
Hell, yes. It's a terrible hell.

1143
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:28,940
Yes. Yeah.

1144
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:31,500
Yeah. It's really like titty cheap.

1145
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:33,780
I don't know what's going on here.

1146
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:36,020
Yes, it's really bad.

1147
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:38,300
Yeah, it sounds really badly mixed poorly.

1148
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,580
Like all of it are all across the board.

1149
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:42,260
Yeah. What are you thinking?

1150
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:44,340
Like, I don't know.

1151
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:47,660
Yeah. How did the world align itself in this way

1152
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:51,740
where this where the the white rapper Jay Bigga's

1153
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:54,980
not popular song because there is not a music video for it.

1154
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,660
None of this is popular on Spotify.

1155
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:02,100
This is not some like a thing of the era that I missed, unless I am way off.

1156
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:04,820
The three of us have never heard of Jay Bigga.

1157
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:11,540
So how did this sexy song about flexibility done in whatever proto pro tools?

1158
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:15,380
How did this end up in a Disney ice show performed in this grand

1159
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:17,580
studio singers kind of way?

1160
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:20,780
They must have just Googled the term, not even Google,

1161
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:24,780
like combed through a searchable licensing music library.

1162
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:29,860
Found the word flexible because these are also all covers like, right?

1163
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,300
These Disney ones. Yeah.

1164
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:33,340
None of it is the same for.

1165
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:34,780
Yeah, it's not the same version.

1166
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:39,300
So it says they're getting people to rerecord it and truly someone

1167
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:42,300
or maybe someone in the office knew it and was just like,

1168
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:44,340
did you say you need it?

1169
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:46,420
Something that said flexible.

1170
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,980
But I got a CD for you.

1171
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:51,500
How do you not just write your own song?

1172
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:54,580
Because they now have to like the other rerecording

1173
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:58,180
Jay Bigga and censoring lyrics like in their version,

1174
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:02,100
the singers just don't sing anything, thus emitting the lyric.

1175
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:04,780
It's not natural what you can do with your tongue.

1176
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:07,500
Like, why have why have they put Mrs.

1177
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:13,940
Incredible in the light of this like this chirpy white rapper dude?

1178
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:16,100
That's I mean, look,

1179
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:19,780
there's a lot of like online lust for Mrs.

1180
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:22,020
Incredible these days. Yes.

1181
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:24,620
Yeah, so I guess it feels recent.

1182
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:25,700
I don't remember that happening.

1183
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,900
I agree. It feels recent.

1184
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:28,940
But I don't know.

1185
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:33,380
Maybe this is like because it's really I mean, it's if you're working at Disney,

1186
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:38,540
you go, you know what we shouldn't do probably is put the really fucking horny song

1187
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:43,420
in the Incredibles part of or the Incredibles ice show.

1188
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:45,860
Like, you shouldn't do that for three year old.

1189
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:48,740
This is for not even kids, but for the kids.

1190
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:51,300
And I get it like no one's probably going to understand.

1191
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:54,020
No one's going to look that song up, especially.

1192
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,020
No, no, no. I guess it didn't occur to anyone to like,

1193
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:58,020
I really like this melody in these lyrics.

1194
01:02:58,020 --> 01:02:59,340
I'm going to figure out what this is.

1195
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:02,460
But that means, yeah, like if there was a big Jay Bigga fan

1196
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:05,580
that was also like really worried about protecting the children,

1197
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:09,500
which I guess could exist, you know, you in your private time as an adult,

1198
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:13,180
you enjoy the work of Jay Bigga and you enjoy the different

1199
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:15,140
sexually explicit songs that he makes.

1200
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:18,340
But you're very worried about your kids getting exposed

1201
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:20,700
to that type of content until they're of age.

1202
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:22,740
So I could see that they're possible.

1203
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:25,500
That's possible that somebody like that was in the audience.

1204
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:27,060
Yeah, it might have.

1205
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:29,300
People, a kid might have like

1206
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:33,700
or might have been having some weird little feelings like, like had the sense of

1207
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:37,940
like was thinking about bodies and flexibility and maybe I should look that up.

1208
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:39,940
And now they're on.

1209
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:44,380
Now they're in the very explicit album Laced Me Up,

1210
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:47,140
which, you know, gets more explicit.

1211
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:48,660
Yeah, Laced Me Up.

1212
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:51,380
What other songs are on this?

1213
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:53,860
I would love to tell you about the other songs.

1214
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:55,260
Yes. Let's see.

1215
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:57,140
There's Use Your Tongue.

1216
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:59,820
There's Nasty One.

1217
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:03,940
There's 357, which.

1218
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:06,540
Wait, let me look up the lyrics.

1219
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:08,660
I don't have them in front of me, but I remember noting

1220
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:12,820
357 by Jay Bigga because there's like a.

1221
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:16,980
Oh, yeah, the parenthetical on that title is Blanco Machete.

1222
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:19,620
Wait, let me. Oh, yeah.

1223
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:24,380
The lyrics are You Got Me Rock Solid Fondling My 357,

1224
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:26,940
which refers to like a gun that's like a gun shaft.

1225
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:32,020
So I'm so I'm going to hit your tonsils with my Blanco Machete.

1226
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:34,580
Baby, grip on the handle.

1227
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:36,860
Hold on a second here.

1228
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:39,260
Hold on one moment.

1229
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:42,020
But whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1230
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:46,620
You think that there's we've discovered all the ways to refer to pieces

1231
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:48,460
and then you end up at Blanco Machete.

1232
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:49,460
What is that?

1233
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:52,540
That might be one of the worst things you've ever said on the show.

1234
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:57,060
I think, yeah, I think that's more that's upsetting.

1235
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,780
Yeah, I'm looking this up.

1236
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:01,460
Is this a is this a common phrase?

1237
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:05,140
Can't be. And also being this is also I think nobody today

1238
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:07,580
is going to be proud of the like Blanco part.

1239
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:10,180
You know, nobody's going to like underline that

1240
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:12,260
as a feature of the machete.

1241
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:16,620
Oh, wait, let me keep going, though.

1242
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:21,180
I mean, hit your tonsils is kind of crazy, but then it gets to baby

1243
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:23,460
grip on the handle of my 357.

1244
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:26,980
I'm going to split you up the middle with my Blanco Machete.

1245
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:30,300
OK, wait, so there the gun is the separate.

1246
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:33,420
The 357 is a gun, but it's not also a penis.

1247
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:35,220
Oh, yeah. Wait a minute.

1248
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:38,300
Yeah, there's a gun and a what do you call it?

1249
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,140
Is a machete a knife or a sword?

1250
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:42,020
It's a knife. It's a knife.

1251
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:43,100
Large knife. Yeah.

1252
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:44,380
I don't know. Yeah.

1253
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:46,740
All right. So there's a I like hatchet.

1254
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:49,540
There's a there's a gun and a hatchet in play.

1255
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:52,220
And contextually, I think that they're both penises.

1256
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:58,740
But if hypothetically, some woman is gripping the handle of J.

1257
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:03,500
Biggest 357, then how also can she be split up the middle with his Blanco Machete?

1258
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:07,700
So this is either very poor writing or we're missing something big here.

1259
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:13,020
Well, with there being a grammatical error in one of the song titles

1260
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:17,100
and then and the name of the album being Laced Me Up, which I don't.

1261
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:21,540
That's like is that like part of a bigger sentence like she laced me?

1262
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:24,140
And what is laced me up referring to?

1263
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:27,380
What do you think is 2011 single is about?

1264
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:29,420
It's called Fucking.

1265
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:33,460
Wow. It threw it all out the window.

1266
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:36,660
It's the cover. So that's a great cover.

1267
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:40,020
Yes, a bed and kind of like Godfather font over black.

1268
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:42,340
But it's like a bad.

1269
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:44,100
It's a bad at a high.

1270
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:47,580
Like it's not a it's not a notable bad.

1271
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:51,340
His two thousand eighty broke inside and a much more interesting cover

1272
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,820
kind of of its time. Very, you know, photoshop.

1273
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:57,260
A little cool. Yeah, that's better than the than the Laced Me Up cover.

1274
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:01,740
Lyrics in general, very bizarre of Blanco Machete.

1275
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:04,020
She's baking me loot cakes, mommy.

1276
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:06,860
I'm not something Jason said.

1277
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:08,940
Come on. That's a Jason thing.

1278
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:10,340
Yeah, that's all you've ever heard of that.

1279
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:12,380
You bake me loot cakes, mommy.

1280
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:15,260
I go straight. I go straight.

1281
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:18,140
There's kind of a Brill building in Los Angeles.

1282
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:20,460
It's not really, you know, you don't talk about a lot.

1283
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:24,460
This is how you made money in college was ghost writing lyrics for J.

1284
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:25,340
Vega. Yeah.

1285
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:27,940
Two thousand nine, of course, like everything else, bottom fell out.

1286
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:29,580
You know, first thing to go.

1287
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:32,700
Wow. Sorry, Jay.

1288
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,580
You're going to have to write these yourself.

1289
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:36,460
Come up with your own colorful metaphors.

1290
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:40,300
He scrounged some funds together, got fucking out in 2011.

1291
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:43,660
But I think people have moved on.

1292
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:48,060
Even just further in the lyrics of the one that Disney used,

1293
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:52,540
I'm going to load that sexy body and pull the trigger.

1294
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:59,660
How you could reach back and handle it while the other hand was slapping it.

1295
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:03,020
It's a it's a very explicit song.

1296
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:08,300
And then just a couple of tracks away from a way.

1297
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:09,980
What do you hear? Are you playing one of them?

1298
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:10,820
I accidentally hit J.

1299
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:13,020
Vega. You're a little bit of fucking. Yeah.

1300
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:16,500
So let me just let me play one other.

1301
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:20,340
I think my favorite track on the album, no offense to you,

1302
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:21,900
are too flexible to be human.

1303
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:24,620
But I am a fan of pink chocolate.

1304
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:26,180
Here's a little bit of pink chocolate.

1305
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:27,740
No, man.

1306
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:32,220
Oh, I'm sorry.

1307
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:33,420
I how could I make that error?

1308
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:35,660
That was also you're too flexible to be human.

1309
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:38,260
Let me let me find now.

1310
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:41,100
Now let's go to the radically different pink chocolate.

1311
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:12,020
I keep wanting to hit the space bar and end it, and then I keep not.

1312
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:13,500
No, it keeps me.

1313
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,740
He's keeping me lasting, I guess.

1314
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:16,700
What does this mean?

1315
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:19,260
What does this portend for the year 2022?

1316
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:21,220
This is where we're starting.

1317
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:23,140
Message for the past.

1318
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:26,140
Means that the year is going to be so chocolatey.

1319
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:29,300
I like that this came an hour into the episodes.

1320
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:31,260
This is an interesting second gate.

1321
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:34,940
Oh, it's fun to hear my friends talk, my friends, the three boys talk.

1322
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:39,980
And then the last 15 minutes for these unpleasant songs from 20 years ago.

1323
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:43,820
It's like little this like slimy white worm

1324
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:46,860
threatening to split us down the middle.

1325
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:47,860
There's a lot of look.

1326
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:51,860
I found a lot of material here, and I have not obviously gone through this.

1327
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:55,780
One of these seems to be a cover of Katy Perry's Teenage Dream.

1328
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:58,340
Oh, no, no.

1329
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:00,500
I don't know. I don't know if I should play it.

1330
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:05,820
In his defense, in case things get weird at this point, there's another song.

1331
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:07,660
And now I don't know if I have the lyrics in front of me,

1332
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:11,980
but there is a song where he asks somebody for ID

1333
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:14,380
to make sure that everything's on the up and up.

1334
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:19,060
I mean, I know shows that the girl has just turned 18.

1335
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:22,180
So now they're going to hit it and spit it or whatever the hell.

1336
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:25,860
Well, I'm impressed you found that because the mix on all of these

1337
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:28,300
has been unlistenable.

1338
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:29,980
And I have to read lyrics.

1339
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:32,420
I can't let him speak for himself because you can't hear.

1340
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:33,420
He can't make them out.

1341
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:37,500
It's all like like because he's up here when I found it and going to find a.

1342
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:42,180
Yeah. And then all the music is like, you know, there's no low end.

1343
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:45,980
There's no high. Yeah, it's really. Wow.

1344
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:51,300
I finally read that big article that went around at the end of 2021 of like,

1345
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:55,060
why is music or why is dialogue in movies so hard to understand nowadays?

1346
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:57,220
And there's all these different reasons and stuff.

1347
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:59,740
But I'm like, oh, everything seems crystal clear.

1348
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:03,220
Thomas Hardy Bane seems crystal clear compared to these songs.

1349
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:08,420
Yeah. I mean, look, it's a there's a real finesse to this type of material.

1350
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:10,660
I mean, Scott and I are big Prince fans.

1351
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:13,900
Yeah, that's a man who could write an innuendo song

1352
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:18,060
or a song that might be provocative, but it wouldn't make you uncomfortable.

1353
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:21,620
Yeah, I want starfish and cough.

1354
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:24,700
Like I want something a little bit back.

1355
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:27,580
I mean, I think look, Jay Big, I'm sure has his audience.

1356
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:30,140
He's still posting on SoundCloud.

1357
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:35,900
So I mean, some of you might be big fans, and I'm not trying to say you can't be.

1358
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:40,100
What if he's listening? What if weirdly like, oh, yeah,

1359
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:43,380
I'm the only ever thought of those theme parks, yo, anytime.

1360
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:45,820
I love taking a ride on the teacups.

1361
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,860
That's it. I feel like that's not dirty enough.

1362
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:52,780
What you just said.

1363
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:56,860
Like riding my tongue around the teacup.

1364
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:00,820
I got to lick all the liquid out of the teacup.

1365
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:03,220
Why don't you pee into these cups?

1366
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:05,060
Yeah, that's good. Great.

1367
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:07,500
Hey, he's a pee guy for sure. Definitely.

1368
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:11,300
I think we can all agree Jay Bigga is a pee guy.

1369
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:15,260
Based on what we've heard so far, it's reasonable to assume.

1370
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:18,260
I love to pee.

1371
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:21,740
I want classier filth like Aerosmith's pink.

1372
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:25,460
OK, that's a classier dirty song, you know.

1373
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:28,020
And that also, by the way, plays in Disney World.

1374
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:34,060
So I guess Jay Bigga maybe is just following the precedent set

1375
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:37,820
by Aerosmith at the Rock and Roller Coaster when they would play.

1376
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:39,860
They would blast their song pink.

1377
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:46,580
They are OK in general with people exploring areas that involve pinkness.

1378
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:50,540
But I still don't. I mean, I don't pink chocolate.

1379
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:53,540
Like, am I crazy for not?

1380
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:55,780
Am I being a real good boy here and not?

1381
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:58,460
I don't think it is clear what.

1382
01:12:58,460 --> 01:13:02,580
Just think about what chocolate dyed pink is and then think about sex.

1383
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:05,700
And I don't. I can't think of what is like pink chocolate.

1384
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:07,740
I mean, I have some guesses.

1385
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:09,180
I have some guesses, too.

1386
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:12,220
I don't know. I can see why it didn't take off.

1387
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:15,460
I'd rather Jason said it than I did. But yeah, I don't.

1388
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:19,580
But I have a thought or two.

1389
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:20,780
I don't know if I'm right.

1390
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:24,780
Like he might be listening.

1391
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:27,500
I figure a mile. We're just like just exploring.

1392
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:31,180
Jay, if you're listening, we're just we're we're analyzing here.

1393
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:34,620
Yeah. Yeah. And please don't turn your 305 on us.

1394
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:38,500
Thank you. Or your Blanco machete.

1395
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:44,580
Use those things for good for pink chocolate exploration, not for violence.

1396
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:46,860
Stop frozen or stop syndrome.

1397
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:50,180
Help frozen, frozen and stop syndrome.

1398
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:55,260
Yeah. Did the Disney on Ice people hear the full album?

1399
01:13:55,780 --> 01:14:00,900
Did anyone listen to the entire or how about this possibility

1400
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:07,420
that some Disney executive was possibly like the parent of Jay Bigga?

1401
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:12,540
And that's how he was able to finance his record laced me up to begin with.

1402
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:14,460
It's possible. Very possible. Yeah.

1403
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:16,620
There was like, you know what we could do?

1404
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:22,980
My son. He could really stand some money for books.

1405
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:25,500
And yeah, he's expensive.

1406
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:28,740
He is. But I think I did some math based on his Wikipedia.

1407
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:33,540
When he's asking for a girl's ID to make sure she's 18, I don't think he's 18.

1408
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:37,180
Based on like somewhere I saw.

1409
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:40,900
And unless the birth year is not accurate on what I saw,

1410
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:43,620
this seems like a double standard from Jay.

1411
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:45,540
He's playing the under prize.

1412
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:48,300
Can you read this car for me?

1413
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:52,780
He's playing a character.

1414
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:55,140
He's embodying a character.

1415
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:57,260
An older shady before him.

1416
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:59,700
He what he's doing is he's playing an older creep.

1417
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:03,260
He's not the young creep in real life.

1418
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:04,820
He was when he was recording this.

1419
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:10,300
He's an older creep who's put in a position where he might be around underage women.

1420
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:14,180
So it used to take so long for stuff to come out.

1421
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:16,500
He would know like, well, you know, by the time he gets mixed

1422
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,700
and mastered and everything, I'll be an old creep.

1423
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:21,820
You know, right. Right.

1424
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:23,020
I would like to take these.

1425
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:26,500
If I could get just the stems, if I could get the tracks of this,

1426
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,140
I could do a couple of remixes, I think.

1427
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:31,500
And maybe McGruff would throw a verse or two down.

1428
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:37,780
Watch your mouth, kid.

1429
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:40,860
Pink chocolate. I don't know about that.

1430
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:42,900
How about regular chocolate?

1431
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:47,460
Delicious snack gives me energy for the day to take a bite out of crime.

1432
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:49,860
But I'm a dog. I can't eat it.

1433
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:55,500
So, yeah, man.

1434
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,900
Well, yeah, so many questions.

1435
01:15:56,900 --> 01:16:00,020
This is this is an impossible question to answer, is it not?

1436
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:00,980
Is this a thing?

1437
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:04,340
Could we send an email to Jim and Len

1438
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:06,660
and see?

1439
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:11,220
I mean, the answer is yes, and I want to expose them to this filth.

1440
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:13,100
I kind of think we should.

1441
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:14,580
I kind of think these are the best.

1442
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:16,340
These are the guys, the best guys in the game.

1443
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:17,220
These are the minds.

1444
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:19,220
These are the detectives to put on the case.

1445
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:23,260
And I think we I wonder because Jim has the extensive file.

1446
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:28,380
I wonder if we could get to the bottom of how this song ended up in the show.

1447
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:31,260
Uh huh. Yeah, maybe.

1448
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:33,220
I was a great bigger fan, actually.

1449
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:36,380
Polka dot Daisy Dupes and a big chocolate grin.

1450
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:38,300
That's it exactly.

1451
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,940
I mean, if God bless it, we can get that.

1452
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:46,180
Jay Vega's legal name, that that's a place where we can start

1453
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:48,780
and just start looking up, you know, right.

1454
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:50,700
Connections and records and stuff.

1455
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:53,620
I mean, even just asking Guy Selga, who has a lot of this.

1456
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:56,300
I bet I bet we can figure it out.

1457
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:59,500
I mean, if we ask somebody to do the work, we can find out.

1458
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:02,260
That's what I think.

1459
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:04,620
I mean, I think we could be in communication with Jay

1460
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,940
Vega by the end of the hour if we wanted to be.

1461
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:10,620
I think that's true, but.

1462
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:15,180
He like he might just have the answer, like, why is your song

1463
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:18,460
in the because it's fly is a song fly.

1464
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:21,540
Like that might be it.

1465
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:23,020
It was so fucking dope.

1466
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:26,060
Disney had to hit it and Jay Big had to split it.

1467
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:32,140
Jim and Len going through all these lyrics is maybe my dream podcasts.

1468
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:35,460
Of all, I mean, I would love them to recite all of it.

1469
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:37,940
Certainly that is maybe

1470
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:40,060
it would be the greatest podcast of all time.

1471
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:42,420
Bar none.

1472
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:45,300
I'm about to make your pink chocolate famous.

1473
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:51,780
What a note we're starting the year on.

1474
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:53,140
You know what you want to do?

1475
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:56,340
I didn't know I was just like, here's a funny Twitter joke.

1476
01:17:56,340 --> 01:18:00,140
And then we now we ended up deep in the land of pink chocolate.

1477
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:04,460
I was going to make a joke like my brain is mush until like the 10th.

1478
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:06,780
And I don't think this is correct at that.

1479
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:09,460
And usually something snaps me back into reality.

1480
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:13,700
No, you know, it's going to last longer because of the circumstances of the world.

1481
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:16,020
You might be back to normal at the end of February.

1482
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:19,980
I oh, yeah, we will see.

1483
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:26,260
Yeah, I mean, feed something to focus on, something to research on a bit, you know.

1484
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:28,580
Yeah, that'll get you right back.

1485
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:31,140
That'll get me that'll get me back to something.

1486
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:33,620
I don't know if it's fully reality.

1487
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:36,140
We'll certainly never bring up any of these terms in these songs.

1488
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:39,260
Yeah, these aren't going to haunt us like a ghost.

1489
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:43,100
I'm sorry, it's too late now.

1490
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:45,180
This is the year of the Blanco Machete.

1491
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:48,300
There's nowhere to go.

1492
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:51,140
All right. Let's just turn this turn this car around.

1493
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:53,580
No episodes this year. Sorry, everyone.

1494
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:54,900
See you in 2023.

1495
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:56,420
Hold on a second. Hold on a second.

1496
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:57,940
We got to figure out what celebrity

1497
01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:02,100
lacquer is going into this cocktail known as the Blanco Machete.

1498
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:08,420
So there you have it.

1499
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:12,500
I mean, I didn't think we'd get here from this one, but I knew that the image

1500
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:18,500
was profound and I knew it was going to lead us to something to pirate treasure.

1501
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:21,740
And but the pirate's name was J.

1502
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:24,260
Bigga, and he is the treasure.

1503
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,340
He's on the lookout for his pink chocolate.

1504
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:29,780
And much like pirates, he wields a big sword.

1505
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:30,900
Mm hmm.

1506
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,900
And I don't even know. I am out of I am on a gas.

1507
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:35,340
Yeah, I'm so we can end it here.

1508
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:39,340
I wasn't there. I am not exactly exploding with facts about like,

1509
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,500
well, and then it made it to Kansas City.

1510
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:46,500
I think we can be done with this episode about this one GIF I posted.

1511
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:48,260
I mean, look, it's a wide look.

1512
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:50,660
This is a wild. This is wild.

1513
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:53,980
I'm just it's crazy.

1514
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:55,260
I don't know what to say.

1515
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:58,940
All right. Well, we'll pull ourselves together and we'll get a little more

1516
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:01,900
professional if we can by the time we're back on the main feed.

1517
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:06,420
For now, you survived podcast, the ride, the second gate.

1518
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:10,620
I what I what can I say now?

1519
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:14,140
I feel my apologies, I guess.

1520
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:14,980
But we're sorry.

1521
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:16,180
We had to start somewhere.

1522
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:17,540
And this is where we started.

1523
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:20,620
We'll be back on the main feed in a little bit.

1524
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:22,140
Might still be a second.

1525
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:25,500
But this is a little treat because you you know, you went you went a couple

1526
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:26,420
of weeks without us.

1527
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:30,180
And now you're wondering, maybe should I go a couple more weeks still with them?

1528
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:34,220
It might be. Yeah, it might be nice.

1529
01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:36,700
Nice break. Longer break.

1530
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:40,980
Should I should we go out?

1531
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:44,900
We could like roll the dice on a J biggest song as the outro,

1532
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:47,060
like one that I haven't vetted.

1533
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:52,060
Yeah, I mean, I guess you could try to have the Katy Perry cover loaded up.

1534
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:54,100
Oh, I had it. Well, I had it.

1535
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,220
I can get it back.

1536
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:59,940
See if you can, unless I can find one off of laced me up.

1537
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:03,100
But again, just as we search for whatever we're going to play,

1538
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:08,140
keep in mind, this music is fully vetted and approved by the Walt Disney Company

1539
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:11,420
all to be played in front of three year olds.

1540
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:15,900
Jay Bigga is a proud member of the Disney family.

1541
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:19,060
He's a legend, Disney legend.

1542
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:20,900
Yeah, they're giving it to him next year.

1543
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:22,980
Really excited for him.

1544
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:25,260
Let's see. Yeah, I got it.

1545
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:29,180
I got it on YouTube and it's it's got 16 views.

1546
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:31,620
She's very sexy.

1547
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:33,060
That's what she's crazy.

1548
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:37,980
But I did what gets her into me is something I just don't get.

1549
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:39,620
I feel so lucky.

1550
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:42,340
So our new lyrics, she comes around

1551
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:46,820
around the same for your father.

1552
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:49,020
Wait, hold on. Let's look into the chorus.

1553
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:53,060
But yes, I confess, she's the best thing that I've got.

1554
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:58,140
And she said that ice cream and be 13 and tight jeans.

1555
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:00,340
And yes, she's better than sex.

1556
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:02,180
Let's go.

1557
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:05,220
The key is better than sex.

1558
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:07,180
Yeah, you heard him. Sex with her.

1559
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:08,300
You heard him.

1560
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:11,700
You and I still mix badly.

1561
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,100
Don't be shy.

1562
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:17,100
And we'll grow.

1563
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:21,860
I mean, that's I don't know.

1564
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:23,460
Do we want more?

1565
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:24,660
I'm good.

1566
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:26,020
We're good. Yeah. All right.

01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:29,140

And well, we'll do one without J.

1570

Biggest Scare.

1571
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:35,220
I'm sorry.

1572
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:36,220
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

1574
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:38,220
I'm sorry.

1575
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:39,220
I'm sorry.

1576
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:40,220
I'm sorry.

1577
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:41,220
I'm sorry.

1578
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:42,220
I'm sorry.

1579
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:43,220
I'm sorry.

1580
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:44,220
I'm sorry.

1581
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:45,220
I'm sorry.

1582
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:46,220
I'm sorry.

1583
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:47,220
We'll do it without J.

1584
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:48,220
Biggest soon.

1585
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:48,740
Happy New Year.
