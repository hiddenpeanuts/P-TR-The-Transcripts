1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,520
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate,

3
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,540
the theme park podcast where a couple of smooth characters

4
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,100
kick back and have a conversation

5
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,420
that's quite simply smoking.

6
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,400
I'm Scott Gardner, equally smooth as Mike Carlston, hi.

7
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,860
I'm so relaxed today, I'm feeling good.

8
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,680
Damn, nice exhale my brother, Jason Sheridan, hi.

9
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,540
Wow, that's real American tobacco, our finest export.

10
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,300
Yeah, the way they used to do it.

11
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,500
And as always, anytime we talk about a topic on an episode,

12
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,740
we endorse it full throat endorsement.

13
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,140
Yeah, that's right, it's literally,

14
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,220
it's covering our throat, it's smothering our throat.

15
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,540
The T-zone, the T-zone as they used to say

16
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,020
in all the old 50s ads where like four out of five doctors

17
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,560
tell you to smoke luckies.

18
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,880
Yeah, let's get that out of the way.

19
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,480
We are, you know, like does this episode,

20
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,080
is it an endorsement of the product?

21
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,240
And yes, 100% fully.

22
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,400
Yes, we love cigarettes.

23
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,960
Well, you know, not all of them, let's be, you know.

24
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,160
Yeah, cause it's those other brands that cause cancer

25
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,860
and impotence and some of the bad, but Camels,

26
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,920
nothing but.

27
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,500
Nothing but goodness.

28
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,340
Nothing but good times.

29
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,280
Nothing but solid smoothness.

30
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,360
That's why we're so excited to talk about,

31
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,080
but it won't be mainly about the product, I would say.

32
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,700
I think largely we will focus on the character

33
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,600
that this wonderful brand was forced to retire.

34
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,440
Yeah.

35
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,440
Yeah, cause the marketing memos behind it that came out,

36
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,400
turned out to be like 10 times more ghoulish than I thought.

37
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,240
Oh really?

38
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,960
I think inadvertently they picked up you smokers

39
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,000
with this cool, fun character.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,840
On the other hand.

41
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,680
You said inadvertently?

42
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,960
Inadvertently they picked up very young ones, I mean.

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,720
But then there were memos saying like,

44
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,700
we need to hit the youth market.

45
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,960
It's more sustainable.

46
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,800
Cause if you pander to the older smoker market,

47
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,600
eventually they go away.

48
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,840
But the youth market stays around for a while.

49
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,680
Yeah, I don't think anything.

50
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,920
Until they die of lung cancer.

51
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,560
Nothing was accidental about this.

52
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,560
Nothing was accidental, but they were like,

53
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,120
they were winking like in testivodes.

54
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,160
Like, oh I don't know.

55
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,640
They wanted to have their own Ronald McDonald.

56
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,480
And it worked.

57
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,200
And it worked, it's so fucked up, it's crazy.

58
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,240
Well yes, yes.

59
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,080
I'm gonna throw a premise into the mix here.

60
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,760
We're talking about Joe Camel, the spokes camel,

61
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,300
the smokes camel of Camel Cigarettes,

62
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,300
which was heavily around in America from 88 to 97.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,400
Our sweet spot.

64
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,360
Our childhood sweet spot.

65
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,360
Yeah, it was right there with everybody we love.

66
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,720
With McDonald Land and Chuck and the Disney gang.

67
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,020
Yeah, he was right in there.

68
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,800
I think probably a lot of people listening.

69
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,680
He was part of our childhoods.

70
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,520
Yes he was.

71
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,360
He was a lot.

72
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,600
He was very around.

73
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,680
The forbidden character.

74
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,800
Like I knew him and I liked all the bright colors

75
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,720
in the ads, but I knew like this is naughty.

76
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,560
Yeah.

77
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,360
You're not supposed to know too much about it.

78
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,880
Well, which this is my, okay, because you guys,

79
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,400
we were talking about it before we started,

80
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,120
that we, you know, you were watching YouTube videos,

81
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,040
reading articles about this phenomenon and this character.

82
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,040
And a lot of it is very hard, stridently,

83
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,880
this was the character designed

84
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,680
to make children smoke cigarettes.

85
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,520
Sure, sure.

86
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,240
And I think there's some truth to that,

87
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,720
but here, just keep that in mind as we talk

88
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,840
about what these ads are.

89
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,920
Because I maybe take a little bit of umbrage

90
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,920
with the idea that like, how do we nail kids?

91
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,840
A poor playing camel?

92
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,360
Yeah, well what do kids like?

93
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,640
Okay, well for sure billiards, definitely billiards.

94
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,480
I'll say this though, I liked billiards as a kid.

95
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,320
Yeah, I liked billiards too.

96
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,520
Billiards looked like a cool adult thing to do.

97
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,320
Sure, but you're both like, you know,

98
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,080
you're from the 90s by way of the 30s.

99
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,080
Cause we watched The Hustler when we were little.

100
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,920
Yeah.

101
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,880
The Paul Newman movie, The Hustler.

102
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,720
Jason probably did.

103
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,560
Great movie.

104
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,840
One of my dad's favorite movies.

105
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,680
No, I didn't see that until a few years ago actually.

106
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,320
I've never seen The Color of Money,

107
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,400
the pseudo sequel that Scorsese directed with Tom Cruise.

108
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,080
I haven't either, yeah, I've been meaning to do that,

109
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,840
digging into the full Tom Cruise filmography.

110
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,240
But like, that's what I, yeah,

111
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,960
you hear what I'm saying that like,

112
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,080
some of the things that we'll get to,

113
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,040
that Joe Camel is associated with.

114
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,560
I am a little bit, yeah, you know, kids,

115
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,840
you know how kids love,

116
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,680
Well teens though.

117
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,400
Like fedoras and swing music.

118
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,240
Yeah.

119
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,560
Like Gen X maybe more was being marketed to

120
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,120
than us who were littler.

121
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,800
I think, yes, I think that it's more,

122
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,000
That's still 12, 13, 14 year olds.

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yeah, I think it's more like teens acceptable for sure.

124
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,360
And I think there was, I think sure,

125
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,680
the idea that a cartoon character will be used

126
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,080
for this cigarette brand is going to end up netting kids.

127
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,320
I'm not saying it's a good thing.

128
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,360
I just think that there is some real stridency

129
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,960
in what's been written about it.

130
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,760
And again, just keep it in mind as we go.

131
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,400
As we look at some of these ads go,

132
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,520
yeah, you know what a kid would like this.

133
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,360
Some of the ads are really funny.

134
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,560
Mm-hmm.

135
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,600
Well, yeah, and look, that's why, you know,

136
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,320
I don't think we're here to moralize.

137
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,480
At least I'm not.

138
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,480
I think that we need to separate the art

139
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,200
from the bad company with the bad intentions

140
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,480
that produce the art.

141
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,280
Well, yeah, I can swear, growing up,

142
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,880
I got it from every direction that like,

143
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,640
this is no good, this is bad.

144
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,440
This might've been the main chunk

145
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,200
of media literacy education I got was teachers going like,

146
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,480
we're gonna do something different today.

147
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,720
We're gonna talk about subliminal messages in advertising.

148
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,920
And this being like a big example.

149
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,120
Well, but the subliminal part of this is that his nose

150
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,960
looks like a big penis.

151
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,280
Yeah.

152
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,120
It looks like a dick.

153
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,840
That wasn't explicitly said at the time.

154
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,080
Yes, that for sure is the, it's impossible to unsee

155
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,280
once you realize it.

156
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,200
That's weirder.

157
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,240
But like the stuff of like, yeah, cool parties

158
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,080
and like motorcycles.

159
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,920
Yeah, that's not subliminal.

160
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,240
Like he's riding a motorcycle and like.

161
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,960
He's got a cool bomber jacket on.

162
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,840
He's got a cool bomber jacket on.

163
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,920
His jeans are so tight.

164
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,120
Joe Camel's jeans are just so tight.

165
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,360
He looks like Bruce Springsteen

166
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,640
on the cover of Born in the USA.

167
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,120
Wow, look at this man, this camel man.

168
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,480
I wanna be a ripped hunk like this guy.

169
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,680
Look, I know that I'm a quiet seven year old

170
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,040
who reads basketball stats and Disney annual reports.

171
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,880
But he was.

172
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,680
But I think, boy, that's who I wanna be.

173
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,600
Vroom, vroom, rev, rev.

174
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,120
He did catch my eye though.

175
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,240
I was like low key interested in him.

176
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,080
Yes.

177
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,440
I knew I was told smoking was bad.

178
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,760
So yes, he was a forbidden character.

179
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,600
But.

180
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,640
It did not inspire me to ever smoke a camel cigarette.

181
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,480
No.

182
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,840
I don't believe in the brief period

183
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,320
where I would smoke one cigarette like every several weeks

184
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,240
and make a big show of it.

185
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,480
I'm stressed.

186
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,840
Jason does that too.

187
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,080
Or he did that.

188
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,920
That's what I've sensed yet.

189
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,040
You had a dark.

190
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,120
I would smoke backstage.

191
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,960
Brooding.

192
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,480
Improv shows that people were smoking.

193
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,440
I would walk, yeah.

194
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,880
Every two years I'd walk outside at a party

195
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,680
and Jason was just smoking on the porch.

196
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,080
And I'd go, what are you doing?

197
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,920
What is this?

198
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,200
It was that class.

199
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,240
It was that teacher.

200
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
The teacher made him wanna do it.

201
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,280
Marissa's smoking periods here and there.

202
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,120
Sure.

203
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,680
Well, that camel, Jason was like,

204
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,840
well, you know, it was the camel with the dick nose.

205
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,400
It was the camel with the dick nose.

206
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,240
It was cool.

207
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,960
If it's good enough.

208
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,800
For the camel with the dick nose.

209
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,840
Sorry, if it's good enough for this dick face.

210
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,000
The way, Harry, wait, I need to look at a picture

211
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,320
and just see where the cigarette kinda comes out of.

212
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,040
Because really it's as if,

213
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,600
if you wanted to recreate this,

214
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,200
it's certainly going with this.

215
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,080
You would have to put the cigarette

216
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,920
under your right ball.

217
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,760
Yeah, yeah.

218
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,280
Yeah, go take a look.

219
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,840
Pause this podcast if you don't know

220
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,440
what your camel looks like.

221
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,320
And it does look like he has a penis

222
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
and two balls are his snoot.

223
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,720
And his cigarette is hanging out of his right underball.

224
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,680
Yeah, and it's a flaccid penis.

225
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,600
That's an interesting, if we're talking about,

226
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,240
because it's the ultimate badass

227
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,280
and who you wanna be rev rev vroom vroom.

228
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,200
You know how I want a product that makes my face feel

229
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,160
like a not hard dick.

230
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,160
Like a droopy.

231
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,400
I don't wanna get too weird though,

232
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,640
but it does look, it has a good size

233
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,680
is what I'm saying, even not.

234
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,880
That's true, you're right, you're right.

235
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,640
Let's be fair, there's an implied

236
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,200
that when it's brought to full steam.

237
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,760
There's a virility that's implied.

238
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,600
Not virility, it's not the word.

239
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,680
Did everyone watch the TV Fun House?

240
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,600
Like re-watch the TV Fun House?

241
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,840
I remember that from the time.

242
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,640
The segment where it's like, Joe Camel.

243
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,440
It's like, yeah, Pokemon was pretty new at the time.

244
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,080
And yeah, Joe Camel had a big penis

245
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,520
and then Team Rocket's guys had like,

246
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,440
were clearly breasts and a vagina and a butt.

247
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,560
And then they would show you all the products.

248
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,760
And then as it went on, it would start showing montage

249
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,360
of real quick shots of products

250
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,600
and there were very clearly cigarette packs

251
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,000
every third image.

252
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,320
Yeah, the Pokemon parody and like tackling

253
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,000
that collect them all.

254
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,360
With some truth to the fact that

255
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,440
the Joe Camel products were unreal.

256
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,520
There's so many.

257
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
There's unlimited.

258
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,240
There's no way that we got them all.

259
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
There's no way that we saw pictures of all of them.

260
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,480
No, no, and I didn't dig super hard into the products,

261
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,680
but some of them, yeah, like if you take just his face

262
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,200
and make it, and I can't picture,

263
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,600
is it like a, there might be a mug or something.

264
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,680
Anything where it is just primarily the nose

265
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,400
and the face droops.

266
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,840
It does, like if you walked into a room

267
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,640
and didn't get up close to it, you would just go,

268
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,440
why does this person have a novelty mug of a penis?

269
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,280
Yeah.

270
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,760
The tone doesn't help.

271
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,960
The skin tone doesn't help.

272
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,080
No, it's absolutely what they were,

273
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,720
the artist was going for.

274
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,680
Should we do some, Jason, you have the history brought up

275
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,000
of Joe Camel?

276
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,680
Well, I have something about the art.

277
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,360
Did you come across the art, Jerry LaFaro?

278
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
Cause it was. Some of the art.

279
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,480
It was like drawn in 1974.

280
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,160
Drawn by a French designer for like French marketing stuff.

281
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,600
And around for a while before it came to America.

282
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,520
Not in America, I didn't realize that,

283
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,280
that the American run was only 88 to 97.

284
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,120
Yeah.

285
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,960
That's like, that doesn't feel right to me.

286
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,600
The way that he looms large, you're like,

287
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,320
he had to have been around for more than nine years,

288
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,240
but apparently not.

289
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,240
It feels like there should have been like 1960s,

290
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,760
like Camel ads.

291
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,280
Cause we feel like, you know, it feels like he was with us

292
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,120
forever.

293
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,080
Yeah.

294
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,160
I mean, the Camel on the cigarette pack has been around

295
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,000
since the beginning.

296
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,160
And that Camel's name is Old Joe.

297
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,000
Old Joe.

298
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,840
Old Joe.

299
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,360
He's just a regular Camel.

300
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,200
Yeah.

301
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,640
Essentially.

302
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,400
Yeah. It's kind of insane that the first American use of him,

303
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,400
I believe was in the 75th anniversary campaign.

304
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,320
That's pretty lit.

305
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,320
Like we're that deep into this product,

306
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,920
which I guess speaks to the like old tiny nature of cigarettes

307
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,760
a little bit.

308
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,280
And they, they, they thrive for a long time with this very,

309
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,320
like a kind of line drawn Camel that could have been on a

310
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,960
product in 1802.

311
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,800
Sure.

312
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,360
But then, you know, but now it's the eighties.

313
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,280
It's a different world.

314
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,720
We got to get cool.

315
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,880
We got to get like airbrushed.

316
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,520
And that's, I think what I did again,

317
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,760
if I'm just purely the art of it,

318
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,840
cause in the recently I've been seeing some of this stuff and,

319
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,280
and if you can see it in the highest quality you can,

320
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,760
it like it rules honestly,

321
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,800
just pure like however they painted it, whatever the,

322
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,160
I don't know if we're getting into early digital yet or maybe not.

323
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,400
Maybe I'm reacting to the,

324
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,560
an older school style of color and illustration.

325
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,800
Well, I came across the guy,

326
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,720
Jerry LaFaro who drew some of this stuff also drew like the

327
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,000
t-shirts with animals on it.

328
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,440
And if you were in the nineties, you,

329
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,320
what you're imagining is what I'm talking about.

330
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,160
Like save the rainforest.

331
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,320
Like save the rainforest, like really digital art,

332
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,560
dolphins and stuff sometimes sold at aquariums and zoos,

333
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,600
sometimes sold as fundraisers.

334
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,960
I feel like we have them at school.

335
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,800
You know what?

336
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,640
Jerry LaFaro?

337
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,480
Jerry LaFaro.

338
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,880
Jason, if you look up some of those pictures,

339
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,000
if there's a picture of a dolphin,

340
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,600
does the dolphin's beak look like a giant penis?

341
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,000
I mean, it could be argued that this is a little phallic.

342
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,600
Yeah, but they naturally are a little phallic.

343
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,440
Yeah, yeah.

344
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,480
And the camel is less so.

345
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,840
So, I mean, this was a more,

346
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,040
like more unnerving discovery that I didn't know that like,

347
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,000
oh, the same guy drew on Joe camel sometimes was also

348
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,600
drawing all those animals.

349
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,600
So there is like a connection with a thing that I knew and

350
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,440
liked.

351
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,560
Funny story,

352
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,200
a few years ago,

353
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,440
he was quoted in,

354
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,480
I think Yahoo News,

355
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,560
there's an article,

356
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,840
Joe camel illustrator,

357
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,440
e-sig maker jewels marketing seems more egregious.

358
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,280
Where it's because there is like,

359
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,280
there were jewel ads a few years ago.

360
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,320
I know they're like in trouble now,

361
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,480
but there is like hipster jewel ads.

362
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,320
Yeah, yeah.

363
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,320
Like basically saying hipster smokes,

364
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,840
vapes jewel.

365
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,440
It's been a rough time for jewel.

366
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,880
We've gotten some concern about the sector keeper's

367
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,720
wellbeing.

368
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,560
Yeah, that's true.

369
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,400
Anybody talked to him lately or he might be,

370
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,080
maybe he's not really reaching out just given that he's so

371
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,080
bummed about it.

372
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,920
Yeah, I don't know.

373
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,000
He hasn't been around.

374
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,800
I feel like he's been really depressed.

375
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,640
Yeah.

376
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,280
He's probably,

377
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,840
what I would imagine is he's going everywhere that jewels

378
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,680
are.

379
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,500
Oh yeah.

380
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,680
He has ghostly powers.

381
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,520
He would rather,

382
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,440
he'd rather collect as many as he can and hoard them than

383
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,280
hang out with us.

384
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,160
It's like Elaine with the sponge episode of Seinfeld.

385
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,680
Yeah.

386
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,080
Just a lot, but no laughs.

387
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,960
Just one very sad ghost.

388
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,880
No laughs.

389
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,440
So legit artists part of this.

390
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,280
Yeah.

391
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,440
Cool art that definitely as a kid,

392
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,360
I liked and was fascinated by it,

393
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,400
but it did give me a feel like a lascivious feeling.

394
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,760
I feel felt inappropriate looking at it.

395
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,280
I don't think it had to do just with the cigarettes.

396
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,480
I think he was exuding something.

397
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,360
Slee, yeah, it's a little sleazy.

398
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,240
This is one of our sleaziest topics.

399
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,080
I think we've ever covered.

400
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,920
Is this the sleaziest?

401
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,760
What are the sleaziest?

402
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,960
Like I just feel like,

403
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,000
I just feel like it's all very sleazy,

404
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,320
like cigarette advertise.

405
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,040
But I'm saying if we do what Scott was saying and separate

406
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,760
the, if it's just the image itself, is that what it is?

407
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,760
Is it sleazy?

408
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,720
Is it cause like Joe is so confident and like he's exuding

409
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,360
a camel sexuality that is making us uncomfortable?

410
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,240
Like a hedonism sort of thing.

411
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,480
Well no, but he's not like in the middle

412
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,760
of a giant orgy or anything.

413
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,600
He's in the middle.

414
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,520
He's in the middle of a pool hall.

415
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,080
You don't really see Joe Camel at work.

416
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,400
You don't see him with a Protestant work ethic.

417
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,040
You only see Joe Camel at play.

418
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,640
At only at play, yes.

419
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,000
Well here, let's try to, let's analyze some photos.

420
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,920
Here, let's, this one's like a classic one to me.

421
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,200
I think if you look up Joe Camel hot tub, you'll see it.

422
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,560
So he, I mean, all right, is this one sleazy to us?

423
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,560
He's in a jacuzzi.

424
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,160
He's looking over a beautiful purple 90s dusk,

425
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,560
pinks and purples, which I'm a sucker for.

426
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,200
Yeah, of course.

427
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,680
With a pack next to him and the smoking in the hot tub,

428
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:05,080
empty beer, empty sleazy kind of, he's ripped.

429
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,920
Well, if you look at those, they are fully human.

430
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,760
He's jazz. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

431
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,320
And I kept coming across that like his hands

432
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,560
would only be showed when necessary.

433
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,400
And it's kind of necessary the way this image is composed.

434
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,880
They are weird.

435
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,160
He's got three big dick fingers on the one hand.

436
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,400
Yeah, they're real sausagey, I was gonna say.

437
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,840
They're real.

438
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:31,080
I mean, there's other moments, there's one image

439
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,120
where he's like wearing an elaborate coat

440
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,120
and on the cuff is the Camel image from the cigarette pack,

441
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,160
like really small.

442
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,200
And I think it's one of the 75 years and still smoking,

443
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,800
which is such a grim, that's so funny.

444
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Yeah, that's something, if you take the cool N apostrophe

445
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,960
out of it, it's a statement that you could say

446
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,040
about an old relative you're concerned about,

447
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,520
75 years and still smoking.

448
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,920
Still smoking.

449
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,160
And you're like, is it killing them

450
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,640
or is it keeping them alive?

451
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,200
You know, it's where. Oh yeah, at this point, yeah.

452
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,840
Pickled, as they say.

453
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,040
Like you guys and Lucky Charms and Coke Starlight.

454
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,240
Stopping would be the issue.

455
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,520
Is their pack a day and their daily seven and seven

456
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,880
keeping them going, you know?

457
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,560
Here's another one.

458
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,120
This is kind of outside of the style.

459
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,920
It's a little bit of a 60s throwback a little bit.

460
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,200
In fact, I think they're clearly edging him over

461
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,480
to the Connery bond era.

462
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,360
He's in front of a surfacing submarine

463
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,800
or a sinking submarine.

464
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,520
Did he do something to destroy the submarine

465
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,520
but yet remained in a tux?

466
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,520
Hot lady behind him in a fuchsia one piece,

467
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,120
kind of a Daryl Hannah thing going on.

468
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,720
That's one thing about Joe.

469
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,920
He, I think primarily is into human women.

470
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,920
And human women are very into him.

471
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,440
Yeah, well of course.

472
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,800
There is a big party scene.

473
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,080
There's a big party scene

474
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,280
with a lot of lady camels in there too.

475
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,720
They introduced some ladies.

476
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,800
Yeah, when you get into his nightclub.

477
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,600
His friend, well then there's his friends that come up.

478
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,040
Well, let's focus on Joe.

479
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,640
Let's focus on Joe right now.

480
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,000
I do wanna say, I'm gonna shout out this YouTube video

481
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,280
by a user named Alyssa Erin,

482
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,720
the history of cartoon cigarette advertising.

483
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,240
Because Cool Cigarettes for a long time

484
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,360
had Willie the Penguin.

485
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,200
Okay.

486
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,240
And they say Willie was the,

487
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,840
he looks like a penguin in a tuxedo.

488
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,160
And his introduction kind of lines up with like,

489
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,160
oh, he also inspired the Batman Penguin in the 30s,

490
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,520
in the late 30s.

491
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,680
What, the cigarette?

492
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,640
The mascot inspired the?

493
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,680
Yeah, and I think when you,

494
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,880
if you see like this kind of,

495
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,440
Tim Burton's movie, Penguins,

496
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,760
kind of look like Willie the Cool Cigarette.

497
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,600
Right, right.

498
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,120
And his girlfriend, I forget her name,

499
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,640
but they were on like, you know, ceramic stuff.

500
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,280
They were on, you know, ashtrays and all.

501
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,840
Wow, oh yeah, geez.

502
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,840
I didn't realize this was around so early.

503
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,360
Yeah, and she played a clip in the video.

504
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,600
They commissioned Fleischer Studios

505
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,560
to make a short, Fleischer Studios who did Popeye

506
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,880
and Betty Boop.

507
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,760
They did a short of the penguins

508
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,600
in a factory making the cigarettes.

509
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,120
They make them.

510
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,920
What Mike loves are the Disney characters.

511
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,760
That's right.

512
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,600
Clean Disneyland.

513
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,320
So, but probably the most alarming thing was this,

514
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,840
I learned was a series of comic strips

515
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,840
from Dural Cigarettes where the pack keeps saying,

516
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,120
taste me, taste me.

517
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,080
But most alarming was learning that I am apparently

518
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,360
in one of these cigarettes.

519
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,800
Oh my God, oh, oh.

520
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,560
Whoa.

521
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,400
Oh wow.

522
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,240
Yeah.

523
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,080
Wow.

524
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,920
What's happening here?

525
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,760
What are you doing?

526
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,200
It's a bride and groom.

527
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,120
The bride appears to be like six or eight inches taller

528
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,680
than the groom.

529
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,840
Story of my life.

530
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,280
And they are getting married.

531
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,840
They're cutting the cake.

532
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,400
And the cigarette box just keeps floating through the air

533
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,800
saying, taste me, taste me.

534
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,480
And then at the end, they're in their car driving away.

535
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,600
How do you feel about it?

536
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,440
I mean.

537
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,680
What's your story of your life?

538
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,520
I'm more confused that they're just keep,

539
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,840
they have like four nicknames for each other.

540
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,720
Like one of your friends, Lamb Chop,

541
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,800
no Honey Bone, that's Dural.

542
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,640
Dural.

543
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,960
Who invited Dural?

544
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,400
How can a low tar and nicotine,

545
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,440
low tar and nicotine cigarette talk taste?

546
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,280
Try one, Mike.

547
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,960
Try one, my pigeon.

548
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,320
That unfortunately does seem like something I would say.

549
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,160
Yeah.

550
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,000
Ah, my pigeon.

551
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,320
My pigeon.

552
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,160
Yeah.

553
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,000
Wow.

554
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,480
Wow. Wow.

555
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,680
But are you smiling in there?

556
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,040
Are you happy to see Dural?

557
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,360
Yeah, everyone's happy.

558
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,200
Well, yeah.

559
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,040
He's yeah.

560
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,920
He seems close with Dural.

561
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,120
And then she smokes.

562
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,120
Do you like the taste, Schnuckums?

563
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,120
I do.

564
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,400
And that's the conclusion.

565
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,880
Driving away, just got married.

566
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,000
And she learned about a new cigarette.

567
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,360
That's what it would have been the scenario

568
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,200
if you and Jane had had that weed in New York.

569
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,280
Oh, yeah.

570
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,680
What do you think, darling?

571
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,680
Do you like this street weed sold from a car table?

572
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,000
This three-car Monte table, my pigeon?

573
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,360
Do you like this very legitimate weed

574
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,960
sold next to the police car

575
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,000
that they are paying no mind to?

576
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Well, so a rich history, evidently, of cartoon.

577
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,840
Yeah.

578
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,040
Yeah, Joe's part of a proud history.

579
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:09,040
I'm gonna bring into things my main piece of research,

580
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,560
which is, so I was,

581
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,720
I've been working with this very funny guy, Joe Carnegie,

582
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,720
and he was, I know that he has given some office gifts out

583
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,840
in the recent past that are Joe Kamel-oriented.

584
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,920
Here's a little notebook that has that Joe

585
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,840
in the hot tub image on it.

586
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,680
Wow, the hot tub.

587
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,240
So he's spoken of, they're actually legitimately liking it

588
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,440
from that artistic angle, that airbrushy angle

589
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,320
that I dig as well.

590
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,880
And so I said, okay, we're doing a podcast

591
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,360
right about Joe Kamel, what can you point me to?

592
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,440
And he said, oh, you gotta borrow this book I have.

593
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,280
Oh, interesting.

594
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,960
There is a coffee table book,

595
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,560
and this book is called A Kamel Named Joe,

596
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,760
the Illustrated Story of an American Pop Icon.

597
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,720
Wow.

598
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,640
And this book is pretty phenomenal.

599
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,040
I was into this thing.

600
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,200
When borrowed it, a lot of funny stuff about it.

601
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,160
The first thing is like leafing through the entire thing

602
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,040
where you get to see a ton of the art

603
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,760
and a ton of backstory and say,

604
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,960
even information about secret Joe campaigns

605
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,320
that didn't come out.

606
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,920
This is really the mother load here.

607
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,320
But one thing is every page that I turned,

608
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,280
I started realizing, oh, this book reeks of smoke.

609
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,560
There are pages that have not been like, okay,

610
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,040
so no one, wherever this book has been,

611
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,760
whoever did this, who sold it on eBay,

612
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,800
nobody has opened pages 87 to 88.

613
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,920
Because of the smoke has stuck them together?

614
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,760
Yeah, maybe.

615
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,200
Yeah, yeah, some of them might.

616
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,600
I mean, I hate to be vulgar, but was it come?

617
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,160
I don't think a preview,

618
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,960
I found no evidence that a previous owner

619
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,760
came all over the book.

620
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,600
Well, like, Jay though.

621
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,000
But they were sampling the product.

622
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,200
What were you going to say, Michael?

623
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,040
I'm afraid.

624
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,280
No, I was just gonna say,

625
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,360
Jason was saying it was like a lascivious ad,

626
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,240
so maybe somebody was really into the book.

627
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,840
Unless it was pages that I missed or just could not,

628
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,040
they were so sealed together, so coded.

629
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,920
No, I know it.

630
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,400
The pages opened fine.

631
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,560
Stickiness was not the issue.

632
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,920
I would just turn and then go like, ah,

633
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,400
just get the most stale smell.

634
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:37,360
But Mike, it is not the pages of the book,

635
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,440
the physical book that were ever soaking wet.

636
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,880
It is the copy.

637
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,880
The copy in this book is just dripping,

638
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,200
dripping with desire for Joe Camel.

639
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,240
It is crazy.

640
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,240
It is like so from the POV of people

641
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,400
who want to fuck Joe Camel.

642
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,840
It's wild.

643
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,760
Can I ask, does it seem like the book was written

644
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,320
five or 10 years later of a look back,

645
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,560
or does it seem like a book that you would cash in,

646
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,480
Camel cash, and receive the coffee table book?

647
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,920
You are right on both counts in a way.

648
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,880
I believe this was done a year or two

649
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,880
after the campaign had been retired,

650
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,840
but it was a book that you could purchase.

651
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,120
We can't use Joe in the ads anymore,

652
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,520
but I don't think anyone, you know,

653
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,400
Bill Clinton has not told us that we have to stop,

654
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,320
that we can't sell a coffee table book

655
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,440
and sell it with our Camel money, C notes,

656
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,280
is that correct?

657
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,120
C notes.

658
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,920
Yes, they were called C notes.

659
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,360
So what you're saying is this is like a eulogy.

660
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,360
This is a celebration of life.

661
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,080
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

662
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,600
At the very beginning, the book is very solemnly dedicated

663
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,800
to for Joe Camel wherever he is.

664
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,880
And then he started going, okay,

665
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,400
so this is so crazy, the love of this character,

666
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,880
that this must be from the company.

667
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,640
And sure enough, at the beginning, you can look up,

668
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,400
okay, it's from R.J. Reynolds, it's from the company.

669
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,800
And then there is a foreword by somebody

670
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,760
who is an upper level executive, I think,

671
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,160
in that enterprise, which, let me read.

672
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,040
Okay, so he, you know, because this comes right after

673
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,960
Joe has been banned, essentially.

674
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,960
And you might be wondering, is it gonna go over that stuff?

675
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,240
Are we gonna hear their side of that story?

676
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,240
No, no, no, it's a celebration.

677
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,080
This book isn't about politics.

678
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,680
This is quite simply a book about Joe,

679
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,440
a charismatic camel who became nothing less

680
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,720
than an American pop phenomenon.

681
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,120
And then the foreword goes on.

682
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,640
Okay, buckle up for this.

683
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,920
So talking about how crazy the popularity

684
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,160
of the character was, he got mail, lots of mail,

685
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,120
even got a wedding invitation.

686
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,880
Somebody invited, just like Doral there,

687
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,720
what was the name?

688
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,480
Yeah, Doral, the cigarettes.

689
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,160
Somebody tried to have Joe come to their real wedding.

690
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,960
And then, in a particularly telling example

691
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,560
of just how real he became

692
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,560
in the American popular imagination,

693
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,640
a New York City focus group of racially diverse

694
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,040
20-somethings spontaneously got into a heated debate

695
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,880
about whether Joe was black or white.

696
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,920
Joe struck a chord for racial harmony that day

697
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,160
when they finally agreed that he was, after all,

698
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,280
just a very cool camel and consequently belonged

699
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,280
to everybody.

700
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,680
What a moving, true story.

701
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,360
What a great real story that really happened.

702
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,800
And so insane.

703
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,440
You missed out, Euniceff.

704
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,640
You could have had a perfect ambassador

705
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,400
who belonged to everybody.

706
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,760
As my son gets older and I have to answer

707
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,400
some of the more difficult questions about our world,

708
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,520
and if he asks, what is with the racial strife

709
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,920
in this country?

710
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,400
And I'll say, well, I'm not sure where it began.

711
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,040
I think it had something to do with all of the races

712
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,720
fighting over who could claim ownership

713
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,760
over this sexy camel.

714
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,000
And then all his questions will be answered in that moment.

715
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,680
Oh, I see, I understand.

716
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:23,280
I would fight very hard to claim Joe for my race as well.

717
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,640
Of course, we all would.

718
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,400
We can't blame anybody for that.

719
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,240
Right.

720
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,760
Penis-faced camel in a pool hall?

721
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,680
No, we want the penis-faced camel.

722
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,160
We want...

723
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,400
We are all smooth characters.

724
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,840
That's what Joe taught us.

725
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,560
Yeah, I mean, you know, yeah.

726
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,920
And look, I think, yeah, I think it's beautiful.

727
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,320
This is a beautiful tale.

728
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,840
I would just get like,

729
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,880
when I'm reading sometimes about masked spokes characters,

730
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,800
the people who create them

731
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,360
and the people of the ad companies develop either love

732
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:01,360
or like incredible connection to these characters too.

733
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,360
Like the guy who was McGruff

734
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,200
but like was doing the voice until he died

735
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,600
in like late, his early 90s, maybe, when he died.

736
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,080
He was an older dude.

737
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,200
And I said, I listened to YouTube.

738
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,560
Maybe we played it on the first episode.

739
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,560
We were like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

740
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,600
We got every cut.

741
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,000
Like, you're like, oh God, somebody needs to...

742
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,680
Maybe new voice time.

743
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,600
Yeah, but I mean, I think he had a lot of like,

744
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,640
he created this character and it was like,

745
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,480
it was everything.

746
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,560
So obviously like this is lustful,

747
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,240
these crazy stories in this lustful copy.

748
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,680
Well, and that's just the forward by the way.

749
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:39,560
Because then the actual book is written by David De Smith.

750
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,160
Who is David De Smith?

751
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,200
Okay, he wrote copy for Joe Cammie.

752
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,120
He was part of the campaign.

753
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,120
So that's where it just made the tone of what I'm reading

754
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,280
make a lot of sense because it just started to feel to me

755
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,480
like the Mad Men, Don Draper monologues.

756
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,880
Like when he comes into the meetings

757
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,800
and just perfectly summarizes

758
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,560
not just what the product is all about,

759
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,800
but what this country is all about.

760
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,920
And as I started reading it in that voice,

761
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,920
let me just hear some of the better little snippets.

762
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,520
Wherever Joe went, a part of each of us went with him

763
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,120
when he was sitting six feet offshore in a lounge chair,

764
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,920
tickling his toes in the warm turquoise water.

765
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,440
He was just sitting in for us.

766
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,880
Yeah, you know, it's just really assuming.

767
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,200
I think even like, what is the average camel customer

768
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,040
think of Joe Cammie?

769
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,400
They're like, hey, look at that camel.

770
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,160
He looks funny or he looks cool.

771
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,000
Yeah.

772
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,820
That's the end of it.

773
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:43,640
I don't think a lot of, even people who buy,

774
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,680
well, because it's an addiction at a point.

775
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,480
People who spent the most money on camel cigarettes

776
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,080
are not like, and there he was, both father and brother.

777
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,920
Yeah.

778
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,320
Father, son and the Holy Ghost, all one.

779
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,040
How many kinds of embrace can one character give?

780
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,880
The answer is all.

781
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,200
You smoke a camel when you're happy.

782
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,520
You smoke it when you're sad.

783
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,800
They're always there for you.

784
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,520
It's like a carousel.

785
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,600
Jesus has returned and he has a dick face camel man.

786
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,160
There's water and there's camels.

787
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,920
Everything else we can figure it out as we go along.

788
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,040
If I got those two, I'm fine.

789
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,640
I'm alive.

790
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,120
Even guys with like a Joe camel beach towel,

791
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,400
I don't think we're like pouring over this copy

792
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,600
and being like, look at this man.

793
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,680
This is the ultimate man.

794
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,360
This is who I, this is my God now.

795
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,200
Like I don't think.

796
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,000
It's who I want to be, who I want to be with.

797
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,880
Never had feelings for a man before,

798
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,400
but is that even what's happening?

799
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,480
He's beyond man.

800
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,520
He's beyond human.

801
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,360
There has to be.

802
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,200
He's beyond camel.

803
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,680
He doesn't even have a hump.

804
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,840
If listeners are our age,

805
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:56,680
reach out to us if like your dad had our thing for Joe camel.

806
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,960
Cause I wonder if there were a couple of straight people

807
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,520
like dad really liked Joe camel.

808
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,360
Yeah.

809
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,360
I mean, people definitely have allegiance

810
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,480
to a cigarette brand.

811
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,880
Like I smoke parliaments, I smoke Lucky's.

812
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,160
But I wonder if it was like, yeah,

813
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,760
he had a lot of Joe merchandise and ads.

814
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,760
Like I wonder if there was,

815
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,080
there were particular enthusiasts of Joe himself.

816
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,920
Was there a man cave?

817
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,760
Was there a garage that was particularly, yeah.

818
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,400
Would you go into your dad's garage

819
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,600
and it's full of weird Joe camel stuff.

820
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,800
Not like a normal garage.

821
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,280
It's full of fries, electronics, liquidation sale,

822
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,200
inspirational posters and old Epcot signs.

823
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,480
My big memory of friends, parents who would smoke

824
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,000
in their house growing up was just that

825
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
there were ashtrays everywhere.

826
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,280
And an abundance of blueberry candles.

827
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,280
That that was what,

828
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,840
that's what we're going to cover up the smell of cigarettes

829
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,840
with, you know, Yankee candle, blueberry candles.

830
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,600
But then what happens is that you just smell blueberry

831
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,560
candles and secondhand smoke,

832
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,120
like in that caked in smoke smell.

833
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,280
Yeah.

834
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,120
And I just-

835
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,940
Which that is nasty.

836
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,040
Like the, I can even like,

837
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,120
I could still feel, I haven't smoked in a long time,

838
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,160
but I could feel the appeal of somebody smoking next to me

839
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,160
in the smoke itself.

840
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,840
Like, oh, that's a little, that smells okay.

841
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:23,560
But it's, but that caked in that just like tar, ashy,

842
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,440
what I was getting out of this book with each page turn.

843
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,560
It's so nasty.

844
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,160
It's so, like, I remember going to like, yeah,

845
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,160
sleep over at a friend's house and the parents smoked

846
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,880
inside the house.

847
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,040
And it was just crazy.

848
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,760
You were like a little, your little boy clothes

849
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,280
smell like smoke.

850
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,120
Yeah.

851
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,640
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

852
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,040
And like, yeah, you're on like, like sleeping on their couch

853
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,760
or something and it's like you're rolling in their fucking

854
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,080
like secondhand smoke that's like settled down on this couch.

855
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,920
Yeah.

856
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,320
It is crazy that in our life,

857
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,800
I always forget that in our lifetime is when like

858
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,040
smoking bans started and bars and stuff.

859
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,880
Oh yeah.

860
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,400
It's like when we went to college, like you smoke anywhere.

861
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,440
I remember being a kid, the first thing they'd say

862
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,560
at the host stage is like, smoking or not.

863
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,400
Yeah.

864
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,280
And oftentimes it didn't matter

865
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,840
because everywhere it didn't matter.

866
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,280
You'd get blood like right next to the smoking section,

867
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,400
which had no like hard divider or air filtration system.

868
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,360
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

869
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,600
You're just getting smoke.

870
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,440
My dad smoked a pipe on and off when I was younger,

871
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,240
but always smoked it outdoors.

872
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,160
So didn't really smell, would smell like in passing.

873
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,120
How often was he smoking that pipe?

874
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,000
A few times a day when he was smoking it.

875
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,840
Oh, okay.

876
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,680
But like he would take a few years,

877
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,080
he would stop for a few years.

878
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,200
He actually got off it in the last 10 years

879
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,000
by smoking e-cigarettes and then Juul.

880
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,160
But he changed a couple times.

881
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,000
Wow.

882
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,720
My dad's a cool millennial.

883
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,600
My dad's a Juuling cool millennial.

884
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,320
Yeah, it's got him.

885
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,320
How was the pipe?

886
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,120
Can I ask it was the pipe like, what did it look like?

887
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,160
Was it a corn cob?

888
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,440
No, it was just like, there's just like a regular

889
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,000
kind of like pipe you can get.

890
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,560
It's very labor intensive.

891
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,440
It takes a while.

892
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,280
You have to pack it

893
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,960
and then you have to get it going and stuff.

894
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,880
Was it like, I'm trying to think it's,

895
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,080
yeah, corn cob pipes with Popeye head.

896
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,920
Yeah.

897
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,600
Just like brown, like wood, I guess.

898
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,800
Just a regular like curled up pipe.

899
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,640
No, like a straight pipe.

900
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,880
You're never gonna get what you want out of,

901
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,840
I know what you wanna hear is that the pipe was like,

902
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,880
you know, 30% bigger than Jason's dad's face.

903
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,680
And it was small enough he could fit in a pocket.

904
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,520
Yeah.

905
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,560
And the smoke made sounds as it came out.

906
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,960
They didn't make a toot toot.

907
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,640
The smoke was silent, unfortunately.

908
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,720
I know what you're after.

909
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,120
I am after a toot toot.

910
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,120
I think that's absolutely right.

911
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,800
But I'm trying to imagine it.

912
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,360
Cause I, my grandfather smoked cigarettes,

913
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,360
but I don't remember what the brand was.

914
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,400
But he did not have a pipe.

915
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,520
You're really, you're pissing off the listeners.

916
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,440
They gotta know what your grandpa smoked.

917
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,280
I'll have to ask questions.

918
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,120
Write them all a letter after this episode's out.

919
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,360
I'll have to ask my mom if she remembers.

920
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,200
Yeah.

921
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,480
That was like just a few weeks ago.

922
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,240
That was the big news story one day.

923
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,440
It's like the FDA is going to ban Juul.

924
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,080
And it was kind of like,

925
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,800
oh God, why is every Democrat just Michael Bloomberg now

926
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,960
banning the big, so like, who cares?

927
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,800
Like you've already taken most of the flavors of like all.

928
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,480
I can't think of any bigger issues

929
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,840
that need to be solved right now.

930
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,120
But that was like, oh, this is,

931
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,760
this is stupid news story of the week.

932
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,560
And then the next day Rover's weight was appealed.

933
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,920
Like it's like, what the fuck?

934
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,760
What?

935
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,640
I thought this was a stupid news week,

936
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,560
not a horrific news week.

937
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,040
Well, they'll do what we voted them in there to do.

938
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,960
They're going to get rid of those robot cigarettes.

939
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,080
Yeah.

940
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,400
Are the big sodas still banned in New York?

941
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,600
I don't know.

942
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,880
I haven't heard about the big sodas in a while.

943
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,160
They might've scaled that back.

944
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,440
You got to go to a weird table.

945
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,640
You got to go to a little table.

946
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,240
It's got to go to a little table next to the car.

947
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,840
A former three card Monte table.

948
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,400
Former three card Monte.

949
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,080
You can tell, you see the card stains.

950
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:05,080
It's by the knockoff designer bags and scarves and stuff.

951
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,000
In Japan, you couldn't get a large.

952
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,640
You couldn't get a big one.

953
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,560
In Japan?

954
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,520
Yeah.

955
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,360
Well, then what?

956
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,440
Like a big drink.

957
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,800
You made sure to get a big drink in Japan.

958
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,800
You can't.

959
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,640
Oh, you can't.

960
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,400
No, you aren't allowed.

961
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,280
Didn't hit that T.

962
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,120
That's why, look, Mike, that's the importance of little.

963
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,560
That's why we hit those T's.

964
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,400
Right.

965
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,440
Yeah, I think most countries don't serve.

966
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,720
I think our small is upsetting in most countries.

967
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,320
I think that's right.

968
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,360
Yeah.

969
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,080
Mike's fighting for the right to drink full fat Sprite.

970
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,040
So in the, in the, the narrative,

971
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,880
like the writerly voice of David DeSmith,

972
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,400
I think informs some of the character because like, okay,

973
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,760
there's no, there's only so much you can glean from the ads,

974
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,720
from silent ads, because as far as I could tell,

975
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,080
unless you guys hit some mother load,

976
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,720
there is not some secret Joe Camel animated series

977
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,120
that was made that we dug up.

978
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,640
So there's not a lot of places to like hear the voice

979
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,480
of the character.

980
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,240
No, I think Nixon banned cigarette ads

981
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,400
on television.

982
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,680
I did find there is a Marlboro ad without Joe Camel,

983
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,360
but Scott, I thought you would think this was interesting.

984
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,080
Maybe this is from another country.

985
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:24,720
It's like a Jeep going through a jungle and it features,

986
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,880
maybe you know this man, Rushden Rocky Pamplin.

987
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,720
No.

988
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,680
A former college football player and model

989
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,080
who was employed as a bodyguard for the American rock band,

990
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,800
the Beach Boys in the late 1970s.

991
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,080
Wow.

992
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,120
Oh, a piece of Beach Boys mythology.

993
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,320
I don't know about Rocky Pamplin.

994
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,400
He's a hunk.

995
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,400
Like he's a all American guy smoking a Camel.

996
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,320
Geez, I can't believe they didn't get that guy up on stage

997
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,560
like Stamos.

998
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,120
That was the whole thing with Stamos.

999
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,080
It's like maybe we're losing our hunkiness.

1000
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,520
We need a ringer hunk.

1001
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,480
All right, I'm gonna learn all about Rocky Pamplin now.

1002
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,480
Thank you for that.

1003
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,800
No, so there's not a lot where we get a sense

1004
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,920
of the character, how he speaks or whatever,

1005
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,680
but this is where the book comes in handy.

1006
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,920
With some of it probably written by this guy himself.

1007
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,840
There were odd bits and pieces where we get a sense

1008
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,760
of what's going on in Joe's brain,

1009
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,600
such as on matchbook covers.

1010
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,360
I think they put out one issue

1011
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,040
of a magazine called Smooth Magazine.

1012
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,840
And I think all of these things,

1013
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,160
I'm seeing it on matchbooks,

1014
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,360
but then I think this was a feature

1015
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,440
in Smooth Magazine as well.

1016
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,800
Something called Joe's Smooth Philosophy.

1017
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,680
So if we're trying to tackle the character,

1018
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,000
this might help us get into his head.

1019
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,080
Here is Joe's Smooth Philosophy on movie rentals.

1020
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,200
The reason that it's so popular these days

1021
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,840
is that you can do things at home

1022
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,360
that you can't do in the theater, like smoke camels.

1023
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,840
So we know this about him.

1024
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,400
He likes movie rentals.

1025
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,720
I bet he's a guy who'd tell you to be kind, rewind,

1026
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,880
and smoke smooth.

1027
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,280
For a second I thought he was talking about,

1028
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,640
and again, I hate to be vulgar, but jerking off at home.

1029
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,480
Not in the theater.

1030
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,400
I think that's the implication.

1031
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,840
You think it's jerking off, not having sex with?

1032
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,360
You think that specifically, you know,

1033
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,320
because what a smooth character would do

1034
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,120
is pull out his watch.

1035
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,360
Plunging himself alone in a theater.

1036
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,680
Joe Gamble, when did the local video store

1037
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:34,280
went to Blockbuster, went to West Coast Video,

1038
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,640
got a copy of Hudson Hawk, went home,

1039
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,000
pulled out the gold bond, and just was like,

1040
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,560
well, it's Joe's evening.

1041
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,880
This is just for me.

1042
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,720
The gold bond?

1043
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,040
The gold bond, I don't know.

1044
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,880
I don't even wanna unpack that.

1045
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,920
Pulled out the Jergens, pulled out the gold bond.

1046
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,080
I wanna go on a camel riff,

1047
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,440
but I'd love to talk about gold bond.

1048
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,000
Man's best friend, if you know what I mean.

1049
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,480
If you're looking at non-nude scenes with,

1050
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,920
who's in Hudson Hawk, Andy McDowell?

1051
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,600
Or hey, teach his own, Frank Stallone.

1052
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,760
Sometimes I just...

1053
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,600
A big throng.

1054
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,840
I admire old Frank.

1055
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,800
I've got a big tub of gold bond.

1056
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,280
I've got a double date tonight.

1057
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,440
I'm watching Ghosts.

1058
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,240
I'm joined by Patrick Swayze and Whoopi Goldberg.

1059
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,040
Who's the love interest in Ghosts?

1060
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,360
Mm. Fuck.

1061
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,400
Well, I'd need more.

1062
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,960
Demi Moore and of course, my friend Nivea.

1063
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,920
The finest moisturizer a man can buy.

1064
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,440
A big problem is they make these porno theaters

1065
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,480
for you to go watch,

1066
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,280
but they don't let you jerk off in them.

1067
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,200
There's always a cop there for an undercover sting.

1068
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,080
That's why I like to rent the movie

1069
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:50,360
and go home and get a big tub of gold bond powder.

1070
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,400
Have I gone through a tub in a night?

1071
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,080
Try two.

1072
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,520
Gold bond powder?

1073
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,360
I don't know what to go.

1074
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,200
I don't know what to get.

1075
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,000
They have a full range of products.

1076
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,600
I mean, when I Google gold bond, I find powder.

1077
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,040
Yeah, it's powder.

1078
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,280
Yeah, but they also sell like lotion and moisturizer.

1079
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,000
Okay, so when you were talking about...

1080
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,840
You were talking about gold bond.

1081
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,160
I wasn't talking about using gold bond medicated powder.

1082
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,840
Look, you made an old timey reference

1083
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,880
and I assumed you were talking about

1084
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,120
masturbating with powder.

1085
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:22,960
Okay.

1086
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,280
Fair enough.

1087
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,440
Hey, look, Joe Camel.

1088
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,200
Hey, what can I say?

1089
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,120
I know billiards and what do you do when you...

1090
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:32,960
Hey, this looks like...

1091
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,120
It looks like I was just doing a bunch of cocaine,

1092
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,640
but I assure you I was not.

1093
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,000
I was masturbating.

1094
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,840
That's why I meant...

1095
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,440
We're just masturbating with a bunch of powder.

1096
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:46,680
You chuck up your pool cue and you chuck up your camel cue.

1097
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,120
That's why men were so irritable in the past.

1098
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,960
Why they smoked and drank so much.

1099
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,600
They were so irritated and then one of them

1100
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,440
happened to try their wife's night cream

1101
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,360
and we're like, this is miles better.

1102
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,160
Like their face cream?

1103
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,000
Yeah.

1104
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,680
It's better than powder, you know?

1105
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,080
Like what is this weird, what's this pie filling

1106
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:12,040
that the mother puts on her face?

1107
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,440
Ooh, are there other uses?

1108
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,760
Look at all this, look at this child's play sand.

1109
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,880
I wonder what else you could do with this.

1110
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:20,920
Oh, weird.

1111
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,600
It's just like setting up for an Olympic,

1112
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,000
setting up for the pole vault,

1113
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,080
different kind of pole vault if you know what I mean.

1114
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,680
Just toss a bunch of powder in the air,

1115
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,280
clap it against your hands and you're good to go.

1116
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,240
But I'm no sprinting involved, I'm taking my time.

1117
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,760
I do think we are missing an important piece

1118
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:45,760
of Joe Camel's vibe and that is he kind of fits into the,

1119
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,280
he's kind of a blank slate.

1120
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,080
He can kind of do any like relaxing vacation cool guy stuff.

1121
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,680
He falls into like the big dog, here he is like fishing,

1122
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,640
he's in a full fishing attire.

1123
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:04,000
That's true, he has a little of the Margaritaville thing too.

1124
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,720
He'll be in the keys and the capes and what have you.

1125
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,160
I was gonna say he fits into like the mold of 90s t-shirts

1126
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,760
of like big dog at Big Johnson,

1127
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,360
where like they can kind of do anything.

1128
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,000
I think he wrote that a little of that way.

1129
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,840
A little bit of it.

1130
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,680
A little bit.

1131
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,960
I feel like nothing Joe does in any of the images

1132
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,520
I think would be out of character for him.

1133
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,640
It's not like he's, I mean I guess he's James Bond,

1134
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,640
but he's also Jimmy Buffett.

1135
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,480
Yeah.

1136
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,880
Which I think honestly kind of lends it.

1137
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,720
Tully Mars is sort of that way, Jimmy Buffett's character.

1138
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,320
A lot of times there's like a Miami Vice, Don Johnson,

1139
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,160
kind of like he's got a suit with the sleeves rolled up

1140
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,720
at like a nightclub sort of thing.

1141
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,840
I'm trying to think if there's anything

1142
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,000
that would be like too much, like this guy can do,

1143
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,280
he's too much of a jack of all trades.

1144
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,320
Well, was there like him in space or anything?

1145
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,480
Is there him with like a shotgun, like shooting skeet?

1146
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,000
They're taking care of the city.

1147
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,680
Put taking matters into my own hands.

1148
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,960
Just joke, is Joe Camel a one man militia?

1149
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,800
Maybe.

1150
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,680
Joe Camel is the substitute.

1151
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,080
Joe Camel in Death Proof Five.

1152
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,000
Let me read a little bit of,

1153
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,760
let me go back into Draper mode.

1154
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,000
Here's something asserted by this author.

1155
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,640
Joe was nothing if not optimistic.

1156
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,520
He didn't sit down at the craps table

1157
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,920
or the blackjack table or the high stakes poker table

1158
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,720
expecting to lose his shirt.

1159
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,000
Joe was a winner.

1160
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,120
Whether he was shooting pool

1161
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,560
and clearing the table in one turn,

1162
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:37,520
playing golf and scoring in the mid 20s for 18 holes

1163
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,960
or I'll stop it there.

1164
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,280
Things just went his way.

1165
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,320
And that was one of the reasons he was so well liked.

1166
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:47,040
So here are some new facts about Joe Camel.

1167
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,000
First one, typically we see him shooting pool

1168
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,840
in a lot of the ads.

1169
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,440
What we don't realize maybe is that he sets up

1170
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,720
all of the balls one shot and most of them go in.

1171
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,960
He's like a trick shot guy.

1172
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,400
He's a trick shot guy, yeah.

1173
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,960
So he's, yeah, he's perfection.

1174
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,000
And that's it.

1175
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,680
Now you use the word trick.

1176
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,880
So it is possible to like,

1177
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,880
oh, I just know the mechanics of the pool table.

1178
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,720
I can figure that out.

1179
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,880
But it's really logic defying,

1180
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,200
gravity defying everything,

1181
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,920
laws of space and time defying

1182
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,760
that he can play golf and score in the mid 20s.

1183
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,600
Just to remind everyone of golf,

1184
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,440
like the par in golf typically 72.

1185
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,520
You gotta have a lot of holes in one.

1186
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,280
It is, yeah, we're talking primarily holes in one.

1187
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,960
We're talking that like a two,

1188
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,280
that a double eagle would make Joe go,

1189
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,880
damn, I'll get them next time.

1190
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,200
It's kind of in my head that,

1191
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:48,120
I think Tiger at one point got a 59,

1192
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:53,120
holy shit, a 59, but that's camel scoffs at Tiger.

1193
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,680
There's one king of this jungle, that's camel.

1194
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,320
This is like Kim Jong-un propaganda.

1195
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:04,720
This is like other countries dictator propaganda

1196
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,200
where you're like, he's never scored over a 30 in golf.

1197
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,360
Everyone's like, wow, he's amazing.

1198
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:14,760
That's, it's so kind of him to be our leader

1199
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:18,080
rather than to use his God given gift

1200
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,200
as the greatest golfer has ever walked the earth.

1201
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,200
That's similar with Jett.

1202
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,320
Like it's boy, he could be, he'd be cleaning up.

1203
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,640
He'd be the great, like by leaps and by like times three,

1204
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,040
the greatest golfer ever to pick up a club.

1205
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:31,880
Yeah, for sure.

1206
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,640
That's just, you know, that's one of the many facets of Joe.

1207
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,520
I'd rather spend my time getting the word out

1208
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,400
about a fantastic product.

1209
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:43,560
Yeah, Joe is essentially like the same gimmick is used

1210
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,720
by alcohol company.

1211
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,080
Like Joe is essentially the most interesting man

1212
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,480
in the world gimmick.

1213
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,400
Sure, yes.

1214
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,520
But he's a cartoon camel and he's selling cigarettes.

1215
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,400
That's true, he's a precursor to that.

1216
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,760
Everything that like cigarette companies

1217
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,800
they had to crack down on in advertising,

1218
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,840
alcohol companies never stopped doing, they still do.

1219
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,760
Who is the most prominent character?

1220
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,960
Yeah, well like is it the most interesting man in the world?

1221
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,520
That's like the most popular alcohol character?

1222
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,960
Well, obviously it's Clooney and Gerber on the bikes now,

1223
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,880
but at one point in a less enlightened time.

1224
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,000
Well, the Bugweiser Frogs.

1225
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,840
Yeah.

1226
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,680
Spud's McKenzie.

1227
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,720
Of course, yes.

1228
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,320
Spud's goes right with Joe.

1229
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,800
Spud's and Joe. You know they partied.

1230
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,040
Yeah. Yeah.

1231
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,360
Spud's doesn't have the,

1232
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,800
he isn't as lascivious.

1233
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,720
He's like sleazy a little bit, but he doesn't,

1234
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,840
he doesn't make me feel all my, the feelings I feel.

1235
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,560
What is that kind of dog called?

1236
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,280
Oh, let me look, I forget what.

1237
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,280
Bad ass.

1238
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,320
Spud's McKenzie is a, oh yeah.

1239
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,120
Oh, a bull terrier.

1240
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,520
It's a bull terrier.

1241
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,720
Yeah, I mean he was, there are cartoon,

1242
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,280
well, you know what, look at this,

1243
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,800
look at this ad with Spud's.

1244
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,240
There's sort of a Kim Basinger-esque woman.

1245
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,280
Oh, top dog.

1246
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,920
I went to the image and not to the Top Gun logo.

1247
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,760
Yeah.

1248
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,680
So this is a very, fairly like,

1249
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,040
she's hitting on this, okay, this is a real life woman

1250
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:16,040
with her arm around a dog in a bomber jacket.

1251
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,680
And there's a beer, two beers.

1252
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,480
The dog is drinking a beer and she's drinking a beer.

1253
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,480
Spud's made all of the other dogs

1254
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,320
go into actual flight training.

1255
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,480
They vomited at 12 Gs, of course they did.

1256
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,520
But you know what, great performances,

1257
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,600
can't argue with that.

1258
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,960
But you know what, this is obviously,

1259
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,560
this is still a little cuter and more innocent

1260
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,200
than the Joe Camel stuff.

1261
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,360
Even though that's just a pure,

1262
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:43,160
that is an actual woman with her arm.

1263
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,000
But he's just a dog, a real dog.

1264
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:46,840
Yeah.

1265
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,400
So he's not making like, a goo goo eyes at her or anything.

1266
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,880
You're more creeped out by the ability of the art style

1267
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,680
to kind of merge man and camel.

1268
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,520
Yeah, I am.

1269
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,960
Into one sexualized being.

1270
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,360
Yes, here's a dog in a Hawaiian,

1271
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,200
here's Spud's in a Hawaiian shirt, like pouring a tap.

1272
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,120
And it's like, this is weird.

1273
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,200
I'm not just, I'm not denying that.

1274
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,280
I'm just saying this is not quite as,

1275
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,760
doesn't feel as evil.

1276
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,600
Well, okay, where things start to get really creepy for me

1277
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,520
is, you know, all right, so I'm with him

1278
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,960
for the first little bit.

1279
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,960
And here is this one, one cool camel character.

1280
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:28,560
But as time goes on, we start expanding Joe's world.

1281
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,040
And we start going places with him

1282
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,920
where there are other man camels.

1283
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,240
And here's one that I'll show you guys.

1284
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:41,520
This is a nightclub scenario

1285
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,240
where a bunch of, just a smoking bar,

1286
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,760
if they were drinking anything, I don't know,

1287
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:47,800
cause the glasses are empty.

1288
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:51,040
But mainly they got together to smoke and smoke.

1289
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,960
So this implies a world where

1290
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,720
it is primarily upright camels.

1291
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,160
There is a woman working there.

1292
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,880
They do allow a human woman to serve them.

1293
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,360
But we got little scenarios here.

1294
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,680
We got two like arm wrestling ones.

1295
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:12,480
We got one with extra, extra limp face balls,

1296
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,400
who is kind of like a forties gangster in a white suit,

1297
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,560
whisper in a secret to one who looks like

1298
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,600
he's got those like severe glasses,

1299
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,160
like Slugworth in Willy Wonka.

1300
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,480
They're like, they're from all different eras.

1301
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,320
There's like modern construction worker.

1302
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,000
It's a real village people scene here.

1303
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,120
And then one detail at the top,

1304
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,520
this bar is in demand.

1305
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,320
Everybody, everybody wants to be,

1306
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,560
but hey, one rule, only camels allowed.

1307
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,680
And there is a detail at the top

1308
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:49,320
that a cowboy possibly presumably the Marlboro man

1309
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:54,040
is in a, has tried to get into the bar wearing a camel mask

1310
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:57,640
and he is being booted by a camel bouncer.

1311
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,120
Camel bouncer dressed like one of the blues brothers.

1312
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,360
Yes, yes.

1313
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,080
Hold on to that thought.

1314
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,800
More to come.

1315
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,600
The Marlboro man, of course the Marlboro man

1316
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,920
used by Marlboro for decades,

1317
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,560
much longer run than Joe Camel.

1318
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,280
Yeah, and he's a fucking loser and all that time.

1319
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,960
He did nothing noteworthy.

1320
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,960
He just dreams of the day that he can poke around.

1321
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,720
He's like, if they'll just let me into their world,

1322
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,680
their wonderful world for 20 minutes,

1323
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,120
I know I'm gonna get caught.

1324
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,680
But if I could just experience what it's like

1325
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,160
to not be this loser cowboy that I am.

1326
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,560
Take your ass back to flavor country, bud.

1327
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,320
It's just a name.

1328
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,040
We know it's a lie.

1329
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,400
All the flavors here in Club Camel.

1330
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,480
Club Camel.

1331
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,120
So this is where we start getting into

1332
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,960
that there are other characters, right?

1333
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,440
But mainly it's just, all right,

1334
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,160
here's a bunch of like generic extras.

1335
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,400
We don't know details about them.

1336
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,040
They're not personified in any particular way.

1337
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,920
And as the book put it,

1338
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,160
things were actually getting a little saving for Joe.

1339
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,280
Even camels can cry.

1340
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,840
Big pull quote in the book.

1341
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,760
Joe was in danger of becoming the world's loneliest camel.

1342
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,640
The hard pack changed all that.

1343
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,120
Do we come across the hard pack?

1344
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:24,960
Yeah.

1345
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,040
Yeah, I believe so.

1346
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,200
I always forget that's their name.

1347
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,600
That's his friends.

1348
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,160
That's his friends.

1349
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,360
And that's how they existed for a little while.

1350
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,920
But after not too long, they became more,

1351
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,800
they did what all the best friends

1352
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,760
ultimately get together to do, which is start a band.

1353
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,360
Joe Camel was in a band.

1354
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,400
The hard pack.

1355
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,440
And here's, all right, now I don't have these,

1356
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,080
you couldn't give me flashcards,

1357
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,120
but listeners, you can try it.

1358
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,480
You can run your own drills at home.

1359
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,040
Here's what I like about, okay.

1360
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,160
The hard pack, four unique individuals,

1361
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,480
each with his own style, his own instrument,

1362
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,120
and his own preferred kind of camel cigarettes.

1363
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,000
By the way, hard pack refers to this weird,

1364
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,440
that's like a functional term.

1365
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,000
A lot of the new campaigns were always about,

1366
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,720
okay, how do we push this thing?

1367
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,560
And that's like a type of box.

1368
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,400
I don't quite understand.

1369
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,120
Yeah, it's not a soft, it's like a soft pack

1370
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,160
you can kind of smush.

1371
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,240
Hard pack is, I think most modern cigarettes.

1372
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,720
It's a fixer, yeah, it's like a cardboard,

1373
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,280
a thin cardboard box.

1374
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:31,000
Okay, wait, I can't even picture what a non

1375
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,760
would just come in a bag?

1376
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,600
What's a non hard pack?

1377
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,240
No, you've seen it, like in old movies

1378
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,800
where a character like gives someone a cigarette,

1379
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,760
but they're like squeezing like a really soft, like,

1380
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,320
it looks like it comes like pre-crunched.

1381
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:47,680
It's just like a flimsy paper plastic kind of thing.

1382
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,520
Oh, okay, okay.

1383
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:51,040
I don't know if I've ever seen one in the wild,

1384
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:56,040
but like in old movies, characters will like hand someone

1385
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:57,800
a cigarette from a soft pack.

1386
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,320
Okay, as opposed to the hard packed in

1387
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,720
where you gotta like pound it against your hand,

1388
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,000
which might be the beat of a song by the hard pack.

1389
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,200
Why there's Busta on guitar and hard pack lights,

1390
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,840
Eddie on drums and hard pack 99s,

1391
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:14,360
Floyd on sax and hard pack ultralights,

1392
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:18,120
and Max on harmonica and hard pack filters.

1393
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:21,920
Maybe not a great idea to have two instruments

1394
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,760
in your band that require dexterous lung abilities.

1395
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,200
Ultimately, the shelf life of the hard packs music

1396
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,800
is gonna be limited.

1397
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,320
Perhaps a piano you might consider.

1398
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,320
I'm not sure what Joe himself played,

1399
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,520
but he was in there.

1400
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,320
I mean, I'm assuming he was harmonica.

1401
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,960
Well, but Max, I mean, they probably did double duty.

1402
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,520
We know he could play everything.

1403
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,980
He's like Prince, he's a virtuoso of every instrument,

1404
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,520
but he has to have other people

1405
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,480
because he can't play all at once, at least not yet.

1406
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,080
There's a, figure out a way.

1407
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:59,680
An image of all of them on a series of packs.

1408
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,320
Oh, they all got a custom pack?

1409
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,720
So there's Busta and there's Floyd?

1410
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,040
This was a giveaway.

1411
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,760
This was in a rancor article.

1412
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,160
I had some little information about them,

1413
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,640
but they also in the list of friends,

1414
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,080
they include a Josephine.

1415
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,880
I didn't come across a picture of just Josephine.

1416
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,400
There was a picture, okay.

1417
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,400
They also had their own lighters.

1418
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,440
Did you see those?

1419
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,280
Of the hard pack?

1420
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,520
Yeah, the hard pack had their own.

1421
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,120
Like each character was on a lighter.

1422
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,080
Oh, cool.

1423
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,640
But then I saw Josephine listed as well.

1424
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,400
And then I also saw them in the background of,

1425
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,800
and I should, I'm not being able to find the photo.

1426
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:36,280
There was a club camel photo with them in the background,

1427
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,040
but they look different than their like blues brothers look

1428
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,560
that they were in most of the ads.

1429
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,240
That's largely how you find them.

1430
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,560
It's sunglasses and it's cool hats.

1431
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,640
And again, this, think about kid.

1432
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,080
I mean, the way that they're marketing to kids

1433
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:53,120
and how much kids love the blues brothers

1434
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:57,000
and smokey clubs and harmonicas

1435
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,960
where they are weaponizing our kids' interests.

1436
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,160
But there's another mode and you'll like this mode.

1437
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,800
Mike, everyone will like it.

1438
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,280
It's the tropical hard pack.

1439
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,760
They got into that, that buffet,

1440
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,320
that coral reefer territory.

1441
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,160
You know what?

1442
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,240
Actually Joe probably plays piano because there's that.

1443
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,080
He is here.

1444
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,840
He had a, that actually, now that I'm thinking about it,

1445
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:21,240
he's got a very like a Goldblum at the piano look

1446
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,200
in some of these ads.

1447
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,680
So I guess maybe it was Canon that he played the piano

1448
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,160
before the hard pack came along.

1449
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,520
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

1450
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,760
Oh, and Goldblum's a perfect because they, you know,

1451
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,840
it's not just about the music.

1452
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,200
He's telling stories too.

1453
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,920
It's the charm.

1454
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,440
It's grabbing the hands and what can I tell

1455
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,000
about the hands and ah.

1456
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,120
Jeff Goldblum as Joe Camel is a good idea for a movie.

1457
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,480
Oh man, like a mocap that you can really tell it's.

1458
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:53,480
It's a Mecus Joe Camel movie starring Jeff Goldblum.

1459
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,800
Well, well, I have a band.

1460
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,640
I have a band.

1461
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:58,480
You should come see the band.

1462
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,720
You must, you simply must see the band.

1463
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,680
The hard pack, the hard pack.

1464
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,880
Josephine, Josephine.

1465
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,440
The longest two handed handshake you've ever seen.

1466
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,520
Have you met him ever?

1467
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,360
Huh, no.

1468
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,400
Have you?

1469
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,240
Yeah, funny or die.

1470
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,480
Oh, you had to, you had to kick him out of funny or die.

1471
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:20,800
You had to pull a fire alarm

1472
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,000
to keep him out of funny or die.

1473
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,200
He is exactly, we saw him twice at when Rockwell.

1474
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,160
Rockwell, yeah.

1475
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,000
Oh, you went to the show.

1476
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,560
We were in, we were in line and he just walked it down

1477
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,560
the line, talked to everybody and touched everyone.

1478
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,880
Everybody did not spend a ton of time on you and me.

1479
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,200
Talked to Lindsay and the women around us a lot longer.

1480
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,920
Certainly was a little more interested in women.

1481
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,080
Why not?

1482
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,560
You guys are very interesting.

1483
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,440
People pay to hear what you talk about.

1484
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,280
Do you have any stories?

1485
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,400
Any Cronenberg stories from the set of The Fly,

1486
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,240
Mr. Goldberg?

1487
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,360
Later, perhaps later.

1488
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,200
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

1489
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,240
Oh, what are those lines?

1490
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:56,080
What are the lines?

1491
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:59,160
I mean, he was doing, here's what I remember from that.

1492
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,920
He was like, there were two ladies next to us,

1493
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,160
maybe like a mother and daughter.

1494
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,680
I'm trying to remember how he got to this,

1495
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,280
but I will get there just by making it up.

1496
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,160
He's like, ah, yes, hello, what is your name?

1497
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,800
Ah, yes, oh, else and oh, and what's this?

1498
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,160
And what's the family lineage?

1499
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,320
Oh, yes, oh, your father, what is your father's name?

1500
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,760
Ah, Herman, Herman is Herman.

1501
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,920
Herman's Herman, it's Mrs. Brown.

1502
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:24,040
You've got a lovely daughter.

1503
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,400
And I know he for sure got there by the end of it.

1504
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,240
And I was like.

1505
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,640
Playing a game, it's a game show.

1506
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,040
Yes, yes.

1507
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:31,040
I took, I.

1508
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,040
Doing a live Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.

1509
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,440
I took my friend to see him too when he was in town

1510
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,560
and we went up to him afterward,

1511
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:40,840
right after Grand Budapest Hotel came out.

1512
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,160
And he was, my friend, I don't know,

1513
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,120
we were talking with him.

1514
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,840
He's like, oh, the movie was great.

1515
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,120
That's right, he's in Budapest, right?

1516
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:47,960
Yeah.

1517
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,240
And he's like, ah, yes, isn't it wonderful?

1518
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,960
It's a wonderful film, isn't it?

1519
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:51,960
Isn't it great?

1520
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,080
Oh, isn't it?

1521
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:56,120
It's just so great, great to be in that film or whatever.

1522
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,440
But there were no women around, so he did.

1523
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,200
Yes, yes, great West, the great West.

1524
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:02,520
So Wesley, Mr. Belvedere, Streets of China,

1525
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:03,720
I never met him before.

1526
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,200
But he's.

1527
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,520
I've ever.

1528
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,440
He is, he's that way all the time.

1529
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,800
Is there still, is my video still,

1530
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:16,600
I pulled a video, an early post on YouTube for me.

1531
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,200
Oh, it's, oh, here it is, okay.

1532
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,680
This is a seven second clip that I put on YouTube

1533
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,160
forever ago.

1534
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,160
Here's just, it's a little flavor of,

1535
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:29,440
this is Jeff Goldblum doing some scat jazz piano

1536
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,080
on the Howie Mandel show.

1537
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,200
I think we remember the.

1538
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,040
I've always been coming up on this show lately.

1539
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:38,320
Thank God, we're only heading into good territory.

1540
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,920
All right, Jeff Goldblum scatting.

1541
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:40,920
Oh, I like it.

1542
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,240
Now I can.

1543
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,360
Have I brought up the Aerosmith Goldblum clip?

1544
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,520
I have, right?

1545
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,200
You have brought it up, I believe, yes.

1546
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,040
On the show.

1547
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,360
Yeah, I think like two weeks ago.

1548
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:58,320
You brought it up.

1549
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,640
Jurassic Blues.

1550
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,040
Yeah.

1551
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,080
What is it?

1552
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,400
What up?

1553
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,240
I forget, but it's like really that.

1554
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,040
Oh, we got an ad here.

1555
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:11,160
Jurassic Blues, it's only, there's a 42 second clip

1556
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,240
on the YouTube channel, Jurassic Finds.

1557
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,080
I mean, we'll play a clip of this.

1558
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,720
Jeff is just jamming on the piano next to Steven Tyler.

1559
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,320
They're playing Big Ten Inch.

1560
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:26,800
I don't know why it's called.

1561
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:34,200
I think there's a better clip.

1562
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,400
I'll edit that in.

1563
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:40,040
What's he's just jamming with him?

1564
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:40,880
He's up, he's up.

1565
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,120
He's wearing his like lost world era outfit

1566
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,040
with the leather jacket and the white shirt.

1567
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,160
Cool.

1568
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,640
And Steven is shirtless and they're just,

1569
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,280
he's at the front of the, I don't know how this came about,

1570
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,280
but he's at the front of the stage with an electric piano

1571
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,040
and they're jamming out and.

1572
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,520
And that's just what, that's what American bad assery

1573
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,080
looks like to cancel it.

1574
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:04,920
There it is.

1575
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,480
Tyler Goldblum together.

1576
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,840
That's man in man.

1577
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,640
Wait a minute.

1578
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,440
Why are we playing Jeff Goldblum?

1579
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:21,440
Guys, guys, the hard pack was not just a band in pictures.

1580
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:28,000
The hard pack put their money where their penis mouths are.

1581
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,320
And they made an album, the album meet the hard pack.

1582
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:34,720
Do you want to hear a little clip of meet the hard pack?

1583
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:39,720
An album available exclusively via C notes, camel cash.

1584
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,000
By the way, you can buy on eBay,

1585
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,760
like 300 C notes for five bucks right now.

1586
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,240
So I don't think they have any legal.

1587
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,080
The conversion rate is getting better.

1588
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,720
Yeah, there's no conversion rate.

1589
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,240
It's like Confederate money.

1590
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,800
Like you can't really do anything with it.

1591
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,640
No, it's actually crazy.

1592
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,240
No, I get like all the headlines are about crypto crash

1593
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,040
and everything, but what you don't realize

1594
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,360
the next thing is going to be camel cash.

1595
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:02,560
Camel cash from the 90s.

1596
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:04,920
That's the new, it's like, wait, I knew,

1597
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,160
I knew crypto was gonna go away.

1598
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:09,000
It's just, it's, but see, that's the new C.

1599
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,760
Just add the customer service desk at a Cole's baking.

1600
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,440
Like, please convert my C notes to Cole's cash.

1601
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:15,440
Please help me.

1602
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:21,040
So here's a little taste of meet the hard pack.

1603
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:25,000
I got the empty lava blue.

1604
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I have no butane.

1605
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,240
Every time I hear blues, I have no butane.

1606
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,480
Well, it hit an ad and that might be for the best.

1607
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:42,560
I believe me when I say that doesn't go anywhere.

1608
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,440
This is just in case, like I was very excited to discover

1609
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,160
there was this album.

1610
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,280
However, in case you were thinking

1611
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:53,280
there was a spiritual error to the McGruff album.

1612
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,840
It isn't, that's the most interesting song by far.

1613
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,640
There's a couple of tracks that somebody's pulled

1614
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:02,000
on SoundCloud, which is a flagrant violation of the seed,

1615
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,320
the camel cash system.

1616
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,920
That's the only way that you were able to access

1617
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,080
this incredible music.

1618
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:11,200
Joe Camel and Metallica teamed up in the early 2000s

1619
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,400
to try to get rid of streaming.

1620
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,600
Shared interest here, man.

1621
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,080
Broken lighter blues.

1622
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:22,520
Gonna get myself some striking matches

1623
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,920
before this lighter drives me insane.

1624
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,120
One of the interesting things though,

1625
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,800
is that that might be Joe's voice.

1626
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:30,640
That might be the only time.

1627
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:31,680
That was my question.

1628
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,840
Yeah, it doesn't say.

1629
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:37,440
Although do we know, were there like liner notes

1630
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,280
on the actual album maybe that would say specifically

1631
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,720
who sung what?

1632
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:42,560
I don't believe so.

1633
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,640
I did check discogs.com.

1634
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,520
I think nobody has archived this.

1635
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:47,800
I think you're in a different world

1636
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:52,520
when you're mainly exchanging camel bucks for camel albums.

1637
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:53,800
So I would have loved to have known.

1638
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,560
Although, still from this book is let me know

1639
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:59,080
that Max's last name, the harmonica player,

1640
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,480
his name is Max Match Books.

1641
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:03,560
That's good.

1642
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:06,040
I'm not sure if they all got last names.

1643
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,720
Yeah, it's possible.

1644
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,320
It's possible they did.

1645
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:13,280
Did we all come across the kind of exhausting

1646
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,840
ad busters riff?

1647
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,480
Does everyone remember ad busters?

1648
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,320
Sort of.

1649
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,600
They were magazines,

1650
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,720
there was a magazine and they were kind of,

1651
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:24,480
you know, Photoshop ads, you know,

1652
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,800
cause advertising was just so,

1653
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:30,000
like it seems charming in the 90s.

1654
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,200
Like what they considered like,

1655
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,960
this is so insidious, advertising is so insidious.

1656
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,440
They kind of went with the low hanging fruit

1657
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:40,360
with Joe Kimo for this.

1658
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,400
It's pretty lazy.

1659
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:45,200
Meanwhile, in 2022, this just came out a few hours ago,

1660
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,880
a vice article that says leaked video show Disney

1661
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,680
is the biggest ad tech giant you've never heard of

1662
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:56,560
with a bunch of internal Disney videos

1663
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:58,960
featuring Baymax and Bunsen Honeydew

1664
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,000
telling you about what a great product

1665
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,920
their ad vying network is.

1666
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:04,840
Oh boy.

1667
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:05,680
Yeah.

1668
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,600
Internal videos starring Bay and Bunsen.

1669
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,840
Starring Edna Mode.

1670
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:10,680
Edna, what?

1671
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:11,520
Edna Mode?

1672
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,480
Yeah, Edna Mode, yeah.

1673
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:13,320
Mode, okay.

1674
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,800
Yeah, here she is talking about planning,

1675
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:20,480
activation, reach and frequency management.

1676
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,560
I'm still gonna say that cigarette ads are worse.

1677
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:24,680
Cigarette ads are pretty bad,

1678
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:28,440
but these are like weirdly more invasive

1679
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:29,600
in your daily life.

1680
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:33,280
Like the way ads just play on the internet

1681
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,960
or before videos and stuff.

1682
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,720
I guess we found the answer of what Disney will do

1683
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,800
with the Muppets.

1684
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,640
Yeah.

1685
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,280
Internal corporate ad by,

1686
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,160
hey, he ran for president.

1687
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:51,440
He, with the camel party,

1688
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,240
the party that knows how to party.

1689
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,720
Hey, I'd vote for him at this point.

1690
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,560
Let's take his win.

1691
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,040
Let's get a smoker in the White House.

1692
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,640
Although I guess Obama was a smoker secretly, so.

1693
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,040
It wasn't long ago.

1694
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,640
And that was a thing like,

1695
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,080
oh, will he be able to win?

1696
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:13,920
He smokes a cigarette once in the blue moon.

1697
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:14,760
Right, right.

1698
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:15,600
You know?

1699
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:17,800
Everything has really changed in a few years.

1700
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:18,640
Yeah.

1701
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:19,480
Really fast.

1702
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,320
What the public will, yeah.

1703
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,320
Look, look.

1704
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,160
But the thing, you know, we know this other guy.

1705
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,880
It's part of his brand that he casually commits

1706
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,080
five crimes a day without realizing it.

1707
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,400
Obama knows better than to smoke

1708
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,680
and wear a kind of suit we don't like for some reason.

1709
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:36,680
That's right, yeah.

1710
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:38,960
Your C notes will go to good use

1711
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:40,920
as we take our message to the people.

1712
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:41,880
It's gonna be a tough race,

1713
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,360
but I'm sure with a little luck,

1714
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:44,960
the best party will win.

1715
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:45,800
Joe.

1716
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,960
And then his signature, which also appears in the book,

1717
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,240
the J is smoking.

1718
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:56,240
It's like a ball jowl within the J.

1719
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,160
It's just, you can't, it's so funny.

1720
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,640
Like so much, it's just so funny.

1721
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:03,480
That's what I'm saying.

1722
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:06,440
The more I'm reading it, like, hey, I love everything.

1723
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:10,080
I can tell why this guy's so in love with his own work.

1724
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:14,840
And then we get to a chapter.

1725
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,240
First of all, okay, let me go back

1726
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,360
to something I read earlier.

1727
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:20,280
Joe was in danger of becoming the world's loneliest camel.

1728
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:21,960
The heart pack changed all that.

1729
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:26,960
The loneliness, as with any, if you're a good man,

1730
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:31,120
your loneliness is cured by getting a blues band together,

1731
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,520
not by having a life partner.

1732
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:36,160
That wasn't the good, no, no, no,

1733
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:37,880
that's not gonna, how loneliness, who cares?

1734
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,560
I got my gold bond, I'm sick.

1735
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,520
You got your blues brand.

1736
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,360
You play your songs about like how Prilo Sec

1737
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,640
helps your heart burn.

1738
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,640
You do try that Prilo Sec.

1739
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,060
Lipitor, da da da.

1740
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:58,240
But he, you know, there was maybe desire

1741
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:00,600
for a little bit more in his life.

1742
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,000
And that's why we get, then we get to this chapter,

1743
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:07,160
an idea whose time hadn't come.

1744
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,480
Big capital letters coming.

1745
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:11,400
And this is the chapter that addresses

1746
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,040
why is there not a female Joe camel.

1747
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,120
Okay, so Josephine was brought up.

1748
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,480
I did not come across Josephine.

1749
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,200
I don't think Josephine was even in the book.

1750
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:22,120
Josephine thrown under the bus, not part of history.

1751
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:25,680
What I learned about in the book was a character

1752
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:29,080
by the name of TJ.

1753
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,520
Here's TJ.

1754
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:35,640
If anybody has a descriptor you wanna throw in,

1755
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:38,200
I mean it's like, well here's what,

1756
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,600
very airbrushy drawing.

1757
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,000
And if I covered up the head, you'd go, oh hello.

1758
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,080
90s cocktail, like kind of like Sharon Stone dress

1759
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:49,080
with a pool cue.

1760
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,680
Wow, and then you keep, then I remove my hands

1761
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:55,720
to reveal the big eyed camel face.

1762
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:58,520
This is, what do we think of TJ?

1763
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:01,400
TJ is, I'm trying to think, she looks almost like

1764
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,600
a planet of the apes ape.

1765
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,840
Oh yeah, like Helena Bonham Carter.

1766
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:06,840
Yeah.

1767
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:10,400
She's got, her arms are very long.

1768
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,240
Yeah, extremely.

1769
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:13,840
Normally long, which I guess is cause of the camel,

1770
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,200
half being a half camel.

1771
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,480
She's got kind of, yeah, yeah.

1772
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:20,760
Or just like statuesque, like a Kate Upton or something.

1773
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:23,360
Just like a tall woman, certainly.

1774
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:24,600
But like she almost looks like she has

1775
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,880
like Navi length arms.

1776
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:29,720
She looks maybe like a Navi in the size.

1777
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,960
Oh, and by the way, if you couldn't tell from the ads,

1778
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:35,760
cause I'm only with other camels, I'm 14 feet tall.

1779
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,600
Yeah.

1780
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,440
We all are.

1781
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:43,440
She's doing the thing with the pool cue.

1782
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,280
Mm-hmm.

1783
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:45,120
At the top.

1784
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,840
Oh, she's chalking, you know Joe likes that.

1785
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,040
Yeah, yeah, and she's giving like sort of a little bit

1786
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,080
of a flirty look at the camera.

1787
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:52,840
Mm-hmm, big earrings.

1788
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,800
TJ, does TJ stand for something?

1789
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:55,640
I don't know.

1790
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:56,480
I mean, that I couldn't figure out.

1791
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,440
Yeah, I don't know.

1792
01:11:58,440 --> 01:11:59,800
The joy of smoking.

1793
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:00,800
The joy of smoking.

1794
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:01,800
The joy of smoking.

1795
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:02,800
The joy of smoking.

1796
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:03,800
The joy of smoking.

1797
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,640
TJ, the chapter about TJ is just like,

1798
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,000
hey, look, we tried and it didn't work out.

1799
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,640
They tried one ad with TJ.

1800
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:14,920
There was, you know, we know Joe likes motorcycles, right?

1801
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:19,160
So they had her riding behind him, arms around him.

1802
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:22,680
And a lot of the copy, a lot of what they were saying is,

1803
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:26,400
there was a bunch of like pseudo feminist,

1804
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:29,880
but not really jargon about like, and she's no fool.

1805
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:33,000
And she doesn't take no crap from anybody.

1806
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,240
So when she was behind him on the motorcycle,

1807
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,680
that's not the character.

1808
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:41,800
That's not the 90s woman that we're painting with TJ.

1809
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:44,280
So they switched it and they put her in front

1810
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,520
of the motorcycle with Joe behind.

1811
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,920
And everybody at Camel was like, no, it's worse.

1812
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:49,920
That's weirder.

1813
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,000
Kill the campaign.

1814
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,240
It's not happening.

1815
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:55,520
So this one image, nevermind, no women.

1816
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,400
So that's a stupid idea to begin with.

1817
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:58,240
Can I see?

1818
01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:59,720
So then the next week, Joe was wearing a shirt

1819
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:02,680
that says, if you can read this, TJ fell off.

1820
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,800
TJ in this photo looks as a different vibe though.

1821
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:11,640
She's getting out.

1822
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,040
Yeah, kind of messy hair.

1823
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:13,880
Yeah, yeah.

1824
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,800
Kind of like Olivia Newton, John at the end of Grease

1825
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,080
when they drive off to heaven.

1826
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:19,560
Oh yeah, man, stud.

1827
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:22,560
Yeah, so yeah, they never figured this out.

1828
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,800
No, why weren't they just riding bikes

1829
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,880
next to each other then?

1830
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,840
Yeah, I guess that would be the equal.

1831
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,280
Wait, yeah, I don't know.

1832
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:32,240
Seems like an easy fix.

1833
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:36,440
Well, and as we know, Pete's two greats riding motorcycles

1834
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:39,440
next to each other is the most compelling advertising

1835
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:42,200
campaign there could ever be for an adult substance.

1836
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,360
That's right.

1837
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,720
So they should, yeah, they really screwed up.

1838
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:48,840
I feel like they were, I feel like they sabotaged TJ,

1839
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,200
poor TJ.

1840
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,880
Yeah, yeah, she got an unfair,

1841
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:54,800
I think maybe there'd be some,

1842
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,880
I think now if they came back,

1843
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,200
especially to like a future,

1844
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,520
whatever future great administration we're gonna have

1845
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:04,120
and said, hey, we know we made that rule way back when,

1846
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:07,240
but like, come on, we didn't, what about TJ?

1847
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:09,200
TJ never got her chance.

1848
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:12,080
You wanna stay in the graces of female voters?

1849
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:12,920
That's right.

1850
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,040
TJ, and then we roll back,

1851
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:17,680
the cartoons can't be in cigarette ads and things.

1852
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,160
Well, and then when TJ comes in,

1853
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:21,920
then finally Joe Camel has a bunch of kids.

1854
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,200
That's what we're missing.

1855
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,320
The Joe Camel kids.

1856
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:26,160
Camel babies.

1857
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:29,720
What do those look like, the Shrek babies,

1858
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:32,280
the Farkel of Camel World.

1859
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:34,280
The Supreme Court will rule that you are allowed

1860
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:38,240
to market children's camel based characters,

1861
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:39,640
two kids to make them smoke,

1862
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:42,400
to allow them to be interested in smoking.

1863
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,280
It is like unusual looking at all this now,

1864
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:50,320
like, yeah, this is all stuff we liked, lots of characters.

1865
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:53,640
Yeah, I think that's why it's a worthy topic to bring up.

1866
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,200
Chuck and Cheese tickets.

1867
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,040
Yeah, yeah.

1868
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,840
That's a big argument, yeah, for the marketing,

1869
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,040
because when you look through the merch,

1870
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,200
it is great, the amount of merch

1871
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:05,120
and the way you get the merch is fun.

1872
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,720
That it's with, yeah, do we even really,

1873
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,440
we were talking about their specific money,

1874
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:11,920
but we didn't discuss that it's Disney dollars.

1875
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,200
It for sure is their version of Disney dollars

1876
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:17,720
and it's bright, vibrant, colorful money,

1877
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:22,720
much cooler than our regular stupid green money.

1878
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:26,160
And it's Joe as George Washington

1879
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:31,160
and Max, his harmonica player friend as Lincoln.

1880
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,560
Yes, in the five.

1881
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:35,000
Yes, yeah, yeah.

1882
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,880
And then there's a 50 that just stops looking like money.

1883
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:41,160
Now it's, on the 50 scene note,

1884
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:43,160
it's Joe as George Washington,

1885
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:44,840
but back in a leather jacket

1886
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,800
and just tossing money in the air.

1887
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:47,640
Oh.

1888
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:50,520
These are good.

1889
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:53,480
I mean, I would love to have a pack of C notes.

1890
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:56,080
Well, a lot of this stuff is not so expensive.

1891
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:56,900
Yeah.

1892
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:58,800
Because I was on eBay and I think you can get,

1893
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,640
here, you can get vintage a lot of 310 camel cash,

1894
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,960
C note, C note, Joe camel cigarette, 1990s,

1895
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,000
$5, $5 shipping.

1896
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,520
And that's a buy it now price.

1897
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:09,360
Wow.

1898
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,640
So you could make it rain in C notes

1899
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,360
whenever you want for like 10 bucks.

1900
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,720
Yeah, you can get like a $10 Zippo lighter

1901
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,520
with Joe on it for 10 or $11.

1902
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,000
Yeah, camel cash.

1903
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,440
You could use his own lighter

1904
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:26,000
to burn up a bunch of camel cash and then just buy more.

1905
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,240
Yes, camel cash is cheap right now.

1906
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,520
The value can only go up as far as I'm concerned.

1907
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,200
That's what I'm saying, it's the next wave.

1908
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:34,000
Yeah, you're right, you're right, yeah.

1909
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,200
That's what you pay for the second gate for,

1910
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:39,080
get in on the next financial big thing.

1911
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:40,280
Camel, yes.

1912
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:44,320
Where this TJ thing went is that they said,

1913
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,960
all right, never, all right,

1914
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:49,800
it's not gonna be his consistent girlfriend or nothing

1915
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,120
because we can't tie him down.

1916
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:51,960
Yeah, yeah.

1917
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:56,400
So that's not his rebellious spirit flag flying free,

1918
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,800
ball face flapping in the breeze.

1919
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,040
So then it became, all right,

1920
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:02,600
well, he's got his nightclub Joe's place

1921
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,640
and that will just be full of women.

1922
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:08,240
Women, female, creepy female camels are now

1923
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:11,720
just all over the Joe-iverse.

1924
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:13,920
And this, I mean, there's too many details

1925
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,400
and this is a veritable where's Waldo,

1926
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:21,400
where here's a camel with a broken leg

1927
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,160
and another camel is signing the cast.

1928
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,680
There's a bunch of like flat top ones

1929
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:29,400
and some are dancing to a band

1930
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:34,400
and one guy is handing a rose up to a female camel

1931
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,880
on the second level.

1932
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:43,440
I, just seeing them be like anatomically correct

1933
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:48,480
is really, I think the women are somehow creepier than the.

1934
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,320
That's probably right.

1935
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:52,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

1936
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,240
So now there are just women in his world, great.

1937
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,120
Things just keep getting better.

1938
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:02,440
And now I'm gonna move to one,

1939
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:05,400
it's sort of the final big topic on my end

1940
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:08,480
which is that Joe, all right,

1941
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:11,560
we know he likes pool and billiards,

1942
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,760
we know he likes nightclubs,

1943
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:16,320
so what place would he love more than Las Vegas?

1944
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,800
Of course, sure.

1945
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,760
Hand and glove.

1946
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,640
Let me go back into the copy.

1947
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,560
There's one place Joe Camel belonged.

1948
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,440
There's one city that he should have had all the keys to.

1949
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:29,200
It's without a doubt Las Vegas.

1950
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:31,400
New York may be the city that doesn't sleep

1951
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,800
but Vegas is the town that doesn't even nap.

1952
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:37,400
Which I say, talk to Jason Sheridan.

1953
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:38,720
A lot of naps in Vegas.

1954
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,080
It's the only way you can keep going,

1955
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,120
especially in that summer 100 degree heat,

1956
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:44,320
it'll take it out of you, you gotta stay hydrated,

1957
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,160
you gotta have some naps.

1958
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,960
That's the only way you can keep going.

1959
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:49,520
Take cocaine or something.

1960
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,360
Oh yeah, you could take cocaine.

1961
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:53,960
Joe wouldn't, he would smoke.

1962
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:56,080
Or just crank camels.

1963
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:57,280
Then you're good to go.

1964
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:03,400
So anyways, fully associated with this,

1965
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,480
here's a cool image of, he's at the poker table

1966
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:10,640
and he is flicking an ace at you.

1967
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:14,760
A custom ace with a camel on it, flying right at you.

1968
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:17,920
You know that game in Vegas

1969
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,840
where you're flicking cards around?

1970
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,040
Yeah, the Ricky, what's his name?

1971
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:28,080
The guy in the Mammoth movies who can throw the magician.

1972
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,040
Ricky J.

1973
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,880
Ricky J, yeah, Ricky.

1974
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,680
Yeah, I'm playing a Ricky J's table.

1975
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:35,480
Turn cards into weapons like Ricky J can.

1976
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,760
Just Ricky J in it, you know me.

1977
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,080
We're thick as thieves, Ricky and me.

1978
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,480
All right, the dealer's bleeding, sorry.

1979
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,320
Lesser thrower, it would just bounce off his neck

1980
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,240
as opposed to mine which sliced it.

1981
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,760
How many C notes can I give you to make this right?

1982
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:01,160
So let me get to this.

1983
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:05,760
Okay, we've talked about how Joe and the Joe-iverse

1984
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,400
has so much that we like.

1985
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:11,160
It's custom money and a big universe of friends

1986
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:13,920
that expands and expands but there was no cartoon.

1987
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,480
There's an album, that's good.

1988
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:16,320
That's good.

1989
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,000
There's one thing that we are missing

1990
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,120
and especially with the premise of our podcast

1991
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:26,120
that Joe did not have a physical place that you could go.

1992
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:31,760
There was no Joe Camel themed experience

1993
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,520
or so you would think.

1994
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:39,520
I take you now to November 22nd to 24th, 1997

1995
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:45,960
to a little event called Camel's Big Vegas Groove Blender.

1996
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:47,280
What?

1997
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:51,160
What you were looking at, okay.

1998
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:55,320
Joe Camel is on a big video wall

1999
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:59,040
and on one TV is Caesar's Palace,

2000
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:01,680
must be the location, hell of a place to party.

2001
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:05,440
And then another thing says ready to party with my recipe

2002
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:09,840
and Joe is just stuck on the monitors 2D.

2003
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,040
He's just there and he's got nowhere to go.

2004
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,480
No, wrong, false.

2005
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:15,920
He is reaching out of the video wall

2006
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:20,760
and he is pouring a bucket of psychedelic fluid

2007
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:22,320
all over you.

2008
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:25,760
This must be concentrated liquid groove.

2009
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:28,960
I love to have a little nip of absinthe

2010
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,400
with my Camel lights.

2011
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:32,360
That's what you could have gotten

2012
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:35,200
at Howl at the Moon though, in a big bucket.

2013
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,360
That's true, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2014
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:41,240
No blue Curacao but every other color of Curacao.

2015
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,400
This is trippy.

2016
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,280
This is gonna be a nonstop over the top weekend

2017
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,200
in the party capital of the universe

2018
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:49,680
and everything's on the house.

2019
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:54,680
So what this was was a Willy Wonka style

2020
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:58,800
golden ticket situation where keep buying those Camels,

2021
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,040
keep buying those hard packs

2022
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:03,400
because you might just get an invite to the groove blender

2023
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:07,920
and 500 lucky smokers did along with their guests

2024
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:11,440
and this was a private party weekend

2025
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:14,280
that was only for Camel smokers.

2026
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:19,160
Let me get to my info on this.

2027
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:22,240
Okay, so here we go.

2028
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,360
This is, look, I'll be honest.

2029
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:27,240
I'm just gonna read a lot of this book about this event.

2030
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:31,920
A futuristic neon powered look into the world of Joe

2031
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:34,200
and the culture of Camel.

2032
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,600
If you weren't one of the lucky 500 smokers

2033
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,360
and their guests who want a trip to the blender,

2034
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:39,920
it went something like this.

2035
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,000
You entered through a circular shaped entrance

2036
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,800
swirling with lights and color.

2037
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,680
A video column projected your image

2038
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:48,960
between several huge video screens

2039
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:53,200
before swirling it around into a quickly dissipating vortex.

2040
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,000
Watch out, Hunter S. Thompson.

2041
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:00,000
This is, if you and Benicio are tripped out

2042
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,160
by just the carpet,

2043
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:03,680
you ain't taking a trip into the groove blender.

2044
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:05,280
Buy the ticket, take the ride.

2045
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:08,320
Buy the C-note.

2046
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:11,800
The floor below spun with neon blades.

2047
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:13,760
The fuck, that can't be true

2048
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:17,040
I don't think you would even have to be tripping

2049
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:19,880
to be scared of blades on the ground.

2050
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:22,160
That doesn't just mean a design, shut up.

2051
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:23,760
There were no neon blades.

2052
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,280
Then suddenly you were inside.

2053
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,440
I mean, probably because there wasn't that much space

2054
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:29,280
to work with.

2055
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:31,880
Yeah, then imagine a door and you're in it.

2056
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:36,000
The main room where you encountered two giant lava lamps.

2057
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,920
Holy shit, whoa.

2058
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,000
Dance cages and a lot more.

2059
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:44,040
You saw a Swami booth, a pyramid shaped structure

2060
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:47,840
with four live Swamis, weird lighting.

2061
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,040
We're giving up on the copywriting now.

2062
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:52,960
Weird lighting and sky beams.

2063
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,360
You said what?

2064
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:57,120
You stopped to check out the interactive Swami

2065
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,120
and came away enlightened.

2066
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:04,760
This doesn't sound like the Joe Camel voice.

2067
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:06,840
I'm confused here because there's something, yeah,

2068
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:09,440
there's something classic, all-American,

2069
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,520
swing and ding ding about this guy.

2070
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:16,520
He's not about, he's not an electric daisy carnival guy.

2071
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,440
That's not even, I don't think who they're marketing to

2072
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:20,760
because these cigarettes specifically are like

2073
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:24,040
salt of the earth, denim.

2074
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:28,360
This is a Jay Leno type of guy, American car guy.

2075
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,040
Traditionally masculine.

2076
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,760
A bunch of Jay Leno viewing.

2077
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:34,600
Yeah.

2078
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:35,880
Love the monologue.

2079
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:40,040
Right, Jay, I assume Jay adds for Camels

2080
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:41,480
in the early days of this night show.

2081
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,960
Joe Camel says, I try to turn in early,

2082
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:47,640
but sometimes I watch Leno's monologue and then drift off.

2083
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:49,560
Joe Camel will.

2084
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:51,240
I know he left before the end of the day.

2085
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:53,520
I wish Joe was on in the early days too.

2086
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,920
Like a self-fully animated,

2087
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:57,840
where they have to keep the camera still.

2088
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:58,680
Yes.

2089
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:02,320
It says here you're a smooth character, isn't that true?

2090
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:06,040
From there you went onto the virtual reality room

2091
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:08,360
and played some head games.

2092
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:11,480
You even went for the ride of your life

2093
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:15,280
on a Smoke and Joe's racing simulator.

2094
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,600
What the fuck?

2095
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:21,560
Are we getting into that there was a Joe Camel ride

2096
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:25,280
that was only available for three days in Las Vegas?

2097
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:26,760
This is huge news.

2098
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:27,600
Sounds like it.

2099
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:32,160
And yet no information fully about it

2100
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:37,200
What I did find was a big crazy press junket style video

2101
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:39,480
about the Groove Blender,

2102
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:42,640
which before I continue the description of the Groove Blender.

2103
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:44,640
The laziest name too.

2104
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:45,480
The Groove Blender?

2105
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:46,320
The Groove Blender.

2106
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,480
No, that's okay.

2107
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:49,320
That name's okay.

2108
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:50,160
I don't know.

2109
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:51,640
It doesn't fit the Joe Camel aesthetic.

2110
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:52,480
I view that.

2111
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,320
Maybe that's what's rubbing me wrong.

2112
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,680
But I think the Groove Blender is groovy.

2113
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:55,680
I think it's cool.

2114
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:57,680
Yeah, baby.

2115
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:59,160
How do we imply that just,

2116
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:03,000
we're gonna take everything that's groovy in this world

2117
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,280
and mix it up in one room.

2118
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:08,440
And by that I mean cigarettes,

2119
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:11,280
Swamis, neon blades.

2120
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,320
Swamis are religious teachers.

2121
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:17,640
Come on in, explore some new fates.

2122
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:21,120
What month did Austin Powers come out in 1997?

2123
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:22,160
Oh, that wasn't 97, wasn't it?

2124
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:23,200
That was early in the year.

2125
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:24,920
I think that was March or so.

2126
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:26,400
Or it might have been May.

2127
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:27,240
Okay.

2128
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:30,280
Who's warning of Austin Powers influenced Joe Camel?

2129
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:31,120
Yeah, maybe.

2130
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:31,960
Yeah, yeah.

2131
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:33,920
There's this new, the swing 60s are back.

2132
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,280
But it wasn't a phenomenon yet.

2133
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:38,840
There was a big 60s comeback in the 90s in general.

2134
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:41,960
All the smiley faces and inflatable furniture

2135
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:43,600
and bell bottoms, all that garbage.

2136
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:44,440
That is true.

2137
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:45,280
They tried to get him.

2138
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:48,080
Can we just, Mike, can you just send a video of saying,

2139
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:52,360
of you saying, this blender is very groovy, baby.

2140
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,840
They didn't get that, but they got a bunch of

2141
01:26:56,120 --> 01:27:00,120
people who clearly from looking at them

2142
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:01,760
are hardcore smokers.

2143
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:04,480
And they got everyone to, well, here's just some thoughts

2144
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:07,000
first of all about like, why the groove blender?

2145
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,720
Why now?

2146
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:09,560
I think it's amazing.

2147
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:12,080
I think it's exactly what needed to happen.

2148
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,120
See, for Christ sakes, people, the TV's boring.

2149
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:16,880
We want the cigarette burners back now.

2150
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:19,880
Kind of some Dennis Leary style, not just thoughts,

2151
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:21,560
but camera work.

2152
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:25,040
It's all spin in and then kind of like a

2153
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,920
grunge bass player with beard braids.

2154
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:28,760
Yeah, I think it's great.

2155
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:30,760
I think it's exactly what needed to happen right now.

2156
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:32,240
You know, with everything.

2157
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:34,400
97's been a tough year, right?

2158
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:37,240
With their cloning the sheeps and what have you.

2159
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:39,080
We gotta, I think, what do we need?

2160
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:41,080
We need a groove blender now more than ever.

2161
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:41,920
And then.

2162
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:44,840
Here are the guys.

2163
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:46,160
The groove blender.

2164
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:47,000
Groove blender.

2165
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:47,840
Groove blender.

2166
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:48,680
Groove blender.

2167
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:49,520
Groove blender.

2168
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:50,360
Groove blender.

2169
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:51,200
Groove blender.

2170
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:52,040
Groove blender.

2171
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:52,880
Groove blender.

2172
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:53,720
Groove blender.

2173
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:54,560
Groove blender.

2174
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:56,480
Pretty fricking groovy.

2175
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,320
And then there's a glimpse of a guy unloading

2176
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:02,280
a bunch of boxes.

2177
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:07,080
Like, yeah, we're gonna have 5,000 packs of camels.

2178
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:09,880
We're giving away Z notes.

2179
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:12,640
The groove blender montage of people just saying it

2180
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:15,120
is pretty clear to me that no one had anything

2181
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:16,880
of substance to say.

2182
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,120
So they're like, well, let's just get them

2183
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:19,080
to repeat the name.

2184
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:21,520
Like, let's just make that seem like the excitement level

2185
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:22,720
is at an all time high.

2186
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:25,640
Just a handler walking around to like 30 people.

2187
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:27,800
Hi, hi, can, could you say groove blender

2188
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:29,200
into the camera real quick?

2189
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:32,920
When you see the light come on, that means it's on.

2190
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:35,440
Groove blaster.

2191
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,920
No, no, let's take that again.

2192
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:37,760
Back to one.

2193
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:38,600
Back to one.

2194
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:39,440
Light your energy though.

2195
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:42,280
Thank you so much again for doing this.

2196
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:43,800
We'll let you into the groove blender in a second,

2197
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:44,640
we swear.

2198
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:47,880
By then you were hungry and thirsty.

2199
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:50,720
So you sashayed over to the oasis and grabbed a cold one

2200
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:53,360
and a bite to eat under a neon palm tree.

2201
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:56,840
You sat on the biggest pillow you've ever seen.

2202
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:57,960
Are you sure?

2203
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:00,640
The biggest pillow in the world is a groove blender.

2204
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:05,120
The biggest pillow, what is this change of scenery for Joe?

2205
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:08,840
I love trying to navigate a plate of sloppy buffalo wings

2206
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:11,080
on the biggest pillow I've ever seen

2207
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:14,480
with my camel long burning for a while.

2208
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:18,720
This is like a Tim Burton, Nelson Wonderland style

2209
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:21,120
like a copy here.

2210
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,440
Well, you're exactly right.

2211
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:25,240
Well, because next is you satiated,

2212
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:29,520
you decided to saunter over to the Turkish Bazaar.

2213
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,080
And yeah, now we're in sort of like groovy,

2214
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:35,160
who could not go not Joe's vibe.

2215
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:38,160
Wait, what year, was this the year that Joe was?

2216
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:39,000
Wait a minute.

2217
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,400
1997, I think it was over.

2218
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:43,040
Is there no Joe at, did they change the vibe

2219
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:46,040
because they couldn't have Joe there?

2220
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:47,360
Was that what we're figuring out?

2221
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:49,840
Their excuse, I mean, their justifications

2222
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:53,160
were always very funny for all these years.

2223
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:56,160
But when they discontinued Joe Camel,

2224
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:58,720
they were like, well, it's just, you know,

2225
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:01,080
the way marketing goes, you just change it up sometimes.

2226
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:03,640
And we just want to change it up a little.

2227
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:04,840
What's the, yeah, wait,

2228
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:07,120
what was the president and congress saying?

2229
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,600
No, we haven't been paying attention.

2230
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:09,920
No, we're just, we're already thinking

2231
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,720
like probably not gonna do it anymore.

2232
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:14,400
At RJ Reynolds, we're concerned about your health

2233
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,640
and quality of life.

2234
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:18,840
So I wonder, yeah, were they like,

2235
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:20,080
we have to get rid of Joe,

2236
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:23,040
so we're gonna make it like sick, the sick, groovy 60s?

2237
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:24,800
No, but he's in the promotional image.

2238
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,760
Yeah, well, and it was explained in the book

2239
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:29,600
as if this was like the ultimate trip into Joe's mind.

2240
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:30,440
What?

2241
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:33,280
This might've been one last go for Joe.

2242
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:36,560
Yeah, maybe, there was, yeah, one crazy blowout

2243
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,800
and then he's done being alive.

2244
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,320
Wow, then they, yeah, at the end of the.

2245
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,800
He knew he was gonna croak.

2246
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:42,640
They took him out back.

2247
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:43,680
You have three days to live.

2248
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:47,960
Perhaps you should spend them quietly and reflectively

2249
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:52,720
or I could invite 500 of my closest buddies to Vegas.

2250
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:54,480
And then they can all go out in the desert

2251
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:57,080
and watch as they put me, they bury me alive.

2252
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:01,160
Don't worry, everyone, one thing's for certain,

2253
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:02,640
I've learned nothing.

2254
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:08,200
Keep smoking, folks.

2255
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:10,760
Load more sand into my lungs.

2256
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,400
I can still feel something.

2257
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:17,160
Hey, you there, come on, take a shovel.

2258
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:18,840
Everybody get to turn.

2259
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:21,200
500 of you, it'll be done in no time.

2260
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:23,960
Hey, if you hit a body, that was the mafia.

2261
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:25,040
Don't worry about it.

2262
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:31,760
Steve Wynn threatened to kill me and put me on the desert.

2263
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,760
Yeah, I've had so ever run afoul

2264
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:37,040
of some interesting characters, as you do.

2265
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:41,680
Joe Kamel was like, well, just leave my body in the dunes

2266
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:44,240
before the implosion and then I'll go to heaven.

2267
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:51,760
Ride that wave of smoke up, up, up to the top.

2268
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:53,320
I just realized we're doing the

2269
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:55,280
Odenkirk impression of Robert Hicks.

2270
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:57,640
It's kind of, yeah, yeah, it's right in there.

2271
01:31:57,640 --> 01:32:00,960
Odenkirk, he didn't get it quite as deep, I feel like,

2272
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,480
but it's the this and this and this, and here we go.

2273
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,440
Which is also great.

2274
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:09,800
And then we end up with, now we got

2275
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:14,080
belly dancers, snake charmers, sword swallowers,

2276
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:18,520
flame swallower, flame breathers, right?

2277
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:20,840
That's the ultimate cigarette, right?

2278
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:21,960
Yeah, right.

2279
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:24,520
Oh, if only, oh boy, if I can get it all done

2280
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:26,120
with just one big stick.

2281
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:30,880
When's Kamel kind of start offering torches?

2282
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:31,720
Oh man.

2283
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:36,280
Then you go play roulette and craps and stuff,

2284
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:37,720
but with scene notes.

2285
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:40,960
So you're one wall away from a real casino,

2286
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,400
but then you're playing with fake money,

2287
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,520
with a camel and a wig.

2288
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:47,640
And then-

2289
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:49,280
Is there a photo of the camel with a wig?

2290
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,120
What's that?

2291
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:52,320
Is there a picture of the camel with a wig?

2292
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:53,760
I mean, just on the scene notes.

2293
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:54,960
Yeah, yeah, you know, that's what they were,

2294
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:56,600
I mean, George Washington,

2295
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:58,880
oh, now one thing I haven't said,

2296
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:02,080
oh, here you go, after you had a chance to kick back

2297
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:06,000
and watch a live camel do some laps around the room.

2298
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:06,920
So here's what we're gonna do,

2299
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:09,680
we're gonna pack a bunch of smokers into a room,

2300
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:11,520
pass out a bunch of cigarettes,

2301
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:14,280
and then, and just crank music,

2302
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:17,120
and then have a camel walking around,

2303
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:19,320
just farting it up.

2304
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:20,160
You know what-

2305
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:22,120
Breathing second hand.

2306
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:24,240
Look, wildlife love two things,

2307
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:27,520
they love cool camel, second hand smoke,

2308
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,560
and they love being indoors.

2309
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,400
Don't worry, he won't freak out,

2310
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:37,520
kick all the roulette tables down,

2311
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:40,320
chips go flying into your drinks and eyes.

2312
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:44,000
Was there a camel in Siegfried and Roy's show ever?

2313
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:44,840
Not sure.

2314
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:47,600
Was there already a camel easily accessible in Vegas,

2315
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:48,440
is what I'm asking.

2316
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:49,840
They have to bring one in.

2317
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,760
I feel like there was a good chance,

2318
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:52,920
like the Sahara or something,

2319
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,920
there was just like a camel that was on loan.

2320
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:56,880
There's a couple menageries,

2321
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,400
there's two kind of things, I feel like.

2322
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:00,240
I'm sure it was not hard.

2323
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:01,120
There was probably some sad thing

2324
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:02,900
where two camels were in a space

2325
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:05,340
where people could get drunk and bang on the glass.

2326
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:06,660
That's what I'm saying.

2327
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:08,060
It maybe wasn't much of a stretch

2328
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:09,340
to get the camel over there.

2329
01:34:09,340 --> 01:34:10,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2330
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:12,020
No, very possibly.

2331
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:13,300
They might have had to stretch a little more

2332
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:16,180
to get the bands.

2333
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:18,620
Big head Todd and the Monsters,

2334
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:22,100
the Smithereens and Southern Culture on the Skids,

2335
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:24,460
rocked the palace with their own special brands

2336
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:26,260
of alternative sound.

2337
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:27,660
And then right after that,

2338
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:31,460
it was the kind of party that only Joe could have dreamed up.

2339
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:34,420
Yeah, you know, we know what Joe loves.

2340
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:37,540
Swammies, the Smithereens,

2341
01:34:37,540 --> 01:34:41,300
camels who are not walk around upright camels like him,

2342
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:44,580
but regular ones who are forced to breathe a lot of smoke in.

2343
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:47,060
That doesn't sound like the music Joe likes.

2344
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:47,940
No, I don't think so.

2345
01:34:47,940 --> 01:34:50,060
No, we heard the music he makes.

2346
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:53,900
He likes public domain blues

2347
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:56,860
that is amended to be about lighter shortages.

2348
01:34:56,860 --> 01:34:59,620
Right, he would like a South Side Johnny maybe.

2349
01:34:59,620 --> 01:35:02,180
He would like a kind of bluesy.

2350
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:04,300
Something that swings, Daddy-O.

2351
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:05,140
Yeah.

2352
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:09,460
No, this is all completely confusing.

2353
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:12,660
What you were saying about the food

2354
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:15,180
and like barbecue at the Pillows, there's a shot.

2355
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:17,020
I'm gonna do a cut down on this video

2356
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:21,060
because boy, I love this Groove Letter video.

2357
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:23,380
There it does involve.

2358
01:35:25,140 --> 01:35:27,700
Okay, first of all, it goes from a shot

2359
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:32,380
of like three people all doing what I can only describe

2360
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:35,020
as like a cigarette threesome.

2361
01:35:35,020 --> 01:35:36,460
Like they're all lighting up,

2362
01:35:37,540 --> 01:35:38,860
from one center point,

2363
01:35:38,860 --> 01:35:41,100
all getting uncomfortably close to each other

2364
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:43,380
for like breathing in one big flame.

2365
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:46,180
And then it cuts straight from that to like a tilty shot

2366
01:35:46,180 --> 01:35:50,860
going over like a really pale taco salad.

2367
01:35:50,860 --> 01:35:53,700
Just a big open container of sour cream.

2368
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:58,300
Look, Ash is gonna get in there

2369
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:00,300
and maybe the camel spit in it.

2370
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:02,540
That's what everything's getting blended up.

2371
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:03,820
You knew what you were getting into.

2372
01:36:03,820 --> 01:36:05,100
It's Groove Blender, baby.

2373
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:06,260
It's Groove Blender.

2374
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:09,220
What a terrible event.

2375
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:12,940
I mean, there's just no way it wasn't.

2376
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:16,260
No, everyone was so hard on the gathering of the Juggalos.

2377
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:17,100
Yeah, that looks like a fucking.

2378
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:19,980
And yet Groove Blender just passed with no comment.

2379
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:21,460
That looks like some decadent

2380
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:25,900
like ancient Roman party or something versus this shitty.

2381
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:27,340
Yeah. Joe camel event.

2382
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:30,460
But live camels in a room with swamis

2383
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:32,860
and all the cigarettes we can find.

2384
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:36,660
And let the record show that Mike said,

2385
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:39,740
it's the worst event he's ever heard of

2386
01:36:39,740 --> 01:36:43,140
before I introduce this element.

2387
01:36:45,940 --> 01:36:49,380
All I gotta say is that when camel throws a party,

2388
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:50,700
they do it upright.

2389
01:36:52,420 --> 01:36:53,260
Did you see it?

2390
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:54,100
Did you see it?

2391
01:36:59,940 --> 01:37:00,940
Wait, first of all.

2392
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:04,500
The guys have got a VR helmet.

2393
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:07,420
So there's 94 or 97 era VR.

2394
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:10,020
But that music you were hearing was coming courtesy

2395
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:13,500
of some blues brothers impersonators.

2396
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:16,740
All that plus fake blues brothers.

2397
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:19,340
Oh my God.

2398
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:20,180
What?

2399
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:24,220
The worst party I've ever heard of.

2400
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:26,220
This come RJ Reynolds.

2401
01:37:26,220 --> 01:37:28,220
They are preying on our children

2402
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:30,420
and putting everything they like in front of them.

2403
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:32,220
Sword swallowers.

2404
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:36,380
The blues brothers.

2405
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:38,620
Cocktail lounges.

2406
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:40,260
Taco salad.

2407
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:42,580
Open containers of sour cream.

2408
01:37:42,580 --> 01:37:45,460
Getting dusted with ash and camel spit.

2409
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:48,580
What hope does my six year old have?

2410
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,060
The six year old though was, to be fair,

2411
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:52,540
wasn't going to the party.

2412
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:54,940
I don't think he knew about the party in Vegas

2413
01:37:54,940 --> 01:37:57,180
for 500 of the closest, closest smokers.

2414
01:37:57,180 --> 01:37:59,740
I'm just saying if this is the Joe vibe,

2415
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:03,980
I've somehow failed to see how this is hooking

2416
01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:07,900
someone who's otherwise watching the Teletubbies.

2417
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:11,340
If you're saying that they didn't always do a good job

2418
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:13,500
of marketing to children, I would agree with you.

2419
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:14,500
Yeah, it might be right.

2420
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:16,460
I would agree with that.

2421
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:18,660
Once in a while they weren't hitting the spot

2422
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:20,940
as far as making kids go,

2423
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:24,900
mommy, I want to go to Vegas and eat barbecue on a pillow

2424
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:27,900
and I want to see fake Elwood.

2425
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:30,300
Mommy, mommy, can we go see fake Elwood?

2426
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:34,100
I want a lunch pool trick shot.

2427
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:35,500
I forgot that.

2428
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:37,100
There was a speaking of Odenkirk

2429
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:39,460
and there was a Van Hammersley walking around.

2430
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:40,980
That's all right.

2431
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:41,820
It was one.

2432
01:38:41,820 --> 01:38:42,660
Oh.

2433
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:47,740
This party, holy shit.

2434
01:38:47,740 --> 01:38:50,060
This isn't one, but I was imagining like,

2435
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:54,140
then further satiated, then step into the next room

2436
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:56,060
and watch a live camel birth.

2437
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:56,900
What?

2438
01:38:56,900 --> 01:38:58,900
Joe's offspring is coming right at you

2439
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:01,500
and you can catch it and you can keep the camel

2440
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:03,620
in your hands while you do it.

2441
01:39:03,620 --> 01:39:05,900
They won't mind, he's a born smoker.

2442
01:39:07,180 --> 01:39:11,580
Maybe try to wash some of the camel fluid off your hands

2443
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:14,100
before you dig back into that taco salad.

2444
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:16,340
But if you don't, we ain't watching.

2445
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:18,340
Would the listeners come to a live show

2446
01:39:18,340 --> 01:39:20,300
that was our own version of this party?

2447
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:21,140
Groove Blender.

2448
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:24,420
Podcasts that ride's Groove Blender.

2449
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:29,140
A tribute to the classic Joe camel party in 1997.

2450
01:39:29,140 --> 01:39:29,980
We found.

2451
01:39:29,980 --> 01:39:30,820
I think the answer is yes.

2452
01:39:30,820 --> 01:39:32,660
We got catering for the place called

2453
01:39:32,660 --> 01:39:34,900
the worst restaurant in Los Angeles.

2454
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:37,940
In the last live show, I said we need to come out

2455
01:39:37,940 --> 01:39:39,700
as the Blues Brothers one of these days.

2456
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:40,940
Oh yeah.

2457
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:42,620
Free Blues Brothers.

2458
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:45,660
And we haven't even talked about Blues Brothers Con.

2459
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:47,740
Oh yeah, so you were saying the event,

2460
01:39:47,740 --> 01:39:50,460
this is in August at the retired prison.

2461
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:54,180
August 19th in Joliet, two day event.

2462
01:39:54,180 --> 01:39:57,940
Only one day does Jim Belushi and Dan Aykroyd appear.

2463
01:39:57,940 --> 01:40:00,340
The best day of your goddamn lives.

2464
01:40:00,340 --> 01:40:01,980
They will perform.

2465
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:06,820
I hear the train a-comin', comin' round the bend.

2466
01:40:06,820 --> 01:40:08,500
They don't do that.

2467
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:10,340
They don't do that, so I know it's a pressure.

2468
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:13,620
It's just the association with a prison performance.

2469
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:15,020
The prison music.

2470
01:40:15,020 --> 01:40:16,940
But then also on the Blues Brothers website,

2471
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:19,900
they are auditioning for Elwood and Jakes.

2472
01:40:20,860 --> 01:40:21,700
Huh?

2473
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:22,540
You didn't see that?

2474
01:40:22,540 --> 01:40:24,860
I sent that to, I said Jason, you and I have to audition.

2475
01:40:24,860 --> 01:40:26,660
Oh, that was a real, oh that was based on

2476
01:40:26,660 --> 01:40:27,860
that there were auditions.

2477
01:40:27,860 --> 01:40:31,380
There are auditions to be new Blues Brothers.

2478
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:33,300
For what and where?

2479
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:35,460
For if there's ever a Groove Blender again.

2480
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:37,300
It doesn't specify, but I think a Groove Blender.

2481
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:38,620
We are lobbying Congress.

2482
01:40:38,620 --> 01:40:41,220
Jim is working on making sure

2483
01:40:41,220 --> 01:40:43,460
that cannabis farms stay unrestricted.

2484
01:40:43,460 --> 01:40:45,740
Meanwhile, we're also trying to roll back

2485
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:48,100
the cartoon cigarette legislation

2486
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:50,300
so that we can have another Groove Blender.

2487
01:40:51,620 --> 01:40:54,700
Licensed Blues Brothers can be there.

2488
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:57,300
Jason and I need to put ourselves on tape for this.

2489
01:40:58,740 --> 01:41:00,700
To be Jake and Elwood on the road.

2490
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:03,580
As long as you're willing to show our listeners that tape.

2491
01:41:03,580 --> 01:41:04,420
Yeah.

2492
01:41:04,420 --> 01:41:06,260
Well, what Elwood, of course.

2493
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:07,700
And you do that thing where like,

2494
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:09,460
these guys are just standing there.

2495
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:10,540
They're just standing.

2496
01:41:10,540 --> 01:41:14,500
I paid to see dancers and they're only standing

2497
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:15,700
and looking grim.

2498
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:18,260
But then when the song kicks in,

2499
01:41:18,260 --> 01:41:22,220
you shuffle all around like no white person has ever done.

2500
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:24,180
They won, yeah, they won dance.

2501
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:28,980
Which is to say just like randomly shaking.

2502
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:33,060
I'm looking, I have the copy here.

2503
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:35,020
I just want to make sure I get it right

2504
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:37,220
in case any listener also wants to.

2505
01:41:37,980 --> 01:41:39,220
If you want to do it a little Joe,

2506
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:40,980
or if you want to do it a little Draper,

2507
01:41:40,980 --> 01:41:41,820
because I think you're going to read

2508
01:41:41,820 --> 01:41:43,140
some beautiful copy here.

2509
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:47,260
Let's see what it comes to me.

2510
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:49,460
I can't remember, what did the Blues Brothers sound like?

2511
01:41:49,460 --> 01:41:50,700
Well, they're sort of like clipped

2512
01:41:50,700 --> 01:41:52,700
and kind of where you got to do it.

2513
01:41:52,700 --> 01:41:56,540
Looking for young talented Blues Brothers performers.

2514
01:41:56,540 --> 01:41:58,460
Blues Brothers approved ventures

2515
01:41:58,460 --> 01:42:01,180
in association with legends and concerts.

2516
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:04,540
It's searching for a young fresh Blues Brothers tribute act.

2517
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:06,980
We only approve the finest ventures.

2518
01:42:07,820 --> 01:42:10,220
To potentially use at several of legends

2519
01:42:10,220 --> 01:42:12,340
and concerts locations.

2520
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:13,180
We are looking for.

2521
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:14,580
Well, that's an established brand.

2522
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:16,740
Legends and concerts.

2523
01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:18,580
We are looking for a dynamic duo

2524
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:20,220
that can portray Jake and Elwood

2525
01:42:20,220 --> 01:42:22,020
during the Saturday Night Live era.

2526
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:26,460
Well, so not like, wait a minute, not the current one?

2527
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:27,300
For some reason not.

2528
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:29,620
Not the one where it's 70 somethings

2529
01:42:29,620 --> 01:42:33,220
who need to hold hands to walk down a small set of stairs.

2530
01:42:33,220 --> 01:42:35,780
As they did on the fucking SNL anniversary,

2531
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:38,020
they have to let you take my hand.

2532
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:39,660
Like Trump.

2533
01:42:39,660 --> 01:42:42,100
Strong familiarity with the Blues Brothers characters

2534
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:45,300
are essential in order to accurately replicate

2535
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:48,540
their voices, moves, dance, skits,

2536
01:42:48,540 --> 01:42:51,660
and comedic flair live on stage.

2537
01:42:51,660 --> 01:42:55,500
The tribute act must have experienced performing

2538
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:57,180
in front of a live audience.

2539
01:42:57,180 --> 01:42:59,260
The tribute act must have experienced performing

2540
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:00,740
in front of live audiences

2541
01:43:00,740 --> 01:43:03,460
and developing good rapport and timing with them.

2542
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:07,940
Guys, years of podcast the riot, years of Harold team.

2543
01:43:07,940 --> 01:43:08,780
That's it.

2544
01:43:08,780 --> 01:43:09,620
I think you're set.

2545
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:14,260
Candidates to consider must sing live

2546
01:43:14,260 --> 01:43:18,060
and the Elwood character must be able to play the harmonica.

2547
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:20,380
This is your opportunity to help us continue

2548
01:43:20,380 --> 01:43:22,340
to celebrate the comedic legacy

2549
01:43:22,340 --> 01:43:25,100
of these beloved iconic characters.

2550
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:27,100
Please send all submissions for consideration

2551
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:31,540
to Legends and Concert 4570 West Post Road,

2552

Or info at Legends.

01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:49,020
Wow.

2560
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:53,380
Well, guy, I mean, extensive knowledge of the,

2561
01:43:53,380 --> 01:43:57,420
I mean, you could point to lots of podcast material

2562
01:43:57,420 --> 01:44:01,060
about them too much, most people might say.

2563
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:05,140
To manifest the physicality, just really quick,

2564
01:44:05,140 --> 01:44:06,860
both of you just move your arms

2565
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:09,820
and let me see if I think that it's like the Blues Brothers.

2566
01:44:09,820 --> 01:44:13,140
Just, okay, go for the, wow, oh my God, it's perfect.

2567
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:13,980
Whatever you just did,

2568
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:17,580
have you been in a dance school for five years?

2569
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:19,540
That looked exactly like the Blues Brothers.

2570
01:44:19,540 --> 01:44:20,380
No, you know what?

2571
01:44:20,380 --> 01:44:21,740
We just have a big Blues Brothers fan

2572
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:24,420
so we watched a lot of their old stuff and we picked it up.

2573
01:44:24,420 --> 01:44:26,380
Yeah, I did one or two coaching sessions

2574
01:44:26,380 --> 01:44:28,860
with Judith Belushi Pisano.

2575
01:44:28,860 --> 01:44:30,420
Oh my God.

2576
01:44:30,420 --> 01:44:35,420
John had an energy, John, he was a maniac.

2577
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:37,740
What can I say?

2578
01:44:37,740 --> 01:44:38,580
Wow.

2579
01:44:38,580 --> 01:44:41,820
Jason, are you Belushi or am I Belushi in this scenario?

2580
01:44:41,820 --> 01:44:43,060
You think I'm Ackroyd?

2581
01:44:43,060 --> 01:44:45,460
I might be Ackroyd, but wasn't Belushi shorter?

2582
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:46,780
Belushi was shorter.

2583
01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:48,460
Eventually I think you're Ackroyd.

2584
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:51,500
I think, what, now I'm doubting if you can do it.

2585
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:53,500
You were just asking who's who?

2586
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:54,860
It's obvious who's who.

2587
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:56,780
I mean, I guess height wise it's obvious.

2588
01:44:56,780 --> 01:44:58,620
Yes, I guess it has to be that way.

2589
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:01,700
I guess height wise it could be the other way around.

2590
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:03,460
I understand why I was asking.

2591
01:45:03,460 --> 01:45:06,020
Look, when you're trying to be a tribute act,

2592
01:45:06,020 --> 01:45:07,980
you gotta look at it from all angles.

2593
01:45:07,980 --> 01:45:09,900
Jason has to bring that Belushi energy

2594
01:45:09,900 --> 01:45:12,260
and I was wondering if that's something he can summon.

2595
01:45:12,260 --> 01:45:13,260
Yeah, I don't know if that's coming.

2596
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:14,100
Yeah, I don't know.

2597
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:14,940
That's tough.

2598
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:17,940
Although if he gets a little rammy maybe.

2599
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:18,780
Oh yeah.

2600
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:20,740
He could get that Belushi vibe going.

2601
01:45:20,740 --> 01:45:22,700
We're gonna have enough gold bond in the pocket.

2602
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:23,540
Sure.

2603
01:45:25,060 --> 01:45:26,940
Scott here, I found a picture.

2604
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:30,020
Called the Joe Camel Collection and a woman in it

2605
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:34,140
explains that I think her grandmother moved in

2606
01:45:34,140 --> 01:45:36,620
with her family and they had to clean out the house

2607
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:39,820
and there's just dozens and dozens of camel things

2608
01:45:39,820 --> 01:45:42,180
they found, Joe and old Joe.

2609
01:45:42,180 --> 01:45:44,220
But here's some soft packs of cigarettes.

2610
01:45:44,220 --> 01:45:47,300
You can tell they look like they're already crunched up.

2611
01:45:47,300 --> 01:45:49,060
Like they already look like shit.

2612
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:49,900
Oh, I see.

2613
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:50,740
Okay, okay.

2614
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:52,460
So I think the innovation of the hard pack

2615
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:54,700
was these cigarettes will stay in good shape.

2616
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:55,540
Mm-hmm.

2617
01:45:55,540 --> 01:45:56,380
In your pocket.

2618
01:45:56,620 --> 01:45:57,460
But just look at this.

2619
01:45:57,460 --> 01:46:01,460
It's just a montage of thing after thing of Joe Camel stuff.

2620
01:46:01,460 --> 01:46:02,860
Oh, that's an example, yeah.

2621
01:46:02,860 --> 01:46:03,700
Cue ball.

2622
01:46:03,700 --> 01:46:04,540
Cue ball, ashtrays.

2623
01:46:04,540 --> 01:46:07,900
Plates and forks and of course they're in a clock,

2624
01:46:07,900 --> 01:46:12,900
a cool clock, a bout pool and ashtrays and hats and shades.

2625
01:46:14,900 --> 01:46:16,740
And this is the lifestyle.

2626
01:46:16,740 --> 01:46:20,660
I guess it goes hand in hand if you were a guy in the 90s,

2627
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:24,740
you were a dad in the 90s who had a lot of Playboy stuff.

2628
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:25,580
Mm-hmm.

2629
01:46:26,260 --> 01:46:27,700
This is sort of my, I wanna-

2630
01:46:27,700 --> 01:46:28,540
Inspirational.

2631
01:46:28,540 --> 01:46:29,380
Yeah.

2632
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:34,340
Or any shots, oh yeah, my relatives really into Elvis.

2633
01:46:34,340 --> 01:46:36,020
They're really into Betty Boop.

2634
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:38,340
Then they just have walls of this stuff.

2635
01:46:38,340 --> 01:46:39,500
Yeah.

2636
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:42,180
I mean, look, I know about having walls of stuff

2637
01:46:42,180 --> 01:46:44,940
of a certain character. Sure, yeah, yeah.

2638
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:46,740
Well, and why not Joe?

2639
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:49,100
Maybe it's time to introduce Joe.

2640
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:53,340
And you know, let me, to summarize how the book

2641
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:54,580
brings things to a close,

2642
01:46:54,580 --> 01:46:56,380
it's pretty much what Jason was saying.

2643
01:46:56,380 --> 01:46:59,660
Like, yeah, and then his days were numbered.

2644
01:46:59,660 --> 01:47:02,300
It just, you know, felt like time.

2645
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:05,340
Maybe the world would no longer accepted this rebel

2646
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:07,620
and he had to ride off into the sunset.

2647
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:11,180
Certainly we were not forced to stop doing this.

2648
01:47:11,180 --> 01:47:13,620
But you know, then they bring things to a close

2649
01:47:13,620 --> 01:47:16,180
with this statement.

2650
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:19,580
Any way you look at him, Joe Camel was one of a kind.

2651
01:47:19,580 --> 01:47:21,580
And even though he stayed around for less than a decade,

2652
01:47:21,580 --> 01:47:23,980
he made his mark in ways that few advertising characters

2653
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:26,180
ever have or will.

2654
01:47:26,180 --> 01:47:29,820
Joe's style, his attitude, his joie de vivre

2655
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:33,740
made his mythological world seem more magical.

2656
01:47:33,740 --> 01:47:36,580
And it made our world seem a little bit more magical too.

2657
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:38,700
He will be missed.

2658
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:41,340
The eulogy.

2659
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:44,140
Again, then a 21 gun salute happens after that.

2660
01:47:46,140 --> 01:47:48,100
21 puff salute.

2661
01:47:49,660 --> 01:47:50,500
Fire.

2662
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:51,340
Pull.

2663
01:47:51,740 --> 01:47:53,140
Poof.

2664
01:47:53,140 --> 01:47:54,220
But how do we feel?

2665
01:47:54,220 --> 01:47:57,500
Do we, are we, do we love him more?

2666
01:47:57,500 --> 01:47:58,380
Do we get him more?

2667
01:47:58,380 --> 01:48:00,780
Having taken a trip, now that we know about his world

2668
01:48:00,780 --> 01:48:03,780
and the heart pack and his music and TJ

2669
01:48:03,780 --> 01:48:08,100
and a miraculous weekend called the Groove Blunder.

2670
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:12,860
You know, I, my feelings as a kid was,

2671
01:48:12,860 --> 01:48:14,940
I was fascinated with him,

2672
01:48:14,940 --> 01:48:17,100
but I was put off a little bit by it.

2673
01:48:18,140 --> 01:48:19,740
But though that being said, I was like,

2674
01:48:19,740 --> 01:48:21,620
there were certain ads in the magazines

2675
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:23,540
that I knew were adult ads.

2676
01:48:23,540 --> 01:48:26,460
So that's part of it, part of it's his penis head.

2677
01:48:27,540 --> 01:48:32,540
But when we look in, there's a pretty rich mythology here

2678
01:48:32,620 --> 01:48:34,860
when we talk about all of it.

2679
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:36,620
So yeah, if, if.

2680
01:48:36,620 --> 01:48:39,660
And if we, look, what we love is we, you know,

2681
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:41,900
we admit to the shortcomings and the evils

2682
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:43,420
of the Disney corporation.

2683
01:48:43,420 --> 01:48:44,260
Sure.

2684
01:48:44,260 --> 01:48:47,580
But if some magical IP and storytelling comes out

2685
01:48:47,580 --> 01:48:49,700
of this bad organization, isn't that what everything

2686
01:48:50,660 --> 01:48:51,500
that we're obsessed with?

2687
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:52,340
Yes.

2688
01:48:52,340 --> 01:48:53,660
Isn't that the same that's happening here?

2689
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:56,900
I know being opened up to a magical world of Jouadevive.

2690
01:48:58,780 --> 01:49:00,420
I didn't realize I was going to be opened up

2691
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:02,940
to a magical world of Jouadevive.

2692
01:49:02,940 --> 01:49:06,060
So I am, I have been taken on a journey in that way.

2693
01:49:06,060 --> 01:49:09,660
So yes, I mean, Joe himself, I like him a lot.

2694
01:49:09,660 --> 01:49:10,700
I do.

2695
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:14,500
I, his mission, you know, Joe wasn't born in,

2696
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:16,540
Joe wasn't born into the world of cigarettes.

2697
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:18,620
Joe just existed.

2698
01:49:18,620 --> 01:49:19,460
That's right.

2699
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:22,300
You have to examine Joe himself.

2700
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:23,900
The people that were pulling the strings on Joe,

2701
01:49:23,900 --> 01:49:24,740
that's a different story.

2702
01:49:24,740 --> 01:49:27,860
But Joe himself was just a cool, confident,

2703
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:32,500
smoking man camel who loved to play pool.

2704
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:33,900
He lived the leisure life.

2705
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:34,740
You know.

2706
01:49:34,740 --> 01:49:35,580
He lived the leisure life.

2707
01:49:35,580 --> 01:49:36,780
And here's the thing, he wasn't like a leisure suit

2708
01:49:36,780 --> 01:49:40,020
Larry character who was like really like out there

2709
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:42,340
probably being gross and saying inappropriate things

2710
01:49:42,340 --> 01:49:43,420
to women.

2711
01:49:43,420 --> 01:49:45,460
Joe was a classy guy.

2712
01:49:45,460 --> 01:49:46,300
That's right.

2713
01:49:46,300 --> 01:49:48,900
Joe was someone who wasn't like Duke,

2714
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:52,300
the 90s characters who we think of who were Duke Nukem

2715
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:55,540
characters who were, you know, they would be, you know,

2716
01:49:55,540 --> 01:49:58,220
put in jail now they would have been me too.

2717
01:49:58,220 --> 01:49:59,300
That's not necessarily Joe.

2718
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:00,140
I don't think it's Joe.

2719
01:50:00,140 --> 01:50:01,260
I don't get that vibe from Joe.

2720
01:50:01,260 --> 01:50:02,140
Just wanted a good time.

2721
01:50:02,140 --> 01:50:05,380
Hey, I put a, I tried having a lady camel

2722
01:50:05,380 --> 01:50:06,620
on my motorcycle once.

2723
01:50:06,620 --> 01:50:08,700
We tried two positions, didn't like it.

2724
01:50:08,700 --> 01:50:10,380
I drove off left and right dust,

2725
01:50:10,380 --> 01:50:12,740
but I gave her a chance and that's the Joe way.

2726
01:50:12,740 --> 01:50:16,540
I think there's also a chance Joe was either, you know,

2727
01:50:16,540 --> 01:50:18,580
bisexual, asexual.

2728
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:19,900
Maybe there's like, there's no,

2729
01:50:19,900 --> 01:50:21,620
when you're reading all of this,

2730
01:50:21,620 --> 01:50:24,500
there could be any number of scenarios for Joe

2731
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:26,900
as far as what his actual sexuality was.

2732
01:50:26,900 --> 01:50:28,900
And I'm not going to out him on this podcast.

2733
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:33,140
I don't know, but I think that there's a lot of different

2734
01:50:33,140 --> 01:50:35,180
things under the surface there that could make Joe

2735
01:50:35,180 --> 01:50:38,060
even more interesting or unique.

2736
01:50:38,060 --> 01:50:40,860
So yes, once we go through all of this,

2737
01:50:42,140 --> 01:50:44,620
I do have a lot of affection for Joe.

2738
01:50:44,620 --> 01:50:45,460
Yeah.

2739
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:48,260
And I'm more comfortable with him now than when we started.

2740
01:50:48,820 --> 01:50:50,980
So what's some of these episodes are about is tackling

2741
01:50:50,980 --> 01:50:53,260
something that made us feel uneasy as a kid.

2742
01:50:53,260 --> 01:50:55,740
We talk about it for a while and where do we land?

2743
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:57,060
Sure. I love where we land.

2744
01:50:57,060 --> 01:50:59,580
I think we've gone on a lot of adventures,

2745
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:03,140
the ultimate dick faced easy rider.

2746
01:51:03,140 --> 01:51:04,500
Oh man.

2747
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:07,340
Places where you could have the worst Caesar salad,

2748
01:51:07,340 --> 01:51:09,380
man has ever imagined.

2749
01:51:09,380 --> 01:51:11,380
And just like, we haven't even, I mean, we're wrapping up,

2750
01:51:11,380 --> 01:51:13,020
but we haven't even like touched,

2751
01:51:13,020 --> 01:51:15,180
like there's a Joe camel plush,

2752
01:51:15,180 --> 01:51:18,220
like the merchandise is out of control.

2753
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:19,060
Yeah.

2754
01:51:19,060 --> 01:51:20,220
Truly out of control.

2755
01:51:20,220 --> 01:51:22,380
And if I learned anything from looking at this book

2756
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:23,420
and leaving through this book,

2757
01:51:23,420 --> 01:51:24,980
if we were to buy it all on eBay,

2758
01:51:24,980 --> 01:51:26,860
oh, the smells we could smell.

2759
01:51:26,860 --> 01:51:27,700
Well, that's the problem.

2760
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:30,700
Cause there's some plush and Jason brought it up

2761
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:33,940
that there's plush you can get,

2762
01:51:33,940 --> 01:51:38,940
but the chances of that not smelling like awful smoke,

2763
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:40,580
there's two specifically here.

2764
01:51:40,580 --> 01:51:42,660
I don't know, Jason, this is the one you were talking about.

2765
01:51:42,660 --> 01:51:45,340
It has like big sunglasses and a leather jacket.

2766
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:47,380
This thing is horrifying looking.

2767
01:51:47,380 --> 01:51:48,460
It's real bad.

2768
01:51:48,460 --> 01:51:52,060
I found a camel, camel the game.

2769
01:51:52,060 --> 01:51:53,740
Yes, I found camel the game as well.

2770
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:56,380
A smooth deal for two to six players, 21 and older.

2771
01:51:56,380 --> 01:51:57,220
What do you mean?

2772
01:51:57,220 --> 01:51:58,060
What is it?

2773
01:51:58,060 --> 01:51:59,020
I think it's just playing.

2774
01:51:59,020 --> 01:52:00,820
I think it's just a deck of playing cards.

2775
01:52:00,820 --> 01:52:01,820
Oh, okay.

2776
01:52:01,820 --> 01:52:05,700
Here's a blues brothers Joe doll.

2777
01:52:05,700 --> 01:52:06,860
A blues brothers plush.

2778
01:52:06,860 --> 01:52:10,420
Blues brothers plush doll of Joe camel,

2779
01:52:10,420 --> 01:52:12,940
which is a hundred, this is expense 120.

2780
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:15,580
And I believe it's got someone's phone number written down

2781
01:52:15,580 --> 01:52:18,140
or it's like some sort of a product thing written

2782
01:52:18,140 --> 01:52:20,100
in Sharpie on his feet.

2783
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:23,980
Or maybe just maybe a lady eager to get with Joe

2784
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:25,420
right now where he could see it.

2785
01:52:25,420 --> 01:52:28,140
Yeah, he writes, yeah, he writes the ladies number down

2786
01:52:28,140 --> 01:52:31,180
on his foot on the bottom of his bare feet.

2787
01:52:32,420 --> 01:52:36,140
But we'll post some of this stuff, but it's just,

2788
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:39,460
it's overwhelming how much stuff there was

2789
01:52:39,460 --> 01:52:42,100
and they all, it probably all smells like dirty smoke.

2790
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:42,940
You know, there's other.

2791
01:52:42,940 --> 01:52:45,140
Don't bring us, by the way, don't bring us

2792
01:52:45,140 --> 01:52:47,500
like a live show any dirty smoke Joe camel stuff.

2793
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:48,340
Any stinky Joe camel stuff.

2794
01:52:48,340 --> 01:52:49,780
If it's newer and it doesn't smell like smoke,

2795
01:52:49,780 --> 01:52:52,020
okay, I may be interested, but the same.

2796
01:52:52,020 --> 01:52:55,660
And honestly, take that, sell that stuff on,

2797
01:52:55,660 --> 01:52:58,020
like those t-shirts probably cost a fortune

2798
01:52:58,020 --> 01:53:00,300
at vintage shops in LA.

2799
01:53:00,300 --> 01:53:03,140
There's a lot of really cheap groove blender shirts,

2800
01:53:03,140 --> 01:53:04,220
which those were peruse.

2801
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:05,580
We were a little interested in that.

2802
01:53:05,580 --> 01:53:07,740
A groove blender shirts, like I could maybe go for it.

2803
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:10,740
But you're talking about a massive body of work

2804
01:53:10,740 --> 01:53:14,940
and a lot of arts and a lot of great music

2805
01:53:14,940 --> 01:53:19,380
packed in by a pop culture icon that really only,

2806
01:53:19,380 --> 01:53:22,380
that where it all came and went within nine years.

2807
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:25,660
Remind you of anybody, maybe like the fab four.

2808
01:53:25,660 --> 01:53:26,500
The Beatles.

2809
01:53:28,020 --> 01:53:29,860
This is our Beatles.

2810
01:53:29,860 --> 01:53:32,180
The Beatles of cigarette mascots.

2811
01:53:33,180 --> 01:53:35,460
The Beatles of scrotum faces.

2812
01:53:35,460 --> 01:53:37,700
The Beatles were their own cigarette mascots though,

2813
01:53:37,700 --> 01:53:39,740
if you saw them ever.

2814
01:53:39,740 --> 01:53:42,460
I can't find it now, but I did see,

2815
01:53:42,460 --> 01:53:47,020
Kool did attempt to make Willie the penguin.

2816
01:53:47,020 --> 01:53:51,460
There was like an extreme roided out version of Willie.

2817
01:53:51,460 --> 01:53:52,300
Really?

2818
01:53:52,300 --> 01:53:54,740
For a short period of time in the 90s.

2819
01:53:54,740 --> 01:53:57,500
And they were like, we don't see any resemblance

2820
01:53:57,500 --> 01:53:58,340
to Joe cow.

2821
01:53:58,340 --> 01:53:59,660
I don't know what you're talking about.

2822
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:01,820
And I don't think it really lasted.

2823
01:54:01,820 --> 01:54:06,340
But that looked more like a kids fruit snack mascot.

2824
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:11,060
I'll say this real quick, just about the kids thing.

2825
01:54:11,060 --> 01:54:12,460
There are some ads though,

2826
01:54:12,460 --> 01:54:14,620
about the advertising to kids like this one,

2827
01:54:14,620 --> 01:54:17,500
where this is clearly three smoking camels

2828
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:19,540
offering cigarettes to a child.

2829
01:54:21,020 --> 01:54:23,420
Oh yes, because there's no child in the frame,

2830
01:54:23,420 --> 01:54:24,900
but they're all pointed down.

2831
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:28,220
It is like a POV, a point of view of like a child.

2832
01:54:28,220 --> 01:54:29,060
They're looking up.

2833
01:54:29,060 --> 01:54:30,460
Hang on.

2834
01:54:30,940 --> 01:54:33,620
Couldn't that be the point of view of somebody

2835
01:54:33,620 --> 01:54:36,220
who passed out on the floor at the Groove Funder?

2836
01:54:36,220 --> 01:54:37,060
Okay, that's possible.

2837
01:54:37,060 --> 01:54:39,540
They just, no, they just socked a guy

2838
01:54:39,540 --> 01:54:41,940
and he's like lying on the ground going, oh,

2839
01:54:41,940 --> 01:54:44,460
and they're like, here, smoke a camel,

2840
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:45,900
you pathetic piece of shit.

2841
01:54:45,900 --> 01:54:47,380
That's possible.

2842
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:48,500
I know you-

2843
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:50,460
Get this into your mouth before you,

2844
01:54:50,460 --> 01:54:52,020
we knock you down one more time.

2845
01:54:52,020 --> 01:54:53,300
I know you don't want to think bad,

2846
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:54,740
but there are a couple of those where you're like,

2847
01:54:54,740 --> 01:54:58,540
that is definitely Jim's camels offering it to a child.

2848
01:54:58,540 --> 01:54:59,860
No way, man.

2849
01:55:00,700 --> 01:55:02,220
A really little child.

2850
01:55:02,220 --> 01:55:04,420
The point of view is so low.

2851
01:55:04,420 --> 01:55:06,660
There's only one scenario.

2852
01:55:06,660 --> 01:55:08,540
What's lower than a little child?

2853
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:12,420
Somebody who's lying down on the world's biggest pillow.

2854
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:14,780
Who got a little too groovy in the blender.

2855
01:55:14,780 --> 01:55:15,620
That is true.

2856
01:55:15,620 --> 01:55:18,860
That was what really got them in trouble was like,

2857
01:55:18,860 --> 01:55:23,260
you know, smoking gun stuff would be like,

2858
01:55:23,260 --> 01:55:25,540
well, you know, we're going after younger markets,

2859
01:55:25,540 --> 01:55:27,780
you know, ages 14 to 24.

2860
01:55:27,780 --> 01:55:29,460
And it's like, hold on, hold on.

2861
01:55:30,420 --> 01:55:32,260
Four years too early.

2862
01:55:32,260 --> 01:55:34,500
Even eight to 18 would be legal.

2863
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:37,500
A lot of places, you'd be 21 now to buy cigarettes, I learned.

2864
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:40,460
Could you take the cigarettes?

2865
01:55:40,460 --> 01:55:44,500
I mean, would we like Joe Camel without the cigarette?

2866
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:45,340
Could you-

2867
01:55:45,340 --> 01:55:46,780
A thousand percent.

2868
01:55:46,780 --> 01:55:48,260
Yeah.

2869
01:55:48,260 --> 01:55:49,100
Absolutely.

2870
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:50,140
Hold on, hold on.

2871
01:55:50,140 --> 01:55:51,980
Let me think this through.

2872
01:55:51,980 --> 01:55:52,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

2873
01:55:52,940 --> 01:55:56,300
Okay, Camel comes back without the cigarette,

2874
01:55:56,340 --> 01:55:59,820
but with all the iconography of the old Joe Camel,

2875
01:55:59,820 --> 01:56:01,460
what are they now?

2876
01:56:01,460 --> 01:56:02,540
It's just a cool cat.

2877
01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:03,820
It's like Bojack Horseman,

2878
01:56:03,820 --> 01:56:06,180
but without any of the sad stuff.

2879
01:56:06,180 --> 01:56:07,580
It's just Joe Camel.

2880
01:56:07,580 --> 01:56:08,980
There's no conflict.

2881
01:56:08,980 --> 01:56:10,980
He just goes around doing cool stuff.

2882
01:56:10,980 --> 01:56:13,900
Just jumping in Jacuzzis, nailing it at golf,

2883
01:56:13,900 --> 01:56:16,500
holes in one all day, and then he leaves.

2884
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:17,340
Yeah.

2885
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:18,180
Yeah.

2886
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:22,220
So he could survive without cigarettes.

2887
01:56:22,220 --> 01:56:24,820
I don't, yeah, I think we've proven there's enough to him

2888
01:56:24,820 --> 01:56:28,540
to his friends to max and bust a,

2889
01:56:28,540 --> 01:56:30,860
that's the cigarettes is where it started,

2890
01:56:30,860 --> 01:56:32,220
but it isn't where it ended.

2891
01:56:32,220 --> 01:56:34,300
And he is, Jason was pointing out he's flexible.

2892
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:36,020
Here's an ad where he's like kind of dressed

2893
01:56:36,020 --> 01:56:38,300
like Tucker Carlson is on that fake show

2894
01:56:38,300 --> 01:56:40,260
that he does in like a log cabin

2895
01:56:40,260 --> 01:56:42,220
to pretend he's like a man of the people.

2896
01:56:42,220 --> 01:56:45,260
Again, Mike, you're watching the worst shit I've ever-

2897
01:56:45,260 --> 01:56:46,100
Jason, you know what I'm talking about?

2898
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:47,780
Well, yeah, cause he does this thing

2899
01:56:47,780 --> 01:56:49,860
where he goes fly fishing a few times a year

2900
01:56:49,860 --> 01:56:52,220
and someone always confronts him at the tackle shop.

2901
01:56:52,220 --> 01:56:53,060
No, I'm talking-

2902
01:56:53,060 --> 01:56:54,540
No, I know, but he has his own,

2903
01:56:55,380 --> 01:56:57,300
he has like his own like-

2904
01:56:57,300 --> 01:56:59,220
It looks like he's in Santa's workshop.

2905
01:56:59,220 --> 01:57:00,060
He's in Santa's workshop.

2906
01:57:00,060 --> 01:57:01,340
And he wears like a fucking flannel shirt

2907
01:57:01,340 --> 01:57:02,820
to pretend he's like a man of the people

2908
01:57:02,820 --> 01:57:05,340
and not some rich asshole who's lying

2909
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:06,180
to a bunch of old people.

2910
01:57:06,180 --> 01:57:07,020
What is he the heir to,

2911
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:07,860
Swanson TV dinners or something?

2912
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:08,700
Yeah, there was a story going around

2913
01:57:08,700 --> 01:57:09,740
where his mom didn't-

2914
01:57:09,740 --> 01:57:10,580
His mom left him a dollar.

2915
01:57:10,580 --> 01:57:12,940
His mom left him a dollar, she hated him.

2916
01:57:12,940 --> 01:57:14,420
Yeah.

2917
01:57:14,420 --> 01:57:17,060
So, so anybody, I'm saying Joe is kind of dressed like that,

2918
01:57:17,060 --> 01:57:20,660
like man of salt of the earth guy here.

2919
01:57:20,660 --> 01:57:23,420
So yeah, like you can see even just Joe

2920
01:57:23,420 --> 01:57:27,260
going out to the baseball game here with his camel friends

2921
01:57:27,260 --> 01:57:29,980
and like there's one camel wearing like funny,

2922
01:57:29,980 --> 01:57:34,980
like Dame Edna glasses in the top left there.

2923
01:57:36,020 --> 01:57:37,220
The answer is yes.

2924
01:57:37,220 --> 01:57:42,220
I think the way to bring a conflict free animated series

2925
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:45,340
about just a guy who kicks ass,

2926
01:57:46,620 --> 01:57:50,140
who happens to be a man camel with a scrotum face

2927
01:57:50,140 --> 01:57:52,980
is something I would like to make and I'm gonna do it.

2928
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:54,780
I called it, nobody else can do it

2929
01:57:54,780 --> 01:57:58,260
and happy to do it, not putting cigarettes in it.

2930
01:57:58,260 --> 01:58:01,460
It's about the character and you can pay me in camel bucks.

2931
01:58:01,460 --> 01:58:03,100
Is this TJ?

2932
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:03,940
That might be TJ.

2933
01:58:03,940 --> 01:58:05,300
She's in like one of the ads,

2934
01:58:05,300 --> 01:58:06,620
like kind of toward the right,

2935
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:08,420
but she's not being featured prominently.

2936
01:58:08,420 --> 01:58:11,460
They showed, yeah, you're background now.

2937
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:12,860
We're trying to feature Xtreo,

2938
01:58:12,860 --> 01:58:14,780
but back to background please.

2939
01:58:16,220 --> 01:58:19,300
Never Joe though, Joe's in the forefronts of our minds,

2940
01:58:19,340 --> 01:58:22,300
you survive the culture as you always has been

2941
01:58:22,300 --> 01:58:24,180
and always will be.

2942
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:25,940
You survive podcast the ride.

2950
01:58:44,900 --> 01:58:46,220
wandering around.

2951
01:58:46,220 --> 01:58:47,060
Sure.

2952
01:58:47,060 --> 01:58:49,500
Well, we don't know who's in that listener base.

2953
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:52,580
Some of them might be camel freaks of nature.

2954
01:58:52,580 --> 01:58:53,420
I hope they are.

2955
01:58:53,420 --> 01:58:54,660
I hope that's most of them.
